00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,083
[SHIZU] So that's
the Ship Country, is it?

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,958
[RIKU] It's more like a
man-made island if you ask me.

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,833
[RIKU]
Hmm, they've set up a market.

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,500
[SHIZU] Guess that's how
they make their living.

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,458
Trading as they
travel across the coast.

6
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,875
Hey, you know what?

7
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:33,916
I think we should travel
with them, if they'll have us.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,875
Does that sound good, Riku?

9
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,416
There's no need for
you to ask my permission.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm a dog.

[MALE LEADER A]
Traveler.

13
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,541
So glad you could join us.

14
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,125
We are the governing
body of this country,

15
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,958
known as the Tower Clan.

16
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,291
[MALE LEADER B]
How long will you be with us?

17
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,791
[SHIZU] Till you reach the
western continent, please.

18
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,083
[MALE LEADER B]
That should do nicely, I think.

19
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,250
We have a few more
stops on the coast,

20
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,875
so it'll be ten days
before we start west.

21
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,541
It's only a five-day
voyage after that.

[FEMALE LEADER A]
If you work for us,

23
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,750
we'll provide you
food and a room

24
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,291
with the same lovely
view that we have.

25
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,708
[SHIZU]
What kind of work?

26
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,166
[FEMALE LEADER A]
Overseeing the lower class.

27
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,541
[MALE LEADER A]
The people have been getting

28
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,375
rather bold as of late.

29
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,916
Making various demands
in the guise of petitions.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,958
Feel free to use
violence as you see fit.

31
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,333
[MALE LEADER A] Alternatively,
you could join them,

32
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,291
and spend your days
doing manual labor.

33
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,666
What's your preference?

34
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,166
I think...

35
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,833
...I'd rather take the lifestyle
and work of the commoners.

[LEADERS gasping, murmuring]

I simply believe
that will be the best fit

38
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,791
for a humble man such as myself.

Hmm.

It's an honor to have
a traveler among us.

It's very tasty, thank you.

45
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,083
I'm quite glad to hear that.

46
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,541
My face may not show it,
but I've lived a long life.

47
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,791
I'll be turning 55 soon.

And in all those years, you are
the kindest stranger I've met.

49
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,666
When we meet travelers
in this country,

50
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,083
typically, they wear
the garb of the tower clan,

51
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,333
and give us orders while
brandishing their weapons.

[MALE ELDER A] Allow me to
introduce you to your guide

This is Tifana.

Will I have this room to myself?

Great. Thank you, Ti.

58
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,041
[SHIZU]
See ya. Have a good night.

59
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,625
Hey, it's a decent
room, and quiet.

60
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,500
That their way
of telling us to sleep?

61
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,125
Guess we should obey.
Sleep soundly, Riku.

62
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,833
I intend to. You as well.

63
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:02,708
[SHIZU]
Hmph. Travel is exhausting.

64
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,041
Hopefully, we can settle down
in the next continent.

[SHIZU]
All right, then.

Now that we've had breakfast,
I guess it's time to work.

I doubt I can do
much skilled labor,

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,333
but I am fairly strong.

Do you have anything for me?

Or, if not, could you
show me around the place?

Where are you taking us?

Strange that they chose someone
who doesn't talk for our guide.

about the ship taking damage?

Many lives are at stake.
Why haven't you acted?

[MALE LEADER A] I have
no thoughts on this matter.

162
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,916
This country is
under our command.

Therefore, the land

Yes, this country
will someday sink.

was neglecting the country

What do you mean,
you get it now?

262
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,833
[HERMES] Well, I was talkin' to
a black robe in the warehouse,

263
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,916
and as a favor to
a fellow non-human,

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,250
he told me all about
who they really are,

265
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,416
and about that kid as well.

266
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,916
Once upon a time,
there was a ship called Tifana.

267
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,916
About 600 years ago,
it drifted right into

268
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,625
this old, deserted,
man-made island of a ship.

269
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,916
Now, Tifana's
only passengers were

270
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,583
a few hundred young children.

271
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:56,458
Apparently, the adults had all
been killed by a strange plague.

272
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:00,125
So those people were
descendants of those kids?

273
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,333
[HERMES]
Yeah.

274
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,125
The AI that had been
in control of Tifana,

275
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,041
those machines themselves
transferred to the ship country

276
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,750
and became the Tower Clan.

277
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,250
Because they knew
those kids needed

278
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,291
someone to guide them.

279
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,708
[HERMES]
Spoken like a former prince.

280
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,166
So they became the elite.

281
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,541
Organized everyone and
tried to keep 'em alive.

282
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,583
Why didn't they just
take the country to shore

283
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,875
and beach it?

284
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,125
[HERMES] Well, they
considered it a few times.

285
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,375
But neither they,
nor the people,

286
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,208
knew how to live on land.

287
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,750
Plus, as machines,
they couldn't protect

288
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,083
the people from other countries.

289
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,416
[SHIZU] Then when
he said I'd be next,

290
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,583
did he hope I'd do
what they couldn't?

291
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,333
And what about Ti?

292
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:45,500
[HERMES] She isn't actually a
part of the original population.

293
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,458
A traveling couple gave
birth while visiting,

294
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,916
and then... abandoned her.

295
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,083
[SHIZU gasps]

296
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,500
[HERMES] The black robes
gave her the name

297
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:58,375
of their drifting ship,
and raised her with care.

298
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,208
But since she wasn't related

299
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,666
to any of the country's
human citizens...

300
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,458
...the people rejected her.

301

[SHIZU]
Ti...

303
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,625

But even without knowing that,

305
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,083
what I said to you was cruel.

00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,583
[TIFANA]
I...

312
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,000
I could do that...

313

No need to thank me.

But... you are welcome...

'cause we'll never
see that country again.

[SHIZU]
From now on.

00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,958
You and I are...

319
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:37,333
[SHIZU rasps]

320
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,541
[TIFANA]
No... No...

321
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,458
[TIFANA]
You can't leave. Not like this.

322
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,458
Not... without me...

323
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,750
[HERMES] She's planning
to kill herself and him.

324
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't do it!

325
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:49,875
[SHIZU]
Kino.

326
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,083
Ah.

327
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,625
Thank you for everything.

328
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,166
[KINO]
What?

329
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,375
I just... realized I hadn't
had a chance to thank you yet.

330
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,375
So there it is.

331
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,166
It was no trouble.

332
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,291
[HERMES]
"All's well that tends well."

333
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,500
--"Ends."
--[HERMES] Ends well.

334
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,625
Well, uh...

335
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,041
Hope we meet again.

336
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,291
Yeah, same here.

337
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,625
As long as me and
Hermes keep travelling,

338
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,875
I'm bound to find where
you eventually settle.

339
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,416
Really just a matter of time.

340
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,208
When that time comes...

341
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,916
...I'll be happy to welcome you.

342
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,958
[HERMES]
By the way, Kino.

343
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,166
[KINO]
Hmm?

344
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,500
[HERMES] If we were
to see that man again,

345
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,500
I feel like...

346
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,458
Yeah, I agree with you.

347
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,375
If it did happen...
the shock might kill him.

348
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,958
[KINO]
"Country of Liars."
