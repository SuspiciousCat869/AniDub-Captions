with fate... as her.

420
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,458
First orphaned,
then sold as a slave.

421
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:32,333
She failed to die, started
traveling, and struck it rich.

And now, she works
as a photographer.

423
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,458
She's so painfully honest,
that when we first got

424
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,250
to this country,
she came clean

425

with every last
detail of her story.

426

But to her incredible fortune,

427
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,916
the people here accepted
her as an immigrant.

428
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,250
[SOU] Pretty soon after that,
she took up photography.

429

her "Photo" now.

with the poisonous herbs,

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,708
she said to that man:

434
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,291
"Everyone is
tested at some point.

435
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:15,583
I believe this is my test."

436
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,666
I don't know how
she feels about that now.

438
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:21,791
