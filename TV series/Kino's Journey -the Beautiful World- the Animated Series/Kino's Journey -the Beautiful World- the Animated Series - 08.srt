1
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,125
Crazy kid.

2
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,416
I'm just about healed.

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,958
Let's get ready to move.

4
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,083
The faster we're
outta here, the better.

5
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,791
[RIKU]
And Ti? We only have two seats

6
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,666
Sorry, but you'll have to share.

7
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,583
There it is.

8
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,625
[SHIZU] Sure hope this country's
advanced enough to have takeout.

9
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,375
So hey, Ti.

10
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,083
There's something
I want you to know.

11
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,000
It's the reason
why we're traveling.

12
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,416
This journey's about
more than sightseeing.

13
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,666
Do you get that?

14
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,416
We're not traveling for
pleasure so much as.

15
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,541
Seeking a home.

16
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,625
A peaceful, quiet place
to settle down in.

17
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:07,125
Now if I can be of use
to others, then great.

18
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,333
I'll do what I can
for whoever we run into.

19
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,791
But our goal here

20
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,291
is to find out which of
these countries fits us.

21
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,416
Barely seen this one,
but it's peaceful.

22
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,041
Or it seems to be
that way so far.

23
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,166
Plus, their pizza's delicious.

24
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,291
Today, we didn't get
much done besides shopping.

25
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,833
Starting tomorrow,
we'll examine this country.

26
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,916
I don't want to be picky, but
let's not be careless either.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,541
Let me know if you see something
that sticks out to you.

28
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,583
That said we're guests here.

29
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,791
So you need to do your best
to keep an open mind.

30
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,458
And make sure you're
polite to everyone.

31
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,458
We don't want to offend anybody.

32
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,333
And no matter how
unkind someone else might be.

33
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,333
I can't have you hurting them.

34
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,166
Do you understand?

35
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,875
[TIFANA]
Hm. [gulps]

36
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,125
[SHIZU]
Excuse me, sir.

37
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,875
[MALE FARMER A]
Huh? What can I do for ya?

38
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,250
[SHIZU] I was wondering
if this was the road

39
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,791
that leads into the city.

40
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,000
[MALE FARMER A] It sure is.
I'm guessin' you're a traveler?

41
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,125
[SHIZU]
That's right.

42
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,750
We just rode
into town yesterday.

43
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,958
[FEMALE ELDER A]
Tomato? It's fresh off the vine.

44
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,666
[RIKU]
Thank you very much, ma'am.

45
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,458
[RIKU]
So, how'd it go?

46
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,458
This country almost seems like
it's too good to be true.

47
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:49,833
The crime rate is low.
It's a representative democracy.

48
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,916
And the economy seems
like it's prospering.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,583
That's excellent news.

50
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,458
[SHIZU] What's more, they're
now accepting immigrants.

51
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,750
All we have to do is find work,
n' pay our taxes.

52
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,541
Rare for them
to make it that easy.

53
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,791
It really is.

54
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,125
Most countries
limit immigration.

55
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,916
It's thought to
cause some trouble,

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,333
like with the public order
and rates of employment.

57
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:33,375
[SHIZU] So listen-- This
is only my first impression,

58
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,125
but this place seems normal.

59
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,916
"Normal" is high
praise coming from me.

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,208
It takes a lot of work to keep
a country running normally.

61
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,833
And a lot less to screw it up.

62
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,333
So, you like it here?

63
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,625
[SHIZU] Mm-hmm. I think we
should give this place a shot.

64
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:56,500
See if it suits us. Let's leave
the hotel early tomorrow.

65
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,041
We can check out another town.

66
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,750
[BOY A gasps, laughs]
Look, Mama!

67
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,208
--[MOM A] What is it?
--[BOY A] Dunno, but it's cute!

68
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,708
[MOM A]
That's called a dog.

69
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,541
[RIKU]
Shizu!

70
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,333
--[CITIZENS screaming]
--Oh, my God, call the police!

71
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,000
Somebody, help! Please!

72
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,333
What happened to you?!

73
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,416
Or should I say.
What have you done?

74
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,416
Shut your mouth.
Do you wanna die, too?

75
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,125
Yes, that's it.
I think you must.

76
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,833
You all... must want to die.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,833
[grunts]

78
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,750
[MALE OFFICER A] The suspect
was an employee at the academy.

79
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,833
He was one of
the school teachers.

80
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,083
We think it was
one of his students.

81
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,250
[MALE OFFICER B]
Right.

82
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,250
We're en route to
the academy to confirm.

83
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,166
[MALE OFFICER B whimpers]

84
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,291
[TIFANA]
All of them are dead.

85
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,125
Your actions today

86
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,333
were nothing short of
heroic, traveler.

87
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,583
If you hadn't stopped that man,
I shudder to think

88
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,750
just how much worse things
could've gone.

89
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,958
[MALE OFFICER C]
Hmm.

90
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,875
These incidents aren't common,

91
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,041
but they do occur once
every couple of years.

92
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:47,250
It's tragic, but it happens.
People just go crazy sometimes.

93
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,291
[gasps]
I disagree.

94
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,083
The damn radio waves
are causing all this chaos.

95
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,291
[gasps]

96
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,583
[RIKU]
Hmm?

97
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,250
[MALE CHIEF A] That man'll
be sent to a hospital,

98
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,166
where he'll undergo
supervised treatment.

99
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,166
The man's a mass murderer.

100
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,333
Don't you plan to make him
go to a trial at least?

101
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,541
[MALE CHIEF A]
The thing is,

102
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,333
this country has
a rather tragic history.

103
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,500
[MALE CHIEF A]
When it first formed,

104
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,583
the vast majority
of its population

105
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,083
was comprised
entirely of slaves.

106
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,958
To control these slaves,
the elites put small machines

107
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,708
into their heads.
We have records of this.

108
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,291
[SHIZU]
Small machines.

109
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,666
[MALE OFFICER C] The elites
would send out orders

110
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,125
via radio transmission
to the devices,

111
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,208
and then all the people
would be forced

112
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,416
to comply with their commands.

113
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,875
[MALE OFFICER C] This made
rebellion all but impossible.

114
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,333
But one day, for reasons
that we still don't

115
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,166
completely comprehend,
the orders stopped coming

116
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,791
and the slaves were freed.
It's been centuries since then.

117
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,041
[SHIZU] And this relates
to the incident how?

118
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,583
[MALE CHIEF A]
The masters are gone,

119
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:59,041
but the radio outpost they once
used to control us remains.

120
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,458
It sends out bad
signals at random.

121
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,875
Every now and then,
some poor soul receives one.

122
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,708
[MALE CHIEF A] These people are
not in control of their actions.

123
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,000
That professor is just
as much a victim here

124
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,750
as the people he killed.

125
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,375
[MALE OFFICER C] The exact
same thing could've happened

126
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,041
to any one of us.

127
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,166
So we must be merciful
and not treat him

128
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,083
like some comman criminal.

129
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,958
[SHIZU]
But it's been centuries.

130
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,291
Were these machines
passed down somehow?

131
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,875
How would you even inherit
something like that?

132
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,208
[MALE OFFICER C]
You talk pretty smart.

133
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,750
What are you an engineer,
or a doctor?

134
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,583
You build machines?
Study physics maybe?

135
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,125
[SHIZU]
No, I'm not an expert.

136
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,625
[MALE CHIEF A]
I see.

137
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,666
Well, perhaps you should stick
with subjects you do know.

138
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,666
Those machines are
not an abstract theory,

139
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,875
they're a fact of our history

140
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,916
[SHIZU] Well then,
why doesn't someone destroy

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,916
the radio outpost? It's not
like its being guarded, right?

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,583
[MALE OFFICER C]
It doesn't have to be.

143
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,833
The closer someone
gets to the tower,

144
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,666
the more clearly they
receive the signal.

145
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,583
It's enough to drive
a person crazy.

146
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,833
That's true for any
citizen of this country,

147
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,208
so there's nothing for it but
to permanently seal off

148
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,500
the forbidden region and make
sure that no one wanders in.

149
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,625
I understand.

150
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,916
Then please,

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,958
allow me to take
care of this for you.

152
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,250
I must ask.

153
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,791
Yes, what is it?

154
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,541
[RIKU] Why'd you end up
offering to destroy

155
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,875
this outpost for them?

156
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,208
You don't think their
story is true, do you?

Well.

158
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,333
The original premise seems like
it's somewhat plausible.

00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,458
But after this many
generations have passed,

160
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,833
I doubt it's hurting much, but
it is possible that the outpost

161
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,833
is still running on a generator.

162
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,708
[SHIZU] So if we
destroy it completely,

163

164
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,958
we can hopefully put some of
these people's minds at ease.

[RIKU] And I suspect we'll be
commended for doing so.

That status boost could
be to our advantage.

00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,750
Huh?

316
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,125
[RIKU]
No, it's nothing that serious,

317
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,958
but it'll taste better if you
put it on the croissant.

318
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,375
That's all.

319
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,125
'Kay.

320
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,458
[sighs]

321
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,583
[TIFANA]
Gonna take a walk.

322
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:28,041
[RIKU] All right, but let's
leave those behind, kay?

323
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,375
[TIFANA]
Hmm...

324
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,916
[RIKU] All right then, Ti,
where are we going?

325
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,875
[TIFANA]
I did it.

326
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,333
[RIKU]
What is it you've done?

327
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,541
[RIKU]
Uh, wait a moment.

328
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,833
Did you come all the way out
here to step on your own shadow?

329
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,583
[TIFANA]
Black shadow.

330
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,666
Shadow black.

331
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,875
[RIKU]
That is a basic fact, yes.

332
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,416
[TIFANA]
Gone now though.

333
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,541
[RIKU]
I'm not sure I follow.

334
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,291
[TIFANA]
But I'm perfectly fine.

335
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,375
[RIKU]
I'm glad to hear that.

336
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,375
[TIFANA]
Yes. I think I'm glad, too.

337
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,291
[TIFANA]
You wanna go back?

338
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,333
[RIKU]
Hmm?

339
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,000
[RIKU]
Thank you very much, Ti.

340
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,291
[TIFANA]
Hmm.

341
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,375
[TIFANA snores softly]

342
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,541
[RIKU]
She was...

343
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,666
...much more talkative
than usual today.

344
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,500
Although she was mostly
incomprehensible.

345
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,625
To me, at least.

346
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:38,125
[SHIZU]
Yeah? Interesting.

347
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,750
[SHIZU]
I didn't realize.

348
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,041
You two had never spent
a day by yourselves before.

349
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,500
[RIKU]
True.

350
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,083
[SHIZU]
I'm just guessing.

351
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:50,166
But maybe that made her think
she had to be on top of things.

352
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,791
You know.
Ti's a surprisingly clever kid.

353
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,625
She might think about
a lot more than we know.

354
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,500
[RIKU]
Perhaps that's so.

355
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,666
[SHIZU]
For example.

356
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,833
Maybe the reason she was
stepping on her own shadow,

357
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,666
was because of the black figures
from her home country.

358
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,666
To confirm that they
really are gone.

359
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,250
[SHIZU] They raised her,
but definitely not with love.

360
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,250
[SHIZU] And she wants to
stay strong in spite of that.

361
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,250
[RIKU]
Huh.

362
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,833
[SHIZU] She gave you
some of her croissant.

363
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,083
I know she could've finished it,

364
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:27,125
but she left a
little bit behind.

365
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,125
To make sure
her friends got some.

366
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:36,625
[RIKU]
So we're her friends now.

367
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,333
Listen, Shizu.

368
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,541
[SHIZU]
What's goin' on?

369
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,666
Somethin' wrong?

370
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,708
[RIKU] When we were
in that last country.

371
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,583
Had the need arisen, I would
have prioritized your life,

372
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,208
even if it meant killing her.

373
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,250
I hope you could
forgive me for that.

374
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,791
[SHIZU]
Don't worry, Riku.

375
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,125
We all made it out.

376
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,333
No need to fret about
what might've been.

377
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:01,375
[SHIZU] Look, these things take
time, but you did get closer.

378
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,916
Believe it or not,
you already seem

379
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,208
more comfortable around her.

380
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,541
[RIKU]
Hm.

381
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,583
[SHIZU]
Well then. Are we ready?

382
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,625
[TIFANA]
Mm-hmm.

383
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,875
[RIKU]
Let's go.

384
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,458
[TIFANA]
Yeah, we can go now.

385
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:27,333
We'll go together.
Riku is a friend.

386
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,541
[RIKU gasps]

387
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,916
[KINO]
"Various Countries."
