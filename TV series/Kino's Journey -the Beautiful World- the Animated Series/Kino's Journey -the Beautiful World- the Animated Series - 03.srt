1
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,875
Ugh. Good grief.

2
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,541
[HERMES]
So... what do we do?

3
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,666
[KINO]
That's a good question.

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,791
For now?

5
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,125
[HERMES]
Yeah? Go on.

6
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,791
[KINO] Just till I come up
with a better idea...

7
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,583
[HERMES]
You'll do what?

8
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,166
[KINO sighs]
I'm goin' to sleep.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,375
[HERMES]
What?

10
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,791
[KINO] Wake me up
if something happens.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,250
[HERMES] You're kidding.
I thought you had some plan.

12
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:52,166
[KINO snores softly]

13
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,250
[HERMES]
Kino.

14
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,125
[grunts]
What's up?

15
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,458
[HERMES]
The ground started shaking.

16
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,291
You don't say.

17
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,000
[KINO]
Is it an earthquake?

18
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,375
[HERMES]
Doubt it.

19
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,500
The shaking's light,
but getting steadily stronger.

20
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,666
So then...

21
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:20,791
[HERMES]
It's simple.

22
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,250
Something's slowly
coming our way.

23
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,083
[KINO]
You think? What's that big?

24
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,833
[HERMES]
Look there!

25
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:31,875
[rumbling]

26
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,333
[birds squawking]

27
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,375
[KINO gasps]

28
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:45,083
Well. That answers that.

29
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,875
[HERMES] It's big enough
to be a country.

30
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,250
[KINO] Amazing. I've never
seen anything like this.

31
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,166
[HERMES] Neither have I.
So, what now?

32
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,416
You gonna stick out
your thumb or...?

33
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, maybe I will.

34
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,875
Might as well see
what happens, right?

35
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,666
[HERMES] Aren't you a little
worried they'll just shoot'cha?

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,958
[KINO]
Well, yeah.

37
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,166
It's a gamble... but they
haven't shot us yet.

38
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,916
And I can't think of
a better idea, so...

39
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,500
[INTERCOM VOICE]
Greetings traveler.

40
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,208
Are you seeking entry
into our country?

41
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,166
I am!

42
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,250
[INTERCOM VOICE]
Wait just a moment, please.

43
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,125
[gasps]

44
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,833
[MALE OFFICER A]
Good afternoon, traveler.

45
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,291
I serve as the head
immigration officer here.

46
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,333
I'm also the guide,
the sole policeman, diplomat,

47
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,125
and a few other things.

48
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,166
Our country's unique
in a few ways.

49
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,500
Officials take on
a variety of duties here.

50
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,750
It's nice to meet you.

51
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:59,375
So, uh, this place is
a country? A real one?

52
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,625
Like, with citizens
and everything?

53
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,291
[MALE OFFICER A] Of course
it is! Albeit a smaller one.

54
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,500
[KINO]
Where is it heading right now?

55
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,000
We're making for the
plains past this valley.

56
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,625
[MALE OFFICER A]
So, what brings you here?

57
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:15,250
Just looking to sightsee?
Or are you a hopeful immigrant?

58
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,250
Uh. Sightseeing
and recreation is all.

59
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,000
Travelers are always
welcome in this country.

60
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,250
How long do you anticipate
your visit with us to last?

61
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,250
[KINO]
Hmm...

62
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,541
[HERMES]
Hmph.

63
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,375
About five to ten days,
if that's all right with you.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,125
Long as we're here,

65
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,916
would you like to see
how the place works?

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,541
I'd appreciate that.

67
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,333
My apologies, Hermes.

68
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,333
We're not use to
motorrads visiting.

69
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,666
Hope you're not uncomfortable.

70
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,333
[HERMES]
No worries, I'm fine.

71
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,416
[MALE OFFICER A]
This is our main reactor.

72
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,333
It creates a vast
amount of steam,

73
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,500
which is then piped
to various generators.

74
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,291
Some electricity goes
to the general populace.

75
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,791
But most is used
to keep us moving.

76
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,250
The process is automated,
we just oversee it.

77
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,000
The difficult part
is maintaining

78
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,000
and sometimes replacing
the drive motors

79
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,000
and caterpillar tracks.

80
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,041
This is our
residential district.

81
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,500
We've prepared a room for you.
I'll take you there now.

82
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,666
[HERMES] So is this country
always moving, then?

83
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,958
Do you settle down
when you find good land?

84
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,458
There are two reasons why our
country is always on the move.

85
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,250
First off, there's the
size of our reactor.

86
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,875
It produces a vast
amount of heat and energy.

87
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:38,083
Far more than we could expect
our populace to easily consume.

88
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,000
We keep the treads
moving to expend

89
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,250
that energy, and prevent
the country from overheating.

90
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,708
That makes sense.

91
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,875
--[HERMES] I guess.
--[horn honks]

92
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,000
[KINO]
Huh...?

93
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,416
[MALE OFFICER A]
The other reason...

94
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,000
...is one I expect
you'll relate to.

95
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,708
We like this nomadic life.

96
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,666
We enjoy watching beautiful
landscapes come and go.

97
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,666
Why would we stop in one place?

98
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,750
We can see the world
and bring our home with us.

99
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,875
I do relate. Quite a bit.

100
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,833
[KINO]
Gotta say.

101
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:27,416
I've never seen a country with
this much hot water to spare.

102
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,333
[HERMES]
They recycle that water.

103
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,166
You'll probably be drinking
it at lunch tomorrow.

104
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,333
[KINO] I've had to drink
muddy river water filtered

105
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,583
through rags before,
so why would I get

106
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,041
squeamish about that?

107
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,583
[HERMES]
Good point. Say...

108
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,375
Where'd ya get those pajamas?

109
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,416
[KINO] The sign said
they were for guests.

110
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,041
[HERMES]
Oh.

111
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,166
[KINO]
Mm?

112
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,416
[HERMES] Are we going
over rocks or something?

113
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,750
[HERMES] Huh. I guess
it... ground them down.

114
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,500
[KINO] To think that something
this big can move.

115
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,041
It's amazing.

116
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,583
[sighs]

117
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,958
[HERMES]
Ya think this'll work?

118
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,416
No idea.

119
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,750
Guess we'll find out
in five days.

120
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,541
For now? We sleep.

121
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,541
[HERMES]
Oh, Kino--

122
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,208
We can talk tomorrow, 'kay?

123
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,500
I'm tired. Good night.

124
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,083
Oh, uh. Lights out, please.

125
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,416
[KINO]
A bed with clean sheets.

126
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,041
This is too nice.

127
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,208
[KINO sighs]

128
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,250
[HERMES]
'Morning, Kino.

129
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,916
[KINO]
You woke up before me?

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,083
That's weird.

131
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,083
[HERMES] So, what I was
gonna tell you last night...

132
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,583
[KINO]
Wh--?!

133
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,958
[HERMES] ...is if ya go to
sleep with your hair wet,

134
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,208
it'll get kinda crazy.

135
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,541
[MALE OFFICER A]
This is the highest level.

136
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,416
Which makes it the only part
of the country where

137
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,958
you can take in direct sunlight.

138
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,791
[KINO]
Hmm. I see.

139
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,708
[HERMES] Hope no one who
lives here is afraid of heights.

140
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,833
[KINO gasps]

141
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,583
[KINO]
A bird?

142
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,291
No, it isn't.

143
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,000
[HERMES]
Looks like a machine.

144
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,791
That's one of our
country's cameras.

145
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,291
We like to keep a video feed of
our surroundings on display.

146
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,416
Wow.

147
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,416
[MALE OFFICER A]
Hmm?

148
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,833
[HERMES]
Goodness.

149
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,000
[MALE OFFICER A] That's the
price of this lifestyle.

150
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,625
It pains us to leave such a
huge blemish on mother nature,

151
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:47,750
and I'm sure it's a bother to
others, but it can't be helped.

152
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,500
All who travel leave
their mark behind.

153
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,333
[MALE OFFICER A] We've made
peace with that inevitability,

154
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,083
and we pray that someday,
healthy greenery will grow anew

155
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,583
on all of the lands
we've traversed.

156
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,375
What's that?

157
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,333
[MALE OFFICER A]
Oh, those are cranes.

158
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,416
We use them when
we paint the murals.

159
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,208
Our oldest grade
schoolers paint them

160
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,375
to commemorate their graduation.

161

if we watched for a bit?

No, go right ahead.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,375
[FEMALE TEACHER A] The students
have many discussions

164
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,416
in which they choose
one special sight from

165
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,458
their school years to
capture in a mural.

Hey, traveler!

The traveler will be
watching us, so focus!

Let's do our best
to make this a fine mural!

Yes! 'Kay!

Hmm. I can't really tell

from up here.

177

Here's the camera's view.

178
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,500
This scene is from a land
that we passed through

179
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:01,166
more than 1,200 days ago.
It was a truly beautiful place.

180
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,291
I don't suppose you plan
to leave the mural up forever.

181
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,083
No, but we'll take a picture,

182
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,291
and give it a
protective coating.

183
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,416
After that, it'll
decorate the wall

184
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,875
until the next group
of students graduates.

185
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,041
That'll be in 500 days.

Good afternoon. I am
this country's diplomat.

We would like to open

Tell us who you are

and we may yet
avoid hostilities.

[MALE OFFICER A] Ours is
a nation constantly moving.

We ask you to help us pass

Forgive me,

but your country's

220
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,250
completely across these plains.

221
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:14,250
There's simply no way for our
country to go around yours.

Yes. Our walls stretch far.

We fought long and hard
to expand our borders.

Now, I'm warning you--
Draw no closer,

hear that. Carry on.

We demand full and complete
restitution! Damn it!

318
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,958
You've infringed on our rights
as a sovereign nation!

319
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,041
Halt, so we can
discuss terms of peace!

320
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,375
[MALE OFFICER A]
I'm afraid we can't do that.

321
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,333
Have a nice day though!

322
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,500
[KINO] With this much power, you
could extort, raid, or conquer

323
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,291
other countries pretty easily
if you wanted to.

324
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,500
Well, yes, I suppose
you're right,

325
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,208
but I really don't feel like
we have any reason to.

326
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,625
This country's doing
just fine as things are,

327
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,958
so why would we risk turning the
rest of the world against us?

328
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,083
Incidents like
yesterday's are tough.

329
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,333
We try to avoid them.

330
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,833
[HERMES] And yet,
you keep on travelling.

331
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,916
[MALE OFFICER A sighs]

332
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,208
Yes.

333
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,000
Every country,
just like every man,

334
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,708
causes some degree of bother
to others merely by existing.

335
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,333
Yet we all must carry on.

336
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:59,458
[STUDENTS cheering]

337
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,875
[MALE STUDENT A]
Thanks a million!

338
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,625
[FEMALE STUDENT C]
Come back soon, okay?

339
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,416
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
Take care!

340
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,583
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Bye-bye!

341
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,125
[HERMES]
I'd say that went pretty well.

342
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,750
[KINO]
Yeah.

343
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,333
[HERMES]
That country was interesting.

344
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,250
And bothersome, too.

345
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,625
[KINO]
Which one?

346
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,375
[HERMES]
Uh. Both, actually.

347
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,708
I thought as much.

348
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,333
[HERMES] I mean,
the country that got bulldozed

349
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,875
only walled off those
plains so they could extort

350
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,708
whoever needed to get through.

351
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,000
They kinda deserved
what they got.

352
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,625
Yeah, it was just too high.

353
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,250
[HERMES]
The border wall? Or their toll?

354
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,333
Actually, I guess both.

355
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,958
If they'd asked me
for something other

356
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,208
than the Woodsman,

357
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,625
maybe offered to let me
work to pass through,

358
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,666
I probably would've
gone with it.

359
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,958
[KINO] Anyway, I wonder where
that country'll end up next.

360
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,250
[HERMES]
Who knows?

361
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,791
I'll tell ya one thing
for sure though.

362
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,958
What's that?

363
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,500
[HERMES] A few hundred
days from now?

364
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,666
They'll have a mural of you
and your rifle on their wall.

365
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,250
That's, uh,
weird to think about.

366
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,666
Kinda embarrassing.

367
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,833
[HERMES]
Does it bother you?

368
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,375
[KINO]
I mean...

369
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,708
No, I guess it's fine.

370
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,833
[KINO]
"Ship Country."
