00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,791
[KINO]
To be honest with you.

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,958
The country we're
heading to next is--

3
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:22,083
Well, it has a bad
reputation with travelers.

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,083
[HERMES]
How so?

5
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,458
[KINO]
I've heard a few things.

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,875
Like "they're cold
towards outsiders."

7
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,500
Or they're "disagreeable"
and "rude."

8
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,916
"When travelers come,
they close their shops,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,208
or claim to be sold out
when they're not".

10
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,916
"They'll only give you food
that's gone half bad.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,500
And be careful that they
don't overcharge you.

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,958
No one who'd been
there wanted to go back.

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,458
One guy said he
hoped it would burn.

14
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,625
[HERMES] Doesn't this
seem like the kind of country

15
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,500
we could skip?

16
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,958
Nah, I'm too curious.

17
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,583
I wanna know what kind
of country would make

18
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,875
people say all that.

19

[HERMES]
Has some beautiful scenery.

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,833
[KINO] Yeah. Too bad
it doesn't tell us

21
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,208
what the people who
live there'll be like.

22
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,666
[HERMES]
True. Let's go, then.

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,333
And may this country leave us
with such strong memories

24
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,541
that we never forget it.

25
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,666
Fingers crossed.

[MALE CAPTAIN A] How many days
are you planning to stay here?

27
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,375
Just three.

00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,500
So I'd leave the day after
tomorrow, in the early evening.

Most excellent.

We're honored to

Open the gate!

You don't need to
inspect my belongings?

37
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,333
Or ask me any more questions?

00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,875
'Course not.

00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,916
Why would we search someone when
they've committed no crimes?

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,208
That would just be rude.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,708
[HERMES] So did we take
a wrong turn, or what?

No. This is the place, I'm sure.

This has to be
a different country.

I expected. For sure.

Thank you very much.

Gotta admit, I didn't
anticipate such a grand welcome.

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,541
So I'm not sure what to say.

But, uh, if I could
ask something.

Could someone point me

to a hotel that's
not too expensive?

58

Preferably one with a shower?

00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,291
[HERMES] It would be nice
if it had enough space

to park a motorrad in.

[MAN B] There's a
cheap inn near my place.

They serve pretty
good food there, too.

If good food's
what they're after,

Say, honey.

What was the name of that
inn we stayed at last spring?

just around the corner.

I like your name.

It's unique, but it still
has a nice ring to it.

Plus, it's short.

Thank you.

same way about it.

"Used to." Did that change?

That's why I kept it.

for one week every spring.

I like it, but all my
friends tease me about it.

00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,375
They call me Ok-u-ra,
or Sock-wear-uh.

Is the first-floor room
with the wide door still open?

If needed, I'll change
out some parts.

I have a proposal, everyone.

160
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,291
It hasn't been
long since we started.

161
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,000
So why don't we just start
this show from the top?

162
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,208
Wait. You don't have to--

163
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,416
Great idea!

164
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,750
--That works for me!
--[MAN K] Sure! Why not?

165
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,666
[BOY B]
Start it over!

166
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,166
--[KINO gasps]
--[BOY C] From the top!

167
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,416
Thank you all very much.

168
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,208
[NARRATOR A]
All right. That settles it.

169
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,541
Long, long ago.

170
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:35,958
A downtrodden clan was driven
by force from a distant country.

171
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,000
No country is kind
enough to take us in!

172
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,791
And we ran out
of food a few days ago!

173
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,416
If nothing changes,
our children will perish!

174
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,791
[NARRATOR A]
They continued their long,

175
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,333
aimless journey. Until one day,

176
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,416
they found themselves
deep in a forest,

177
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
the likes of which
they'd never seen.

178
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,208
[MALE ACTOR C]
Hmm? [chuckles]

179
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,666
[CHILD ACTOR gasps]
I'm scared, mommy!

180
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,833
Let's get out of here!

181
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,791
You have to be brave for me.

182
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,000
No...

183
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,208
We have no food left
to give to the children.

184
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,166
[gasps] Wait.

185
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,375
There's fruit falling
from the trees!

186
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,791
Whoa, you're right.

187
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,958
And there are animals here, too!

188
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,458
[NARRATOR A]
The forest may have seemed

189
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,625
frightening at first,
but its bounty was rich.

190
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,000
And it saved the lives
of the starving exiles.

191
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,666
What a wonderful
forest we've found!

192
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,333
Here's a place where
no one will persecute us!

193
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,041
[MALE ACTOR B] No one to throw
stones at us, or chase us away?

194
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,125
[ACTOR A]
Mm-hmm!

195
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,125
[CHILD ACTOR A]
Let's stay forever!

196
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,500
[ACTOR A]
Yes!

197
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,250
Let's build a
new country right here!

198
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,000
[SAKURA] After deciding
to make this forest

199
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,791
their permanent home,

200
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,458
the people built a beautiful,
prosperous country.

201
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:50,333
Countless time has passed
since those trying days.

202
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:55,125
[applause]

203
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:59,416
[SAKURA] And now, thanks
to the resolve of my forbears,

204
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I get to live here.
And carry their legacy.

205
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,625
Nice work.
You're a really good cook, Kino.

206
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,250
You sure know how to grill.

207
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,458
It looks delicious.

208
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,416
[HERMES]
Just grill it, okay, Kino?

209
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,875
No seasoning.

210
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,291
I know, I know.

211
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,875
[FEMALE ACTOR B]
Here, put this on.

212
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,000
We wouldn't want you to get
your clothes all greasy,

213
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,000
now, would we?

214
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,583
[KINO chuckles]
I appreciate it.

215
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,541
It looks good on you, Kino.
Very cute!

216
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,416
[HERMES]
Someone's having fun.

217
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,750
[KINO]
Hey, Hermes. You up?

218
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,666
Once I finish breakfast,
let's go shopping.

219
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,000
All right? And after that,
we can go pick up Cannon.

220
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,125
I'm honestly shocked.

221
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,916
It feels better than when I
picked it up for the first time.

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,083
'Course it does.

223
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,333
[KINO]
How much do I owe you?

224
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,250
None.

225
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,458
[gasps]

226
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,541
[PERSUADERSMITH]
Though I would like to ask.

227
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,416
Yeah?

228
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,666
[PERSUADERSMITH]
A while back, there was

229
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,125
an expert marksman who
made all of her students

230
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,708
call her "Master."
She was a traveler.

231
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,250
The type to poke her nose
into all sorts of trouble,

232
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,666
earning spite and gratitude
wherever she went.

233
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,958
That was a long time ago.

234
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,791
Have you heard of her?
Or met her, perhaps?

235
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,416
Afraid not. Don't know her.

236
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:35,000
[PERSUADERSMITH chuckles]
Fair enough. Anyway...

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
The Woodsman is a very dear,

238
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,708
old friend of mine, but
I've decided to pass it on

239
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,041
to you, traveler.

240
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,166
[gasps]

241
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,333
Years ago, back when
I was a traveler,

242
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,750
this gun saved my life
countless times.

243
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,583
It's been quite a while
since I've used it, though.

244
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:04,125
I settled down and got old.
Too old to start again.

245
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,125
This guy's still usable.

246
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,416
I'd hate to see him
waste away with me.

247
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,333
I wanna let him travel.
Like we did in the old days.

248
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,125
[PERSUADERSMITH]
Won't you take him?

249
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,750
That's a kind offer.

250
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,291
I'd be glad to take it.

251
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,875
[chuckles] All right!
That's the spirit, kid!

252
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,291
Come on 'round back 'n
we can fire some test shots!

253
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,791
I'll show you all its quirks.

254
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,000
We'll have to adjust the holster
and grip for ya, as well.

255
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,458
Ready?

256
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,833
Hey. You finished?

257
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,708
[HERMES] I've been dying
of boredom out here.

258
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,666
Sorry for keeping
you two waiting.

259
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,041
Wanna head back now?

260
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,791
[SAKURA] Wait a sec, Kino.
And Hermes, too.

261
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,625
Before we call it a day,

262
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,916
there's one more place
that I wanted to show you.

263
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,583
[gasps]
This view is amazing!

264
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,000
[HERMES]
Pretty.

265
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,541
[SAKURA]
I come to this spot a lot.

266
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,875
It's my favorite place
in the whole town.

267
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,083
So yeah.

268
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,083
I always told myself
that if a traveler came,

269
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,666
I'd show it to them.

270
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,875
And you two happen to be
the first ones who did!

271
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,791
It's an honor.

272
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,166
When I grow up,
I'm going to inherit the hotel

273
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,833
from my mother and father.

274
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,916
I'm training hard, 'cause
when that day comes,

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,750
I wanna be a great
innkeeper and tour guide.

276
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,041
Think I could be?

277
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,208
[KINO]
Of course.

278
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,375
Heck. You're already
a great tour guide.

279
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,625
I've enjoyed these past
two days a whole lot.

280
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,791
[HERMES]
Same here.

281
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,708
This kind country
was perfectly matched by

282
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,333
the kindness of our guide.

283
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,875
[giggles]
Well, thank you for saying so.

284
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,333
[SAKURA] I wanna learn more and
more about all kinds of things.

285
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,958
That way, I'll never stop
becoming a better tour guide.

286
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,208
You're the first I've met,

287
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,958
but I hope that lots and
lots of travelers end up

288
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,458
visiting this country.

289
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,500
And I hope, before they leave,

290
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,875
that they'll have made lots and
lots of wonderful memories.

291
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,416
The kind so good
they'll never forget 'em!

292
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,083
It's nice, that I'm able
to help make that happen,

293
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,583
don't you think so?

294
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,583
Yeah. It's a
lovely job you have.

295
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,625
[SAKURA]
Hey. Kino?

296
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,166
Do you ever run into
hardship in your travels?

297
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,250
Or have to do stuff you hate?

298
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,458
I do. Now and then.

299
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,791
But you keep going?

300
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,875
[KINO]
Yeah.

301
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,791
It doesn't make me wanna stop.

302
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,125
Why not?

303
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,875
Is it because traveling is
something you feel like

304
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,833
you're supposed to do?

305
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,083
[KINO]
It's more like

306
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,166
I just keep traveling
cause I want to.

307
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,083
[SAKURA'S MOTHER]
Hey, Sakura.

308
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,791
If you really wanted to, you
could start a journey as well.

309
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,125
[SAKURA]
Huh?

310
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,125
[SAKURA'S MOTHER]
You could go and see the world,

311
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,583
just like Kino does.

312
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,041
And then you could come back
and be a guide afterwards.

313
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,500
[SAKURA'S FATHER]
Hmm.

314
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,333
Oh. You think so?

315
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,041
[SAKURA] Mm-mm. I wanna be
the best tour guide I can.

316
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,541
That means studying here,

317
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,250
at the place I'll be
showing people around.

318
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,125
After all, it is my dream.

319
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,583
[BOTH gasp]

320
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:26,375
Well, that's lovely, too.

321
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,583
[SAKURA'S FATHER]
Looks like we'll find ourselves

322
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,083
with some free time
not too long from now.

323
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,625
Exactly!

324
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,000
[laughing]

325
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,708
[SAKURA]
Well, Kino, this is the spot.

326
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,625
[HERMES] They seem a bit
young to be getting married.

327
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,250
Normally, people
don't get married here

328
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,791
until they're after 20.

329
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,208
This is unusual.

330
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,583
[HERMES]
What are they doing?

331
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,166
The bride and the groom
are gonna throw

332
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,500
a bunch of little bags
out to the crowd.

333
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,833
Most of the bags'll be empty,
but there'll be a few bags

334
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,666
with a seed in it for every
kid they wanna have.

335
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,791
And they say if you get
one of the seeds they throw,

336
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,416
and you sleep next to it,
then you'll become

337
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,625
a happy bride
yourself before long!

338
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,708
Want me to help
try and grab some?

339
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,958
It should improve your odds.

340
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,166
You'd do that?

341
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,625
Sure. Let's go.

342
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,000
[BRIDE A]
We'd like to have...

343
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,958
[GROOM A] ...a grand
total of five children.

344
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,500

Aww...

[gasps]

[KINO] Luck is one thing
I've always had.

350
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,166
[SAKURA] I've never even managed
to get an empty one before.

351
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,541
Let alone one that
has a seed in it!

352
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,708
So, Kino, thank you.

353
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,250
I was happy I could help.

354
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,583
Traveler. Good evening.

355
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,375
Could you please start
preparing to leave now?

356
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, actually, I was
really hoping I could stay

357
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,583
for another day or two.

358
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,833
[gasps]

359
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,458
[HERMES] Whoa! What's
gotten into you, Kino?

360
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:18,000
Nothing. I just feel like it.
Is this really that shocking?

361
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,250
My apologies,
but when you entered,

362
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,333
you told us you would
only stay for three days.

363
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,250
I must insist that
you hold to that.

364
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,458
These are the rules.

365
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,041
Since your
next stop is out west.

366
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,916
You should camp up on the ridge.

367
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,416
Stop any closer than that,

368
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,166
and you'll risk rocks
falling on you.

369
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,750
He's quite right.

370
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,000
Be sure to reach the top of the
ridge, before you stop to rest.

371
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,541
[SAKURA'S MOTHER]
Here. Take these.

372
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,958
The small one is a snack for
tonight, and you can have

373
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,416
the larger one for
breakfast in the morning.

374
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,166
Thanks, I appreciate it.

375
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,333
I'm grateful to all of you.

376
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,458
In all my travels, I've yet to
experience such a pleasant

377
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,833
and welcoming country.

Thank you very much for coming
all this way to see our country.

No, thank you.

00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,958
I made a lot of wonderful
memories here.

You're welcome.

Goodbye. See ya next time.

Come back and see us!

386
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,375
[HERMES]
That really was strange, Kino.

387
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,458
You almost never ask to
stay more than three days.

388
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:39,750
[KINO] Yeah. I'm surprised
at myself, too.

389
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,750
[HERMES]
That was a nice country.

390
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,250
[KINO]
It was lots of fun.

391
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,458
[HERMES] Just about the
opposite of those rumors.

392
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,583
Yeah.

393
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,625

Makes me wonder.

Me, too.

395
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,333
Then again, rumors
can just be rumors.

396
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,125
But at the end of the day,
it doesn't really matter.

Don't know.
I just have a bad feeling.

00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,375
Something's wrong.

My mouth is all dry
for some strange reason.

That's weird.

Everything seems fine.

What is that?

408
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,666
[HERMES] If memory serves,
that's a pyroclastic flow.

409
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,000
A burst of super-hot ash
and pumice that flows down

410
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,125
a mountainside at high speeds.

411
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,083
It's one of the ways
a volcano can erupt.

412
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,916
It's a volcanic eruption?!

Yeah, that.

If we went back right now...

Nope.

you can do for them.

my country will be

the rest of the story.

432
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,125
About a month ago, we
learned that a large-scale

433

pyroclastic flow would
destroy our country."

00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,583
"Faced with this awful news..."

436
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,166
[SAKURA'S MOTHER]
"...we had two options:

437
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,750
To abandon our country,
or to die in it.

438
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,083
We made our choice.
We decided to stay.

439
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,708
Such a choice may seem foolish,

440
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,416
especially to a traveler
such as yourself.

441
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,583
But this country is where

442
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,541
every one of us was
born and raised.

443
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:32,041
This is the only land we know.
The only way of life we know.

444
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,166
So rather than lament
our fate, or curse it...

445
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,958
...or fight it...

446
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:41,000
...we simply chose to live our
final days to the fullest.

447
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,375
Now, this may come
as a surprise, Kino.

448
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,958
But up until recently,
our country has been

449
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,208
rather disrespectful toward
travelers like you.

450
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,791
In learning our fate,
we also realized that

451
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,000
the only thing our people
would be remembered for

452
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,791
was our rudeness.

453
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,083
So we resolved to do better.

454
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,791
To ensure that the only memories
people kept of our country

455
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,625
would be wonderful,
and full of joy.

456
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,916
However, it began
to seem our rudeness

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,375
had caught up with us.

458
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,000
Not a single traveler
came our way.

459
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:18,666
Until, with only three days
left, you arrived.

460
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,458
So when we welcomed you,

461
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,875
it truly was from the
bottom of our hearts.

462
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:30,083
I'll say it one last time:
Thank you for coming.

463
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:34,375
P.S. Only the adults
knew about this.

464
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,708
We didn't tell Sakura.

465
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,875
Honestly, my husband and
I were hoping to talk you

466
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,666
into taking her
with you, but...

467
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,000
Then, last night,

468
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,833
she told us she wanted
to inherit the inn.

469
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,750
That it was her dream
to inherit the inn.

470
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:56,500
That told us she belongs here.
So we'll be taking her with us."

471
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,916
[HERMES]
Well. That solves the mystery.

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,958
Hey, Hermes.

473
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,416
[HERMES]
Hmm?

474
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,916
[KINO] Care to guess
what my first thought was

475
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,750
when I read this?

476
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,625
[HERMES]
Go ahead.

477
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,000
[KINO]
I thought... I was lucky.

478
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,916
That they didn't talk me
into taking Sakura.

479
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,375
I felt relieved.

480
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,583
[HERMES]
That's understandable.

481
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,625
It's just selfish.

482
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,458
I'm so damn selfish.

483
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,000
[HERMES]
I dunno about that.

484
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,416
But I do know there's
nothing to be done now.

485
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,958
And it's not like I could
have carried both of you.

486
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,291
[gasps]

487
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,500
"Hey there, Kino.

488
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,791
I just realized that"...

489
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,083
[HERMES]
Read it.

490
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,291
"That there's no point..."

491
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,041
[SAKURA] "There's no point
in me hanging onto this.

492
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,250
I think you'd better
keep it instead.

493
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:55,333
Take care.
And don't forget about us.

494
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,625
Your friend, Sakura."

495
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:02,958
[wheezes]

496
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,833
[HERMES]
You're all set.

497
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:17,958
[KINO]
Hmm.

498
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,750
[HERMES]
What a nice country.

499
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,250
Yeah. We had fun there, right?

500
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,125
No complaints about that one.

501
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,208
[KINO]
Let's go.

502
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,625
[HERMES]
Yeah.

503
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,875
[KINO]
"Country of Adults."
