We hold the fights
once every three months.

becoming a citizen here.

One-on-one matches,

Whoever wins the whole thing
is granted citizenship.

Also, they get a shiny
new medal from the king.

Oh, and they get to add any new
rule to this country's laws.

Weapons're allowed,
and you can yield,

47
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,208
but your opponent
doesn't have to spare ya.

48

If they do,
you'll be free to go.

Refuse to fight at all,
and you're enslaved,

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,291
No, not yet, but I'm
making a very special one

160
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,958
with this denser propellant.

161
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,750
It oughta pack
more of a punch.

162
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,916
[HERMES]
Hmm... Oh, right.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,041
I heard more about this country
from some old man today.

164
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,375
An old man?

165
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,500
[HERMES] Yeah.
The one who calls you 24.

166
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,750
[KINO]
Oh.

167
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,916
[HERMES] So, seven years
ago, the previous king

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,916
was assassinated by his son,

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,208
which is how he
became the current king.

170
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,333
[KINO]
Yeah?

171
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,875
[HERMES] The previous king was
a good and diligent one,

172
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,458
but he was very
strict with his son.

173
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,041
Too strict, I guess.

174
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,958
The son bottled up his
rage for many years.

175
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,291
Eventually though,
it all came out.

176
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,458
He slaughtered his father,
did the same to anyone else

177
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,791
that opposed him,
and seized the throne.

178
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,208
But his wife couldn't cope
with what he'd done.

179
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,708
She killed herself,
and their two children

180
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:49,416
were run out of the country.
No one knows where they are now.

181
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,458
So, the murderous king
was left alone.

182
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:56,208
He made selfish rules--
even legalized slavery.

183
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,791
The country attracted
a lot of rough types,

184
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,541
so the king decided to make them
fight to become citizens.

185
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,750
The people questioned
all this at first,

186
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,416
but eventually,
they just went with it.

187
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,583
Slavery made life easier.
The killing was fun to watch.

188
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,541
For them, at least.

189
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,916
All finished.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,291
[HERMES]
Were you listening?

191
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,166
Yeah, sort of. I think I got
the gist of it at least.

192
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,166
Thank you.

193
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,375
[HERMES]
Uh-huh. You're welcome.

194
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,166
It's time I turned in.

195
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,000
[HERMES]
Hey, Kino.

196
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,750
I'm here. What's on your mind?

197
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,208
[HERMES]
Nevermind.

198
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,333
During my fight tomorrow,

199
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,375
I'd like for you to come and
watch from somewhere nearby.

200
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,875
[HERMES]
How come?

201
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,500
'Cause as soon as I'm finished,

202
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,541
I wanna ride straight
outta this filthy country.

203

[CROWD cheering]

204
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,916
[BOTH]
Yeah!

205
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,583
[HERMES] That young man
is Kino's last opponent?

206
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,041
[GUARD A]
Yeah, that's him, all right.

207
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,625
He's an incredible fighter.

208
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,208
Your partner's no pushover, but
I think he might be in trouble

209
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,625
against this one.

210
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,916
[HERMES]
Hmm... Nah, I'm not worried.

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,916
Well actually, I think that
Kino's planning to do

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,375
something drastic once
this match is over,

213
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,541
so... I am worried about that.

214
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,666
Uh.

215
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,708
Hi there, my name is Shizu.

And mine is Kino.

[SHIZU]
Kino, huh?

218
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,458
I'd like to ask you a favor.

219
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,875
[KINO]
What is it?

220
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,416
[SHIZU] Yield to me now,
before blood is shed.

221
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,208
I swear I'll accept it.

222
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,875
[KINO] Are you hoping to become
a citizen of this place?

223
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,583
[SHIZU]
No. That's not my goal.

224
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,541
But I won't be able
to do what I have to

225
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,000
until I've won this tournament.

226
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,833
That'll be easier if you yield.

227
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,166
I have no idea what
you're trying to get at,

228
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,583
but I'm not yielding.

229

And why not?

230
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,916
Think that should be
pretty obvious.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,916
I'm not yielding because
I wanna fight you.

00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,875
[GUARD A gasps]

320
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,791
[yelling, grunting]

321
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,500
[sighs]

322
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,333
I told you I'd be back.

323
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,583
[HERMES]
It's pretty out here.

324
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,000
[HERMES]
Um, Kino?

325
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,000
The lake... It's calm now.

326
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:11,375
[KINO] No matter how brutal the
shockwave, serenity returns.

327
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,458
[HERMES] You're thinking of that
couple with the carriage, right?

328
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,833
[KINO]
Yeah.

329
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,041
[HERMES]
If I'm remembering right,

330
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,125
they told us about
a wonderful country

331
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,458
out in the vast western forests.

332
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,708
They were planning to
start their lives there.

333
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,083
Yeah. They were.

334
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:34,375
[HERMES] But later on,
we met the wife by herself.

335
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,666
Do you think that they...?

336
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,250
Yeah.

337
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,583
[HERMES]
As I recall, at least.

338
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:43,791
She seemed just fine.
She smiled and said:

339
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,666
Visit that country as
soon as you can, Kino.

340
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,916
[KINO grunts]

341
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,166
[KINO]
All right. Let's go.

342
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,833
[SHIZU]
Kino.

343
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:39,250
My father was a vile man.
He needed to be slain.

344
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,916
So thanks.

345
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,416
[HERMES]
You're the exiled prince?

346
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,708
Used to be. If I had beaten you,

347
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,916
I would've waited for him to
present me with my medal,

348
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,958
and then cut him down,
consequences be damned.

349
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,458
Planned that for seven years.

350
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,791
[KINO]
You should know--

351
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,791
Revenge is stupid.

352
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,625
[SHIZU sighs]
I think so, too.

353
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,041
Well, Riku?
Where should we go from here?

354
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,166
Wherever you'd
like to go, Shizu.

355
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,416
[HERMES] No way!
A talking dog?! That's crazy!

356
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,541
[RIKU] Am I the first
talking dog you've met?

357
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,916
Nice to meet you.

358
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,375
Likewise. I am
Shizu's loyal servant.

359
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,041
My name is Riku.

360
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,750
It seems my master owes you.

361
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,208
You saved him from having
to kill the king himself.

362
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:40,333
That might not have ended well.
Therefore, you have my thanks.

363
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,250
I'm glad I was helpful.

364
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,958
He's very cute.
Does he mind being petted?

365
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,416
Go for it.

366
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,083
[chuckles]

367
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,791
[HERMES]
Hmph. Pervy mutt...

368
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,958
Uh...

369
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,458
[KINO]
Pardon, but...

370
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,041
[SHIZU]
Oh, that?

371
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,291
I'm keeping it as a
rememberance of my grandfather.

372
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,458
I realize that it isn't
exactly my place

373
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,083
to ask something
like this, but...

374
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,916
...do you not wanna
become the king?

375
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,541
No, I don't.

376
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,958
How come?

377
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,250
I just don't feel like someone
who planned to kill

378
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,583
his own father could
ever be fit to be a king.

379
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,083
That's interesting.

380
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,208
Wouldn't suit me anyway. Right?

381
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,625
Yeah, I'm not sure if it would.

382
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,625
[SHIZU]
Hey, Kino.

383
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,625
We could travel to the next town
over together if you'd like.

384
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,958
I can show ya the way.

385
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,958
I'll pass, but thanks
for the offer.

386
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,416
--Ah.
--[KINO] Nothing personal.

387
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
I was taught not to go wandering
off with strange men is all.

388
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,875
Huh...?

389
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,833
Hey, Shizu.

390
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,250
[whispers] You do
realize that Kino is...?

391
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,958
I understand.
Just be careful, okay?

392
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,416
But you are
stronger than me, so...

393
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,625
I'm pretty sure
you'll be just fine.

394
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,291
Thanks. You take care.
The both of you.

395
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,750
I'm glad to have met you.

396
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,125
[HERMES]
Catch ya later, pervy mutt.

397
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,541
Yes. Until then, rust bucket.

398
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,000
[HERMES]
Hmph!

399
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,750
[KINO]
That Riku was a real cutie.

400
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,250
[HERMES]
You mean the dog?

401
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,583
I kinda figured you two
would get along.

402
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:43,666
[HERMES] Why? What, do we
have something in common?

403
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,916
--Hey! Kino!
--[KINO chuckles]

404
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,125
[SHIZU sighs]
Really though...

405
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,875
What should I do now, Riku?

406
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:30,166
[RIKU] Are you sure you would
like to ask me for advice?

407
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,791
I lick my own butt sometimes.
Pretty often, in fact.

408
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,625
[SHIZU]
Fair point.

409
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,916
[KINO]
"Bothersome Country."
