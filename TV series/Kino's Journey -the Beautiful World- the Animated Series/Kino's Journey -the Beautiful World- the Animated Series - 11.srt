[KINO] I met the traveler

Back when I still lived in

remember what I was called then.

It's all kind of blurry.

that it was the name

of some kind of flower.

17
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,916
And that if you changed
its pronunciation a little,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,791
it became a nasty insult.
I got teased a lot that way.

but they said it was nothing

Hmm... No, not exactly.

Motorrads can only move

Well, in this case.

him balanced, he'll fall over.

Mm-hmm.

So that's the pact.

keep him fueled,
