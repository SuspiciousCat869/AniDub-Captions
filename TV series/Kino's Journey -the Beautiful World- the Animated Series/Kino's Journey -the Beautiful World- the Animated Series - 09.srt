1
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,666
[gasps] Hey! Check it
out, a car's comin'.

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,000
[BANDIT B]
Mm-hm.

3
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,041
Take a good look again
and tell me what you see.

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,166
Sure! All over it, sir.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,916
Well, uh.
It's a weird car.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,458
The driver's got a sword.

7
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,458
And there's a little girl with
a dog in the passenger seat.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,625
All right.

9
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,208
You've got all
the basic details,

10
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:36,250
now tell me if this group would
be a good target for us.

11
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,666
Yeah. They look like easy
pickings, if you ask me.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,125
And what makes you say that?

13
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,250
Well...

14
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,291
I'm pretty sure that
car's custom-made.

15
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,166
Bet we could sell
it for a fortune.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,750
The man looks like
he's fairly skilled,

17
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,250
but what use will a
sword be against a bullet?

18
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,458
And we might as well ignore
the little girl and the dog.

19
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
That'd be a mistake.

20
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,916
Uh! What do you mean?

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,083
I was wrong?

22
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,791
Take a better look
at that little girl.

23
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:05,000
[BANDIT A]
Um. I see somethin' in her hand.

24
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:08,166
It's dark and roundish.
Head of a doll maybe?

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,333
Think again.
That's a hand grenade.

26
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:13,291
[gasps]
Whoa, you're right.

27
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,500
You'd be surprised what
a skilled swordsman can do.

28
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,750
And dogs have keen noses.

29
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,958
If we set up an ambush,
it would sniff us out easy.

30
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,791
That's a target we'd be
much better off avoiding.

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,958
[BANDIT A]
Look sir!

32
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,833
There's a motorrad comin'.

33
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,250
Well done.

34
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,291
I've got eyes on it, too.
Observe and make a report.

35
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,791
[BANDIT A] Right.
The driver is a young boy--

36
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,333
Or wait.
Actually, I think it's a girl.

37
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,708
What's more, she's sorta cute.
Really cute.

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,416
[BANDIT B]
What you should concentrate on

39
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,166
is whether or not she's
suitable to become our prey.

40
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,458
Well, that's easy!

41
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,291
We could definitely take her on!

42
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,375
I mean what's a lone
girl gonna do, ri--

43
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,083
Couldn't be more
wrong if you tried.

44
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,291
Uh?

45
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,208
She may not look like
much of a threat,

46
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,916
but that girl
is almost certainly

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,375
a highly-skilled warrior
whose seen and won

48
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,541
a number of hard fights.

49
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,166
Don't be fooled.

50
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,041
If she's traveling alone,

51
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,458
it's because she's
capable of traveling alone.

52
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,125
[BANDIT B] Our ideal
target is the kind of person

53
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,250
who carelessly picks
a fight with someone

54
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:32,375
stronger than themselves.
In short, someone like you.

55
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,541
[BANDIT A]
Hey...

56
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,250
Don't be discouraged, now.

57
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,583
I'd wager you're less
than half my age.

58
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,291
That gives you plenty
of time to learn better.

59
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,750
[BANDIT A]
Sure...

60
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,791
By the way, I heard that you
were the one who suggested

61
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,666
this lookout point to be posted
here in the first place.

62
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,125
Well, you heard right.

63
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,416
But I'll tell you that was
a good number of years ago--

64
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,291
[BANDIT B] It was just a
regular day for me and the gang.

65
00:02:56,375 --> 00:03:00,250
We'd stopped a worn down, yellow
car with two travelers in it.

66
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,916
Driver was a goofy
looking young man.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Passenger was
a black-haired beauty.

68
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,916
[BANDIT B] We thought
we had 'em at our mercy.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,500
But they were devils!

70
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,375
Bloodthirsty devils
straight from hell!

71
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,958
[BANDIT B]
Run away! Run!

72
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,625
Hey, uh...
You all right, sir?

73
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,958
Sir?

74
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,166
[MAN B] I'm curious, traveler.
Have you already heard?

75
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,833
About our country's
unique system

76
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,583
of accruable virtue points?

77
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,041
[HERMES]
Ooh, what's that about?

78
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,083
This is the first time
we've heard of it.

79
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,666
Here in this country,
whenever someone is witnessed

80
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,291
performing a good deed,

81
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,416
they're rewarded with
what we call virtue points.

82
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,916
Huh.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,583
So how do you measure what
makes a deed worth rewarding?

84
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,875
[HERMES]
Yeah, how?

85
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,250
[MAN B]
Various ways.

86
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:32,000
I understand that this café
supports an orphanage.

87
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,125
Please, put this
towards your efforts.

88
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,458
Thank you!

89
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,500
So, there's an example.

90
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,000
Donations earn virtue points
based on their proportion

91
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,000
to your income,
not just the raw amount.

92
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,375
[HERMES]
Oh, yeah?

93
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,166
[MAN B] This measure was
introduced so that people

94
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,875
couldn't obtain virtue points
simply by being rich.

95
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,666
Makes sense to me.

96
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,791
[MAN B] The single best way
to obtain virtue points

97
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,500
is by making great
contributions to society.

98
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,833
Think of prodigy singers.

99
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,291
Or doctors who
cure the incurable.

100
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,958
You also get points
for little things,

101
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,666
like giving up your seat on
the bus for an elderly person.

102
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,583
When someone observes
your good deed,

103
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,416
they apply for you
to get points.

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Making such an application
earns virtue points as well.

105
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,708
Your virtue point total

106
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,958
is part of your resident
registration data,

107
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,750
and is displayed on
every citizen's ID card.

108
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,958
Gotcha.

109
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,208
So anyone can easily
tell how much a citizen

110
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,000
has contributed to your society.

111
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,375
[HERMES]
All right.

112
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,583
Now what if you're rude
and bother a lot of people.

113
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,833
Or straight up commit
some kinda crime?

114
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,083
You lose points?

115
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,083
That's correct.

116
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,791
Small crimes don't hurt much.

117
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,458
But felonies cost
a great deal of points.

118
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,750
And when someone goes negative,

119
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,333
they're made to
serve time in prison.

120
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,250
So if I'm hearing right,
then if someone built up

121
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,291
enough good deeds in their life
before they committed a crime.

122
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,791
They could basically
get off without punishment.

123
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,583
Or am I mistaken?

124
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,625
Well. Yes, the points
would offset each other.

125
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,083
As long as their
total's positive,

126
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,666
they'd avoid jail time.

128
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,500
[MAN B]
I think it's a fair system.

129
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,833
Tell me if you've
heard stories like this.

130
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,250
Someone who's lived
virtuously all their life

131
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,791
randomly slips up and
does something wrong.

132
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,916
Suddenly, they're
condemned by all.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,208
[KINO]
Yeah.

134
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,791
[MAN B]
On the other hand,

135
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,458
someone can spend their entire
life being selfish and cruel,

136
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,000
but then, thanks to
a single good deed,

137
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,333
be viewed as an angel.

138
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,083
[HERMES]
It happens.

139
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,375
[MAN B] It's irrational, judging
someone off of one or two

140
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:32,625
short moments of their lives.
Our system is different.

141
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,875
It views us fully.

142
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,833
That said,
losing points does hurt.

143
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,500
In terms of reputation and more.

144
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,750
It's very rare for someone
to think it's all right

145
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,500
to indulge in a bit of crime

146
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,041
simply because they've
built up a few points.

147
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,833
[HERMES]
Well, that's good to hear.

148
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:54,125
[MAN B] That said...
I've been debating it.

You see, up until now,

151
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,625
I have devoted my life to

00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,125
First as an inventor,
then as a business man.

And up until last month,

154
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,333
I served as this

155

Quite successfully, too.

You must have a whole lotta
points built up, huh?

Yes. You're right about that.

161
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,791
I have many points.

162
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,458
[HERMES]
How many?

163
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,458
Enough for me to commit
the crime of murder.

164
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,458
Once.

[HERMES]
Whoa!

166
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,083
That's impressive.

167
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,666
At any moment.

168
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,083
I could slay someone
without cause.

169
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,958
And face no penalty aside
from a reduction in points.

170
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,791
No one's ever had
this many points before.

171
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,916

should use them, is that right?

[KINO grunts]

174

[MAN B] I've managed to accrue
all of these points, and yet,

175
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,458
I can't think of
a single person to kill.

176
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:07,625
I've earned the right,
but no matter how hard I try,

177
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,250
I can't think of who.

178
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,541
What's more,
I'm running out of time.

179
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,791
My heart's giving out on me.

180
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,333
If I don't act quickly,
I'll die before I can decide.

181
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,583
[HERMES] Hey, there's no need to
force yourself to kill someone.

182
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,666
[MAN B]
It's not like that.

183

Don't you get it?

184
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,958
This is why I've saved points.

185
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,541
In the hopes that this
moment would come.

186
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,083
I've worked my
whole life for this!

187
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,833
And I made it. I can't just
throw all that away.

188
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,958
I want to kill.
Killing's always been my dream.

189
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,375
Ever since I was a child.

190
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,750
From the moment I learned

191

how the virtue point
system worked,

192
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,500
I have been obsessed.

193
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:53,083
Obsessed with the idea that
I could save up enough points...

194
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,083
...to erase a life.

195
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,750
Yes. To kill.

196
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:02,208
To end someone.
It's all I want.

197

I understand.
Thanks for the explanation.

198
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,333
When I first approached
you, I had planned to--

199
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,375
You know, most would-be

their victims this much warning.

[MAN B] No. But it didn't
make a difference with you.

You noticed that I was
hiding a knife in my jacket

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,875
from the moment I sat down
here, did you not?

[KINO]
True.

of any ingredients!

it's up to his standards,

he'll leave you the recipe!

That's right!

skill has put a marvelous twist

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,625
on the already incredible
dish and left us the recipe!

317
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,375
I've reproduced it. Behold!

318
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,875
[ALL gasp]

319
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,208
[MALE OWNER D] At first, I
didn't want to have a knock off

320
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,583
of our own specialty,
but taste it.

321
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,416
Let's see.

322
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,208
Wow, this really isn't bad.

323
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,375
Although it doesn't have as much
impact as the original dish.

324
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,125
Amazing, the chicken
is wrapped in

325
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,791
a paste of mashed
fruits and vegetables.

326
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,666
It really tones
down the spiciness!

327
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,250
Y'know what?

328
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,291
This would be a lot easier for
children and the elderly to eat.

329
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,458
Which is why
I propose we do this!

330
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,708
[SHIZU]
Huh.

331
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,625
Good afternoon.
I take it you're a traveler?

332
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,625
Yep.

333
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,958
In that case,
you'll have to try

334
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,250
one of our country's
signature dishes.

335
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,875
Sure, and what
kind of dishes are they?

336
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,791
Well! Here we have
Kino's original fried chicken.

337
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,875
And here we have
Kino's mild fried chicken!

338
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,750
Huh?

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,541
"May my love become mutual."

342
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,416
That's interesting.
It looks like those statues

343
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,416
are covered head to toe
in people's wishes.

344

[WOMAN A]
Oh, are you two travelers?

345
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,750
Here, for you.

346
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,916
They say that if you write
your wish down and give it to

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,875
one of those three, they'll
make it come true for you.

348
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,791
Hey, you should
give it a shot, Ti.

349
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,208
I'll go find out what
I can about immigration.

350
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,125
Wait, Shizu, why don't
we simply write,

351
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,500
"may we find a country
that accepts immigrants

352
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,416
and isn't populated by
the violently delusional"?

353
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,250
I would rather act than wish.

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,500
[TIFANA]
Hmm...

355
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,125
Hey, kid. Have a wish
you'd like me to post?

356
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,291
Give it here and
I'll put it up for ya.

357
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,541
Wow. That's the most
generous wish I've seen.

358
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,791
Yeah.

359
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,250
"May the wishes of everyone else
who came here come true."

360
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,916
Well, you are just
the sweetest little girl!

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,833
[MAN D]
What a pure-hearted kid.

362
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,291
[MAN C] Ugh. Wish I
had a daughter like that.

363
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,583
[RIKU]
That's very kind of you, Ti.

364
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,541
A truly wonderful wish.

365
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,833
Was there nothing
you wanted for yourself?

366
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,791
You know that the wishes
don't really come true, right?

367
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,333
Hey, you two.
Sorry about the wait.

368
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,833
We're glad to have you
back, Shizu, how'd it go?

369
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,250
Not so well.

370
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,958
They aren't taking
in immigrants.

371

Heh.

You're in a good mood.

00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,833
[KINO]
Yeah.

374
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,625
I remember the country
up ahead especially well

375
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,791
from Master's travel stories.

376
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,958
I'm pretty sure it was
a favorite of hers.

377
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,208
I may want to stay here awhile.

378
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,583
[HERMES] Oh? It's a bit
unusual to hear that from you.

379
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,708
[KINO]
You think?

380
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,541
[HERMES]
Eh. So what's this country like?

381
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,791
She would never tell
me anything about it.

382
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,166
[HERMES]
What?

383
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,458
[KINO] Really, she wouldn't
give me a single detail.

384
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,500
All she would say
about it was that

385
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,458
of all the countries
she'd travelled through,

386
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,416
it was the only one she knew
she would never forget.

--[KINO] Sorry.

to see what it's like.

389
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,541

clean me up once we're in.

Yeah? What's up?

00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:34,000
[KINO] I thought we were just
about to go into that country.

397
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,875
Is that wrong?

398
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,000
[HERMES]
Um. Not "wrong."

399
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,083
[KINO] Then why are we
on the other side now?

400
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,000
[HERMES] Take it easy.
I'll explain everything.

401
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,791
Maybe get off for a sec.

402
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,166

Yeah, all right.

[HERMES] 'Kay, so I'm
just gonna say it flat out.

enjoyed it, and left. The end.

00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,583
What?

406
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,083
[HERMES]
It's just like I said.

407
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,250
Two days ago,
in the early afternoon,

408
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,125
we went in through
their east gate.

409
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,875
We stayed for three days,
just how you like it.

410
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,708
Then we said our goodbyes
this afternoon and left.

411
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,625
Which brings us here.

412
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:17,000
[KINO] But... there's no way.
I don't have any memory of that.

413
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,625
[HERMES]
Of course you don't.

414

in the box on my left side.
Check it out.

remember putting it there?

for would-be visitors.

422
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,125
It's that I agree to have
my memories of it erased

423
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,875
with a drug, once this visit
comes to an end.

424
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,583
[KINO] They don't want word
of what this country is like

to reach any outsiders.

426

However, they still
want travelers to enjoy

a pleasant stay.

428
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,333
So they decided to do
this as a compromise.

it for a few centuries now.

rolling up to the gate,

know what's going on?

But don't worry.

You were still your usual self.

452
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,000
In fact, I'd say you had a
better time in that country

453
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,541
than you've had in
any other we've been to.

then remove the envelope

a picture would be fine.

Man, that country was awesome.

Great, but...

if I can't remember?!

465
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,166
[KINO] So, I guess Master
didn't tell me about it

466
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,916
because she couldn't.

Yup.

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,250
By the way, that's the second
time you've realized that.

469
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,166
You said the exact same thing,
syllable for syllable,

470
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,958
when we first went inside.

471
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,958

How are you on fuel, Hermes?

472
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,041
[HERMES]
Full tank.

473
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,458
We're stocked up
on food and water, too.

474
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,791
You even got me new tires.

475
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:58,916
All right, then.

476
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,625
[engine revs]

477
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,666
You ready? Let's go.

478
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,083
[HERMES]
Sounds good to me.

479
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,250
[HERMES]
Hey, Kino.

480
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,916
Is there even
a country out here?

481
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,583
[KINO]
Who knows?

482
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,791
[HERMES]
I was hoping you did.

483
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,125
Sorry to disappoint,
but to be honest,

484
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,625
I don't know why we're driving
through here either.

485
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,541
We just are.

486
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,666
[HERMES]
Figures.

487
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,000
Hey, Kino.
Where are we heading?

488
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,166
Straight.

489
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,083
[KINO]
"Kind Country."
