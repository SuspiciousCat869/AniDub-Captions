1
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:06,493
In the year 845, two terrifying
new breeds of Titan appeared:

2
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:08,350
the Colossal and the Armored,

3
00:00:08,643 --> 00:00:12,887
barreling through the outer walls as if
wholesale destruction was child's play.

4
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:21,071
The territory couched within the
circle of Wall Maria was abandoned.

5
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:24,001
Twenty percent of the human race perished.

6
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:26,224
As the Titan onslaught advanced,

7
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,546
our only choice was to withdrawal behind Wall Rose.

8
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:34,583
Five years later, the Colossal Titan reappeared in Trost.

9
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,141
Humanity had failed to stop the Titan onslaught.

10
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:43,778
Cadet Eren Jaeger, tragically
consumed early on in the battle,

11
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:48,182
later emerged, miraculously,
from the fallen body of an Abnormal.

12
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:28,747
One more time!

13
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:31,395
Are you a human being or a Titan?

14
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,452
I'm human!

15
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:39,651
So you say.

16
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,722
I'm left with no choice.

17
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:51,209
Those things, they just kept coming.

18
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:53,442
It's a nightmare!

19
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:54,694
Take it easy!

20
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:57,354
I watched those monsters eat my squad.

21
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:02,423
I saw my friends die, and I didn't even really
feel anger or sadness about the whole thing.

22
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:06,217
All I could think was, "better you than me!"

23
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:10,958
But soon my number'll be up, too. That'll be it.

24
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,103
The end. Kaput. Game over.

25
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:17,006
We're s'posed to fight those Titans
until they eat every last one of us!

26
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,939
I don't wanna be eaten. Screw that!

27
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:22,418
Hey! Come on. Keep it together, okay?

28
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,229
You're not alone, you know!

29
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:26,374
We're all fighting back our fear.

30
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:29,896
Look at Sasha! Even after what she's seen,

31
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,706
she remains a proper soldier!

32
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,765
Oh. My stomach aches. Please
cart me away with the wounded.

33
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,268
Lemme die! I just wanna die!

34
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:44,293
Hold on! Stop it!

35
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:48,360
Well the order to keep our
mouths shut makes perfect sense now.

36
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:51,148
As if the situation isn't bad enough already.

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,108
If they knew about Eren...

38
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:01,569
Cannon fire?

39
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,066
But why just one shot?

40
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:06,083
Look! Smoke!

41
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:07,926
It's inside the wall!

42
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:14,411
Did it bust down the water gate?

43
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:17,297
Impossible. It's the sturdiest part of the whole wall!

44
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:19,418
Maybe they set off a shell by accident?

45
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:21,505
But then why is there so much smoke?

46
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:26,703
Not now. Is that Titan steam?

47
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:28,782
Hey!

48
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:55,301
What the hell is that?

49
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:18,914
It's... It's alive!

50
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:20,025
Captain Woerman!

51
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:27,646
Let's see what it does. Maintain your distance!

52
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:29,251
All squads remain alert.

53
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:31,045
He could strike at any time!

54
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:34,216
Artillery Crew! Get that cannon reloaded!

55
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:08,275
What is that?

56
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:13,393
I know I heard them fire their cannon at us, and then...

57
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:17,477
Then there was a tremendous crash and a blast of heat.

58
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:20,665
And apparently we're now in
the innards of a giant skeleton.

59
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,324
Eren did this for us, Armin.

60
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:25,191
That's all we need to understand for now.

61
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:32,951
Those flowers weren't there before. How did they...

62
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,453
Armin! Mikasa!

63
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:37,173
Hey, are you guys alright?

64
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:39,580
Eren. How'd you...?

65
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:41,089
I don't know! But look.

66
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:42,884
It's already starting to vaporize,

67
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:44,490
just like the corpse of a Titan.

68
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:45,706
Let's get out of here!

69
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:49,726
Hard to tell if they're watching and waiting,

70
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:51,330
or just totally dazed.

71
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:54,181
I suppose it doesn't really matter much either way.

72
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:58,779
I'm sure once the smoke clears they'll resume the attack.

73
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:05,254
After seeing this, I think we've
blown any hope of reasoning with them.

74
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:08,171
The cellar. I'm starting to remember.

75
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,767
This key...

76
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:11,732
Our house in Shiganshina!

77
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:15,393
My father said I'd have to go
back there. Everything hinged on it!

78
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:18,716
I think it's why he gave me the power to transform.

79
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:21,583
If I can make it to our cellar,

80
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,378
I might learn the Titans' secrets.

81
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:32,577
Why did he keep this stuff secret?

82
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:37,773
How many thousands of Scouts have already died
because my father didn't share this information?

83
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,458
It could be the last chance humanity has!

84
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,155
And the answer's been hidden away
under our house this entire time?

85
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:48,516
Is he insane? Damn him!

86
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:54,466
Where have you been these last five years, Dad?

87
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:55,220
Eren.

88
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,304
We have other business to deal with.

89
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,758
Right.

90
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:03,459
Get ready, the smoke's clearing.

91
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:04,606
As soon as you see it, blast it!

92
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,687
Kill it before it gets us!

93
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:06,926
Hold your fire!

94
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:21,021
Listen. I'm getting out of here.

95
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,111
Where? And how?

96
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,266
Anywhere but here. Then I head over
the wall and straight to Shiganshina.

97
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:30,920
But I'll have to become a Titan again.

98
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,247
You can transform at will?

99
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:36,457
To be honest, I don't know how I'm doing it, Armin.

100
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,546
I just know that I can!

101
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:43,782
It's hard to put into words,
but it was like reflexive, see?

102
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:49,267
In that moment, my mind subconsciously
focused on stopping the cannonball.

103
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:50,870
That's why it's decaying.

104
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,299
It only had the endurance to meet that task.

105
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,409
Next time I'll be stronger.

106
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:04,089
I'll be a fifteen meter high
Titan-slayer just like I was before!

107
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:04,851
Eren!

108
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:07,393
Your nose is...

109
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:12,511
Your breathing is erratic. And you're pale!

110
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,474
Something's wrong, Eren. You're not well!

111
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:18,913
As things stand, my health is irrelevant.

112
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:21,954
But I have two ideas.

113
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,830
You two could make it outta here alive

114
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:27,196
if you stop trying to protect me.

115
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:30,200
I've brought you nothing but trouble as it is.

116
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:34,375
I'm doing this on my own, from this point forward.

117
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,109
You're kidding. But I...

118
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:40,080
Eren. I'm coming, too.

119
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:41,140
No way!

120
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:44,549
I plan to follow you whether
you give me permission to or not.

121
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,354
I swear. I'll never leave your side.

122
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,404
Mikasa, stop it. I'm being serious here!

123
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:54,154
I'm not your little brother and
I'm not some snot-nosed toddler!

124
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:09,059
Captain Woerman. The cannon is almost reloaded.

125
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:12,787
We're ready, sir. What are
your orders for the next attack?

126
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:16,592
All troops will await my signal!

127
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,488
Yes sir.

128
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:23,774
As it stands. The Garrison Regiment
isn't ready to assault our position yet.

129
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:27,883
If they were, Mikasa would have
reacted faster than a stray cat.

130
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:29,773
I'm not some snot-nosed toddler!

131
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,094
I would assume they have a
well-trained Artillery crew above us.

132
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:36,056
That cannon ought to be reloaded
in the next twenty seconds.

133
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,071
Eren will most likely spring into action
and be long gone before that happens.

134
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:47,039
Why am I thinking of that at a time like this?

135
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:52,613
Is it... Is it because this is the end for us?

136
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:59,143
When it's all said and done, at the moment of truth,

137
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,909
I was a coward. Same as right now.

138
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,279
I can't count the number of
times they've come to my rescue.

139
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,447
I was always so weak.

140
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,275
I could never reciprocate the favor.

141
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:19,563
I still haven't earned the right
to think of myself as their equal.

142
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:23,821
I-I can't afford to try and repay
their kindness by going with them.

143
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:26,697
I'd only end up slowing them down.

144
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:45,318
I'm afraid this might be the last time
the three of us will ever be together.

145
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:48,888
Listen, I won't...

146
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:50,310
Just wait a second, would ya?

147
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:53,376
If you recall, I said I had two ideas.

148
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,570
Armin, I trust you to make the right decision.

149
00:11:57,737 --> 00:12:00,144
Eh? Huh?

150
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:01,469
Now hear me out.

151
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:05,095
And yes, I'm aware of how unrealistic this plan is.

152
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:06,841
The best-case scenario?

153
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:09,687
I try to use my Titan ability strategically.

154
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,465
Under Military direction.

155
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,609
This might sound crazy...

156
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:19,846
but if you think you can convince the
Garrison Regiment, right here and now,

157
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:21,912
that I present no threat to them,

158
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,853
I'll trust you and we'll go with that option.

159
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:27,403
That's my second idea.

160
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:30,307
If you don't think you can get it done,

161
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,599
then my last resort is the first idea.

162
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:37,294
You've got fifteen seconds to decide.

163
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,121
Think you can get it done?

164
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:42,300
Listen, I'll respect your opinion either way.

165
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:52,119
Eren. Why would you leave such a major decision up to me?

166
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:54,741
Because you keep a level head.

167
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,871
You always choose well, no matter how ugly things get.

168
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:00,627
I figure that's worth relying on.

169
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,505
W-When have I done that?

170
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:07,056
C'mon, you do it all the time. Take five years ago.

171
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,939
If you hadn't gone to Mr. Hannes for help,

172
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:13,213
Mikasa and I would've been eaten by the Titans.

173
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:23,907
That's how you see me?

174
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:28,356
You don't think I'm a poor excuse for a friend?

175
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:33,838
I had convinced myself that I
was just a burden to all of you.

176
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:36,991
But you never...

177
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,106
You never thought of me that way at all!

178
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:40,916
Armin!

179
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:42,630
Our time's up!

180
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:47,125
Artillery crew has reloaded, Captain!

181
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,407
It's your call, sir.

182
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:53,845
Eren and Mikasa have enough faith
in me to put their lives in my hands,

183
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:56,353
and I have complete trust in the two of them.

184
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,617
More than anyone else in this world.

185
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:02,710
And that fact alone is all the convincing I need!

186
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:08,144
I will persuade them, trust me.

187
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:11,997
You two just act as non-aggressively
as you possibly can, agreed?

188
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:21,349
Since Eren first appeared and fought as a Titan,

189
00:14:21,374 --> 00:14:23,790
something has been gnawing at the back of my mind.

190
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:26,182
I haven't had a chance to collect my thoughts yet,

191
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,288
but I can do this!

192
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,954
I'll just have to think as I talk!

193
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:35,181
Halt! Halt!

194
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:42,514
Is this supposed to be your true form, Monster?

195
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:43,850
I don't buy it!

196
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,117
I'll give the signal to fire, I mean it!

197
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:48,440
Eren is not a foe of humanity!

198
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:51,024
We're willing to cooperate with Military Command

199
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,502
and share everything we've learned about his powers!

200
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,424
Your pleas fall on deaf ears!

201
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:59,444
He revealed his true form, and because
of that threat, he cannot leave here alive!

202
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,576
If you insist that he's not
an enemy of ours, show me proof!

203
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:06,008
Otherwise, we'll blast him back to
whatever nightmare he crawled out of!

204
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,851
You don't need any proof!

205
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:10,765
That's right! There's no need at all!

206
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:15,851
The fact of the matter is it doesn't
matter what we perceive him to be!

207
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,732
What?

208
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,625
The reports say hundreds of soldiers saw him.

209
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,486
And those who were there say
they saw him fighting other Titans!

210
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:27,307
And that means they saw him
get swarmed by the Titans as well.

211
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:33,791
To put it plainly, the Titans saw him the same way
they see each and every human being; as their prey!

212
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:36,459
And it doesn't matter how else you may look at it!

213
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:38,525
That is an irrefutable fact!

214
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,570
Kid's gotta point.

215
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:58,563
Prepare to attack!

216
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:01,557
Don't let yourself be swayed by his cunning lies!

217
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:06,451
The Titan's behavior has always
been beyond our comprehension.

218
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:09,207
I wouldn't put it past 'em to assume human form.

219
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,225
He's speaking our language

220
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:13,108
in an attempt to deceive us!

221
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:17,208
I refuse to let them continue this behavior unchecked!

222
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,484
It's hopeless.

223
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:25,336
He let logic give way to hysteria!

224
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,926
Too frightened to think it through.

225
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,034
Eren! Mikasa!

226
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,172
I am a soldier!

227
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:47,358
And I have dedicated my heart to
the restoration of humanity, sir!

228
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,205
Nothing could make me prouder
than dying for such a noble cause!

229
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:57,148
If we were to use his Titan ability and
combine it with the manpower we have left,

230
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:58,920
I believe we can do it!

231
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,913
We can retake this city!

232
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:05,197
For humanity's glory, in what
little time I have left to live,

233
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:08,659
I will advocate his strategic value!

234
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:15,708
Captain Woerman. His words are worth considering, sir.

235
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:16,430
Maybe we should...

236
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:17,732
Quiet!

237
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,101
Don't let their words sway you.

238
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,831
They're all traitors!

239
00:17:22,856 --> 00:17:27,084
I swore an oath as an officer.
I will crush all insubordination!

240
00:17:32,422 --> 00:17:33,718
That's enough.

241
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:39,096
You should really do something about
your nervous disposition, Captain Woerman.

242
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:43,711
C-Commander Pyxis?

243
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:48,336
Can you not see this soldier's heartfelt salute?

244
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:53,052
I've only just arrived,

245
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:55,408
but I'm quite aware of our situation.

246
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,908
Gather our reinforcements.

247
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:03,414
I think we could at least do these young
soldiers the favor of hearing them out.

248
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:12,583
According to reports from the Scout Regiment,

249
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:15,688
it was anticipated that the
Titans would appear from the south.

250
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:20,058
These reports were proven accurate when
the Titans attacked Shiganshina District,

251
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:22,695
located on the south side of Wall Maria.

252
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:25,168
Therefore,

253
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,835
it was surmised that their next most likely
target would be the fortified city of Trost,

254
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:32,049
on the southern side of Wall Rose.

255
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:44,171
Dot Pyxis. The commanding officer
responsible for the southern territory.

256
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:47,580
The man in charge of the defense of Trost district.

257
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:53,149
The man given full authority over preserving
humanity's most vital remaining territory.

258
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,459
Nope. Not any of you.

259
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:58,584
Eaten by a Titan wouldn't be so bad,

260
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,554
if it was a sexy lady one.

261
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:05,417
The man also notorious for being genuinely eccentric.

262
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:08,699
What the hell is going through the Commander's head?

263
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,398
Going up there with those freaks
and not bringing any bodyguards!

264
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:15,447
Well, sir. That's the Commander.

265
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:18,261
He's well known for taking a less traditional approach.

266
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,031
Captain Woerman.

267
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:22,599
We have finished assembling the troops, sir.

268
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:24,633
Ah. Well done.

269
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:34,572
That's that. So, visiting this
cellar should clear everything up?

270
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:37,209
Yes, sir. Well, at least I think so.

271
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,682
For the moment, there is no way to
validate all of the claims you've made.

272
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:44,384
For now, I'll just catalogue them in here.

273
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:46,114
With that said,

274
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:50,198
I can usually tell the difference
between the unctuous and the sincere,

275
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:54,012
which is why I personally guarantee your safety.

276
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,113
You're Cadet Armin Arlelt. Is that correct?

277
00:19:59,197 --> 00:19:59,907
Yes sir!

278
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:03,849
You mentioned a plan to harness
this so-called "Titan Ability"

279
00:20:03,997 --> 00:20:07,083
and then utilize your friend's power to retake the city.

280
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:09,045
Do you believe it could work?

281
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:12,653
Or were you grasping at straws to try and save your hides?

282
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:17,107
Uh, well... Both, Commander.

283
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:20,238
I was going to suggest that Eren,

284
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:22,098
using his strength as a Titan,

285
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,329
could lift that giant boulder.

286
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:26,737
We could use it to block off the wrecked gate.

287
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,338
That was the best idea I was
able to come up with on the spot.

288
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:36,030
I-I just wanted to make everyone see
how Eren's ability might provide a solution

289
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,550
to the problem we all face.

290
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:39,791
Hm.

291
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:44,582
Granted, I was pretty desperate to survive.

292
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:48,259
"Desperate to survive," huh?

293
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:51,097
That's as credible a reason as any, son.

294
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:55,297
Ahhhh.

295
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:02,109
What do you say, Cadet Jaeger?

296
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,508
Say, sir?

297
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,972
That hole. Do you think that you can plug it up, son?

298
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:12,256
Well, I... I don't know.

299
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:16,156
It's possible. But at the moment,

300
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:19,658
I don't understand my power any more than you do.

301
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,213
It's just, I sort of feel
irresponsible giving you an answer,

302
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:26,581
'cause I don't really know.

303
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,813
Ah, yes. Of course, my apologies.

304
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,592
I asked you the wrong question.

305
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:37,082
Are you willing to, Cadet Jaeger. Or not?

306
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,400
I'll do it.

307
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,601
I'll do it!

308
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:13,421
I don't know if I can seal that hole.

309
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,410
But... I'll do it!

310
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:58,023
Despite having fled in terror before,

311
00:23:58,378 --> 00:24:01,833
the survivors choose to stand
on the field of battle once again.

312
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:04,126
Eren's mind is made up.

313
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:06,555
"I will be everyone's hope."
