1
00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:06,155
Attention!

2
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:09,740
The blueprint of the Trost
Recovery Operation is this.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,050
That's where this
fellow comes in.

4
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:16,510
Allow me to introduce
Cadet Eren Jager.

5
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:20,060
Don't let
appearances deceive you.

6
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:24,399
This young man is in fact the
successful product of cutting-edge science.

7
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:27,299
Recall the massive boulder
roughly a league from the gate.

8
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:31,788
Having assumed Titan form, Cadet Jaeger
will hoist said boulder on his back,

9
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:33,782
schlep it to
the hole, and voila!

10
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:35,728
And this is
where you all come in.

11
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:38,667
Your job will
be to defend him. Yes.

12
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:41,035
Defend a Titan
against his own kind.

13
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,601
Should we succeed,
we'll make history!

14
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,531
Today is the day!

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,661
Lands taken by our greatest
enemy will be reclaimed!

16
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:56,463
Now, it may seem an insignificant plot of land compared
to the vast tracts of former glory long abandoned.

17
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,405
But as a
symbol. As an idea.

18
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:04,178
Trost regained shall stand as a
reclamation of pride and hope beyond measure!

19
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:06,784
A leap greater
than we have ever taken!

20
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:23,158
Eren! I know
you're in there!

21
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:27,361
Snap out it!
Come on! We need you!

22
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:28,726
Get out of there!

23
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:33,677
What the hell?

24
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,743
You tellin' me the kid
was a regular Titan all along?

25
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,168
Our job now is to keep the others
off him until he can be recovered.

26
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:43,553
Whether we like it or not
he's still our last best chance.

27
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:45,731
We're not
about to abandon him.

28
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:48,169
We're
expendable. He isn't.

29
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:51,934
Wait.

30
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,099
That's right, of course.

31
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:00,482
Jean!

32
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:03,146
And why the hell
isn't he using his gear?

33
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,194
Hang on!

34
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:07,413
Don't tell
me it's not working!

35
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,637
I am not going to die today!

36
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:10,568
Mikasa!

37
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:12,489
Why'd the plan go belly-up?

38
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:13,785
We've
had to shift tac.

39
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,724
Right now all
we can do is protect him.

40
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,145
He's defenseless.

41
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,045
And there's...
There's just so many.

42
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,348
I don't know how much
longer we can keep this up!

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,372
From the back of the
head to the nape of the neck.

44
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:31,052
One meter high
and ten centimeters across!

45
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:35,405
Tell me, honestly.

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,113
Even though your first step beyond the wall meant
the difference between a warm hearth and hell on earth.

47
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:46,217
Why? Why throw caution to
the wind and venture outside?

48
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:50,290
What kind of question is that?

49
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:55,082
Because the world beyond
the wall is my birthright!

50
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:04,878
Eren!

51
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:57,264
Way to go. Draggin'
everybody down. Great job.

52
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:13,892
Maybe I won't die today.

53
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,822
What are we
going to do, Captain?

54
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,689
We're all that's left!

55
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,893
We fall back to the boulder!

56
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,406
Status report!

57
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:38,887
Five Titans
approaching from the gate, sir!

58
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:53,214
If I wait for the all-clear
I'll never make it out alive!

59
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:54,453
I've got to do something!

60
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:55,255
Jean!

61
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:57,989
His gear is busted!

62
00:05:58,426 --> 00:05:59,657
What's happening?

63
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,448
Damn it!

64
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:07,293
Ugh. Come on!
Work with me here!

65
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,026
Jean! Look out!

66
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:18,306
Marco! What the
hell are you doing?

67
00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:33,144
Crap. Why you
gotta go be the hero?

68
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,570
What? You've got to be kidding
me. Why is the trigger so stiff?

69
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:52,360
Jean!

70
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:57,667
Ow!

71
00:06:58,765 --> 00:06:59,967
Are you insane?

72
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:02,707
What are you waiting
for? Get out of there!

73
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,010
You idiots got a death wish?

74
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:38,418
Don't even start, man.

75
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:40,283
Yeah! You scared
the hell outta me!

76
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:43,868
I'll be damned.

77
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,405
Eren.

78
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:21,136
Mikasa!

79
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:24,053
Armin!

80
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,182
He came out of it somehow!

81
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:27,220
We're set!

82
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:29,814
He's determined to see the
mission through to the end!

83
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,358
As long as we've got his back
while he heads for the wall,

84
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,407
victory will be ours!

85
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:41,757
Defend him!

86
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:45,110
To the last man if
that's what it comes to!

87
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,993
Eren must reach the gate!

88
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,799
I don't want a single
Titan anywhere near him!

89
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:54,620
It looks like we're back on!
Focus on keeping Eren safe!

90
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,104
The both of you, go! I want
you with Eren immediately!

91
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:03,225
Hop to, soldiers!
That's an order!

92
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,726
Sir, yes sir!

93
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,942
Team Mitabi!
What are you doing?

94
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:14,230
The ugly sons-a-bitches
have lost all interest in us!

95
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,645
We need to get close enough
to grab their attention!

96
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,385
Hey big guy, over here!

97
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:23,946
You walkin' away? Maybe you want us to
shove our blades right up your smelly asses?

98
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:28,756
It worked!

99
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,079
We've got two of 'em!

100
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:33,322
Alright! Make a
B-line for the buildings!

101
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:34,593
They're insane!

102
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:37,190
Setting foot
down there is suicide!

103
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,257
If they get cornered somewhere
there'll be nothing they can do!

104
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:42,154
Yeah. I know.

105
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:44,913
Let's move out.

106
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,489
Everyone, follow Team Mitabi!

107
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,771
Come on. We need to go.

108
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:58,151
Over here! Come get me!

109
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:10,328
I feel like... Like I'm about
to buckle under the weight.

110
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,768
Mikasa. Armin.

111
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:16,669
What are you doing?

112
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:20,044
Get to the
rooftops! You'll be killed!

113
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:24,994
Hey! What's the
matter? Can't catch me?

114
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,496
You never
will with that attitude...

115
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:31,077
No! Damn it!

116
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,136
Mitabi!

117
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,284
Why? Why throw caution to
the wind and venture outside?

118
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,957
We're
born free. All of us.

119
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:54,123
Free.

120
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:57,957
Some don't believe it.

121
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,373
Some
try to take it away.

122
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:03,207
To hell with them!

123
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,540
Water like fire.

124
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,082
Mountains
of ice. The whole bit.

125
00:11:09,165 --> 00:11:11,123
Lay your eyes on that,

126
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:13,207
and you'll
know what freedom is.

127
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,707
That
it's worth fighting for!

128
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,957
Fight to live!
Risk it all for even

129
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,665
a glimmer
of real freedom!

130
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:26,665
It doesn't matter
what's waiting outside the gate,

131
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:28,582
or what comes in.

132
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,540
It doesn't matter
how cruel the world can be!

133
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:35,915
Or how unjust!

134
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:41,248
Fight! Fight! Fight!

135
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:42,707
Fight!

136
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,082
There's
still one ahead of us!

137
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,623
I'll take care of it!

138
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:56,748
Out of the way!

139
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:23,082
Go!

140
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:26,040
Fight!

141
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:56,290
Comrades. Your
sacrifices weren't in vain.

142
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,123
We have made history.

143
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:08,165
This day belongs to humanity!

144
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,748
Definitely
yellow smoke, sir.

145
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,540
Oh my god. The
mission was a success!

146
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,248
Deploy all reinforcements.

147
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:21,457
Bring
the Elite Squad home.

148
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:39,332
Mind the stragglers!

149
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,498
Ackerman! Pull back!

150
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:43,457
With all due respect,
I'm not withdrawing

151
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,457
until I recover Eren!

152
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:48,457
Armin! How is he?

153
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,332
Unconscious and
scorching to the touch!

154
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:52,790
There we go.

155
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:56,207
We have to
get him up the wall!

156
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:00,582
Uh oh, damn it.
He's fused to the carcass!

157
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,373
I can't work him free!

158
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:03,748
Then we cut.

159
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:06,582
Wait! We don't know
what that might do!

160
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,248
Eren! Armin!

161
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:42,998
Mikasa!

162
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,790
Who's that?

163
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,290
The wings... of freedom.

164
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:00,373
Pay attention, kiddos.

165
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:01,915
This is the part
where you explain to me

166
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:04,498
exactly what
it is I'm looking at.

167
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,207
Afterward, thanks
to the coordinated efforts of

168
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,623
the Scout Regiment and

169
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:15,915
the Garrison
Regiment's Corps of Engineers,

170
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,998
Wall Rose
once against stood as

171
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:20,582
a bulwark
against the Titan hordes.

172
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:26,040
It was a full day's
work dispatching the Titans

173
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:27,582
who
remained corralled within

174
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,998
Trost's
perimeter, during which

175
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:33,373
the wall-mounted
cannons fired ceaselessly.

176
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:37,707
Most of the
Titans nearest the wall

177
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,498
were wiped
out by explosive shells.

178
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:43,290
The few that remained
once the smoked cleared were

179
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:46,290
summarily cut
down by the Scout Regiment.

180
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:51,540
During the so-called
cleanup operation, two Titans,

181
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:53,957
a 4-meter and
a 7-meter, were captured

182
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,290
alive and
successfully restrained.

183
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,957
However...

184
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,957
All told, 207 people
were either dead or missing.

185
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,332
897 were
counted among the injured.

186
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:07,123
So while
the reclamation of Trost

187
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:09,957
represented the
first true victory for humanity

188
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,915
in its
fight against the Titans,

189
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:13,623
too many
soldiers had fallen

190
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,082
for
celebration to be in order.

191
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:38,582
I-Is...

192
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:48,832
Is that... Marco?

193
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:52,623
If you have
a name for this one,

194
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,415
it'd be
helpful to pass it along.

195
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:56,165
I wondered where he was.

196
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:00,748
But he's... He's not the
sort of guy... who, you know...

197
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,207
Marco. What happened?

198
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:09,498
No. Somebody
saw it. Had to've.

199
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:11,207
Somebody
knows how he went out.

200
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,707
I need his name.
We don't have time for this.

201
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:20,748
Please, son. You understand?

202
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,457
It's been two
days since we bored up

203
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,957
the hole in Wall
Rose. That's too long.

204
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,290
We're nowhere near
accounting for all the dead.

205
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,373
Unless these poor
souls are dealt with soon,

206
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,748
an epidemic is
likely to break out.

207
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:32,998
We're the
first line of defense

208
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:35,207
against
secondary disaster.

209
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,290
We'll lament the fallen
after we've done our jobs.

210
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,415
Is that understood?

211
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,082
He was a member
of the 104th Cadet Corps,

212
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:52,207
captain of
Squad 19. Marco Bodt.

213
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,832
Bodt. Duly noted, then.

214
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:56,665
Thank you, cadet.
I appreciate the help.

215
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,123
Continue.

216
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:12,207
Wha...
What is this thing?

217
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:15,582
Leftover Titan vomit.

218
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:17,498
Apparently they
don't have a digestive tract,

219
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:19,540
so once they've
had their fill of people,

220
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:22,498
they upchuck
them like hairballs.

221
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:24,415
That's sick.

222
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:29,123
Ugh. So gross. Can't
even make out a face.

223
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,415
I'm sorry.

224
00:18:37,623 --> 00:18:39,957
I'm sorry, I...

225
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,165
Contrition does them no good.

226
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:44,415
What they need
is a proper burial.

227
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:11,915
Any questions?

228
00:19:13,748 --> 00:19:15,207
That's Commander Erwin,

229
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,623
head of the Scout
Regiment's Task Force.

230
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:21,665
What's he doing
here? And Captain Levi?

231
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:25,373
Uh... I, uh...

232
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,748
Where...

233
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:30,707
Where am I?

234
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,207
I think it's obvious.
Let's just call it a dungeon.

235
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,165
You're currently in the
custody of the Military Police.

236
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,373
We were
granted permission to

237
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:44,873
see you only just now.

238
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:51,582
Where'd you get that?

239
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:55,207
Off of you. Don't
worry, you'll get it back.

240
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:57,582
Let's talk home.

241
00:19:57,665 --> 00:20:00,790
Specifically the good doctor's
cellar back in Shiganshina.

242
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:03,290
Pretty big secret
in there, right?

243
00:20:03,373 --> 00:20:04,915
About the Titans?

244
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:09,498
Yeah. I think so.
That's what Dad said anyway.

245
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:11,748
Must suck having your
dad and your memory

246
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:13,873
MIA at the same time.

247
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:16,623
Unless, of course,
that's just a cover story.

248
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:19,582
Enough. We've been
over this already.

249
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:22,457
We know he has
no reason to lie.

250
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,582
And that's all we know.

251
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:26,373
How 'bout you shed a little
light on things for me

252
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:28,248
by telling us your intentions.

253
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:31,915
M... My what?
What do you mean?

254
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:35,498
Here's the lay
of the land, my friend.

255
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,373
If we want to pay
your dad's cellar a visit,

256
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:40,373
we have to venture
back into Shiganshina.

257
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:42,582
Sealing the breach there
as we did in Trost would be

258
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:45,207
the smart way to
go about it, don't you think?

259
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:48,498
Naturally, we'll
need your special powers.

260
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,957
Any way you slice it,
a Titan's deciding our fate.

261
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,832
It's been
conjectured that the Colossal

262
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:57,415
and the Armored Titan

263
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:59,707
are more or
less the same as you.

264
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,457
It's why I ask your intentions.

265
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,415
They could be the key to
turning the tide forever.

266
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:09,582
You could save us.

267
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,623
I don't know what I am.

268
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:18,665
No. This is over.

269
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:21,457
I'm going
to put a stop to this!

270
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:24,457
I'll kill them
with my bare hands!

271
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,582
C'mon. It's an easy
question. So answer it.

272
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:30,415
What the hell
is it you wanna do?

273
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:37,498
I want to become a
member of the Scouts

274
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:40,915
and slaughter every
Titan that crosses my path!

275
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,915
Huh. Well played.

276
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:53,665
Alright, then. I'll
take responsibility for him.

277
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:56,457
Let the higher-ups
know what's going on.

278
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,790
Not that I implicitly
trust him, of course.

279
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:00,665
It's more a matter
of me trusting myself

280
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:01,915
to deal with him.

281
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:03,998
Kill him, if I have to.

282
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:06,415
The big wigs aren't
likely to raise a stink.

283
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:09,748
My record more than speaks
for itself, I'm pretty sure.

284
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:11,373
Good news, Jaeger.

285
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:14,415
You're now officially
a member of the Scouts.

286
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,915
A special court marshal.

287
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:58,207
Eren is released
from his underground cell

288
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,332
only to be
dragged before a tribunal of

289
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:02,998
the military's
highest ranking officials.

290
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,707
The
issue being decided?

291
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,123
Whether
he lives or dies.
