1
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:07,072
They first appeared over a hundred years ago.

2
00:00:07,488 --> 00:00:11,233
Giant, humanoid creatures with a taste for our blood.

3
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:20,072
The brute strength of these aberrations
trumped an average person's many times over.

4
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:24,321
We were shoved to the brink
of extinction almost overnight.

5
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:33,283
The survivors erected Walls Maria, Rose, and Sina;

6
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:38,931
withdrawing behind them in frightened huddles
for what was to be a century of uneasy peace.

7
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:47,713
In the year 845, two terrifying new breeds of
Titan appeared: the Colossal and the Armored,

8
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:52,306
barreling through the outer walls as if
wholesale destruction was child's play.

9
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,226
The territory couched within the
circle of Wall Maria was abandoned.

10
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:03,172
Twenty percent of the human race perished.

11
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:05,412
As the Titan onslaught advanced,

12
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:08,734
our only choice was to withdrawal behind Wall Rose.

13
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:15,241
In the year 850, the Colossal appeared once again,

14
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:18,751
breaching the wall bordering Trost before disappearing.

15
00:01:19,198 --> 00:01:21,851
The Titans flooded in through the broken gate.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,109
Eren! No!

17
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:37,557
Two hours later, the evacuation
of the entire populace was complete.

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,097
As a result,

19
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:41,871
no civilians were lost to the Titans.

20
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:48,211
The same cannot be said for the countless
soldiers who perished, buying the people time.

21
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:51,668
Eren. As long as you're part of my life,

22
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,891
I can fight to the bitter end.

23
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,412
Captain, please wait!

24
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:39,670
There's only a handful of us left, sir.

25
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:43,420
If the Titans were to attack here in force, we
wouldn't have a chance in hell of holding them off!

26
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,748
Please, sir. We need you here!

27
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:49,157
Out of my way, soldier. We have to get going.

28
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:52,104
My expertise is needed to help direct the reinforcements.

29
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,131
Behind the safety of the inner gate. Am I right?

30
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,048
Just what the hell are you implying?

31
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,331
They need my help reorganizing.

32
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,931
Or would you rather us be overwhelmed
due to a logistical nightmare!

33
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:07,381
But... But sir! If we lose those supplies...

34
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:08,755
That's enough!

35
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,265
Question my orders again, or delay me in my duties,

36
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:15,644
and I'll run your treasonous hide straight through!

37
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:31,573
Why isn't anyone going over the wall?

38
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,861
They must have heard the withdrawal signal.

39
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:54,446
It's over. All over. We're doomed.

40
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,031
There!

41
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,509
C'mon now. That musket's not enough to stop them.

42
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:11,980
Huh?

43
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:21,196
Hey, Jean. What're we gonna do?

44
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,326
We can't do anything.

45
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:26,019
They finally gave us the order to withdraw.

46
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,578
And we were all out of gas, of course.

47
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:31,839
I can't believe this is how it's going to end.

48
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:34,162
Because of those damned cowards!

49
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:39,868
Y'mean the supply depot? What is going on? Where are they?

50
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,592
They all lost their will to fight.

51
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:44,712
And I can understand why.

52
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:47,623
But they abandoned their duty to supply us,

53
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,940
barricading themselves inside HQ.

54
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:54,639
And of course, Titans have swarmed the place,
which means we can't get the gas ourselves.

55
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,780
Then why're we waitin'? We gotta go.

56
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:59,197
Start thinning their numbers so we have a chance!

57
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:01,556
Sitting here on this roof is totally pointless!

58
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,091
Eventually the Titans are gonna come for us.

59
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,264
We don't have much gas left.

60
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:08,674
We'll just waste what little we've got if we try to run.

61
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,813
And without our mobility, we're completely screwed!

62
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:15,669
You're using your head for once, Conny. Nice going.

63
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,403
But I'm just not sure if we've got the
numbers needed to pull this thing off.

64
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:23,627
The veterans in the Vanguard force have all been killed.

65
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,688
How, exactly, do a bunch of rookies
pull off a suicide mission like this?

66
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:33,646
I mean, let's assume half of our
force even survives the initial assault.

67
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:40,334
Then what? The supply room is probably crawling
with Titans in the three or four meter range.

68
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:43,162
I don't see us accomplishing much in there.

69
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:46,898
It's hopeless.

70
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,966
God, what a dull life this turned out to be.

71
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:53,772
I never even got to tell her just how I feel.

72
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:56,663
C'mon guys, we can do it!

73
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:58,483
Right? Let's go.

74
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:00,469
If we all work together, we can make this happen,

75
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:01,760
I know we can!

76
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:03,756
All right? I'll take the lead.

77
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,899
Armin! It's time to go.

78
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:26,259
Reiner. Do we move out?

79
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:29,190
Not yet. We have to let them gather up first.

80
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:31,128
It's no use.

81
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:33,535
There's too many of them.

82
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:36,954
I don't think any of us are going to survive this.

83
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:40,583
I've come to accept my pending demise.

84
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:44,644
I just... wanted my death to mean something.

85
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,481
Mikasa! Weren't you with the rearguard?

86
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:49,790
Annie!

87
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,993
I know how bad things have gotten. It's selfish.

88
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:56,162
Putting personal matters in the forefront,

89
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,370
but have you seen Eren's squad?

90
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:01,706
Some squads made it back. But I don't know about Eren's.

91
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,020
We found Armin, he's over there.

92
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,078
Armin!

93
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:13,936
Mikasa! I can't. How do I tell her what happened to Eren?

94
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:16,804
I survived, and it means nothing.

95
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:19,466
I'm so useless!

96
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:23,039
I wish I had died with him instead!

97
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:28,768
Armin. Are you okay? You're not hurt, are you?

98
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:36,513
Where is Eren?

99
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,327
Armin?

100
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:59,427
They were... The cadets of Squad 34. Thomas Wagner.

101
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:06,514
Nack Tierce. Milieus Zeremski. Mina Carolina.

102
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,477
Eren Jaeger!

103
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:13,062
These brave five upheld their duties.

104
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,431
They died valiantly on the field of battle!

105
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:21,213
Please, no.

106
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:25,677
His whole squad was wiped out?

107
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,856
The same will happen to us if
we try to take on those Titans.

108
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:32,860
I'm so sorry, Mikasa!

109
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:36,117
It should have been me that died, not Eren!

110
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:43,298
I... I couldn't do a thing! I'm worthless.

111
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,382
Armin.

112
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:56,200
Calm yourself. We haven't got time
for you to get emotional right now.

113
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:57,599
Huh?

114
00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:59,696
On your feet.

115
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:05,004
Marco. If we eliminate or bypass the Titans at HQ,

116
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:08,757
we can there refuel our gear,
allowing us to get back over the wall.

117
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,347
Is that assessment correct?

118
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,408
Well... Uh yeah I guess so, sure.

119
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,620
But there's just too many of them
out there. Even with you on point.

120
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:16,842
I can do it.

121
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:17,691
What?

122
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:20,927
I'm strong. Real strong.

123
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,524
None of you come close. You hear me?

124
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,296
I am a warrior.

125
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:30,684
Know this. I have the power to slay
all of the Titans that block our path!

126
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:33,201
Even if I have to do it alone.

127
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:40,193
As far as I'm concerned, I am surrounded
by a bunch of unskilled, cowardly worms.

128
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:46,881
You dissappoint me. You can just sit here and
twiddle your thumbs, and watch how it's done!

129
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:50,333
Wait, Mikasa. Are you out of your mind? That's crazy!

130
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:53,619
You can't be serious! Trying to take them out by yourself?

131
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:55,304
There's no way you can hope to beat them!

132
00:10:55,351 --> 00:11:00,018
If I can't beat them, then I die. But, if I win, I live.

133
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:02,756
And the only way to win is to fight!

134
00:11:04,627 --> 00:11:05,029
Hey!

135
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,926
You know, I was expecting something more motivational.

136
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,858
Your way with words was kind of a let down.

137
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,971
I blame everything about this on you, Eren!

138
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,664
Hey! Don't just stand there!

139
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,956
We weren't taught to let our comrades fight alone!

140
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,973
'Less you are a coward, in which case stay out of my way!

141
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:29,913
Never expected that from him.

142
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,027
Hey! Seriously? C'mon, you bunch of chickens!

143
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:42,704
They're nuts!

144
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,699
Damn it. All right, let's go!

145
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:59,087
Hurry up! Follow Mikasa! Avoid fighting, if you can.

146
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,749
And get to HQ before you run out of gas!

147
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:05,364
Whoa, Mikasa is a badass!

148
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,546
How is she going so fast?

149
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:11,042
No! Mikasa's using too much gas!

150
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:13,109
She could run out at any second!

151
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:15,517
It doesn't matter how skilled she is.

152
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,377
Once we lose mobility, we're as good as dead!

153
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:28,102
I see through the veil of her composure.

154
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,715
She's letting adrenaline distract her from grief!

155
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,446
At any time, she could...

156
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:39,382
Mikasa!

157
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:40,986
Damn!

158
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:45,431
Jean! You lead the rest to HQ! I'm going after Armin!

159
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,973
I'll go with you!

160
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,039
Don't be stupid! There are still Titans everywhere!

161
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:51,085
You've gotta help the others!

162
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:08,530
It happened. Why this again?

163
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:11,305
I've lost my family.

164
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:22,230
Why? Wasn't the first time enough?

165
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:24,471
It's all over.

166
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,840
Nothing left for them to take from me.

167
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:51,038
It's no use. We're not getting anywhere near Headquarters.

168
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,950
Unless, of course, we don't mind dying.

169
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:01,661
Shit! He's out of gas!

170
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,490
Stay back!

171
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:07,473
Tom! I'll save you!

172
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,567
No, wait!

173
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:09,876
I'm comin'!

174
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,922
Stop it!

175
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:25,646
Why couldn't I stop them?

176
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:33,186
Why didn't I stop them? If I'd kept us all together,

177
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:35,347
this never would have happened!

178
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,043
I wasn't meant to lead.

179
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:47,193
I'm the last person that should've been given the reigns!

180
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,305
No!

181
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:51,880
I hope you choke on me, you bastard!

182
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,472
No! No!

183
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:10,457
This world is cruel.

184
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,796
But it's also... It's also beautiful.

185
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:23,723
It was a good life.

186
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,317
Why?

187
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:00,502
I'd already given up.

188
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:11,158
So why... Why am I struggling?

189
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,789
Why do I keep getting up?

190
00:16:23,498 --> 00:16:25,809
Why am I still fighting?

191
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,059
I mean, I've lost any reason to live.

192
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:33,466
What keeps pushing me?

193
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,932
Fight!

194
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,858
Fight! Fight!

195
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,344
Eren.

196
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:50,746
Kill or be killed!

197
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,228
The only way to live is to fight!

198
00:16:55,704 --> 00:17:00,337
I'm so sorry, Eren. I'm through giving up.

199
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:06,564
I'll never give up again.

200
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:13,446
Because if I die, these memories of you die with me.

201
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:18,228
That's why I'll do whatever it takes to win!

202
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:19,999
Whatever it takes to live!

203
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,373
What was that?

204
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:05,359
That Titan. He's... killing...

205
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:07,361
He's killing the other one.

206
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,212
Please be all right. I'm coming for you!

207
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:39,938
There she is!

208
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:52,934
Mikasa! Are you okay?

209
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:55,039
Are you guys all right?

210
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:55,606
Yeah.

211
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:57,455
Then we better get outta here!

212
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:03,533
Crap. Two fifteen-meter Titans!

213
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:05,806
No. That one's different.

214
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,345
How?

215
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:22,928
Huh?

216
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:56,178
It... It just finished it off.

217
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:58,610
He knew exactly where the weak spot was!

218
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,223
C'mon guys, time to split!

219
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,029
Last thing we need is him coming our way!

220
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:04,439
No. He has no reaction to us.

221
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,387
Any other Titan would've been on top of us by now!

222
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:11,614
It seemed to understand the skill of hand-to-hand combat.

223
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:13,274
What is that thing?

224
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:15,569
Just chalk it up as another Abnormal!

225
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:18,438
Hell, they're always an unpleasant surprise, right?

226
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,719
Forget about it. Let's just get outta here!

227
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:23,826
Wait a minute, hold on. Mikasa's tanks are empty!

228
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,288
Huh? What are we gonna do?

229
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,544
We can't clear HQ without your help!

230
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:30,746
There's only one thing to do.

231
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:33,376
I know there isn't very much left in them,

232
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,623
but it's better than your empty ones.

233
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:36,554
Armin!

234
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:38,444
This is our only choice!

235
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:42,416
It'll be a complete waste if I keep them. But...

236
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,198
Use this gas more sparingly.

237
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:48,629
Everyone's lives are riding on you.

238
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,355
What have I done?

239
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:56,552
I led the attack without any
regard for their lives at all.

240
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:59,656
I was even reckless with my own life.

241
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:02,439
I lost track of what you taught me.

242
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:05,632
Oh, Eren. I'm so ashamed.

243
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:07,745
Eren.

244
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:12,389
There! Got it! The ODM gear's functional.

245
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,054
And I restocked your blades.

246
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:17,534
Just... Just leave me this one, okay?

247
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:23,356
It's just that, I would rather
this be my end, not being eaten alive.

248
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:30,919
Why'd you...?

249
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:33,239
Armin.

250
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,800
I will not leave you behind.

251
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,846
What was he?

252
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:53,062
Are there any more like him?

253
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,932
I've never heard of a Titan killing another Titan.

254
00:21:57,412 --> 00:21:58,933
No one has.

255
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,541
But it struck a chord in me.

256
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:08,673
Something so familiar. So primal.

257
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:15,760
I bore witness to the manifestation of humanity's rage.

258
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:56,793
A Titan killing a Titan.

259
00:23:57,514 --> 00:24:02,904
The very sight of it in action leaves the
104th Cadet Corps Class completely speechless.

260
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:07,142
However, the cadets have much more in store for them.
