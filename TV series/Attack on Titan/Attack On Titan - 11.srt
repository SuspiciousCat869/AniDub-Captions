1
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:07,388
Trost District. Year 850.

2
00:00:07,793 --> 00:00:09,852
Under threat from his own regiment,

3
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:12,854
Eren Jaeger invokes his ability to transform,

4
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:14,784
saving Mikasa and Armin,

5
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:18,330
but striking fear into the hearts of his fellow soldiers.

6
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:21,935
I've always been one of you.

7
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:23,554
I'm human!

8
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,703
Eren is not a foe of humanity!

9
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:32,063
For humanity's glory, in what
little time I have left to live,

10
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:36,012
I will advocate his strategic value!

11
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,331
That brave stand went unheeded,
but for the intervention of one man.

12
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,180
Dot Pyxis.

13
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:48,756
The highest ranking officer in the Southern Territory.

14
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,244
Calm yourself.

15
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:57,226
Surely, sir, we can at least do these
young soldiers the favor of hearing them out.

16
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:38,856
I'll do it! I don't know if I can, but...

17
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:42,057
I will. I swear!

18
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:49,645
Excellently said. You have the heart of a lion.

19
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:55,905
Staff officers, hup! We have a plan to flesh out!

20
00:02:56,508 --> 00:03:01,086
Wait, we...? We can't actually be moving
forward with this as our linchpin strategy.

21
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:02,984
It was just something I tossed out there.

22
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,875
I was thinking the same thing.

23
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:08,308
'Cept, he seems like a guy who knows what he's doing.

24
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,392
Has it all under control,

25
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,505
like we can't see the forest for the
trees, but he's got a bird's eye view.

26
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,688
Y'think so?

27
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:16,209
I do.

28
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:20,629
Either way, though, we've got a whole other problem
to address before we can get your plan off the ground.

29
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,997
And my gut tells me that the
Commander's keenly aware of it.

30
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:25,727
Which would be?

31
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:29,063
Titans aren't our only foe.

32
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:31,592
Look sharp, soldiers.

33
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:39,022
The fate of mankind rests on your shoulders.

34
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,570
Retake Trost, are they kidding?

35
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:59,328
Someone up top's lost their marbles;
how'd they expect us to shore up the hole?

36
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:01,206
Is the brass that out of touch?

37
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:02,819
It's a damn suicide mission!

38
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,280
Lost cause, no doubt.

39
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:07,091
Defending Wall Rose is the only real option here.

40
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:10,754
Jackasses. Some bureaucrat's
pushing this through for the glory.

41
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,155
I can't... I can't go back.

42
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:19,035
We'll die! We're all gonna die!

43
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:20,663
I just want to see my family!

44
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,298
What the hell, Daz? Calm down!

45
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:24,436
Stop shrieking like a sniveling coward!

46
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:27,511
Are you tryin' to give me the
impression you're a liability?

47
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:32,644
Sir, please! Look at us. We're being marched
to an early grave like lambs to the slaughter!

48
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:36,622
You too good to sacrifice yourself
for the good of humanity, soldier?

49
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:40,913
Or do you prefer I cut you down right
now as an example to your comrades?

50
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:46,148
Do what you gotta do. I'll take it over
being fed to a Titan like human candy any day!

51
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:47,841
Get a hold of yourself!

52
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:50,934
Let go of me! Let go!

53
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:54,261
I'm not going back to that nightmare!

54
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,289
You hear that?

55
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,320
Not gonna lie, he's got a point.

56
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:01,150
So, uh... Who do you think's going
to have a nervous breakdown next?

57
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:04,137
I dunno. But Trost isn't the way I want to go.

58
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:04,939
Come again?

59
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,585
Uh. I was only kidding around, sir!

60
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:08,450
Speak up!

61
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:09,513
What?

62
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,854
At the top of your lungs. Make
as much noise as you can, cadet.

63
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:17,861
You think everyone else doesn't feel the
same way about this stupid idea as you do?

64
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:20,458
Now stir up a damn distraction so I can get out of here!

65
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:23,038
And where exactly to you think "out of here" is?

66
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,689
Look man, I just want to see my daughter!

67
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,028
We're all dead anyway, right?

68
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:35,624
It's thought by many that before the
Titans held sway, mankind consisted of scores

69
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,737
of different races, different creeds;

70
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:40,818
all scratching and biting at each other for blood.

71
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:43,884
It's not difficult to believe that second part.

72
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:48,627
Some wise man or other is reputed to have
said, though understand I'm paraphrasing here,

73
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:52,569
that humanity required an enemy
greater than itself just to survive.

74
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,459
What do you suppose he could have meant?

75
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:57,866
This is the first time I've ever heard it, sir.

76
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:01,286
I guess... he thought we'd all join forces?

77
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:02,757
Some wise man.

78
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:08,323
I like the way your mind works. You're
almost as twisted and cynical as me.

79
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:12,209
Well, it's obvious to me the guy didn't
have a clue what he was talking about.

80
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:17,010
C'mon. Here we are with an enemy "greater
than ourselves" bearing down and look at us.

81
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:20,008
Exactly. If our species doesn't pull it together soon,

82
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:23,606
Titans will be merely the instruments
of our demise, not the cause.

83
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:31,405
Eren?

84
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,143
Well I'll be damned.

85
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:38,498
Wait, what? Is he?

86
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,740
That little punk is telling me to get back to work.

87
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:45,441
At least I can assume Mikasa and Armin are alright,

88
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:48,691
judging by his attitude. Still, though.

89
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:51,741
Why in god's name is he with the Commander?

90
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:00,051
Care for a swig?

91
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:02,195
Uh... yes, sir.

92
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:12,463
If you're gonna kill me,

93
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,449
just do it and get it over with!

94
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:16,689
Shut up! Don't think I won't!

95
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:27,047
Attention!

96
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:36,521
Take note. The blueprint of the
Trost Recovery Operation is this.

97
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,594
Our primary objective is to reseal the hole.

98
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,449
Yes, you heard right.

99
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:44,187
What's more, it will be done manually.

100
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,205
What?

101
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:52,116
That's impossible. We just don't have the tech.

102
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,967
As for how the task will be done,

103
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,184
that's where this fellow comes in.

104
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:01,632
Allow me to introduce Cadet Eren Jaeger.

105
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,407
Wha... What the hell?

106
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,799
Don't let appearances deceive you.

107
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,232
This young man is in fact the
successful product of cutting-edge science.

108
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,193
Fantastic as this may sound,

109
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:19,151
Cadet Jaeger possesses the ability to
fabricate and control a Titan body, at will.

110
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:23,905
Uh. Somebody tell me the Commander's off his rocker,

111
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:26,311
'cause otherwise I'm just too thick to get what he means.

112
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:28,671
Will you just shut up and pay attention? Idiot.

113
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,356
Recall the massive boulder roughly a league from the gate.

114
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:36,829
Having assumed Titan form, Cadet Jaeger
will hoist said boulder on his back,

115
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:39,045
schlep it to the hole, and voila!

116
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,603
And this is where you all come in.

117
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:44,353
Your job will be to defend him.

118
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:47,698
Yes. Defend a Titan against his own kind.

119
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:50,604
What do you mean we don't actually need to fight them?

120
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:52,109
There's an easier way.

121
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,161
Sorry, I know it's not my place
to interrupt. I mean no disrespect.

122
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:57,464
It's alright. Just go on with what you were saying.

123
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,101
Right. Thank you, sir.

124
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:03,988
See, whatever else is going on around them,
Titans are generally drawn to large groups of people.

125
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:06,640
If enough of us collected in
the corner away from the breach,

126
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:08,728
we could lure the Titans out of Eren's path.

127
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:10,978
He could be discrete about moving the boulder.

128
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:14,012
He also won't have to slow his pace
while we fight the others off of him.

129
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,378
And since the Titans will all be in one area,

130
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:20,257
we can pick them off via cannon fire
without incurring causalities of our own.

131
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:23,666
Now I'm not suggesting we leave Eren defenseless.

132
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:24,819
That'd be too risky.

133
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:28,067
We'll need a modest band of
Elites to act as his bodyguards.

134
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,174
There's no way of knowing how many Titans might
come through the hole while he's trying to patch it up.

135
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:34,987
His security detail will need to be able to handle them.

136
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:38,880
Easy enough, I think. We can retool the plan around that.

137
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,787
The thing is, we're making a huge assumption here.

138
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:45,507
Namely that Eren even in full-on Titan
mode is strong enough to move the rock.

139
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:50,149
I mean, to be perfectly honest, there's
very little reason for us to suppose he can.

140
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,762
I have my doubts. Serious ones.

141
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:55,836
As do I. Sending people to their doom on a whim

142
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,855
isn't a tactic I'm fond of.

143
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,134
Uncertainty's killed too many already.

144
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:03,176
But the Commander's right. We must do this.

145
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:06,066
Agreed. We're working against the clock here.

146
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,872
Titans are still lumbering into Trost as we speak.

147
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,925
There already may be more than we can handle, frankly.

148
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:16,125
The longer we wait, the worse
our chances of success become.

149
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:21,100
And it goes without saying, the better our chances
they'll bust through Wall Rose and wreak untold havoc.

150
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,180
There's something else, too.

151
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:27,749
Even the bravest of us can't indefinitely bottle our fear.

152
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:29,664
Not before something gives.

153
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,762
The kid can lift a rock that big?

154
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:39,255
Is this real? Is he saying we finally have an advantage?

155
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:44,276
They're lying! I'm not gonna be drawn
into sacrificing myself for this crap!

156
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:46,978
We're just disposable tools to you people!

157
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,640
You expect us to live and die by
whatever the hell comes out of your mouth!

158
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,793
You mean he's a human weapon?

159
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,253
C'mon. They're obviously full of it.

160
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,287
We're being played.

161
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:58,425
This is not how I'm goin' out.
Good luck to the rest of ya.

162
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,316
I'm out of here!

163
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,488
Me too!

164
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:06,066
Yeah, screw a bunch of this!

165
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:09,564
So help me god, I'll execute you on the spot!

166
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,732
To hell with you!

167
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,884
My family gets the time I have left!

168
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,227
This is getting out of hand.

169
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:18,199
I know. If we don't act now,
the whole thing'll break down.

170
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:21,849
Traitors! I'll kill you where you stand!

171
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,603
Desertion is answered by death!

172
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:31,426
Anyone wishing to leave will by my
personal order not be charged with treason!

173
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:38,067
Those who have seen a Titan first hand will
not be expected to revisit such horror again.

174
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:42,732
Whomever this applies to, you may leave with my blessing.

175
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:48,769
Additionally, anyone with family or loved ones
they would spare from the same trauma may also leave.

176
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:51,982
The crown will continue to recognize your service.

177
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,744
Thank you and good luck!

178
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,092
Daddy!

179
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,780
I couldn't live with myself.

180
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,472
My daughter's my all.

181
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:15,423
Daddy's coming, sweetheart. Don't you worry.

182
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:19,316
Now, think back four years ago.

183
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:22,942
Namely, the operation to retake Wall Maria.

184
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:27,136
I bring it up because you all deserve
to have your suspicions confirmed.

185
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,132
Officially, we labeled it reconnaissance.

186
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,317
But in fact, as most of you probably
know, it was little more than a purge;

187
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:37,717
a thinly disguised exercise in population control.

188
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:40,768
We knew this in our hearts, of course we did.

189
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,628
Yet we turned a blind eye.

190
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:48,316
We supported the state-sponsored myth because the
deaths of our fellow human beings allowed us to survive.

191
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:49,673
Pure and simple.

192
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:56,076
The guilt is ours. We share the blame. All of us.

193
00:12:56,552 --> 00:13:01,241
The citizens of Wall Maria sustained themselves
on the wholesale slaughter of the refugees

194
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:03,101
who'd flown to us for help.

195
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:05,724
But turnabout is fair play, is it not?

196
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:11,491
If Wall Maria succumbs, the population
will fall by a whole other order of magnitude!

197
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:16,862
The lands comprising Wall Sina wouldn't
support half the people now living.

198
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,112
If we're wiped off the face of the earth,
the culprits will not have been the Titans,

199
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:23,509
let me assure you.

200
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:28,166
No, no. We'll have done it to ourselves.

201
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,186
If the line isn't drawn now, it won't be drawn at all.

202
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:35,087
If we must die...

203
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:37,938
let us die here!

204
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:50,754
I don't know if I'll actually be strong enough
in Titan form to lift that rock in the first place.

205
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,972
But, I'm sure as hell going to try.

206
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:56,426
Maybe this is naïve.

207
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:58,040
Maybe we're running on false hope,

208
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:00,645
but so what? I have to power through.

209
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,131
For them. For all of us.

210
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:10,251
My role... No. My duty, is to make false hope real.

211
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,637
Good, you're all here.

212
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,492
You have one mission and one mission only.

213
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,511
Protect Eren Jaeger.

214
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,531
Any risks associated with this
operation are yours to eliminate.

215
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:40,536
Which, I'm sure you'll surmise, means
out of everyone, your jobs are the worst.

216
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:43,125
Our success or failure will depend on you.

217
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,816
In fact, it's safe to say the fate
of mankind will reflect your own.

218
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:49,602
Sir. May I ask something?

219
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:50,967
Of course.

220
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,235
Are you certain about this?

221
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:54,721
Pinning our hopes on Jaeger, I mean.

222
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,205
Rico, don't.

223
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,834
I'm sorry. I assume we all have our doubts.

224
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:03,079
Sir, please. With all due respect, the
kid's abilities are an unknown quantity;

225
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:05,469
we don't have the first idea what he will or won't do.

226
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:08,393
If he can't lift the rock, or worse, he goes rogue,

227
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:10,673
a lot of lives will have been lost for nothing.

228
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:16,471
You make a good point. Perhaps we ought to
just give ourselves up to the Titans willingly.

229
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:20,460
Personally, the idea makes me sick.

230
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:22,332
I'm a sore loser.

231
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:28,343
You'd think I'd be used to it. I've been
stuck on the losing side since day one.

232
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:33,149
I'm a stubborn old fool, though.

233
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,279
Just once I'd like to know what victory feels like.

234
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:38,605
Even if I have to resort to extreme measures.

235
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:39,813
Naturally, sir!

236
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,181
I'm sure we all feel the same way!

237
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:44,836
Then I suppose we'll just have to wait and see.

238
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,666
The boy's abilities may be an
"unknown quantity," I'll give you that...

239
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:52,806
But I'll take it over the known quantity of our options.

240
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:58,080
Sir. It's time to get the decoy operation on its feet.

241
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:01,933
Ian Dietrich.

242
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,974
Rico Brzenska.

243
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,730
Mitabi Jarnach.

244
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,925
You are the Garrison Regiment's best and brightest.

245
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:13,381
Win this one for humanity.

246
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:14,732
Sir!

247
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:18,172
Excellent. Ian, I'm assigning you squad leader.

248
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:20,827
On-site contingencies will be yours to deal with.

249
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:23,860
Uh. But, sir. That is...

250
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,833
I have no objections.

251
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:26,864
Neither do I.

252
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,583
Please, sir. I'm not competent enough.

253
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:30,609
Now, now.

254
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,927
You appreciate alcohol, do you not?

255
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:34,752
Sir?

256
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,819
You know a good vintage.

257
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,742
You know a shoddy one, as well.

258
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,260
So, there it is.

259
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:43,425
Sir!

260
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,844
I'm so sorry, Eren.

261
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,881
I was just talking out of my head.

262
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:52,416
It wasn't my intention for you to be pulled into all this.

263
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:56,998
Stop apologizing. The fact is you
have a gift for strategy and you know it.

264
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,818
I believe in you, Armin.

265
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:00,900
Eren. I really think I should...

266
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:02,504
You're not coming with me.

267
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:05,954
You're on the decoy squad. Period.

268
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:08,622
No way! I'm not leaving you alone!

269
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,107
I won't take another chance...

270
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:11,529
Knock it the hell off!

271
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,549
Get it through your head that I'm not your responsibility!

272
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:16,001
You're not my mother!

273
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,799
Ackerman.

274
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:23,596
I want you on the squad that'll
be providing Jaeger with backup.

275
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,513
We'll need your skill.

276
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,284
Hop to. Let's get this started.

277
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,697
See ya, Armin. Don't die on me, okay?

278
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:36,635
Yeah. You either.

279
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:52,328
Let's get this straight right now.

280
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:55,750
Whatever you are, all I care about
is you getting that rock in place.

281
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:57,133
Can we count on you?

282
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:59,252
Yes, sir! I won't let you down.

283
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:02,696
You're absolutely sure you're gonna be alright to do this?

284
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:03,649
I got it!

285
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:05,960
Seriously?

286
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,789
How many times you want me to say it?

287
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:10,354
You just go do your job and I'll do mine.

288
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:12,580
Look, now's not the time to be playing house.

289
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:14,607
Come on, it isn't like that.

290
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,258
I'm gonna say what we're all thinkin' here.

291
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:20,214
The fact the fate of mankind depends on a
little brat like you doesn't make me hopeful.

292
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:23,170
All of you, stop it, right now!

293
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:25,434
We're about to be in range of the giant boulder!

294
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,747
I'm not seeing any Titans nearby.

295
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,535
The decoy strategy must be doing the trick.

296
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,891
Don't be a hero!

297
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,864
Just focus on luring the Titans to our corner of town!

298
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:41,260
If you don't need to, don't engage!

299
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:45,606
Something I want you to be aware of, Jaeger.

300
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:47,776
Make no mistake.

301
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:51,341
More than a few of our comrades are
going to die today trying to pull this off.

302
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:53,317
Their blood's on your hands.

303
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:59,590
I'm talking friends. Captains. Lieutenants. Peons.

304
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:02,798
Yes, they are soldiers. They are prepared to die.

305
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:08,081
But remember, every one of
them is a flesh and blood person.

306
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,595
Steady.

307
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:18,059
Hold position.

308
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:20,395
Get ready.

309
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:23,844
Scatter!

310
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:29,127
Every one of them has dreams. Hopes. Fears.

311
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:31,220
Every one of them has a name.

312
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:36,183
Alyosha. Dominic. Fine. Isabel.

313
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:39,982
Ludwig. Martina. Guido. Hans.

314
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:42,516
They're not pawns. They're people.

315
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:47,093
Some have been living together
like family since their cadet years.

316
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:49,603
This may well be the end of them.

317
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,235
Whole families snuffed out in a moment.

318
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:56,422
Whatever you think your mission is, Jaeger,

319
00:19:56,525 --> 00:20:01,180
your first and foremost concern today is
making sure their deaths mean something.

320
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:05,694
Whatever happens, you keep that lodged in your mind.

321
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:08,524
Take everything that comes with deadly seriousness.

322
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:10,038
Right!

323
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,537
This is happening. I'm going to do this.

324
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:23,665
Not once in this century of terror
has mankind risen above the Titans.

325
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:29,766
Their every craven, bloodthirsty advance
has left a wake of inestimable loss for us;

326
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:32,443
lives taken, territory abandoned.

327
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,743
However, should we succeed, we'll make history!

328
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:38,905
Today is the day.

329
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:42,916
Lands taken by our greatest enemy will be reclaimed!

330
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:45,427
This is the place! Let's do it!

331
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,096
For the first time, we will know what it means not to run,

332
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:52,632
but to meet the Titans head on and win!

333
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,449
We've got green smoke, sir.

334
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:08,730
The Elite Squad has commenced the operation in earnest.

335
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,807
Now, it may seem an insignificant plot of land

336
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:17,343
compared to the vast tracts
of former glory long abandoned.

337
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:20,011
But as a symbol. As an idea.

338
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:24,999
Trost regained shall stand as a
reclamation of pride and hope beyond measure!

339
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:27,638
A leap greater than we have ever taken!

340
00:21:57,302 --> 00:21:59,170
Granted, in terms of proportion,

341
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,396
it's not easy to see how he'll manage to lift it.

342
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:06,545
But in terms of sheer will, he's got this.

343
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:08,220
I know he does.

344
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,808
Eren?

345
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:57,483
The Trost Recovery Operation has begun.

346
00:23:57,863 --> 00:24:00,302
As his comrades fall by the dozens,

347
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:03,063
Eren's rampage goes horribly awry.

348
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:06,912
But just as it seems, the
operation has ended in failure...
