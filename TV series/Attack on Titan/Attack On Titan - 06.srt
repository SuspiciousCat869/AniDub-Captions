1
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:41,530
Wake up! Armin! Hey!

2
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:43,500
Can you hear me? C'mon!

3
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:47,736
Snap out of it! I need you to talk to me! Say something!

4
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,220
There you are. You with me now?

5
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:54,627
What's going on? Where's your squad?

6
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:55,767
Squad?

7
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:58,100
Alright, let's get you on your feet.

8
00:01:58,363 --> 00:01:59,841
You shouldn't be out here alone.

9
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,663
And what the hell you got all
over you that's so damn slimy?

10
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:04,530
What happened?

11
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:13,389
You're worthless! Why can't you just die?

12
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,184
Hey, you need to pull yourself together!

13
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,004
Damn you!

14
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:17,274
Where is everyone?

15
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,492
Let it go, Conny.

16
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:22,964
He's it. There rest of 'em are dead.

17
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:24,564
Damn it, don't talk like that!

18
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:26,230
We can't assume he's the only one!

19
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:28,230
Take a look around you; isn't it obvious?

20
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:30,230
We can't waste any more time here with him.

21
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:31,196
We've gotta move on.

22
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:33,789
You're not making any sense.
Why would the Titans ignore him?

23
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:36,864
I dunno. Maybe they thought he
was already dead or something.

24
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:40,136
When you get right down to it,
that's the real tragedy here.

25
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:44,625
Eren and the others bust their
asses, and the one left standing is him.

26
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:47,246
Alright. That does it, bitch.

27
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:49,464
I'm gonna shut your mouth up permanently!

28
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,488
Both of you stop it right now!

29
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:53,775
Look, we're all at the end of our tether, okay?

30
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:56,581
We're seeing our friends being killed like animals.

31
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:58,297
It's normal to be upset.

32
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,434
Look at my Christa keepin' the peace!

33
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:03,826
You're so gonna have to marry
me when all this crap is over!

34
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:05,572
Yeah, well...

35
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:08,370
She'd best get a hold of that mouth.

36
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:11,422
Alright. Come on. We gotta get out of here.

37
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:13,231
Are you able to stand?

38
00:03:17,324 --> 00:03:20,557
Sorry to be a nuisance. Don't worry about me.

39
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:22,789
I'll rendezvous with the rear guard.

40
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:24,944
But... Armin!

41
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,749
Conny, hop to!

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,871
We've been given orders to advance!

43
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:41,380
I was wrong. This world hasn't become hell.

44
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,209
It's been hell. I just couldn't see it before now.

45
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,574
We're condemned. All of us. Have been from the beginning.

46
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,880
Strength preys on weakness.

47
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:59,057
It's a very straightforward arrangement, actually.

48
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,744
And my friends... They...

49
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:10,560
They tried. They knew how the world worked.

50
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:15,875
They wanted to be strong. For me.

51
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:19,068
Someone who only brought them down.

52
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:22,445
In their eyes, I was a victim.

53
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:24,273
I needed protection.

54
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:28,366
But all I wanted was to stand
shoulder- to-shoulder with them;

55
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:30,564
to be strong, like they were.

56
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:32,414
To be worth something.

57
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,736
And this is how it all ends up.

58
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:46,677
Eren tried to protect me and...

59
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:02,005
Hanna. What are you trying to do?

60
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:04,047
Oh god, Armin! Help me, please!

61
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,357
Franz quit breathing and I can't wake him up!

62
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,955
He won't respond to CPR! Come on, baby!

63
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,887
You got this! Stay with me!

64
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:14,938
Somebody help us!

65
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,314
Hanna, please. It's not safe on the ground,

66
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,464
we need to get you on a rooftop...

67
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:20,625
No! I'm not leaving him like this!

68
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:23,668
You really don't understand, do you?

69
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,473
Hanna, I'm sorry. Franz is...

70
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:36,816
Please stop. Please stop doing that.

71
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,093
I can't.

72
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,627
I... I can't take it.

73
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:47,018
This is hell.

74
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:53,850
What in the hell is wrong with you people?

75
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:57,243
I don't think you fully
appreciate how bad the situation is!

76
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:59,874
Oh, I appreciate it just fine, believe me!

77
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,996
You wanna make it out of here
alive, stop whining and help!

78
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,422
You're a soldier! Do something!

79
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,297
Make him move that damn wagon!

80
00:06:11,332 --> 00:06:12,683
I'm not exactly sure...

81
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,501
Take your best shot, little man.

82
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,243
I'm the president of this town's merchant guild.

83
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,118
Uh... Well, I...

84
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,041
Who do you think pays all the bills for
the food you and your buddies crap out?

85
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:27,299
Or maybe you've got some finances tucked
away to fund the racket you call a job?

86
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:31,797
Now shut up and push! This cargo's worth
more than you people make in your whole lives!

87
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,499
Nobody's getting out of here
unless the wagon's in front of 'em!

88
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:36,133
There's a reward in it if you help!

89
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,231
Don't worry, sweetheart.

90
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:42,545
Daddy's going to use those big, loud
cannons he showed us to scare the Titans off.

91
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:45,428
Mommie, look. There.

92
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,412
Push it through, dammit!

93
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:00,339
If you don't, that thing's gonna kill us all!

94
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:03,042
Stop! You'll trample the children!

95
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:10,022
Someone wanna tell me why the
son of a bitch is ignoring us?

96
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:12,480
It's an Abnormal; stop trying to figure him out!

97
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:15,769
He's too fast! There's no way we'll
overtake him before he reaches the gate!

98
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,001
Just stay on him!

99
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:40,535
Excuse me. What is all this?

100
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:42,541
Couldn't have asked for better timing!

101
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:45,183
Force these useless morons to push my wagon!

102
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,644
I'll pay you handsomely!

103
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:52,556
Seriously? Soldiers are dying back there.

104
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:55,646
Laying down their lives for you.

105
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:58,476
All because this is taking too long.

106
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:04,605
Yeah, that's their job. You expect me to shed a tear
'cause they gotta fulfill the duties they signed on for?

107
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,839
They're supposed to be willing to lay down their lives!

108
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:11,551
Don't get all high-handed on me just 'cause you
finally gotta earn your damn keep after all these years!

109
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:23,572
Yeah. No arguing with that. You're absolutely right, sir.

110
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,439
Guess it's what you call the greater good. Still.

111
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:32,318
Sometimes it's not the life or the death of
a soldier that makes the biggest difference.

112
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,434
Don't you even dare! Your commander and I are old friends!

113
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:39,173
One word from me and you'll be court marshaled!

114
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:40,359
Believe it!

115
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:47,518
That word gonna come from beyond the grave?

116
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:51,410
No! Wait!

117
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,513
Sir, maybe we should uh...

118
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,126
Pull the damn wagon out.

119
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:10,215
You're amazing!

120
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:15,301
You've saved our lives, miss. All of us are in your debt.

121
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,664
Good work, Ackerman. I'm impressed.

122
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:47,374
I did what I could here, sir. But, thank you.

123
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:50,211
I need to be a bit more careful in the future.

124
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:52,554
I inadvertently dulled both of the blades.

125
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,635
I'll do better next time.

126
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:58,663
What on earth have you had to
live through to be so non-chalant.

127
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:01,463
I'm sorry. That was uncalled for.

128
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:10,002
Why do I have to suddenly think of you now?

129
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,484
I'm finished, Momma!

130
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:32,706
What do you think? Did I do good?

131
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:37,132
Oh, darling. It's absolutely fantastic! Excellent work!

132
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:38,364
Aww, thank you!

133
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:43,291
We've kept this style of embroidery a special
family secret for heaven knows how many generations.

134
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:47,255
One day, when you have children of your own,
you'll be able to pass the secret on to them.

135
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:50,798
Huh? I don't understand; how can I have children?

136
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,009
Uh. Honey, why don't you explain?

137
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,820
Yeah! Please, Daddy?

138
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:58,820
Well I'm not sure I'm really an expert on the subject.

139
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:03,868
But you know what? That nice Dr. Jaeger's scheduled
to pay us a visit today. Maybe you could talk to him.

140
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,380
Ah! Speak of the devil!

141
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,688
Just a moment.

142
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,089
Her name's Mikasa?

143
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:23,374
Yes, and she's just about your
age, so try to get along, okay?

144
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:27,822
There aren't really that many children around
here and I'd rather you not grow up to be an outcast.

145
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,570
If she's nice to me, then we won't have a problem.

146
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,767
Eren. Look for the bad in people
expecting to find it and you will.

147
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:39,302
That's odd. Are they home?

148
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:42,861
Mr. Ackermann! It's Dr. Jaeger!

149
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:46,372
Is anyone there?

150
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,727
Well are they or aren't they?

151
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:54,620
Dad? What's wrong?

152
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:02,541
Damn it.

153
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,101
Look around. Can you see the daughter anywhere?

154
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:08,977
Perhaps she's outside.

155
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:11,622
I don't think so.

156
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:17,225
This is bad. I need to alert the Military
Police of this while the trail's warm.

157
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:19,711
 Wait for me at the foot of the mountain.

158
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:23,859
Understood? Say that back to me. Word for word.

159
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:25,335
Eren!

160
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:35,681
Uh-huh. All I'm sayin' is she
better go for a decent price.

161
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,389
I didn't get blood on my hands for nothing.

162
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:41,448
Look at her face and tell me what's she's worth.

163
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:45,984
Sure, she's cute and all. Just young.

164
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:47,756
Wouldn't go for her myself.

165
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:50,640
Then I guess we're lucky you're
not the one we're sellin' to.

166
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,961
Plenty of folks'd pay a premium.

167
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,090
She's exotic; what they used to call an "Oriental."

168
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,099
You know about all that, right? Back when
there used to be different breeds of people.

169
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:02,996
A bunch of 'em from the Far East
came scramblin' here for safety.

170
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,903
The old perverts in the capital
really go for that sort of thing.

171
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:09,429
This li'l beauty's gonna fetch a mint at auction.

172
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,130
It's great business; she's the last of her kind.

173
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:14,179
All the rest of her people died out.

174
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:15,360
Tell me another one.

175
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,259
It's not like she's a pureblood or anything.

176
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,384
Her old man wasn't "Oriental."

177
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:21,772
Good point there.

178
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:24,022
The mother would've been a nice addition, right?

179
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,749
Too bad she's in pieces!

180
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:27,647
Gimme a break! What was I supposed to do?

181
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:28,999
She was puttin' up a fight!

182
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:31,366
So you couldn't have just knocked her unconscious?

183
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,642
We were just talking about you, Doctor...

184
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,613
Sorry. Hope we're not interrupting.

185
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:06,943
Let's take this nice and easy. I don't imagine anybody
wants their skulls split open by this little guy...

186
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:09,565
This bitch is out of her mind!

187
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,772
Run, Mikasa! Run as fast as you can!

188
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,439
Stop it; you're scaring me.

189
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:17,342
I want you to be scared! Move it! Get away from here!

190
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:19,543
Dad?

191
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:22,904
Screw it. You ain't worth this crap!

192
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,772
You stupid bastard! The plan was to only kill the father!

193
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:41,839
She was nuts! I'm supposed to let
her gouge my eyes out with those shears?

194
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:43,379
I don't want to hear it! Just bag the kid!

195
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,062
Fine!

196
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:50,649
Hey. Let's not give me any attitude, alright?

197
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:55,311
If you're feelin' feisty, this is what you get.

198
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:07,364
So cold.

199
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,902
Oh, I'm sorry.

200
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,777
Don't move from that spot, you little vermin.

201
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,809
How did you even you find this place?

202
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:31,119
Uh. Well, I was in the woods and got lost.

203
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,392
I saw your cabin and...

204
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,336
Lost in the woods, huh?

205
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:41,328
A kid your age shouldn't be out
there on his own to begin with.

206
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:45,082
Big bad wolves are liable to
pounce on you from outta nowhere.

207
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:47,893
It's alright now, though; you'll be safe here.

208
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,378
My buddy and I'll be happy to take y...

209
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:56,115
I appreciate that, sir. But I'm not stupid.

210
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,833
And I'm the last thing you'll ever see.

211
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,181
What the hell do you think you're doing?

212
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:09,360
Hey, you little bastard! Get back here!

213
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:20,611
You're an animal! You hear me? No! You're a disease!

214
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,692
This is what you get, you son of a bitch!

215
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,171
This is what you get for being what you are!

216
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,744
Die! Die!

217
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:47,383
The hard part's over. You're safe now.

218
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,634
Anyway, Mikasa, right?

219
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,221
My name's Eren. I'm Dr. Jaeger's son.

220
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,303
I met your folks once or twice while I was with him.

221
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:03,600
We were stopping by your house today for a checkup.

222
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,205
We saw...

223
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:10,575
What happened to the third one?

224
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:22,611
This is all your doing, isn't it?

225
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:28,697
Answer me, you little bastard! You did this!

226
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:32,622
I'm gonna kill you! You're gonna die!

227
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:35,315
Take... Take him out.

228
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:37,238
Fight!

229
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:41,345
Kill or be killed. Fight for your life!

230
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:44,386
It's... It's the only way.

231
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:47,287
Who the hell do you think you are, you little brat?

232
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:51,500
The only way to live is to fight!

233
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:59,284
I can't. I don't think I can do this.

234
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:11,071
And all of a sudden, I remembered.

235
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:13,515
I'd seen it all before.

236
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:20,078
Many, many times. Since the day I was born.

237
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:24,489
It'd been all around me. Forever.

238
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,483
But...

239
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,842
I always looked the other way.

240
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:37,716
Yeah. The world is a cruel place.

241
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:40,503
And it's home.

242
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,535
All of a sudden, my body wasn't shaking.

243
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:59,617
I was in total control. Focused. Ready.

244
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,830
All of a sudden, I could do anything.

245
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:04,742
"Fight."

246
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:10,956
"Fight!"

247
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:13,197
Fight!

248
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:26,941
Stabbed through the heart from behind.

249
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:30,405
Surely a couple of kids couldn't've done this.

250
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:39,367
Damn it, son. I made it clear I wanted
you to wait at the foot of the mountain.

251
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:42,376
Do you even understand the magnitude
of what you've done here today?

252
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,983
Sorry, Dad. I'm not gonna feel bad for what happened.

253
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:48,091
They were animals disguised as
humans who needed to be put down.

254
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:49,511
Listen to yourself!

255
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:51,439
By the time the Military Police got here,

256
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:53,483
they'd have been long gone and you know it!

257
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:55,246
We couldn't afford to wait!

258
00:19:55,714 --> 00:19:57,471
That's not what I'm arguing about!

259
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:00,356
You threw caution to the wind and survived by pure luck!

260
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:01,888
You're strong, yes,

261
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:05,702
but you are too damn young to be so
casual about gambling with your life!

262
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:10,081
But, I... I didn't know how
else I was supposed to save her.

263
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,021
Mikasa. Remember me? We met a few times before

264
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:22,046
when you were just a tiny little thing.

265
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:27,838
Yes, Dr. Jaeger. So, um...

266
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,509
Sorry, can you just tell me how to get home?

267
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:37,403
It's cold. I'm tired.

268
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:40,629
There's really nowhere else for me to go.

269
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,659
Don't worry. You can keep it.

270
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,719
That ought to keep you warm, right?

271
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:06,338
I think so.

272
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,424
Mikasa, how would you feel about coming to live with us?

273
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:12,178
What?

274
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,118
I can't even imagine what you've been through.

275
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:19,109
But I do know you need your share of rest.

276
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:23,183
What's the problem?

277
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,733
Don't think about it. Just come on.

278
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:28,498
We gotta get home.

279
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,833
Yeah. Okay.

280
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:52,365
The world's a cruel place.

281
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:56,224
If you want to live, you have to fight.

282
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:01,205
That's it. We're done.

283
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:02,491
Now scale the wall.

284
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:04,964
I should help the vanguard withdraw, sir.

285
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,758
Ackerman! Wait!

286
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:11,050
It's a cruel world, but I have a place in it.

287
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:17,334
Eren. As long as you're part of my life,

288
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:19,701
I can fight to the bitter end.

289
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:58,277
"It's a cruel world, but I have a place in it."

290
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:03,873
Mikasa races through hell to be beside the
one person who makes the struggle worthwhile

291
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:06,865
only to learn just how deep hell goes.
