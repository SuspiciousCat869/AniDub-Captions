1
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:40,892
Hey, Mop-Top!

2
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:41,754
Sir!

3
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,102
What do they call you, maggot?

4
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:46,823
Armin Arlelt, from Shinganshina, sir!

5
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,400
Wow, seriously? Why would your
parents curse you with such a dumb name?

6
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:52,092
It was my grandfather, sir!

7
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,753
Cadet Arlelt! Why is a runt like you here?

8
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:57,041
To help humanity overcome the Titans!

9
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:58,836
That is delightful to hear!

10
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,811
You're gonna be a great light snack for him!

11
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,489
Row Three, About Face, runt!

12
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,716
What do you call yourself?

13
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:08,819
Sir. My name is Thomas Wagner,
I'm from the Trost district!

14
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:10,155
I can't hear you!

15
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:11,228
I'm from Trost, sir, my name...

16
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,813
Look at him go.

17
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:16,868
The man is a master when it comes to fresh-faced recruits.

18
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,083
That takes me back.

19
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:21,578
Is a pathetic worm like you
the best Karaness has to offer?

20
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:23,810
Sir! I'm afraid that's the case, sir!

21
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:24,424
Tell your backwoods...

22
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:25,901
But what's the point of all the intimidation?

23
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,255
It's a Rite of Passage. Through stress and
denigration we revert them into blank slates.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,337
From there, we can mold them
bit by bit into proper soldiers.

25
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:36,045
He is the first step in that process.

26
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,377
We seem to really excel at that back home, sir!

27
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,574
Row Four, About Face!

28
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,681
There are some he's passing by.

29
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:48,121
A drill instructor is nothing compared
to what those recruits have seen.

30
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:52,721
They were there. Witnesses to the
hell of the Titan attack two years ago.

31
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:55,151
You can read it in their faces.

32
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:57,090
C'mon. Let's go.

33
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,171
What do we have over here?

34
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,612
Jean Kirschtein, sir. From the Trost District!

35
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:03,319
And why're you here, cadet?

36
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:07,243
To join the Military Police, sir. The best of the best.

37
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:12,391
That's nice. You want to live in the interior, do you?

38
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:13,312
Yes!

39
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,237
No one told you to sit, Recruit!

40
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:21,338
If you can't handle this, Kirschtein,
then forget about joining the Military Police!

41
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:24,708
What the hell is wrong with your face, you smiling idiot?

42
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,938
Marco Bodt at your service, sir, from Jinae.

43
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:31,745
South side of Wall Rose. I aim to join the Military
Police and give life and limb in service to the king!

44
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:38,030
Well then. That makes you an idealistic fool. And a rube.

45
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,633
You want the truth?

46
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,806
The only use the king has for your
life and limbs are as Titan fodder.

47
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:49,461
Hey, Cue-ball. You're up next!

48
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,228
Oh, me? Sir! Conny Springer, from Ragako village, sir!

49
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,803
You have it backwards, Conny Springer.

50
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,868
That was the first thing you were taught.

51
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:01,698
This salute represents the resolve
in your heart to fight those bent on

52
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:03,855
the systematic destruction of our people!

53
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:06,482
Is your heart on your right side?

54
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:19,922
Hey, you there. What do you think you're doing?

55
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:26,536
You are officially on my shit list.

56
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:28,428
Just who in the hell are you?

57
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:33,082
Sasha Braus from Dauper village, at your service.

58
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:34,442
Reporting for duty, sir!

59
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,761
Sasha Braus, huh?

60
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:40,311
And what is that you're clutching in your right hand?

61
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,683
A steamed potato!

62
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,109
It sat there in the mess hall begging to be eaten. Sir!

63
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:48,190
The theft, I understand.

64
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,980
But here? Why eat it here of all places?

65
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:55,016
It looked quite delicious. And it was getting cold.

66
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,805
So I gave it shelter in my stomach, sir.

67
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:03,772
Why? I can't comprehend. Why would you eat that potato?

68
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,627
Are you asking me why people eat potatoes?

69
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,349
I'm surprised you don't know, sir.

70
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:26,260
Here sir. Have half.

71
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:30,158
"Have half?" Really?

72
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,350
Man, I thought Sadies was gonna kill Potato Girl.

73
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:41,453
I know. What a helluva first day.

74
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,017
It's funny.

75
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:46,960
Being told to run 'til the sun sets
didn't seem to bother her nearly as much as

76
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:49,808
losing meal privileges for the next five days.

77
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:51,727
I think she said that she's from Dauper.

78
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,175
If I remember right, that's a small
hunting village up in the mountains.

79
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,129
Hey, what's that?

80
00:05:57,712 --> 00:06:01,016
They're dropouts. They'd prefer to work in the fields.

81
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:04,170
But. It's only the first day.

82
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,084
That's the way it is.

83
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,834
If you can't handle the pressure, you've gotta leave.

84
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,703
I can't believe anyone would
rather pull plants than fight.

85
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:18,272
I know about some of us, but you never
mentioned where you were from, Eren.

86
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:21,283
The same as Armin. From Shinganshina.

87
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,405
Oh, wow. That means.

88
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,644
You saw it. You were there that day.

89
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,794
Huh? Quiet!

90
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,045
The Colossal one? Did you see him?

91
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,245
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

92
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,902
Yeah, okay? I saw the big guy.

93
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:39,936
Whoa, seriously?

94
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:41,919
Okay, exactly how tall was he?

95
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:44,019
He stuck his head over the outer wall.

96
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:46,936
Whoa, wait! I heard he stepped over the wall completely.

97
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,102
So did I!

98
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:50,061
That was the rumor in my village, too!

99
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:52,686
Nah. He was big, but not that big.

100
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,461
So what did it look like?

101
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:58,436
It had a mouth like a corpse. And no skin, just muscles.

102
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,794
And the Armored Titan? The one
that broke through Wall Maria?

103
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:06,234
Is that what they're calling it? In all
the panic, it was just another Titan to me.

104
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,148
No way. So, what were they like?

105
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:20,386
C'mon. That's enough questions, alright?

106
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,896
I'm sure he'd rather not relive
everything he went through.

107
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:24,716
Sorry. We didn't mean to...

108
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,082
It's not like that!

109
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:33,121
Those stupid Titans. They're
really not that big of a deal.

110
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,451
If we focus on mastering the
Omni-Directional Mobility Gear

111
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:39,470
they give us, then it's Titan payback time!

112
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,480
I've waited years to be trained as a soldier.

113
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,355
All of a sudden, the reality is sinking in.

114
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:47,510
I'm joining the Scout Regiment.

115
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:51,585
Then I'm sending the Titans back
to hell. I'm gonna butcher them all.

116
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,539
Hey, are you crazy or something?

117
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:57,709
Not that it's my business, but signing up
for reconnaissance is like a death sentence.

118
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,419
I guess we'll see. Or at least I will.

119
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,660
You seem content hiding in the interior with the MPs.

120
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:07,125
Look, I'm just speaking honestly here, kid.

121
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:10,836
I think it's better than being some loud
mouthed braggart tough-guy wannabe pretending

122
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:13,391
he's not as piss-scared as the rest of us.

123
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:16,352
Are you trying to pick a fight?

124
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:17,777
Stop it you guys!

125
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,924
Alright, sure. Makes no difference to me.

126
00:08:23,618 --> 00:08:24,260
Huh?

127
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:35,552
Hey. I apologize. Sorry for calling you
names and dismissing your choice of career.

128
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:37,879
Put 'er there, kid. Whaddaya say?

129
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:42,146
Right. Yeah, I'm sorry as well.

130
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,489
Umm. Excuse me?

131
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:03,613
I... Uh. I just wanted... I mean.

132
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,918
I've never seen anyone like you before. I mean, uh.

133
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:11,923
I'm... I'm sorry. You have really beautiful black hair.

134
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,159
Thank you.

135
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:24,419
Would you lay off? It's no big deal!

136
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:27,388
It's just that you get so worked
up you don't think things through.

137
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:29,159
Again with this?

138
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:30,954
If you insist on worrying,

139
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,961
worry about how long your hair is.

140
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:36,609
It's gonna catch up with you in a
bad way when we start on the ODMs.

141
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:39,914
Okay, fine. I'll cut it.

142
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:42,409
How short should I go, do you think?

143
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,440
What the hell? Leave my clothes alone, dammit!

144
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,307
What did you wipe on me?

145
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:57,137
Don't worry. Just my trust.

146
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:03,223
I'm... finished.

147
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:26,183
Could it be? It's bread!

148
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:29,097
I'm sorry there isn't more. It's all I could take.

149
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:34,484
Hey, hang on. You really should
drink a little water first.

150
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:41,888
You... You're a Goddess, aren't you? Glory unto you!

151
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:44,440
Hey. Just what are you two girls up to?

152
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:50,519
Well, uh. She's been running
all day. Without any food or water.

153
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:53,869
I see. So you're trying to be "nice," huh?

154
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:54,877
Eh?

155
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:02,927
What's the point of breakin' the rules for Potato Girl?

156
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:06,692
That mindless act of kindness gets you absolutely nowhere.

157
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:11,614
Whatever.

158
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:15,257
Let's just get her to bed already.

159
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:19,707
I'm confused. Are you being nice?

160
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:22,846
I'm helping her so that she'll owe me one in the future.

161
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,110
I intend to make use of her stupidity.

162
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:32,704
It's aptitude test time, so listen up!

163
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:36,003
There is no place for you here if you cannot perform!

164
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,505
Fail, and be shipped to the fields.

165
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:41,961
We're just drilling the fundamentals here.

166
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:45,336
You can still determine a Cadet's
knack for it just by watching.

167
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:50,057
Like her. Completely steady.

168
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,472
She inherently knows what to
do, and how to make it happen.

169
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:56,292
That's what aptitude is all about.

170
00:11:57,836 --> 00:12:00,701
I'd say we have several capable cadets this year.

171
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,393
And what about this guy?

172
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:06,128
That's precisely why we run these tests.

173
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:11,045
He proves that drive and dedication
do not always translate into capability.

174
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:14,044
What is your major malfunction, Jaeger?

175
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,892
Straighten yourself up!

176
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,157
Why am I... How do I work this thing?

177
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:23,478
This can't be happening!

178
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:38,152
Just remember the basics and you should be fine.

179
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:40,544
No need to try any fancy maneuvers.

180
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,681
Just focus on your balance.

181
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:47,124
Then distribute your weight evenly
between the belts on your waist and your legs.

182
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:48,961
Loosen up your stance a little bit.

183
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:51,169
If I could do it, I know that you can!

184
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:54,083
Okay. A loose stance, but balanced.

185
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:55,718
Let's give it a shot, Armin.

186
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:14,463
Hey, Daz. He was talking big
about butchering all the Titans,

187
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,188
but he got real quiet after ODM training, didn't he?

188
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:20,177
I guess it's the fields for him tomorrow.

189
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,702
Can't keep wasting food on the useless.

190
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,021
Eren.

191
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,629
Worrying won't solve a thing.

192
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:30,583
There's still time to get some practice in come morning.

193
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:35,866
How pathetic. How am I supposed to kill
'em if I can't even stand up straight?

194
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:38,735
It might be time to let that dream die.

195
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:40,521
Whaddaya mean?

196
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:43,541
I think you should give up this attempt to be a soldier.

197
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:47,903
There's a lot more to fighting and combat
than just throwing your life away in vain.

198
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,186
What're you saying? After everything we
saw that day, after what happened to my mom.

199
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,895
You're crazy if you think I'm just going to walk away.

200
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:58,550
I get it. But it doesn't matter how determined you are.

201
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:00,347
It... Wait, what do you mean?

202
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:04,891
Because whether or not you're
fit to be a soldier isn't up to you.

203
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:16,792
You misunderstand. I'm not saying you
should return to the fields by yourself.

204
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,284
I wouldn't dream of it.

205
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:22,566
Because wherever you go. I'm gonna go with you...

206
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:30,145
So. Uh. Are you saying...

207
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,736
that you're not going to finish that?

208
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:55,244
What's the trick to posture control? Hard to say.

209
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:58,240
Guess I got the "gift". You've just gotta feel it, y'know?

210
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,773
I'm trying to figure out your trick.

211
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:05,818
You've screwed upevery way imaginable, short
of an accidental equipment-related asphyxiation.

212
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:09,552
Please guys. You gotta help me, I'm begging you!

213
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:14,844
That's funny. Wasn't it just yesterday you said
"if you can't handle the pressure, you gotta leave?"

214
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:19,802
No, wait. Or was it "if you're a
complete idiot, you gotta leave?"

215
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,470
Something like that.

216
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:26,002
Oh, come on. I heard from everyone
you're both really good at it!

217
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:28,287
Bertholdt! Reiner!

218
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:32,723
Sorry kid. But there isn't any
special trick to just hanging there.

219
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:36,156
Not to be harsh, but if it's advice
you want, I'm not really the guy.

220
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:37,275
Alright.

221
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,778
Let's just hope it comes to you tomorrow.

222
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:44,710
Hold on. Aren't the two of
you originally from Shiganshina?

223
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,752
Yeah, that's right.

224
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,763
Then you know first-hand how terrifying they are.

225
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:52,400
Why on earth would you want to be soldiers?

226
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,747
I didn't see the things. Eren did.

227
00:15:56,807 --> 00:16:00,520
He saw their bloodlust first hand,
before anyone realized how bad it was.

228
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:06,794
And I... I knew I couldn't sit idly by as the
royal government forced the citizenry into the failed

229
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,933
territory retrieval operation.

230
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:10,669
I see.

231
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:12,603
So where are the two of you from?

232
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:18,519
Oh, Reiner and I? We were both from a
mountain village just Southeast of Wall Maria.

233
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,627
But. Then that means.

234
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:24,173
Yeah. Unlike the more prosperous river towns,

235
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,905
our village didn't receive word right away.

236
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,250
The Titans were on us before
we even knew what was going on.

237
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:36,178
It happened at dawn. All the livestock were so restless.

238
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:40,491
Soon after, we heard these strange
rumblings that just became louder and louder.

239
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:48,419
Eventually, I realized those rumblings were
the sound of death getting closer. I, uh...

240
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:50,820
I looked out my window, and...

241
00:16:57,606 --> 00:17:02,436
After that, well, uh. Everything is just a blur.

242
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:04,687
I think we all just panicked.

243
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,186
Hey. Easy now.

244
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:07,831
You're just getting yourself worked up again.

245
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,256
Sorry. Basically, what I've been trying to say is this.

246
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:16,181
The four of us aren't like the rest of... of them.

247
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:18,127
"Them" who?

248
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:21,520
The others here who've never
been witness to the Titan's horror.

249
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,670
Hey.

250
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:31,339
Most of them are here for show.

251
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:34,431
To do just what society expects.

252
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:39,180
In a world where you're labeled a coward if
you choose fieldwork by the time you turn twelve,

253
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,341
propriety demands our service.

254
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:46,644
With that said, I'm really no different from the others.

255
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:52,323
I joined the ranks hoping for assignment to
the Military Police. Tucked away in the Interior.

256
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:55,104
If that doesn't work out, I'll give up entirely.

257
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:58,845
I don't really have the fortitude for anything else.

258
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:05,694
There's no shame in caring about
your life, Bertholdt. We all do.

259
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,063
Do we?

260
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:14,774
I'm going to return to the home that was
taken from me. That's all I care about now.

261
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:19,239
I will do it. No matter what.

262
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:24,977
What about you? Why did you sign up?

263
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:28,773
Why'd I join?

264
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,161
I decided I have to kill them.

265
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:40,636
I won't stop 'til every single Titan is dead and rotting.

266
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:43,733
Dead. Every last one.

267
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,772
You saw what those monsters are capable of,

268
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,708
and you still want to take them on?

269
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:56,708
Damn right. It's just, after screwing up the training,

270
00:18:56,954 --> 00:18:59,043
I don't know if I'm cut out to be a soldier.

271
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:19,827
We'll take it from step one: Belt Adjustment.

272
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,834
By tomorrow, you'll be an expert.

273
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:27,237
I know you've got what it takes. I can see it in you.

274
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:28,436
Am I wrong here?

275
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:33,268
No! I won't fail. Thank you, Reiner. Thank you.

276
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:47,069
Eren Jaeger. Are you ready?

277
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:51,352
Yes sir! I'm going to do it. I have to!

278
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,877
I may not be as talented as the rest.

279
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:57,003
But nobody, nobody, has more guts!

280
00:19:58,003 --> 00:19:59,066
Proceed!

281
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:11,104
The moment of truth. I won't fail again.

282
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:15,497
To hell with working the damn fields! I'm not giving up.

283
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:17,792
Not without a fight!

284
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:25,284
I did it? No, I'm doing it!

285
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:36,337
No! Not yet!

286
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:39,046
Once more! I can do it!

287
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:41,757
Lower him.

288
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,951
I... I'm finished.

289
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,226
Wagner! Please exchange belts with Mr. Jaeger.

290
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,845
Huh? Yes sir!

291
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,309
Your equipment was defective.

292
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:08,948
If given a piece of functional gear,
you might not be worthless after all.

293
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:12,420
Quartermaster didn't notice this broken clasp.

294
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:16,075
Might have to visit the Supply
Depot and crack a couple skulls.

295
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:19,627
He... He still did it. Even
while wearing that busted gear.

296
00:21:20,206 --> 00:21:21,200
Amazing.

297
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,400
So, you mean I... I didn't wash out?

298
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:28,794
You made the cut. Now keep training, cadet!

299
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:31,949
I did it. I really did it!

300
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:35,086
Check it out, Mikasa! I'm doing it!

301
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:37,211
I can fight the Titans!

302
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:39,433
You don't have to worry about me!

303
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:41,022
Not anymore!

304
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,391
It seems like things worked out for him.

305
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:46,758
Look, his eyes are saying "check me out!"

306
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:48,084
They're not.

307
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:54,640
His eyes are saying he doesn't
have to leave me. Not anymore.

308
00:21:58,294 --> 00:22:01,982
Grisha. Today should bring you pride.

309
00:22:02,658 --> 00:22:04,643
Your son is a soldier!

310
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,761
After graduating from the Cadets,

311
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,031
Eren sees mankind begin to restore its dignity.

312
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,666
"We can beat the Titans."

313
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,142
