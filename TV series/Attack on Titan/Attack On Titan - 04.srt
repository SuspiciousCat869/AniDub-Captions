1
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:06,607
In the year 845, two terrifying
new breeds of Titan appeared:

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,341
the Colossal and the Armored,

3
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:12,787
barreling through the outer walls as if
wholesale destruction was child's play.

4
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:16,836
In blood and thunder, our way of life ended;

5
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:20,687
the Titans fed their hunger for human flesh unchecked.

6
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:24,324
Stop it! No!

7
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:29,123
The territory couched within the
circle of Wall Maria was abandoned.

8
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,944
Twenty percent of the human race perished.

9
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:34,129
As the Titan onslaught advanced,

10
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:37,733
our only choice was to withdraw behind Wall Rose.

11
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:25,024
Pick up the pace, you lead-heeled laggards!

12
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,845
Your boots water-logged, Arlelt?

13
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:30,988
Let's see some hustle!

14
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,707
Gear too heavy for you, son? Hell, drop it!

15
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:36,064
Leave it in the mud!

16
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,944
The Titans'll have easier work digesting
you without all the excess baggage.

17
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:43,724
Dammit.

18
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:45,956
Seriously?

19
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,301
Here. Focus on staying upright.

20
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:51,868
We are being graded on this, you know?

21
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:55,280
Thanks, but uh. Won't they demerit you for helping?

22
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,873
Yeah, if they find out.

23
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,997
Just make the cut and we're even, alright?

24
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:03,771
Reiner Braun.

25
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:09,023
The mind and constitution of a grass-fed ox.

26
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:11,271
Respected by his comrades.

27
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:16,554
I'm no one's burden, you hear me?

28
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:23,893
Armin Arlelt.

29
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:27,803
Built like a daffodil, but academically brilliant.

30
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,421
Annie Leonhart. Gifted with a sword,

31
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:52,424
but does not exactly play well with others.

32
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:54,442
Bertholdt Hoover.

33
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:58,192
Heaps of native talent, but too mild-mannered.

34
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:02,530
Jean Kirschtein. Head of the class on ODM;

35
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:06,684
also an insufferable smartass with a hair-trigger temper.

36
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,776
Think those showoffs can slice and dice?

37
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,326
Best hope you see a Titan before I do!

38
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:19,469
Military Police. Save a place for Jean!

39
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,386
Way to lead the charge!

40
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,835
You don't care if I steal your thunder, right?

41
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:34,588
Yeah-ah! Woo hoo!

42
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:38,465
Sasha Braus. Unusually fine instincts.

43
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:40,880
Rarely shares them with her teammates.

44
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:45,416
Conny Springer. Agile on the switchbacks.

45
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,134
Few sandwiches shy of a picnic.

46
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:49,427
Get ready.

47
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:00,543
Damn it! Still not deep enough!

48
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:05,461
Mikasa Ackermann. Model cadet. Excels in everything.

49
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:09,084
In fact, it's no overstatement to call the girl a genius.

50
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:13,166
Eren Jaeger. Lackluster in the classroom,

51
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:15,447
marginally better in the field.

52
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:20,826
But. Driven by a sense of
purpose that's almost terrifying.

53
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:33,139
Ahhhhh!

54
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,016
Ah!

55
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,597
Sorry, man. I've really gotta learn to hold back.

56
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,680
Eh, it's alright. Let's see how you do as the Rogue.

57
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,389
What're you waitin' on?

58
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:51,930
This training doesn't make sense.

59
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:55,681
We're not exactly picking
fights with someone our own size.

60
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:59,820
A guy'd have to be stupid to use this. I mean, a knife?

61
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:03,904
What if there's not an option?

62
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,877
The fight doesn't give us a say.

63
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,857
If it wants to get ugly, it gets
ugly. It's our job to be prepared.

64
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:13,693
The enemy comes in many forms.

65
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:16,426
Artillery's not always gonna be the answer.

66
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:20,501
Soldiers, the ones worth their salt anyway,

67
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:21,971
are ready for anything.

68
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,562
Don't believe me? Look.

69
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,018
Yeah? What about her?

70
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:33,243
Only thing she's ready for is any chance to slack off.

71
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:37,050
You think so? Maybe somebody
ought to give her a talkin' to.

72
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:40,990
Give her a li'l hard-knocks lesson in preparedness.

73
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:48,593
Commandant not beaten you down enough?

74
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,421
Keep it up, you'll be as flat
as the dirt you're walking on.

75
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:54,767
I suggest you think back to why
you enlisted in the first place.

76
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,759
Uh. What are you doing?

77
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:03,974
Whoa, she's pissed. Wow, I
thought she looked scary before.

78
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,794
You couldn't pay me enough to be on her bad side.

79
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:09,087
Okay! Now, go get 'er!

80
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,832
Huh? What the hell? Wait.

81
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:20,437
Right. I hope you don't expect me to hold back. Heads up!

82
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:28,675
Ugh. Son of a...! That was a dirty move!

83
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,140
Are we done here?

84
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:34,857
Not just yet. You know the drill: take up the dagger.

85
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,894
No, wait! This isn't how... Oh crap.

86
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:48,284
There.

87
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:52,702
So you ready to take me on yourself yet or what?

88
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,876
Uh. Not exactly.

89
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:56,410
Don't you dare.

90
00:07:57,357 --> 00:08:00,717
She's got a lesson coming, right? You go get her.

91
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,320
Yeah. A soldier can't really afford to back down either.

92
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:11,451
Get ready, here I c...

93
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,940
That's some technique you've got.

94
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:19,662
Who taught you how to fight like that?

95
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,136
My father did.

96
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,614
He, like, pioneer it or...?

97
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,114
Does it really matter?

98
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:28,493
It's pointless, just like all this.

99
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:30,989
Wait, you mean the training in general?

100
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,881
Hand-to-hand combat doesn't
really count against our final grade.

101
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:37,026
The smart ones blow it off.

102
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:42,476
It's a crapshoot anyway. Only the top
ten cadets get to serve in the Interior.

103
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,730
The rest of us? Forget it.

104
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:49,134
Point is, only the idiots like you
take this part of boot camp seriously.

105
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:52,121
Idiots. And whatever they are.

106
00:08:52,343 --> 00:08:53,343
Oh... Hello, sir.

107
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:58,111
First rule of this life, kid.

108
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:02,879
The better you are at dropping the bad guys, the
more distance the powers-that-be put between you.

109
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:06,103
That's what this whole stupid farce is about.

110
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,694
Sure. Whatever you say!

111
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:17,631
Face it. You don't fight the nature of things and win.

112
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:25,343
Look around you, Eren.

113
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:31,059
All the sons of bitches really expect us
to do is play the game. Don't be a pawn.

114
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,336
Yeah, well I still stand by what I said earlier.

115
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:43,277
I've been so fixated on building
myself up, I couldn't see it.

116
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:45,591
She's absolutely right.

117
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,609
They're not honing their skills to fight.

118
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,261
They're honing their skill to run.

119
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:57,619
I know, okay.

120
00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:59,671
And look, I'm not saying it's right,

121
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,212
it's just the way things are.

122
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,601
Before Wall Maria was compromised, ODM experts were rare.

123
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,337
Only Scouts ever risked proximity to the Titans,

124
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:08,829
and their regiment wasn't large to begin with.

125
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:10,069
That's how you conserve fuel.

126
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:11,974
Let your momentum do the work for you.

127
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,963
Still, that's pretty advanced.

128
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:18,061
Duh. It's called having a sixth
sense for the finer points of your gear.

129
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:21,546
You gotta do the strut if you wanna make the cut.

130
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,671
The MP only recruit the best.

131
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:26,687
Ah. Man, that'd be amazing.

132
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:30,526
Workin' within a stone's throw of
the king. No greater honor than that.

133
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:32,264
Shut up, Marco.

134
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:36,493
We're not children. You can drop the misty-eyed B.S.

135
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,479
Honor doesn't have any damn part of it.

136
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,999
You just want a nice, cushy job in
the Interior playing glorified sentry.

137
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,229
That's not true! That's not me at all!

138
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:45,645
Listen to you guys.

139
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:50,482
Interior? Five years ago, this was part of it.

140
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,748
You got a point to make, friend? I'm right here.

141
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,770
Poor Jean. So misguided. And besides,

142
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,503
I don't think your head'll fit in the Interior anyway.

143
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:05,722
Very funny.

144
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,794
Seems a little backwards to me.

145
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:12,824
Fine-tuning your Titan-killing skills so the
brass'll station you somewhere you'll never see one.

146
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,691
You'd rather I was good at gettin' killed?

147
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:18,520
Thank you, but I'll pass. Better to
play the system than get gnawed on.

148
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:19,841
You son of bitch!

149
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:21,429
Bring it on, you little bastard!

150
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:23,296
Eren, please stop it!

151
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,558
Gentlemen, please.

152
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:31,104
You think you can judge me?

153
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,937
Huh? You rip my shirt, you're dead!

154
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:35,142
I don't give a damn about your shirt! You piss me off!

155
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,365
What? Are you crazy?

156
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,011
Oh, wait. I get it.

157
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:52,470
He has something to prove. Sounds familiar.

158
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,948
Sorry to do this.

159
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:00,455
It's only to end this before things get out of hand.

160
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:12,856
Dammit! What the hell was that move?

161
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:17,630
Little something I picked up this afternoon
while you were busy with your thumb up your ass.

162
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:23,613
You honestly believe the Military
Police are your ticket to the good life?

163
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:27,307
You're not a soldier. You're a joke.

164
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:39,447
Would someone care to explain
the little ruckus I heard just now?

165
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,084
I do hope everything's all right.

166
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:50,181
Sasha passed some gas, Commandant.

167
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:53,032
Why am I not surprised?

168
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:56,942
For the love of god, learn some self-control.

169
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,490
Of the original recruits,

170
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:10,200
two-hundred and eighteen cadets graduated.

171
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:11,702
Some with honors.

172
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:15,247
Do you have heart?

173
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:16,612
Sir!

174
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,536
As of this moment, you have three options open to you.

175
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:22,117
Choose wisely.

176
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:24,810
The Garrison Regiment,

177
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:27,119
whose job is to reinforce the Walls.

178
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:31,894
The Scout Regiment, who rides out into
Titan country to take back what was once ours.

179
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,940
And the MP Regiment, maintaining law and
order under orders from His Royal Majesty.

180
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:40,171
Those cadets eligible for the MP have already been named.

181
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:43,510
The rest of you, take a look.
These are the top of your class.

182
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:52,336
This is it. We've made it.

183
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:58,174
Our time is now. Titans, be ready!

184
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:17,116
Alright! MP, here I come!

185
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,363
Three square meals a day for life!

186
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,098
How in god's name did I get ranked under Eren?

187
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,920
You're really gonna turn your
back on the MP for the Scouts?

188
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,725
Why in the world would you do that? You're in the top ten.

189
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:33,085
The Scouts have always been my goal.

190
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:37,295
I don't want the easy life.
Not with all the work I've put in.

191
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,615
I trained to fight Titans.

192
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,172
Are you insane?

193
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,178
How many people have died?

194
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,728
We're talkin' a fifth of the population!

195
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,046
If that doesn't paint a picture for you,

196
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,478
I don't know what will.

197
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:57,919
This is our life now. We can't beat them.

198
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,682
Yeah? So what?

199
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:09,310
We buckle? Take it all lying down?

200
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:11,676
Things have changed.

201
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:14,347
Maybe not a helluva lot, but enough.

202
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:17,317
They aren't the mystery they were five years ago.

203
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:21,359
There's still a long way to go, but we've made progress.

204
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,962
Every battle we lost taught us a lesson,

205
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,621
gave us the tiniest inroad toward something like hope.

206
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:31,172
You tellin' me it's better to cut our losses?
Let all the death and destruction be meaningless?

207
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:35,112
Just to ball up and accept it? Not on your life!

208
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:38,026
Humanity's future lies outside the walls,

209
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,546
and I'm gonna clear the way!

210
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:41,612
I'm gonna take back what was ours!

211
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:47,571
I'll drive them out. And as long as at
least one of us can say that, we're not done.

212
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,775
Eren, wait!

213
00:15:58,754 --> 00:16:00,922
Yeah, good luck out there, hotshot.

214
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:03,846
I'll root for you from His Majesty's barracks.

215
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,385
That was, uh, quite a speech you gave us there.

216
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:20,144
Yeah. Most of it was yours.

217
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,587
All that stuff you used to say back in the day.

218
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:27,055
Yeah, well I'm joining the Scout Regiment, too!

219
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:30,647
Now you're just being stupid. Come on!

220
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:33,307
You're not a fighter! Your life is with books!

221
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,499
I'm through with letting other people fight for me.

222
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:38,947
Guess it's the Scouts for me, too, then.

223
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,479
Oh, come on! You were top of the class!

224
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:43,045
You'd be wasting your shot!

225
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:47,273
Understand this, Eren. Where you go, I go.

226
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,665
I made a promise to your mom before she died.

227
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:52,334
I'm not letting you die.

228
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,282
I've got your back whether you like it or not.

229
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,112
So just deal with it.

230
00:16:58,176 --> 00:16:59,985
Yeah. Well, Mom's not here.

231
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:04,322
A lot of the people I used to
care about aren't here either.

232
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,322
Heads up!

233
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:29,817
The main unit of the Scout Regiment is back!

234
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:31,658
That's right, Commander Erwin!

235
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,565
Did ya give those ugly bastards a thrashing?

236
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,726
Look! It's Captain Levi!

237
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:40,438
They say he's like an entire brigade unto himself!

238
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:43,282
Spare me, please.

239
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,634
Feel how excited everybody is?

240
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:48,564
It's like the crowd just has a different energy now.

241
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,855
Well, we are going on five years without incident.

242
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:53,642
Seems like a good omen.

243
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:56,629
And you should check out all the cannon upgrades.

244
00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:59,180
The sight alone oughta be enough to scare 'em off.

245
00:17:59,254 --> 00:18:00,228
That's the truth.

246
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:03,296
You in denial 'cause you're a couple? What's that about?

247
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:05,754
Whoa whoa whoa! This isn't what it looks like! Okay?

248
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:07,904
Knock it off, man! It's embarrassing!

249
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,652
Hey hey, lookie here!

250
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:12,646
Mr. Hannes!

251
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:16,421
Word on the street's they let you graduate yesterday.

252
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,146
Either you've grown up or standards have plummeted.

253
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:20,962
Oh yeah, like you're one to talk!

254
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:23,396
The Corps of Engineers keep their new chief in the drink?

255
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:24,404
Watch it.

256
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,337
I'm sorry if this is out of the blue.

257
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:31,325
But I want you to know you're Mom's death still haunts me.

258
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,861
Me too, but it wasn't your fault.

259
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:38,061
We were shooting in the dark then.

260
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:40,866
But nothing like that's gonna happen again.

261
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:44,251
We know what we're dealing with now.

262
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:52,007
Fired up and capable make a good combination, kid.

263
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,874
Don't screw it up by dyin'.

264
00:18:57,027 --> 00:19:00,293
What? The hell you mean you're joining the Scouts?

265
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:02,900
What happened to the MP? That was your whole thing!

266
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:04,296
Don't worry about it!

267
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,046
A guy's allowed to change his mind, okay?

268
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:09,009
I think your speech yesterday lit a fire under him.

269
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,677
Ain't nobody talkin' to you!

270
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:14,012
His temper tantrum had nothing to do with it.

271
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:15,546
Take it easy.

272
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:18,367
It's not like you're the only one.

273
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,451
What? Are you serious?

274
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,707
Can you guys keep a secret?

275
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:29,173
'Cause I totally just helped
myself to the Officer's Pantry.

276
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,217
Sasha! They can throw your butt in the clink for that!

277
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:34,962
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

278
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,608
What isn't wrong with her?

279
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:39,326
It'll be fine. I'm willing to share.

280
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,660
Oh, can you imagine the sandwiches?

281
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:43,632
Put it back!

282
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:48,510
Yeah! Do you have any idea how rare
meat's been since the Titans took Wall Maria?

283
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,105
Um, li'l bit. Yeah.

284
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:55,842
Just look at it this way. Pretty soon,

285
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:59,164
we'll take back all the room we need for livestock.

286
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:04,963
I would really like a slice, please!

287
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:07,475
Hey if he gets one, so do I! Just so you know.

288
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:10,534
Me, too! I'm in on it, too!

289
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:11,932
But.

290
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,704
Come on! Don't just stand there.

291
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,516
If they see us slacking off, we're in for it.

292
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,486
See you guys at lunchtime.

293
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:28,345
Has it really been five years?

294
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:32,239
Look at us. Ready to stand tall again.

295
00:20:34,793 --> 00:20:35,973
We can do it.

296
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:42,977
Mankind didn't start this
fight, but we're gonna finish it!

297
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:05,644
It's hot!

298
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:14,771
Samuel!

299
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:16,739
Sasha!

300
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,586
Try not to move! Understand?

301
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:30,573
That was too damn close.

302
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,167
Oh god, no. Not again!

303
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:38,551
They're gonna get in.

304
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,321
They're gonna get in.

305
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:42,108
They're gonna get in!

306
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,922
No. This is over.

307
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,585
I'm gonna put a stop to this!

308
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:54,041
I will. This ends now.

309
00:21:56,623 --> 00:22:00,835
This is it, people! Do or die!

310
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:05,013
Mounted Cannon Squad Four, take out the Colossal Titan!

311
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:08,843
This is our chance! Don't let it slip away!

312
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:22,261
You. It's been a while.

313
00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:59,769
The jaws of Hell reopen.

314
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:04,285
Before you can even catch your
breath, you're between its teeth.

315
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:10,055
Sometimes, saving the people dearest to
you means making the ultimate sacrifice.
