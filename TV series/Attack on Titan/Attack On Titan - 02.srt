1
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:47,376
No!

2
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:33,558
Caw!

3
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,528
Hey!

4
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,175
Tch!

5
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:55,086
Huh?

6
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,888
Eren!

7
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:29,288
Eren.

8
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,295
Fire!

9
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:43,545
What?

10
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,166
Eren.

11
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,764
Eren.

12
00:13:58,809 --> 00:13:59,476
Eren.

13
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:04,651
Yeah.

14
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,501
Here.

15
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,743
Sure!

16
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,356
I do.

17
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:33,170
Oh no.

18
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:48,688
Never!

19
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:01,043
Carla.

20
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:49,659
Armin.

21
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:18,046
Look...

22
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:02,498
Mikasa.

23
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,386
Mikasa.

24
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:09,193
Mikasa!

25
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:28,293
Move it!

26
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:36,823
Oh, God.

27
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,001
Forever.

28
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:27,240
Shut up!

29
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:09,848
Come on.

30
00:20:58,003 --> 00:20:59,098
So do I.

31
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,919
Hey guys!

32
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,120
I'm sorry.

33
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:23,688
It's gone.

34
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:39,613
That's it.

35
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:42,920
And then...

36
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,728
Please! No!

37
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:44,685
Impossible!

38
00:09:57,593 --> 00:10:00,116
Go, go, go!

39
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,045
Eren, wait!

40
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,428
Let go of me!

41
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:43,271
No, it's not!

42
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:53,990
I'm with you.

43
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:00,530
Damn it! Stop!

44
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,753
What the hell?

45
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,793
It isn't easy.

46
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:25,769
There they are!

47
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:36,431
Don't leave us!

48
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,645
Retreat or die!

49
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:21,274
What're you...?

50
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:34,335
Every last one.

51
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:13,399
This is the end.

52
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:04,918
Please be alive!

53
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:38,632
Give me a break!

54
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:06,503
What's his deal?

55
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:05,994
What's the point?

56
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:53,625
Retreat! Retreat!

57
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,788
No. This is over.

58
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:21,739
Don't shut it yet!

59
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,035
Are they verified?

60
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:23,930
No! You're insane!

61
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:52,570
Glad I caught you.

62
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:09,420
I told you to stop!

63
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:38,028
There's still room!

64
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,851
No. The Inner Gate.

65
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:34,991
Listen to yourself!

66
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:52,270
Our hands are tied.

67
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:31,404
I'll kill them all.

68
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,628
Get off! Let me go!

69
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:57,295
Excuse me, my lords!

70
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:43,114
Tell me differently.

71
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:59,155
Of the 250,000 sent,

72
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,336
You don't have to...

73
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:58,254
That was nice of him.

74
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:07,339
Bad news travels fast.

75
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:45,625
Now I'll never get to.

76
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:01,148
You little piece o'...

77
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,790
What are you aiming at?

78
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:11,252
Forgive him. I beg you.

79
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,586
but I'm not a parasite!

80
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:20,001
Hey! What are you doing?

81
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,086
Nightmare. Shake it off.

82
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:38,861
All of us are parasites.

83
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,628
What are you waiting for?

84
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,686
I don't think so, friend!

85
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,274
Too much is handed to us!

86
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:16,324
All right. Together then.

87
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:26,311
You can't do this! Please!

88
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:17,572
That's it. We're all dead.

89
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:36,065
You cannot forget the key!

90
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,836
It's the way to the Truth!

91
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,714
One day you'll understand!

92
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:18,484
so it's an ugly situation.

93
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:46,219
I need those canons loaded!

94
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:39,570
Why did I always fight her?

95
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:43,075
I never said, "I love you."

96
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:59,782
Dad was... It felt so real.

97
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:11,062
Poor man's probably hungry.

98
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,545
Armin. You best have a seat.

99
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:15,781
I'm not getting left behind.

100
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,182
Terror spread like wildfire.

101
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:33,762
You're not making any sense!

102
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:42,584
And the following year, 846,

103
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:04,645
Stop whining and do your job!

104
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,326
That does it, bring 'er down!

105
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,253
Hours after Shiganshina fell,

106
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,596
The Titans are... They're in!

107
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,689
Why was I always such a brat?

108
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:34,503
And you will grow to hate me.

109
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,031
Am I a fighter, or am I feed?

110
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:51,288
Spineless cowards! All of you!

111
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:14,493
I'm not about to let her down.

112
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:20,619
Wait! Are you out of your mind?

113
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:41,579
The Titans are closing the gap!

114
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,878
Damn you, this is the only way!

115
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,722
By the way, I'd make that last.

116
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:52,504
We're parasites. We're cowards.

117
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:48,827
Punished by the justice of God."

118
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,967
Have you got rocks in your head?

119
00:11:57,464 --> 00:11:59,083
You'll really want to hear this!

120
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,124
What's wrong? You see something?

121
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,630
I'm going to put a stop to this!

122
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:17,324
the Titans will grow to hate me.

123
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,670
I'm sorry, it's at full capacity!

124
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:01,181
Wall Maria's been broken through.

125
00:14:07,865 --> 00:14:12,521
Eren! Stay with me, boy! Wake up!

126
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:09,030
Or am I gonna be the one to bite?

127
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:29,646
Our house. It's all gone. Forever.

128
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,600
Not exactly a dignified existence.

129
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:02,211
To do what? Get killed by a Titan?

130
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:05,984
not even two hundred made it back.

131
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:33,247
I'm worse. When push came to shove,

132
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:05,930
It's the same thing all over again.

133
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,492
C'mon! They're headed right for us!

134
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,253
At least let our children on board!

135
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:16,645
Stop it! Please, you're scaring me!

136
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,831
Whatever you do, you must reach it!

137
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:09,195
Just ignore it. There's a shortage.

138
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:12,374
Run away and take what we're given?

139
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:02,182
Your mom didn't ask us to be brave.

140
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,575
Eat it. She asked us to stay alive.

141
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:29,957
We have to find a way to stop them.

142
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:25,891
Straighten those spines, piss-ants!

143
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:59,093
the Mountain holds no greater pain!"

144
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:22,701
Hurry up! Keep your eye on the Gate!

145
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:33,799
I wouldn't try to call out just now.

146
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:59,296
Because I'm a kid. Because I'm weak.

147
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,343
This isn't real. This is a nightmare.

148
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,520
We've gotta get the hell out of here!

149
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:00,003
We have to stand on our own two feet!

150
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:36,923
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

151
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:36,544
This world will never feel like home.

152
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:47,093
Right now, you're nothing. Livestock.

153
00:21:56,502 --> 00:21:58,829
'cause here's where you ask yourself:

154
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:17,878
God help us. God help us. God help us.

155
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:54,659
Yeah? What're you tying to do, starve?

156
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:48,945
To become strong enough to fight back.

157
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:36,162
I was too frightened to hold my ground.

158
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,710
What are the rest of us supposed to do?

159
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:55,409
Hey. It's okay. You were just dreaming.

160
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,292
Damn it! I'm not trying to drag you in.

161
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:06,250
Unless you can transmute it into skill.

162
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:41,742
And driven e'en as a plough by avarice."

163
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:44,210
Stop dragging your feet! Snap out of it!

164
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,503
Shut the gate, now! We're being charged!

165
00:14:24,017 --> 00:14:26,045
Mom's death pushed you off the deep end!

166
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,087
Now it's where they corral the refugees.

167
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:30,234
Guess we gotta beef up the herd, though.

168
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:58,104
You seen one? You seen what they can do?

169
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:08,295
I'd never seen what they could do to us!

170
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:14,790
Look at us! What choice do we have here?

171
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:45,450
Don't take your shortcomings out on him.

172
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:55,586
Upon the penance of these writhing souls,

173
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:06,187
every right, so justice here doth chain."

174
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:21,561
You don't have to! Just give me your arm!

175
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:03,810
You son of a bitch! We could've saved her!

176
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:45,628
In terrified haste, The Central Government

177
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,461
But the cold, hard ground yielded nothing.

178
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,910
fraught, fixed, earthen in heart and limb."

179
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:39,943
Your mother died because I'm a damn coward!

180
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:48,336
declared the Outlier Districts a lost cause

181
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:53,978
You don't... You don't know what it's like!

182
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,730
So that's it? This is just the way life is?

183
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,131
The 104th Cadet Corps Boot Camp starts now!

184
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,545
you'll learn to take down your own Goliath.

185
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:20,726
We're dead and standing at the gate of Hell.

186
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,545
I don't understand what you're trying to do!

187
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:59,654
Pride be damned; we do what we must to live.

188
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,477
Our lives will never be our own until we do.

189
00:00:06,128 --> 00:00:09,074
They first appeared over a hundred years ago.

190
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:52,503
"Where covetousness leads, thou sees't bourn.

191
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,670
We almost had her out! Why did you come? Why?

192
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:21,431
In case you hadn't noticed, we're all hungry.

193
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:56,686
When are you gonna get sick of their charity?

194
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:29,645
A few days later, throngs of starved refugees

195
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,961
But over the next three, soul-crushing years,

196
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:02,675
"As greed has drowned our love for every good,

197
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:26,795
"Tethered, captive, are; merged with the clay.

198
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:03,277
Because every last one of us is a damn coward!

199
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:35,467
I can't do this. I'm going back to Wall Maria.

200
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:51,597
To hell with all of 'em! Here. I'm going back!

201
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:10,161
While it did nothing to drive back the Titans,

202
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:43,623
Next year I'll be applying to join the Cadets.

203
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:23,338
I will. Just keeping an eye out for my friends.

204
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:31,625
Look, there's nothing we can do! Push off, now!

205
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:02,670
You gonna give me attitude or you gonna reload?

206
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:46,032
"Now, thou behold'st, am I here punished for it.

207
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:30,615
These things aren't gonna give you a head start!

208
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:46,484
Oww! Damn it! You picked the wrong man, asshole!

209
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:04,572
He's sorry! He didn't mean it; he's just hungry.

210
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:41,711
We couldn't run from certain death without help.

211
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:55,651
Titans are at the top of the food chain. Period.

212
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:52,073
and decreed all mankind retreat behind Wall Rose.

213
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:44,253
every night for the rest of your miserable lives.

214
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:35,221
The survivors erected Walls Maria, Rose, and Sina;

215
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:38,378
"'Til then a man apart from God. O wretched was I.

216
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:30,643
And thus to remain so long as it pleases The Lord:

217
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:41,420
All I've had for two days is a moldy bit of crust!

218
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:02,818
nearly twenty percent of the surviving population,

219
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:01,420
The calculated design flaw in all Outlier Districts

220
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,609
We can't let the Titans get through the Inner Gate.

221
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:24,853
Tell your buddy a little gratitude goes a long way.

222
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:38,598
The Titans have to pay for what they've done to us.

223
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:49,827
For god's sake, we can't even find food on our own.

224
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,993
Look, there's no point in following me to my death!

225
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:24,395
We've still got people out there! Give 'em a chance!

226
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,024
They're handing out food rations near the warehouse.

227
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:13,125
Giant, humanoid creatures with a taste for our blood.

228
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:33,390
Eat up, the Titans like a little meat on their bones!

229
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:30,708
Bastard. I'm not about to show gratitude to a coward!

230
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,378
Training is gonna be a white-knuckle ride through Hell.

231
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:38,152
"What else may heav'nly grace do for sins as ours?" Huh?

232
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,093
Yeah. And if I can help it, then it won't be your death.

233
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:38,201
We're soldiers; we don't get to decide who lives or dies!

234
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:55,693
I say we make appeals to the Central Government for help.

235
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:16,772
They were already dealing with famine before we got here,

236
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:56,137
Remember this moment when you come face to face with him,

237
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:14,353
Oh, I'm a fighter, alright. And before I'm done with 'em,

238
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,847
There's nothing you could've done for her, you understand?

239
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:42,047
Hey, now. You're not serious; that's your stomach talking.

240
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,711
Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Commandant Keith Sadies;

241
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:26,336
We were shoved to the brink
of extinction almost overnight.

242
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:26,606
That outcropping has held for
a century; it makes no sense.

243
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,972
We all get that way; speak
our minds out of turn sometimes?

244
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:37,708
Give 'em their space. God only
knows what they've just seen.

245
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:50,663
Damn it all. Any way it's
sliced the situation is untenable.

246
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:21,478
I think this used to be where
they stored all the dry goods.

247
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:03,468
Hard truth: Passion's no
guarantee you'll stick the landing.

248
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:34,502
There've been at least five-hundred
accounted for in the boats.

249
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,546
The question is how prepared
are we if Shiganshina is in ruins?

250
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,833
Nothin' more gratifyin' than
seein' your rations go to animals.

251
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:13,287
No personal belongings! We need
to make as much room as possible!

252
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:18,611
Yeah, well. Keep in mind who's
givin' up their share so you can eat.

253
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:41,867
Oughta keep you in cages. Shove
you out to the frontlines as a buffer.

254
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,189
"For we lifted not our eye to heights
bequeathed, and like the plou... "

255
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:47,648
Wake up! The guys standing between
us and them are just a bunch of talk!

256
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,701
were put to plough in the wastelands
as a last-ditch effort to raise food.

257
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:57,228
Grandpa scrounged a little extra by
telling the powers-that-be he had kids.

258
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:06,535
Am I gonna be ground up to pulpy human
grist 'tween boulder-sized incisors.

259
00:24:06,507 --> 00:24:10,507
When you're floored by fundamentals
all the heart in the world means nothing.

260
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:14,648
their sacrifice did at least lessen
the effects of famine within the Interior.

261
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:57,092
Estimates held that nearly ten-thousand
lives were lost to the Titan offensive.

262
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,303
Drop everything, find the ferry nearest
you and climb aboard for all you're worth!

263
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,378
Sir. With respect, they're old as sin
and not designed for accuracy to begin with!

264
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:22,048
The brute strength of these aberrations
trumped an average person's many times over.

265
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:41,697
If I've done my job, you'll be waking up
in a cold sweat from memories of this place

266
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:26,992
There's nothing you could've done for her,
you understand? You're a kid; you're weak.

267
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,057
If that happens, the handful of lives left
out there'll be the least of our problems!

268
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,455
every man, woman, and child within the
Interior knew the unthinkable had come to pass.

269
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:23,503
That, and this far in there's a greater
disparity between the haves and the have-nots.

270
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:06,520
I know I used to think our future was beyond
the walls. But it's like you told that man.

271
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:31,545
Whether or not they're verified. The refugees
are certainly flooding in like plague rats.

272
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:41,012
withdrawing behind them in frightened huddles
for what was to be a century of uneasy peace.

273
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:21,495
What do you think we're meant to make of these
reports of Shiganshina falling to the Titans?

274
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,241
Come now. Surely Wall Maria is enough on its
own to hold the Titans at bay, don't you think?

275
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:19,566
We can damn-well leave! If you wanna scrape
by on the charity of cowards, that's your thing,

276
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:50,343
So-called Outlier Districts like Shiganshina jut
out like thorns at vital spots along Wall Maria.

277
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:48,167
the remaining refugees old enough to serve in
the military were tasked with reclaiming Wall Maria.

278
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:33,926
There aren't enough resources for the whole human race
to retreat behind the next wall if they break through!

279
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:03,155
is that they have only a single gate

280
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:07,251
through which its citizens are able to
retreat deeper inward should the need arise.

281
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:54,057
Their basic function is to streamline troop dispersal

282
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:57,914
and keep security costs down by
drawing Titans into specific areas.
