71
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:12,666
Sir.

80
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:42,874
Sir.

99
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:16,441
Mom.

78
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,104
Levi!

116
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,090
Eren?

140
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:19,350
Yeah.

183
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:28,924
What?

251
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:55,834
Or...

268
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:12,675
Eren.

280
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,286
Eren!

49
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,954
Hiyah!

57
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:16,513
Captain!

100
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:22,193
Oh, Mom.

27
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:22,445
Move out!

60
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,562
I'm here.

89
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:06,830
Damn you.

90
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:12,240
Damn you.

289
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:08,283
Dear god.

211
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,280
I'm sorry.

223
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:25,806
Excuse me!

260
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,197
I'm human!

275
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:42,869
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:32,747 --> 00:00:33,625
And then...

26
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:20,928
I mean you.

105
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:40,228
Everything.

261
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:43,144
So you say.

263
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:49,794
Forgive me.

75
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:29,073
Look at him.

77
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:36,268
We can hope.

117
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:52,145
You alright?

150
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:48,865
That's nuts.

267
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:04,962
Wait, no...!

59
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,555
Captain Levi.

127
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:18,135
What is this?

168
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:51,890
That's right.

171
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:57,079
They're good.

248
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:47,969
Is he insane?

285
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,647
Armin's life.

46
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,661
Captain, wait!

122
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,447
Armin, what...

216
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,190
Nor should it.

255
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,280
One more time!

284
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,605
Mikasa's life.

112
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:18,794
Get up. Get up!

199
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:17,219
What true form?

288
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,395
Did we get him?

41
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:38,982
Two on the left.

56
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,154
Ugh. Disgusting.

98
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,066
I know she will.

130
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:24,984
What's going on?

146
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:35,907
Hey. Talk to us.

188
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:46,373
Human? Or Titan?

17
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,535
Spare me, please.

40
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:36,463
One on the right.

81
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:44,147
What do you mean?

101
00:09:24,152 --> 00:09:26,486
Help me. Pleas...

180
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:20,875
and Armin Arlelt!

186
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,296
Answer carefully.

246
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,431
Killed by people.

72
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,701
I'm sorry. He's...

79
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:41,747
We're pulling out.

157
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:15,362
Stay on your toes.

214
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:02,393
Do you understand?

245
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,730
Is this it for me?

286
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,341
Everyone's life...

142
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:25,406
No, no. She's good.

195
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:08,070
Answer me, damn you!

96
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:04,835
Help me. It's so hot.

115
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:32,005
You're all gonna die.

145
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:32,592
She get hurt or what?

160
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:21,439
Hey, something wrong?

233
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:00,414
The hell is all this?

104
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:37,608
Our lives. Our dreams.

169
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,916
I'm really sorry, sir.

252
00:18:56,581 --> 00:19:00,975
No. My sleeve. My arm.

25
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:17,853
What? Seriously? Where?

53
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:46,801
Uh oh. Easy, big stuff.

62
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,521
Was I... Was I helpful?

76
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:31,711
That's a face at peace.

265
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:57,788
all of us are monsters.

15
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:43,083
Look! It's Captain Levi!

91
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:44,561
This... This isn't real!

102
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:29,771
How has it come to this?

114
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,125
You're mine. All of you.

141
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,061
Wait. What about Mikasa?

147
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:43,644
I'd tell you if I could.

176
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:09,294
Loads of inner strength.

204
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:33,893
Under the circumstances,

219
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,397
They won't be persuaded.

239
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,422
This isn't the only way!

253
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:04,058
Am I really one of them?

262
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,958
I'm left with no choice.

271
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,576
Whenever you look at it,

283
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:15,084
But it is yours to make!

132
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:33,770
Are they terrified of me?

203
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,159
and that creature is you.

107
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:53,634
I refuse to die like this!

131
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:28,089
And what's with that look?

166
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,980
They're cadets now, right?

250
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,198
That was all just a dream!

149
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:47,831
Whoa. You're joking, right?

172
00:14:57,702 --> 00:14:59,410
Some tough little bastards.

264
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:53,172
When push comes to shove...

20
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:05,281
Lo! The threshold of Titania!

23
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:13,847
I'll burst with tears of joy!

66
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,396
And tomorrow, because of you,

69
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,376
This I swear on my very life.

92
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,645
We were ready. We were ready.

93
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,491
We hit the books. We trained.

153
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,673
Well, that is, if we survive.

156
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:13,533
We can't get too comfortable.

196
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:09,787
Evasion will get you nowhere!

13
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:38,264
That's right, Commander Erwin!

39
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:22,053
Just wait 'til Captain Levi...

70
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,410
The Titans will be eradicated!

86
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:57,169
It's just like five years ago.

232
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,600
Okay. Somebody talk to me now.

257
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:18,875
I... I don't know what to say.

58
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,493
I... I can't stop the bleeding.

106
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:51,083
Damn you. Damn you all to hell!

119
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:57,437
Can you hear me? Say something!

155
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:12,049
Still just a barricade, though.

249
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:50,688
Why is no one making any sense?

273
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:34,446
"I must return to that cellar."

18
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,562
That scowl will crush your fans.

36
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,147
Mankind will destroy all of you!

54
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:49,510
Nobody's got time for a crybaby.

111
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:09,760
I'll kill every last one of you.

192
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,674
Oh god. Is that what they think?

272
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,916
let this thought flood over you:

38
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,295
Gorge while you can, you bastard.

50
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:20,178
See? Bet you barely felt a thing.

67
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,162
your strength won't die with you;

85
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:52,482
They're bearing down on the city.

148
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:45,898
They slapped us with a gag order.

189
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:50,043
Wh-What is that supposed to mean?

256
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:13,011
Are you a human being or a Titan?

61
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:35,843
Did... Did this make a difference?

64
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,562
Tell me this'll advance the cause.

187
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:43,648
Eren Jaeger. What exactly are you?

282
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:12,789
The journey will be a painful one.

10
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:22,825
military causalities were profound.

45
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:49,455
The pair on the left belongs to me.

55
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:53,633
Let's take it like a man, shall we?

68
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:03,530
the torch will be carried on by me.

109
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:02,871
Do you hear me? With my bare hands!

110
00:10:57,454 --> 00:11:02,221
This isn't your world. Not anymore.

135
00:12:57,826 --> 00:13:00,068
Basically, we got lucky. That's it.

136
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:04,708
That sounds terrible. I'm so sorry.

167
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:49,157
Won't they be at the Vanguard, too?

193
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,281
I'm sorry, sir! I don't understand!

194
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,822
Son of a bitch is playing innocent.

200
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:19,511
Please! Scores of us saw it happen!

207
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,871
I will not let the situation stand!

234
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,383
Mikasa! You can't take them all on!

118
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:55,554
Look at me. Eren, hey, can you move?

152
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,230
Word'll get out, and when it does...

179
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,375
Cadets Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Akermann,

230
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,268
Equal to a hundred soldiers, easily.

258
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,671
My life's not the only one at stake.

126
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:15,586
What the hell are they talking about?

212
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,222
Humanity's fate hangs in the balance!

236
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:09,831
Whoever comes at Eren, deals with me.

83
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,886
My men didn't die to pave our retreat!

97
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:10,429
I need to get home. Mom'll be worried.

103
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:33,350
Why has everything been taken from us?

161
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:25,443
Sir. My apologies. I completely agree.

30
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:35,131
Theirs is a solemn and dangerous honor.

43
00:04:41,926 --> 00:04:44,512
Good. Tend to our comrade below, Petra.

84
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,806
There's a swarm of Titans moving north.

128
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:20,663
Why are all their blades pointed at us?

129
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:23,101
Those are meant for taking down Titans.

144
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:31,013
Hey, Jean! Where in the world's Mikasa?

228
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:46,240
Sir. There's something you should know.

254
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:08,913
That's not possible. It's just now I...

65
00:06:52,164 --> 00:06:54,345
We've made great strides today, soldier.

177
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:11,621
And their friend's a certifiable genius.

178
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,663
They'll be fine. Not a doubt in my mind.

224
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,929
I wouldn't. Not while I'm standing here.

259
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:28,632
But, I mean I've always been one of you.

266
00:20:00,902 --> 00:20:03,819
Armin! Head for the wall! I've got Eren!

290
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,317
Armin pleads for the life of his friend,

95
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:00,918
We knew how to beat them. How to survive.

190
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,244
Why are they all glaring at me like that?

221
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:20,656
Sir, please! This may be our best chance!

292
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:04,357
But however eloquent, however passionate,

29
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:32,208
Acting as a spearhead for human knowledge.

42
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,859
Captain! The reinforcements are here, sir!

44
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,896
You two, take out the Titan to your right.

121
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:01,736
They're terrified, but they'll understand!

125
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:12,479
Son of a bitch wants to eat us. You watch!

159
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:20,375
This is the proverbial line in the sand...

197
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:11,931
Don't try to stall with pretend ignorance!

220
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:17,613
And as you say, it's just a waste of time.

231
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,011
If we lost her, it'd be quite the tragedy.

241
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:21,625
We need to calm down and just talk it out!

8
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:15,627
The Titan assault on Trost left us reeling.

87
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,751
Something tells me this is going to be bad.

120
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,737
Listen, you've got to tell them everything!

124
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,403
There's not much else you can make of that.

22
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,737
I'm on pins and needles! We bag an Abnormal,

32
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,852
the regiment's survival rates have improved.

82
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,524
You damn well know that we can push further!

113
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,482
Let me kill you again! And again, and again!

123
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,399
You catch that? He said we're all gonna die.

1
00:00:02,706 --> 00:00:05,831
They first appeared over a hundred years ago.

51
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:24,418
I know you probably can't help being hideous.

94
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:57,447
These things weren't a mystery to us anymore.

133
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,981
I want all you cadets on standby. Look sharp!

184
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,650
Any attempt to move from where you stand now,

243
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:29,571
Damn it! Why can't I remember how I got here?

14
00:02:38,347 --> 00:02:41,010
Did you give those ugly bastards a thrashing?!

73
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:24,132
Did the man hear what I had to say? Any of it?

170
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,960
Don't know why I felt the need to bring it up.

237
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:12,091
I'll take on the entire regiment if I have to.

293
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:07,733
reason finds no hold in minds wracked by fear.

52
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:30,314
But I can't help being tired of looking at you.

175
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:07,617
The other's so stubborn it can drive you crazy.

191
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,217
It's like... Like they're looking at a monster.

215
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:05,777
My conscience will not falter to watch you die!

276
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,126
I wish there was more time to explain all this.

63
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:45,703
Please, sir. Don't tell me this was for nothing.

143
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,826
She made it in after us with the group Jean led.

213
00:16:57,247 --> 00:17:00,201
I cannot waste any more time or manpower on you!

287
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:29,743
hinges on your being able to control this power!

31
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,063
Thanks to the ingenuity of its exemplary members,

37
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:10,325
Mark my words: the last ones standing will be us!

158
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:17,914
Whatever happens next, it's bound to happen here.

226
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:37,564
well, I 'm happy to demonstrate my own technique.

238
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,783
I don't give a damn what they try to throw at us.

281
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:08,967
One day, the truth will come out. I swear to you!

5
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:26,284
The survivors erected Walls Maria, Rose, and Sina;

16
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,805
They say he's like an entire brigade unto himself!

173
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:02,118
Believe me, they know what it takes to stay alive.

24
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:16,181
I think we've bagged the craziest abnormal already.

35
00:03:56,747 --> 00:04:02,516
One day... One day you'll all just be a bad memory.

74
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,721
Yes, sir. Matter of fact I think he heard all of it.

151
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,052
They're nuts if they think people aren't gonna talk.

2
00:00:05,993 --> 00:00:09,623
Giant, humanoid creatures with a taste for our blood.

227
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:41,632
On you. And every last inch of your traitorous flesh.

229
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:49,061
She was assigned to the elites fresh out of training.

242
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:26,027
Am I the only one here who doesn't think I'm a Titan?

12
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:36,372
Heads up! The main unit of the Scout Regiment is back!

108
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:57,797
I'll drive them all out! Kill them with my bare hands!

222
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,827
We'll expend far less artillery if he's in human form!

225
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,076
Unless anyone's feeling up to the task, in which case,

206
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:40,369
You are a risk I am well within my rights to eliminate!

217
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:10,115
As soldiers, they all know the price of their position.

48
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,289
Points for tryin', but you're a li'l slow on the uptake!

174
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:04,923
One of 'em's just about the best fighter I've ever seen.

244
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:35,133
I'm too weak to stand up, and if I say the wrong thing...

4
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:20,151
We were shoved to the brink
of extinction almost overnight.

88
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:02,580
For all we know, the wall's
already been reduced to rubble.

208
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,452
Every moment I squander mulling
over your supposed innocence

240
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,206
They're just scared. They don't
understand what's happening!

21
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:08,961
Can't you just envision the
horrors in store for us, comrades?

182
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,059
Whether or not a swift execution
is the result depends on you!

162
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,870
I'm just a little preoccupied
about my friends in the Vanguard.

181
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,414
The three of you have jointly
committed an act of high treason!

205
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:37,040
your being sanctioned by His
Majesty is neither here nor there.

134
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:57,670
If we hadn't found the gas, we'd
have never gotten out of Trost.

209
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:49,765
puts us all in further jeopardy
from attack by the Armored Titan!

235
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:07,277
Even if you took down a few,
there's nowhere left for you to run!

163
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:33,636
There was a messenger on the way
to HQ with this look on his face.

9
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:19,377
Owing at least in part to the
Scout Regiment's absence at the time,

139
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:17,921
So, you're saying everyone who
isn't here now didn't uh... you know.

270
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:27,471
Listen to me. It's vital that you
keep this key on you at all times.

279
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:02,151
When the ability confuses you,
let their memories act as your guide.

291
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:01,380
desperate to convince their comrades
Eren isn't the monster he seems.

218
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:13,570
If they're this committed to defiance
under threat of death, so be it.

28
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,308
The Scout Regiment's primary function
is to establish bases of expansion.

165
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:45,218
Is it true what they say about you
saving those kids five years ago, sir?

47
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:06,082
Don't be scared, big guy! I won't
hurt you. Cross my heart n' hope to die!

137
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,872
We volunteered to run supplies out to
everyone, but the situation was so bad.

201
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:24,213
You emerged from the carcass of a
fallen Titan in full view of your comrades!

278
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:57,374
It won't be pleasant, but in my heart,
I know what I'm doing is for the best.

274
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:41,526
I'm going to give you a little something
to make you forget for the time being.

210
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:54,190
Hell! For all I'm aware, you're a tactical
diversion precisely for that purpose!

269
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:19,033
Behave while I'm gone and I'll let you
in on what I've been doing in the cellar.

247
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:45,659
What was that he said about me coming
out of a Titan carcass in front of everyone?

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:15,566
The brute strength of these aberrations
trumped an average person's many times over.

34
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:55,565
A stark illustration of the disparity
between our own strength and that of the Titans.

185
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:37,395
anything I deem the least bit suspicious,
will be met with cannon fire. Do not test me.

198
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:15,972
You won't stand a chance! You'll be blown
to hell before you can assume your true form!

11
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:29,801
Ironically, they'd embarked on a reconnaissance
mission beyond the wall that very morning.

277
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:52,867
When the time comes though, know that you
must reclaim Wall Maria and head for the cellar.

6
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:31,948
withdrawing behind them in frightened huddles
for what was to be a century of uneasy peace.

138
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:12,804
We'd even found some gas we were gonna dole
out to you guys, but then everything went to hell.

202
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:30,497
A creature of unknown origin, ability, or allegiance
has slipped through and infiltrated Wall Rose,

19
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:56,272
Not that it's any of my business, but from a
public relations standpoint, you might wanna lighten up.

33
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:49,487
That said, excursions into long-relinquished territory
still commonly result in a death-toll exceeding 30%.

164
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:39,959
Kid. Difficult as it may be, you've got to wrangle
your mind to stay focused on what's here in front of us.

154
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:10,102
You gotta hand it to the Engineering Corps for puttin'
the heap of rancid Titan corpses to good use, I suppose.
