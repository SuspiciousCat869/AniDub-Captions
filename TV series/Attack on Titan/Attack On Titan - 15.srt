1
00:00:01,548 --> 00:00:04,286
You... You're all cowards!

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:09,084
Just shut up! And put
all your faith in me!

3
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:16,678
You don't need
a good "talking to."

4
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:19,743
What you're in need of,
boy, is to be taught a lesson.

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,456
Hm. Then I have made my choice.

6
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,635
And so it was that Eren became a
ward of the Scout Regiment,

7
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:31,796
and key to their planned
mission beyond the wall.

8
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,703
An architectural
marvel, don't you agree?

9
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,916
A proper royal
residence once upon a time;

10
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,834
and more recently,
our former headquarters.

11
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,568
Fancy, yes. But absurdly impractical
once the Scouts got down to business.

12
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:37,928
Much, much too far removed
from either river or wall.

13
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,681
This was the early
days for us, you understand.

14
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,218
Hopes soared high. Now, this opulent
bauble is a little more than a holding cell.

15
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:50,165
The place where
we store our newest toy.

16
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:55,618
Do not be deceived, greenhorn.

17
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:56,721
Excuse me?

18
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:59,120
Don't be expecting
the royal treatment.

19
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:03,464
Whether you're Titan or human, don't imagine for
a second we all share the good Captain's enthusi...

20
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:11,776
That's what you get for
flapping your jowls on horseback.

21
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,921
The rookie
needed to know his place.

22
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:16,058
First
impressions are important.

23
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:18,440
Well you certainly
made an impression on him.

24
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:19,902
No question there.

25
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:23,500
Indeed so. Our exchange
went exactly as planned.

26
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:27,680
What, um... What happened to you?
You never used to talk like this.

27
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:32,852
I mean. It's really none of my business,
but if you're trying to act like the Captain,

28
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:34,424
it's kind of embarrassing.

29
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,238
You and Levi couldn't be less alike
if you'd been born separate species.

30
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,763
If you intend to hound
me like a wife, Petra, dear,

31
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:46,030
there's rather more of me you need to be
acquainted with before laying claim to the privilege.

32
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:47,698
Ha. You wish.

33
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:50,703
I'd tell you to bite your
tongue, but you've got that covered.

34
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,580
Next time
I hope you bleed out.

35
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,937
Oh-ho-ho!

36
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:57,075
Methinks the
lady doth protest too much.

37
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,046
So here they are.

38
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,715
The Scouts'
Special Operations Squad.

39
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:04,423
The "Levi Squad."

40
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,664
You disgusting swineherd!

41
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:10,589
Petra Rall. Ten
Titan-kills to her credit;

42
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,664
forty-eight kill-assists.

43
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:18,526
Oruo Bozad. Thirty-nine
kills; nine assists.

44
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,835
Elite as they come.

45
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:27,954
Eld Gin. Fourteen
kills; thirty-two assists.

46
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:33,270
Gunther Schultz.
Seven kills; forty assists.

47
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:39,562
Every one of these Scouts was handpicked by
Captain Levi for accomplishments in the field.

48
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:43,050
That, and...
They're my executioners.

49
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:45,607
The ones who'll
end me if I lose it.

50
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:49,897
Look at these weeds.

51
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:52,193
This
place's gone to hell.

52
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,536
It's been
abandoned for years.

53
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,856
Bet the
inside's are shambles.

54
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:59,740
In which case we
have a problem, don't we?

55
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:02,935
Best grab a broom
and get to work.

56
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:14,002
I'm done with
the upstairs, sir.

57
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:19,159
If, uh... If I may ask, Captain,
where will I be expected to sleep?

58
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,288
Your sleeping quarters
are in the cellar.

59
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,878
The cellar? But, sir, again?

60
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,404
Our safest option.

61
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,233
Your abilities are far
from being under control.

62
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:32,140
You might go
Titan in your sleep.

63
00:05:32,196 --> 00:05:35,859
One of the conditions of my having you
in custody at all is that I keep you under

64
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,892
strict security
morning, noon, and night.

65
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:41,269
While we're in dreamland,
you're in restraints.

66
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,404
That's the rule.

67
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:45,335
I'll check your work.

68
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,727
Take over here.
I want it spotless.

69
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:48,711
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,102
Oh, Eren. Try not
to look so discouraged.

71
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,248
Sorry. I hope you
don't mind me calling you Eren.

72
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:02,235
I notice the
Captain does and, well,

73
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,483
he pretty much sets
the tone for the rest of us.

74
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:07,565
Whatever. It's just
that I, uh... well...

75
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:10,838
Did I really look discouraged,
or were you saying that?

76
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,546
Everyone
reacts that way.

77
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:17,068
Up close and personal, Captain Levi doesn't
seem much like the hero he's cracked up to be.

78
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:19,348
For one thing
he's a lot shorter.

79
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,827
Bit on the
temperamental side, too.

80
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,139
Not exactly imbued with what
you'd call the social graces.

81
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,485
It's not that. I'm more
put off by the seriousness.

82
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,717
He's so dead earnest about
following the higher-ups' rules.

83
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:37,008
Let me guess. You think strength means living
by your own rules, flouting everyone else's?

84
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:41,496
Well, he didn't strike me
as the type to take orders.

85
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:44,252
Time was he would've lived
up to your expectations.

86
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:47,343
That's what I understand anyway.
I don't have the details.

87
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:51,807
Story goes he was quite the
rogue before joining the Scouts.

88
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:54,206
A high roller in
the Capital's black market.

89
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:58,099
How the hell
did he... I mean...

90
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:02,135
No clue. Folks talk, but who knows
what really brought him here, right?

91
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,439
The most popular
version involves Erwin.

92
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,045
They say he dragged him to the
Scouts kicking and screaming.

93
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:09,680
The Commander?

94
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,604
What's going on?

95
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:12,795
Sir!

96
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,236
Your cleaning is lamentable.

97
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,720
Back upstairs. Now.

98
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,190
We're thirty days out from an expedition
to set up a logistics base beyond the wall.

99
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,685
And now you're saying we'll have a
crop of green recruits along for the ride?

100
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,330
Assuming
any sign up, yes.

101
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:35,924
Not to be a nay-sayer, but doesn't that
seem rash to you? Honestly, what are their odds?

102
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,897
Our custody of Eren is conditional
on the results of this mission.

103
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:44,242
Right now the first order of business is
persuading the brass we have him under control;

104
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:46,163
that's he's
an asset, not a threat.

105
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:50,574
The last thing we want is for the Military
Police to throw in their lot. Or someone else.

106
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,505
And you don't wanna give me
a straight answer. Is that it?

107
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:01,909
Your nose is as sharp
as ever, huh? Not bad.

108
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:06,096
Yeah, well. Not as sharp
as yours on a good day.

109
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:09,202
You'll have the
facts soon enough.

110
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:21,017
It's safe to assume our standing
orders will stretch into next week.

111
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:25,164
But word through the grapevine is we're
gearing up for a big mission a month from now.

112
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:29,780
One where a bunch of wet-behind-the-ears
graduates are slated to be our main backup.

113
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:33,243
That can't be right.
Why do something like that?

114
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:36,492
The cadets have been through
enough with the last Titan attack.

115
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:38,893
Why subject them to
that kind of danger again?

116
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:42,341
You have to wonder how many of those
snivel-drop runts peed themselves.

117
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,333
Surely this can't be the case.

118
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:47,330
Mission planning
isn't my responsibility.

119
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,665
But, it is Erwin's.

120
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,739
And you can bet the man's
obsessed over every angle.

121
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,167
That's the truth.

122
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,831
Especially given how
unique the situation is.

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,910
Consider how many people died
on the path to taking back Wall Maria,

124
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:03,342
then hope comes
in a form no one expected.

125
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,660
One that we're not even
entirely sure how to deal with.

126
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:17,205
Most of us still
find it hard to believe.

127
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:18,617
So how does it work?

128
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:21,210
This whole changing
into a Titan trick. Really?

129
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:25,540
Wish I could tell you, but the
fact is my memory's not clear.

130
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:28,034
Guess it's kinda
like being in a trance.

131
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:33,103
I do know the trigger seems to be hurting
myself in some way. Like biting my hand.

132
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:38,131
Wait. Why do I
know that, but nothing else?

133
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:41,205
You're not going to
get anything out of him.

134
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:44,217
Apart from what the scribblers
have laid out in the reports.

135
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:47,785
Huh. Not that you-know-
who won't have a go at it.

136
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:52,996
You'll be lucky to come out of
it alive if that one lays into you.

137
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,450
'Course it's
only a matter of time.

138
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:56,784
Who're
you talking about?

139
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,111
Oww!

140
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:05,073
I'm so sorry. Good
evening, Team Levi!

141
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:07,471
How is castle
life treating everyone?

142
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:09,300
You're too early.

143
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:11,763
Am I? S'pose
I couldn't help myself.

144
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,414
Section Commander Hange?

145
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,795
Hello, Eren.

146
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,564
In the event you haven't
pieced it together yet,

147
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:20,836
it's my job to spearhead the
Scout Regiment's research efforts.

148
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:24,284
Essentially, I poke and prod
our captive Titan specimens.

149
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:26,048
I'd very much like your help.

150
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:28,636
My help? In what way?

151
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:30,342
Like, what
would I have to do?

152
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:31,680
Join me, of course!

153
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:34,715
On a quest of
scientific discovery!

154
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,330
Well, uh... I'm happy to help,
except I'm afraid it's not up to me.

155
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,971
I'm under close restrictions by
order of the higher ups, you see.

156
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:45,417
Levi! What's on the
docket for him tomorrow?

157
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:47,325
Clearing out all the weeds.

158
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:49,888
Excellent, then! It's cinched!

159
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,918
Young man, tomorrow
will be grand.

160
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,367
Uh. 'Kay... But, uh...

161
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,136
Just so I'm clear, what
exactly will I be doing?

162
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,818
Hm?

163
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:05,044
Are you running
experiments or something?

164
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,887
Idiot. Shut up.

165
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,603
Ah. I knew it.

166
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:13,417
You possess a singularly
curious mind, don't you?

167
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,123
Well, my inquisitive
friend, if you insist.

168
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,753
Why not lay
it all on the table?

169
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:36,745
I intend to get better acquainted
with the Titans we lucked upon in Trost.

170
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:53,989
As a scientist, naturally I started with the
standard battery of tests we conduct on all such captures.

171
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:57,530
Hello, beautiful.

172
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,942
First was an
attempt at communication.

173
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:05,475
How're we feeling?

174
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:08,305
Do you have
a name? Are you in pain?

175
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:11,841
Section commander!
You're too close!

176
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,052
Hi there! Lovely
weather, don't you think?

177
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:18,282
Are you hungry?

178
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:21,994
Whoa! That was close!

179
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,867
That's what
I've been trying to tell you!

180
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:27,857
Sadly, my findings were consistent
with all other past attempts.

181
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,345
No communication
with them seemed possible.

182
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,791
That said, my time spent in intimate proximity
to these creatures did indeed help me cope

183
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:40,140
with the tediousness
of day-to-day tasks.

184
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:46,125
Once upon a time, many centuries ago now,
there lived a vicious tribe of cannibals.

185
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:52,337
You may think I'm speaking of your kind,
but in fact, these cannibals were human.

186
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,657
They would maraud unwary
travelers near their cave.

187
00:12:55,975 --> 00:13:00,608
Their ruthless palate did not discriminate
between merchant and clergymen; highborn or low.

188
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,842
Valuables were taken,
flesh feasted upon.

189
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:05,579
We gotta go
through this again?

190
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,519
Her naming scheme is so weird.

191
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:10,285
Yeah. What'd she end
up going with last time?

192
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,389
It was Chikatilo and Albert.

193
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:17,832
In the end, these cannibals subsisted on
human meat for twenty-five years, give or take.

194
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,494
Historians suspect they killed somewhere
around five hundred people during that time.

195
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:27,396
That's probably more victims than
the two of you have gorged on, combined.

196
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:31,909
To their credit, though, they
perfected the art of preparing flesh.

197
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:35,343
Steaks cut
from hind-quarter meat.

198
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,497
Leg meat
diced and added to stew.

199
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:42,023
Belly fat ground
into patties and fried.

200
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:45,693
Sausages made from blood
clots and intestinal lining.

201
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:50,271
In fact. One might even suggest
they furthered the culinary arts.

202
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:52,940
In that respect they
were distinct from you.

203
00:13:53,789 --> 00:14:00,082
Alas, this tribe of gourmandizing cannibals were
caught and executed by the providence of a single mistake.

204
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,442
In that respect you
aren't so dissimilar.

205
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:08,607
You both underestimated your quarry's resourcefulness
and wound up captured. Victims of your own appetite.

206
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:15,446
In honor of the cannibal tribe's notorious leader,
I'm going to christen you beauties accordingly.

207
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:17,964
You'll be "Sawney."

208
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:20,115
You are "Beane."

209
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:26,482
No need to fret, though. I'm not going to
publicly disembowel you or burn you at the stake.

210
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,945
Pleasure to meet you,
Sawney. Likewise, Beane.

211
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,787
Let's be chums, huh?

212
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:41,428
That's how I came to name the 7-meter Titan,
"Beane," and his grinning 4-meter companion "Sawney."

213
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:49,047
The next step involved
sensory deprivation;

214
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:50,438
denying them sunlight.

215
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,200
Observing as we do that Titans are
less active in the nocturnal hours,

216
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:59,050
we may extrapolate from this experiment that
the sun is likely a key source of energy for them.

217
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:03,221
Nevertheless, I discovered a
profound difference between the two.

218
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:06,247
Well done, Sawney.

219
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:10,053
See you in the morning.
Sweet dreams, ya lug.

220
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:15,996
Corroborating previous data, Sawney grew
notably sluggish after only an hour's lack of sun.

221
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:18,705
My, my, someone's
certainly the night owl, huh?

222
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,161
You're going to wear me out.

223
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:21,265
Ah well.

224
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:24,084
This wouldn't be my first
all-nighter in the name of science.

225
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:28,977
Beane, however,
still beamed three hours in.

226
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:33,325
A staggering
find, believe me.

227
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,825
They don't require
food or water to survive.

228
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,117
They possess vocal organs,

229
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,367
but have absolutely
no need to breathe.

230
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,284
The only thing their
bodies metabolize

231
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,284
into energy is sunlight.

232
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:45,742
Every Titan may have
a different threshold for

233
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,075
sunlight withdrawal,
so I have be careful.

234
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,367
Don't want 'em
dying on me, ya know?

235
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,075
Several have passed
on in captivity

236
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,825
owing to my
ignorance, sad to say.

237
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:56,992
Two in particular
perished of decapitation

238
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:59,700
when we accidentally
struck the soft spot.

239
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:03,034
Poor devils. Chikatiloni
and Albert, their names were.

240
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:06,159
Such adorable,
ear-to-ear smiles.

241
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:10,575
What I did to them
was terrible. It haunts me.

242
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,075
I mustn't
let that happen again.

243
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,825
I couldn't bear it.

244
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,700
Yeah, no. Sure.

245
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:23,700
Carrying on! Physical
contact with them was

246
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,700
the next obvious step,
because I simply had to know

247
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,242
whether or not they
experienced pain as you or I!

248
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:37,950
Whoa! It isn't necessary for
you to scream, Section Comma...

249
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,867
I can't do this and
not scream, damn you!

250
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,325
Look at him!
He's in absolute agony!

251
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:49,534
My poor Beane! I'm
so sorry! Hang in there!

252
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,075
It was the
only way to learn

253
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,659
if they
had any weaknesses.

254
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:55,492
Apart from
their napes, you see.

255
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:58,034
I hated myself for it.

256
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,242
Sawney. Sweet pea.

257
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,325
I've skewered you
straight through the heart.

258
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,992
Does it not hurt, dear?
Don't you feel that?

259
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:10,534
Sawney was
more, shall we say

260
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:12,700
introverted
than his counterpart.

261
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:15,867
If he felt pain,
he was unwilling to show it.

262
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,700
Go on. Talk to me.

263
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:21,534
Ow!

264
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:24,034
For the love of
god, stand clear!

265
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:27,992
You almost got me that
time, didn't ya, darling?

266
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:30,075
You want your
head chomped off?

267
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:33,242
Sawney's
range of expression is,

268
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,159
somewhat
limited, I think.

269
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:37,992
The only things he
knows to do are lunge and bite.

270
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:40,075
Commander. All due respect.

271
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:44,367
But how can you be
so lighthearted about them?

272
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,159
You talk like
they're badly behaved pets.

273
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:51,034
It's just... They're
the single greatest threat

274
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,742
mankind has ever faced.

275
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:55,034
They've nearly
driven us to extinction.

276
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,034
You're a Scout,
you know that.

277
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,992
You've seen them
in action countless times.

278
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:03,450
True. In fact, more
than my fair share of friends

279
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:06,909
have died in the jaws of
a Titan, right in front of me.

280
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:10,200
When I first became
a Scout, I fought them

281
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:12,617
out of pure,
white-hot hatred.

282
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,034
But one day,
I came to a realization.

283
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,492
I'd kicked
the severed head of

284
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:21,992
a 3-meter
Titan out of spite.

285
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:26,325
It weighed
next to nothing.

286
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,659
Might as well
have been a feather.

287
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,575
In the realm of
improbability, that fact would

288
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:34,409
seem to rank fairly high.

289
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:37,492
Their, utter strength
argues against it.

290
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,325
And such was
the case with every Titan.

291
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:41,867
Contrary
to the appearance

292
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,242
of density
and great mass,

293
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,909
the severed limbs
were light as tree bark.

294
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,950
I've been
given to understand that

295
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:50,284
when you
transform, your Titan body

296
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:53,950
materializes
as if out of thin air.

297
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,367
It's so bizarre.

298
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,950
In fact, the only
way I can think

299
00:18:58,034 --> 00:19:00,159
to describe it is to say
their appearance stands

300
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,950
in sharp contrast
to their true substance.

301
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:09,242
We've been fumbling
around in the dark.

302
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:12,867
Our prime offensive tactic
based on contempt and fear.

303
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:16,200
We need a fresh strategy,
one guided by knowledge.

304
00:19:16,284 --> 00:19:19,325
A whole new way of
looking at the enemy.

305
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,450
Of course it could be
a complete waste of time.

306
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:26,700
Still, though. Nothing
ventured, nothing gained.

307
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,450
Joining the Scouts
has been an eye-opener.

308
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,159
Shock after shock.

309
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,659
And it's not just
Section Commander Hange.

310
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:41,867
Everyone
here's a little off.

311
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,617
It's like I've wandered
into a sanctuary for crackpots.

312
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,034
But... they're
striving for change.

313
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:52,492
That's been the appeal
of the Scouts all along, right?

314
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,450
Commander Hange!

315
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:57,825
If you don't mind, I
think I should hear about

316
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:59,992
these experiments
in greater detail.

317
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,784
What? Really?

318
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,242
Yes! I want
to know everything!

319
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:07,742
If I'm going to help
you tomorrow, I'll need it.

320
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:09,784
Ah. Good point.

321
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,034
Well, I might've glossed over

322
00:20:12,117 --> 00:20:14,575
one or two important
details. Right!

323
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:17,700
Full disclosure, then!
We may be here a while.

324
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,117
Good!

325
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,659
I ought to start
from our first captured Titan.

326
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,700
That was the birth of
my first hypothesis, you see.

327
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,742
Carried to its
natural conclusion, though,

328
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:31,867
the experiment yielded
nothing of positive value.

329
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,575
But listen to
me rambling on!

330
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:36,034
I'm sure you surmised
all this from your training.

331
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,117
They did cover
this stuff, right?

332
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,409
Yes. They did.
Every last bit.

333
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,200
Great!
We can use that as a

334
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,200
jumping off
point for my own theories!

335
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:46,575
Let us
review, shall we?

336
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,492
Huh? Well, I...

337
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:50,325
Consider
how the Titans sus...

338
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:52,742
Section Commander
Hange, come quickly!

339
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,992
The test subjects!

340
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:57,950
They're dead!
Both of them killed!

341
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,742
Sawney! Beane!

342
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:11,617
How could this happen?!

343
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,825
Someone tell
me this isn't real!

344
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,700
They were
such valuable specimens.

345
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:19,325
Is this a soldier's work?

346
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,700
Yeah. But they haven't
pegged the one responsible yet.

347
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:25,200
They were killed
just before dawn, apparently.

348
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,159
By the time
the guards got here,

349
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:29,742
the bastard cleared
out on ODM gear.

350
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:31,534
Whoever it was
must've had a lookout

351
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,200
to warn him about the guards.

352
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:35,325
Sawney!

353
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:36,617
Oh dear.

354
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,075
Someone's gone stark
raving mad, haven't they?

355
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,367
How did this...
How'd it happen?

356
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,409
Let it go. This is a matter
for the Military Police.

357
00:21:46,492 --> 00:21:48,325
Uh. Yes, sir.

358
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,867
What is it you think you see?

359
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:58,534
Who do you think
the real enemy is here?

360
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:05,700
Ignore me.
Loaded question.

361
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,242
As the
manhunt for the assassin of

362
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:57,409
Sawney
and Beane gets underway.

363
00:23:57,492 --> 00:23:59,450
Mikasa,
Armin, and their comrades

364
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:02,034
in the
104th Cadet Corps must,

365
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:04,950
for better or
worse, decide to which regiment

366
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:07,117
they
will pledge their lives.
