1
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:07,380
Go!

2
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:20,787
In the year 850, humankind reclaimed
lands from the Titans for the first time

3
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:23,658
since their appearance some hundred-odd years before.

4
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:26,073
The cost, however, was great.

5
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:31,704
You who stayed, you are now one of us.

6
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:34,169
Allow me to welcome you to the Scout Regiment.

7
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:36,608
This is a genuine salute, soldiers!

8
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:38,475
Together, we give our hearts!

9
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:41,223
Sir!

10
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,850
Those of you standing here have worked through your fear.

11
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:50,449
You've proven yourselves courageous.

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,470
Each one of you has my respect.

13
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:58,650
One short month later, led by Erwin Smith,

14
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:00,619
the Scout Regiment set out.

15
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:04,710
Leaving the relative comfort
and safety of Calaneth District,

16
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,395
they sought to carve a route to Shiganshina,

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,875
the place believed to hold the Titans' secrets.

18
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:16,540
It's officially begun. The 57th Recon Mission!

19
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:19,384
Scouts, move out!

20
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:19,765
We've got a ten-meter closing in from the left! Gah!

21
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:22,855
I want to know what's rolling
around in that glorious belly!

22
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:25,619
Never mind. Let the support squad do their job.

23
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,095
Damn! Too shallow!

24
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,114
Just focus on defending the ranks!

25
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:42,057
Eyes front! Their job's to
handle it. Yours is to keep moving!

26
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:47,684
Forward! Ride for all you're worth!

27
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:55,898
They'll only have our backs
'til we're clear of the city ruins.

28
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:59,068
Everything beyond that will be
uninterrupted Titan territory.

29
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,880
We'll be more or less on our own.

30
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:05,325
The only thing to fall back on out there is
Commander Erwin's long-range scouting formation.

31
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,611
The special ops squad'll be positioned here.

32
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,735
Loaded question. Be straight with me.

33
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,343
You think my friends have a shot at taking down a Titan?

34
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:20,759
Really? I should certainly hope so, otherwise
what the hell have they been training for?

35
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,436
Now listen, and listen well. Prepared or not,

36
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,625
you're all Scouts, which means the time
is nigh to choke back those fears and...!

37
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,684
Long-range formation. Let's go!

38
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:42,830
See you 'round. Good luck.

39
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:46,445
Do us a favor if you run into
one of 'em and don't piss yourself.

40
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,597
Yeah. Same goes for you.

41
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,166
The long-range scouting formation
is a forward-facing semicircle.

42
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:05,308
We'll be positioned relative to one another at
equal intervals within view of signal fire on all sides.

43
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,320
The idea is to extend our spotting
and signal range as far as possible.

44
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,165
Stay calm. You're alright.

45
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:46,509
You can bet the lucky bastards riding in the
front-row spotting squads will see a lot of Titans.

46
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:55,256
The second one comes into view, lock and load.

47
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:58,513
Alert your nearest comrades with a red smoke signal.

48
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:04,504
They in turn will alert their nearest
comrades by doing the same, and so on.

49
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:11,186
Once the commander feels he has a
decent read on the Titan's position,

50
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,810
he'll be firing off a green smoke signal.

51
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:17,266
At the sight of one, the
platoon is to reroute accordingly.

52
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:22,589
The fewer Titans confronted head-on
en route to our goal, the better;

53
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,093
we'll need all the able bodies we can
spare. The name of the game then is evasion.

54
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:32,438
Now keep in mind, this isn't a foolproof strategy.

55
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:36,809
The terrain is wild; plenty of
places for the enemy to lie in ambush.

56
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:46,470
Red smoke. Have to fire...

57
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,865
Braus! Over here!

58
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:57,110
Damn! The Spotters missed a live one!

59
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:59,286
I say we lure it in our direction!

60
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,827
Braus! Cross back over to us!

61
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,850
Break away! I'll take care of it!

62
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,064
Sir!

63
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:34,416
Sorry!

64
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:37,475
It's alright, he's out. Return to your position.

65
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,849
Something feels off.

66
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:49,798
It's been too long since the last red signal,
and the formation's still all over the map.

67
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:50,996
Wait.

68
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:56,081
Keep in mind too, this whole approach
assumes we'll be dealing largely with Normals;

69
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:58,369
Titans whose behavior is predictable.

70
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:06,379
Black smoke? There's a Titan ignoring the
outliers and making a b-line for the center!

71
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:10,405
That can only mean...

72
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:13,161
...an Abnormal!

73
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,676
If one or more of those show up, I'm
afraid we'll have no choice but to engage.

74
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,103
Son of a... Well there's no help for it I guess. Heads up!

75
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:25,813
The nape's all yours, okay? I'll go for the legs!

76
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,051
You got it!

77
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,700
ODM gear's worth squat on level ground.

78
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,107
I'm not exactly thrilled about our odds here.

79
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:37,070
But hell, we can't let it break up the formation!

80
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:40,701
Arlelt's up ahead at my ten o'clock, isn't he?

81
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,434
I'm not letting a rookie face this bastard alone!

82
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:45,325
It's now or never!

83
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,433
All yours, Cis!

84
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:04,471
Way to go! Nicely done, Ness!

85
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:08,334
Not so bad.

86
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,092
Hey, hey! Nothing scares you, huh?

87
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:16,667
That's my li'l darlin' Charrette!

88
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:28,762
Not again. What in the hell are the
right wing spotters doing back there?

89
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:31,206
Looks like we've got another Abnormal on our hands.

90
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,263
It's not their fault.

91
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:35,488
Ahhhh. I hate these things.

92
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,054
Fine. One more for the road, then.

93
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:38,737
Right!

94
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:44,805
Damn it. Someone mind tellin' me what we did to
deserve two in a row? Bad enough it's an Abnormal,

95
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:48,491
but it's gotta be 14 meters.
This is gonna be a pain in the ass.

96
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:00,256
It's moving so fast. Too fast!

97
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,260
We have to keep it clear of Arlelt! Cis!

98
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:04,474
On it!

99
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,944
Did that really just happen?

100
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:44,875
We're not dealing with an Abnormal.
This thing's showing intelligence!

101
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,902
Like the Colossal. Like Eren!

102
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,945
It's a human being wrapped in a Titan body!

103
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:53,369
But who? Why?

104
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:58,407
What am I gonna do? I'm dead! I'm so dead!

105
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,153
Go! Make a break for it!

106
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,631
Why is it...

107
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,453
No. Why are they...

108
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,458
...doing this?

109
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:36,452
Somebody tell the others.

110
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,228
The right-wing spotters are all but wiped out.

111
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:43,329
Tell Commander Erwin...

112
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,053
that the Female Titan brought a hoard with her.

113
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:50,788
Is anyone left? There has to be someone.

114
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,301
Huh?

115
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:53,049
This doesn't make any sense. Why
didn't it... Why didn't it kill me?

116
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:58,280
It pulled back my hood. Looked at my...

117
00:12:58,596 --> 00:13:00,886
Why would it need to check my face?

118
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:02,269
Armin!

119
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:04,436
Reiner!

120
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:09,339
Hey. Can you ride? What the hell are you doing?

121
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:13,199
This is full-blown Titan country,
you can't be without a horse! Climb on!

122
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:19,315
I came as fast as I could when I saw the black smoke.

123
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:21,722
Nice ass for an Abnormal, you gotta admit.

124
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,065
It's not an Abnormal.

125
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,425
It's a person controlling a Titan body.

126
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:26,529
Wait. What?

127
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:31,471
I'll explain in a second. We need to
fire off a signal to warn the others!

128
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,537
Come on! Work you piece of garbage!

129
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:35,840
It's an emergency!

130
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:39,875
Hey. It's alright. Looks like Jean's got you covered.

131
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:47,883
Oh man, that's not good. The right-wing spotters
have suffered too many causalities to carry on!

132
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,093
Yeah, apparently most of them
were wiped out by a Titan ambush.

133
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:55,121
I don't know how it happened, but it
was bad. Sons-a-bitches were lighting-fast.

134
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:57,282
The spotters didn't have time to react.

135
00:13:57,423 --> 00:14:01,562
Whoever's left is trying to hold them off, but
that means now there's no one on lookout duty.

136
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:03,492
Talk about a setback, right?

137
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:05,931
If we don't watch ourselves,
we're all gonna get wiped out.

138
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:07,845
Wait. She came from that direction.

139
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:09,684
Does that mean...

140
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:12,079
Could she have led the Titans here like a commander?

141
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:13,532
Who, her?

142
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,510
Why the hell's she running from us, by the way?

143
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,366
Is she an Abnormal?

144
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:21,147
No, she's isn't. I still don't know how it's possible,

145
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:24,206
but she's another human who's taken Titan form.

146
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:26,805
Someone who has the same power as Eren.

147
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,306
Please say you're not serious.

148
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,671
Really? Why do you think that?

149
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:34,676
Titans eat people, but they're not murderers.

150
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,632
Sure, they kill us in the
process, but that's not their intent;

151
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,705
they just feed on instinct like any creature.

152
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:42,867
This one was different. When the others went for her nape,

153
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:44,815
she struck them down in cold blood.

154
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:46,736
Swatted them like flies.

155
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:50,956
She didn't eat them; she killed them and moved on.

156
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,857
That's out of character, even for an Abnormal.

157
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:56,527
The Titans that took out the right-wing?

158
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:58,083
I think she brought them here.

159
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:00,730
Just like the Colossal and the Armored when they struck.

160
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,208
I just know it.

161
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,615
She's not simply satisfying bloodlust.

162
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,100
She has it in for us.

163
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,409
Or perhaps more specifically,

164
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:12,312
I think she's actually after someone in particular.

165
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,697
At which point the question becomes who and why?

166
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:18,581
Hey, wait a second, could it be Eren?

167
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:21,767
Eren? He's with Levi Squad.

168
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:25,150
They're spearheading the right-wing. Or, they were.

169
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,995
Wait. Levi's team?

170
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,546
I'm pretty sure you're wrong there, big guy.

171
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,802
My copy of the plan had them in the left wing.

172
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:35,957
That's odd, because my copy of the plan
had them at the front of the right-wing, too,

173
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:38,270
which now that I think about it doesn't make sense.

174
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:41,384
Putting them at the vanguard like
that wouldn't be smart strategically.

175
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,222
Then where exactly are they supposed to be?

176
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:47,535
Come on, where else? The safest position in the formation.

177
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,062
Which, I assume, at least,
would be rear of the center rank.

178
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,806
Armin! Now's not the time to be
chasin' our own tails about this!

179
00:15:56,861 --> 00:16:00,444
We've got to get word out how dangerous
this one is; smoke signals aren't gonna cut it!

180
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:03,288
At this rate, she'll cut down the command squad!

181
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:06,656
We let that happen, the formation
goes to hell and we all die!

182
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,736
You have a plan?

183
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:13,052
More of a wing and a prayer. Look, we've got to try
and distract her so the platoon has a chance to retreat.

184
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,214
If we're careful, from this distance
we should be able to manage it.

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,142
And make it out alive.

186
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,001
Well, maybe anyway.

187
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:24,746
She's smarter than the ones we usually deal with.

188
00:16:24,873 --> 00:16:28,648
You can take my word for it. From her
perspective we're little more than insects.

189
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:30,969
One swipe of that arm and we're all flattened.

190
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:32,620
Is that a fact?

191
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:35,423
What a terrifying thought.

192
00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:38,380
Seriously. What have you done with the real Jean?

193
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:42,956
No offense, man, but the one I knew could
only be counted on to look out for himself.

194
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:45,331
Your people skills need work.

195
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:50,918
Believe me, friends. I'm still all about number one.

196
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:54,134
I just don't wanna end up a pile
of bones no one knows were mine.

197
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:57,481
Thing is, I get it now.

198
00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:00,977
I get what needs to be done if
we're going to survive this fight!

199
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:04,034
And last I checked, nobody
forced us to take on this position.

200
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:05,735
Now are you with me or not?

201
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,348
Pull your hood all the way over so it covers you.

202
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,729
She won't try to kill you if she can't see your face!

203
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:20,309
If she's looking for someone specific, she won't
mow us down unless she knows for sure we're not them.

204
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:25,293
Good idea. As far as she knows, any one
of us could be Eren underneath this getup.

205
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,076
That's actually kind of an encouraging thought.

206
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:31,412
Hey, you never know, maybe we'll get
lucky and she'll be near-sighted to boot.

207
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:37,625
Not gonna lie. The way you clung to Eren like a
security blanket all the time used to really creep me out.

208
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:40,016
But I always knew you were brilliant.

209
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:42,017
Uh. Okay, thank you.

210
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:45,378
Not exactly sure how I ought to take that, but thanks.

211
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,382
She's slowed a bit since she first came at us.

212
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:05,773
Tired maybe? Let's hope.

213
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:07,672
If she speeds up, we lose her.

214
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,017
We have to do this now, before she gets her wind back!

215
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:19,605
Okay, guys. Like we discussed.

216
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:23,912
Lure her away from the others so
they have a chance to get out of here.

217
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,414
Keep her on our trail for as long as possible.

218
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,684
Give the rest of the platoon plenty of time.

219
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,031
Slicing her Achilles' tendon should do the trick, I think.

220
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:36,560
Nothing crazy. If she's what
Armin says, we need her alive.

221
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:39,373
She's aware of her soft spot, so she'll defend it.

222
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,787
No run of-the-mill nightmare, this one.

223
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:43,861
Killing her is out of the question.

224
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:48,748
Well, it would be for normal people anyway,
So let's just focus on keeping her distracted.

225
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:54,903
When the time comes, maybe they could take her down.

226
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,147
Armin!

227
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,749
The moves on this one, she's like a damn athlete!

228
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:47,428
We are so screwed! Didn't think this through!

229
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:54,355
What? She's protecting her weak spot?

230
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:55,747
Jean!

231
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:59,575
Damn it! There's nothing I can do.

232
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,468
I'm a dead man! She's gonna yank my wire and...!

233
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,712
Jean! Don't let that suicidal maniac die in vain!

234
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,246
What the...?

235
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,312
Why did she stop?

236
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:18,975
She did it! She's the one who killed him!

237
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,072
I told him the right wing was
suicide but he went along anyway!

238
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:24,407
And how he's dead, thanks to her!

239
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:32,728
What the hell's going on?

240
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,908
Of all the times for Armin to get the sense
knocked out of him! What's he talkin' about?

241
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,377
Reiner.

242
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:43,185
She crushed my best friend, I saw it with my own eyes!

243
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:45,901
His entrails were stuck to the bottom of her foot!

244
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:52,066
He's going straight for the nape? Of course!

245
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:54,783
Now's his chance, while she's focused on Armin!

246
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,828
Oh no. No.

247
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:21,804
No! Reiner. Oh, god.

248
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,458
That beautiful bastard!

249
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:46,344
Mikasa's been hogging so much of the limelight these
days, I'd let myself forget how much of a badass he is.

250
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,374
Odds are that bought the platoon more than enough time.

251
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,575
I say we follow suit and get outta here!

252
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:55,831
If she doesn't have an appetite for people like
you say, I'm guessin' she's not gonna follow us.

253
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:05,962
Alright! Looks like she's in retreat!

254
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,862
Poor thing's running home with her tail between her legs!

255
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,888
What? Wait. No.

256
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:14,867
She's headed for the center rank.

257
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:19,237
She's... She's going for Eren!

258
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:56,174
The monster advances.

259
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:59,682
Even the Scout Regiment, for all its training and skill,

260
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:02,047
cannot bring its newest foe to heel.

261
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:07,825
Until at last, in a forest of giant
trees, she catches sight of her goal.
