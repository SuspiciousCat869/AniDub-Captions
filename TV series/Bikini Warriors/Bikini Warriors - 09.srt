Great.

All done over here.

00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,166
Let's move!

[MAGE]
Die!

00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,916
[FIGHTER yelps]
What was that for?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,708
What in the world do
you think you're doing?

Kill them all! Kill them all!

It's like she's turned into

15
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,625
a completely different person!

16
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,791
Yes! That's exactly
what's it's like.

17
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,416
I'm being controlled by magic,
can't you guys see that?

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,375
We're a team, do you really
think I'd ever try to hurt you?

Hey! What's the matter,
can't you hear me?

You deserve to die!

All three of you!

00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,666
You betrayed me!

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,791
Betrayed? What's
she talking about?

24

[ALL gasp]
Oh no!

25
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,291
[FIGHTER]
Is this because that one time

26
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,541
I gave you less food
than everyone else?

27
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,875
[DARKELF] Or is this about
the time I secretly tried on

28
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,041
your panties?

[PALADIN]
Don't tell me it's because

32
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,500
I can't stop staring at
your adorable little body,

33
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,958
and wanting to lick
and rub you all over?

You tried on her panties?!
What's wrong with you?

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,750
You're despicable!

37
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,750
Didn't you ever think it
might be wrong to do that?

38
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:41,916
What about you?!

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,125
It's true, you might
be terrible people.

40
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,666
But I swear, I'm not mad at you!

Time to die!

[ALL gasp, yelp]

43
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,666
I mean, it's true that

44
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,708
we might have crossed the
line a couple of times...

45
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,583
...but still!

46
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,916
You were our friend once.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,916
But anyone who stands in
our way must be defeated!

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,625
[DARKELF]
If this is how it has to end,

49
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,333
then so be it!

50
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sorry!

51
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,708
But we have a duty to
fulfill, no matter what!

It's sad, but true!

Goodbye, Friend.

We'll never forget you!

[MAGE gasps]
Wait a second!

Guys, can't you see I'm
being controlled by magic?

Please! Don't
apologize like that!

We will continue our journey
in your tragic absence.

Watch over us.

[MAGE]
Uh, you guys?

67
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,333
I know I'm totally
dead and everything,

68
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,208
but if you just go and
pay the church some money,

69
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,666
they can bring me back to life!

70

Um...

71
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,041
I know you're already
aware of that,

72

but just in case you forgot.

enough with the joke,
