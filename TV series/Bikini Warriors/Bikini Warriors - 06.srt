Women have been attacked

00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,625
Whoa! That's really scary.

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,708
What kind of devil
would do such a thing?!

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,458
I think it sounds kinda fun.

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,083
No, wait! It's terrible!

9
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,083
We have to stop this
creepy monster right away!

Uh...But I'm really scared!

11

Well... We are
heroes, after all!

Let's do this!

00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,000
[DARKELF] Hm... What's
the deal with this sign?

14
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,375
Don't you think it's weird?

15
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,458
Why would a sign have so
many randomly placed holes?

[whimpers] This forest is
really spooky, don't you think?

18
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,958
The enemy could
attack us from any side!

19
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,041
So be on your guard!

You have no chance now, my prey.

Oh! It's like he knows exactly

Don't worry!

We're gonna get you out of
this one way or the other.

Uh... I'll turn you into a frog!

be a really cute one!

This can't be
happening to me!

How can I be defeated

48
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:24,000
by a group of pathetic
little girls like you?

49

This is the end!

Sure is!

00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,291
That was pretty
dangerous back there.

00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,708
Our enemies have been
really tough lately.

61
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,291
[DARKELF]
Yes, that's true.

62
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,166
And I imagine that they're only
going to get tougher from here.

63
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,291
But whatever the
danger we face may be,

64
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,750
we're heroes, and we'll keep
fighting, no matter the cost!

65
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,875
Until the day peace is restored,
the four of us will journey on

66
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,083
and fight to rid the
world of all evil!

67
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,666
[MAGE chuckles]
We sure will!

68
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,208
All right, let's go!

69
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,583
Yeah! Right!
