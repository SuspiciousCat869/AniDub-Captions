Finally, another treasure chest!

00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,083
It's been such a tough dungeon!

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,083
We're almost completely
out of health and mana!

5
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,500
We need a regen item.

00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,541
If we don't find a way
to revive our strength,

7
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,375
then we're never gonna
make it to the boss!

8
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,625
I disagree.

9
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,125
The enemies down here
are too strong for us.

10
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,958
What we really need now
is a more powerful weapon!

11
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,958
Well... Let's open it!

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,333
No, wait. What if
it's another trap?

Yeah. Good point.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,541
The treasure chests in this
place have been a handful.

A treasure chest already?

No! Please don't let go of me!

[DARKELF]
With my magic,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,708
I can see what's
behind any wall

33
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:33,000
or inside any treasure
chest, without opening it.

34
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,458
[FIGHTER] Then why didn't
you do that from the start?

35
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:36,291
[DARKELF]
I see it!

36
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,125
There's something inside!

37
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,500
[FIGHTER]
Okay! Here goes!

38
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:44,291
So gross! Why'd it
have to be eels?!

39
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,625
I told you there was something
inside of that chest.

40
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,791
Unless you can tell us what it
is, it doesn't really help much!

41
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,583
Oh my! Yes!

42
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,333
I'll admit, this feels
surprisingly delightful.

That's it, go faster.

[FIGHTER]
It's true.

48
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,208
Most of the chests so
far have been traps.

49
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,791
But that doesn't
mean this one is too,

50
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,208
we have to take the risk!

51
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,166
I used my magic
to look inside it.

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,541
I'm absolutely certain.

53
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,000
There is something
in that chest.

54
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,958
We've already established
that doesn't help.

55
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,958
[MAGE] Yeah, but what if it's
a regen item that we need?

56
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,458
We have to open it.

57
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,500
Or we'll never
know what's inside.

Perhaps you seek
the Token of Courage?

Or perhaps not?

Perhaps you want
the Crest of Justice?

We don't want either those.

have any weapons
