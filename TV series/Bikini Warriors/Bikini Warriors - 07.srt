1
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,958
[FIGHTER]
"World's greatest swordsman.

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,916
Inexperienced in battle,
but... kinda knows

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,708
the next-door neighbor of
the cousin of the friend

4
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,500
who defeated the Demon Lord
seventy years ago."

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,208
[DARKELF] So much for recruiting
another member of the party.

6
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,375
For someone who's all talk, this
guy sure is full of himself.

7
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,875
[FIGHTER]
Oh, and you're not?

8
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,541
[PALADIN] Have you forgotten
what you were like

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,791
when you first started with us?

10
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,208
[DARKELF]
So, you people have come here

11
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,958
because you want my help?

12
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,541
You've got a strong eye
for talent, that's for sure.

13
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,416
Whoa... I've never met
a Dark Elf before!

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,666
Wow! She looks really strong.

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,833
No offense, but what
can you actually do?

16
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,250
Not only can elves wield
swords and use magic,

17
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,333
but we live longer than any
human could ever dream of.

18
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,958
Not to mention, we're
very knowledgeable

19
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,500
in almost every aspect
of life as we know it.

20
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,291
Of course, I don't mean to brag.

21
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,291
Oh please, like hell you don't!

22
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,833
[chuckles] I know she's a bit
on the cocky side, but if we can

23
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,000
get her to join our party,
she'll be a powerful ally

24
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,125
to us on our dangerous quest!

25
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,708
Are you positive we're going
the right way this time?

26
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,500
Trust me, there's
no need to worry.

27
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,625
The great spirits of
the wind always guide me

28
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,041
and lead me towards the light.

29
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,041
That's what you keep
saying over and over again,

30
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,125
but we've been
lost for two days!

31
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,458
Ye of little faith.

32
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,375
Relax and leave
everything to me.

33
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,791
[MAGE cries]

34
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,625
Let me go!

35
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,458
[PALADIN yelps]

36
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,208
No! Don't touch me!

37
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,583
Please stop it!

38
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,166
[MAGE, PALADIN crying]

39
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,333
[FIGHTER] This one's
way too strong for us!

40
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,041
We'll see about that!

41
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,916
Allow me!

42
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,250
[gasps] What is that?

43
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,750
[gasps] I don't know,

44
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,083
but I'm sensing some powerful
magic emanating from her!

45
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,125
[DARKELF]
Ultimate... Thunderburst!

46
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,625
[sizzle]

47
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:02,208
[MAGE, PALADIN crying]

48
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,958
Seems he's much
tougher than I thought.

49
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:04,791
[FIGHTER]
Huh?

50
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,166
Oh, come on!

51
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,958
That's it?

52
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,500
Is this some kinda joke?!

53
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,083
Don't lose hope yet.

54
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,875
If we do that 100 more times,
I assure you, we'll defeat him.

55
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,375
I wonder what these
ruins are all about?

56
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,541
I'm sensing a strange
magical field in the area.

57
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,541
[FIGHTER]
Come on!

58
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,625
Let's hit it and
see what happens!

59
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,125
I wouldn't if I were you.

60
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,750
It's a magical gate
connecting to the demon world.

61
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,458
Are you sure about that?

62
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,833
Of course.

63
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,333
About thirty years ago,

64
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,791
there was this book or
scroll or something like that.

65
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,125
I vaguely remember it
talking about this gate.

66
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,458
[MAGE] Sorry, but that's
not very convincing.

67
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,625
Let's see.

68
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,083
If I recall, you just
push this stone...

69
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,541
[GROUP screams]

70
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,583
[PALADIN]
What have you done?!

71
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,375
Where are we? Tell me!

72
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:00,041
[BOSS] You've done
well to make it this far.

73
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,250
I am the Demon Lord
who dominates this world!

74
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,000
I am Deathgeld!

75
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,458
[GROUP]
Huh?!

76
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,500
[FIGHTER]
Wait a second!

77
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,791
Isn't this the final boss?!

78
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,041
[PALADIN]
This is ridiculous!

79
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,041
We're not prepared for
this sort of encounter!

80
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,958
[MAGE]
M-M-Mercy! Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

81
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,541
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

82
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,708
Relax, girls.

83
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,333
This was my plan all along!

84
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,875
[GROUP]
You're a liar!

85
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,750
[DARKELF] Now that my brave
companions and I have found you,

86
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,625
your terrible reign
of evil and horror

87
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,250
will come to a violent end.

88
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,000
We will stain our blades
with your sulfurous blood!

89
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,166
Please don't make
him mad, you psycho!

90
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,041
[BOSS]
Well, in that case, bring it on!

91
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:34,750
En guard!

92
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,291
[GROUP cries]
