1
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:13,333
[FIGHTER] Aw man, that Crystal
Staff is way too expensive!

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:14,541
[MAGE]
Yeah, I know.

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,500
There's no way we can
afford it right now!

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,791
[PALADIN] But we have to buy it.
We don't have a choice.

5
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,958
Without the Crystal Staff, we
won't be able to beat the boss

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,541
at the end of the dungeon!

7
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,208
[DARKELF] We'll just have to put
together all the money we have,

8
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,833
and scrape up the rest by
selling off whatever we can.

9
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,875
Unless somebody
has a better idea?

10
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, I could
always sell my body.

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,916
Just shut up.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,375
[FIGHTER] I seriously can't
believe how much junk we have.

13
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,125
How did we even
carry all this stuff?

14
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,125
We're way overstocked
with potions.

15
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,375
And we never even
touched the holy water.

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,375
It's pointless to hold onto it.

17
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,875
Hey, wait.

18
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,833
Isn't this the magic mirror
we used in the first dungeon

19
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,000
to seal that enemy away?

20
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,833
I can't believe we
still have this thing.

21
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,375
Well, it's no good to us now.

22
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,750
We should toss it, or at least
try to sell it to someone.

23
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,458
Guys, let's slow down.

24
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,875
We can't start unloading
stuff 'cause we need gold.

25
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,416
It feels like such a waste.

26
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,166
Plus, all of the shops
tell me that mirror

27
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,666
is way too important to sell!

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,000
[PALADIN]
Well, we should definitely sell

29
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:08,041
all the armor and weapons
we don't use anymore.

30
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,875
[FIGHTER giggles]

31
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:14,416
[PALADIN moans]

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,958
[MAGE gasps]

33
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:21,416
[DARKELF moans]

34
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,625
--[MEN chattering]
--[MAN A] It's all mine!

35
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,750
--[MEN chattering]
--This is so awesome!

36
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,833
I seriously don't get it.
Who would've thought

37
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,000
people would want our
used armor so bad?

38
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,708
It does seem like a
peculiar thing to desire.

39
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,916
Yeah, right?

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,458
Is anyone else wondering
why the mage's armor

41
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,583
sold for more than
twice what ours did?

42
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,333
[gasps] Weird.

43
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,166
We still don't have
enough for the staff.

44
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,916
I guess we have no choice
but to sell even more.

45
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,583
[FIGHTER]
Hey guys, check it out.

46
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,791
We have a ton of these.
What are they?

47
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,208
[MAGE]
Oh! Those are magic elixirs.

48
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,083
Those elixirs are a last resort.

49
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,666
They call it a
miracle in a bottle

50
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,750
because they fully restore
your health and mana.

51
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,250
All you have to is drink one
down, and you're as good as new!

52
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,708
[PALADIN]
Yeah, but aren't we careful

53
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,500
to not get to that point?
We always heal up as we go,

54
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,208
so we just end up carrying
them around and not using any.

55
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:10,166
I really don't see why we should
keep them if we never use them.

56
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,083
Well then, let's sell
the whole basketful!

57
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,958
What are the odds
we'll need 'em anyway?

58
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,500
[MAGE gasps]

59
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,416
But what if things get really
bad and it turns out we do?

60
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't be so worried.

61
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,583
The only reason we have so many
is because we never use them!

62
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,375
I promise, we're
gonna be just fine.

63
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,875
--[cash register dings]
--[SHOP MAN] My pleasure.

64
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,000
[MAGE] I've waited so
long for this moment.

65
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,583
My own Crystal Staff!

66
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:33,375
Yes! Now let's go
crush that boss!

67
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:37,083
[FIGHTER groaning]

68
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,875
We're almost there,
guys. The boss is

69
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,250
--just past that gate.
--[PALADIN panting]

70
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,875
[FIGHTER]
But...

71
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,916
--I can barely stand.
--[DARKELF panting]

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,208
[FIGHTER] Doesn't anyone
have a potion I can drink?

73
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,208
[MAGE pants] You already
used up the last one;

74
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,958
we're totally out!

75
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,708
[FIGHTER]
Yeah, you're right.

76
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,208
What if we cast a spell
or something like that?

77
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,791
[PALADIN]
I've got nothing left.

78
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,375
I'm completely out of mana!

79
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,250
[DARKELF] What I wouldn't
give for some of that elixir

80
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,791
right about now!

81
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,958
[FIGHTER] Whose idea was it
to sell those bottles anyway?

82
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,375
That was you, Dummy!

83
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,541
We sold everything we had
to get the Crystal Staff,

84
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,625
but now we can't
even get to the boss!

85
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,250
I knew it would come back
to haunt us in the end!

86
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,875
No use fighting the inevitable.

87
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,250
I guess we'll have
to start over, right?

88
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,583
But that's such
a pain in the ass.

89
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,000
[MAGE squeals]
Look, it's a treasure chest!

90
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:23,791
Jackpot!

91
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,000
Come on, Elixir!

92
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,833
Or any healing item,
I don't care what it is!

93
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,291
[ALL]
Huh?

94
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:37,166
[cries]
It's another Crystal Staff!
