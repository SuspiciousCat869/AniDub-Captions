00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:14,666
I got you!

[screams]

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:16,833
No, don't do it!

[DARKELF gasps]

7
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,250
Now's your chance.

8
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,250
Run! Hurry!

00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,541
[grunts]

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,833
[screams] Stay back, please!

11
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,291
Don't worry about me!
Just save yourselves!

12
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,750
Make a run for it now,
while you still have a chance!

13

[FIGHTER]
He's too powerful for us.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,416
There's no way we'll be
able to defeat this monster!

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,333
[MAGE gasps] What in the
world are we gonna do now?

18
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,708
You guys stay back and
let me handle this one!

19
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,125
[FIGHTER]
What can you possibly do?

20
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,416
[DARKELF]
You can't mean!

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,750
[PALADIN chuckles]

22
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,375
It's been a true
honor everyone.

23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,416
I'll see you in the next life.

24
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:03,958
[MAGE, DARKELF gasp]

25
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,250
You crazy fool.

26
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,625
I can't believe she did that.

27
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:10,916
[cries] No! Come back to us!

28
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,291
Seriously, what the
heck is up with you

29
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,250
and this whole
self-sacrifice thing?

30
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,708
[PALADIN]
Well, I am a Paladin.

31
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,166
We're sacred warriors
sent by the gods.

32
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,291
If it means protecting
innocents or saving the world,

33
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,833
then I'm happy to
lay down my life.

34
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,708
This is my sole
purpose on earth!

35
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,583
Yeah, well, one of these days,
you're gonna die for good.

36
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:36,125
[MAYOR chuckling]

37
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,708
I'm the Mayor around here.
But if it's all the same,

38
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,416
I'd prefer if you
just called me Lord.

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,458
If you want to
continue your journey,

40
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,833
then one of you has
to get married to me.

41
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,250
What?! No way!

42
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,541
[growls] Filthy perverted Mayor!

43
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,041
Can I kill him, please?

44
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:50,791
He's gross.

45
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:51,916
[PALADIN]
No, wait.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,250
This is an opportunity for me

47
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,416
to make a sacrifice
for the greater good.

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,666
If it means helping the party,

49
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,958
then if I must,
I will marry you!

50
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,833
[GROUP gasps]

51
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,583
[PALADIN sighs]

52
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,916
Tonight I will boldly go

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,375
where no woman
will ever go again.

54
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,875
That vile, disgusting man
will have his way with me,

55
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,833
and my innocence
will be lost forever.

56
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:18,708
[pants]

57
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,375
But for the world
and all of its people,

58
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,333
and for the righteous cause
of peace and goodness,

59
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,166
I must deflower myself.

60
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,583
There is no other way.

61
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,500
This is the greatest
sacrifice I can make!

62
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,208
[MAYOR laughing]

63
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,291
Ah, yes...

64
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,333
Now, take off
your clothes, girl.

65
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,208
Show daddy what's
underneath that gown!

66
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,458
[gasps] Yes...

67
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,000
[MAYOR laughs] I'll take
really good care of you.

68
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,458
Now come here.

69
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,916
[PALADIN whimpers]

70
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,083
[whimpering]

71
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,000
[gasps]

72

--Stop right there, Freak!
--[MAYOR screams]

73
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,875
Hey! What's going on?

74
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,250
If you think you can just use
our friend as your plaything,

75
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,666
you've got another thing coming!

76
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,541
Yeah! What she said!

77
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:12,166
--[MAYOR screams]
--[WOLF howls]

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
It's a good thing
we made it in time.

79
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,750
We felt really bad about

80
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,833
letting you sacrifice
yourself for all of us.

81
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,083
Although... you don't
look very happy about it.

82
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,875
I'm not! That was my best chance
to have a meaningful sacrifice!

83
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,750
And you jerks blew it!

84
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:37,083
But... I guess it's possible I'm
a little grateful for it, too.
