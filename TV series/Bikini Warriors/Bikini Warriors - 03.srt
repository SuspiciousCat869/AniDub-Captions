[MAGE sighs]
So what now?

00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,333
At this point, we can't even
afford to stay at the inn!

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,375
Then I have no other choice.

6
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,916
I must resort to
the only option.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,250
You're not gonna start
selling your body

8
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,458
for money again, are you?

9
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,208
[gasps] Don't be absurd.

10
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,125
Just because I fantasize
about it every day,

11
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,166
doesn't mean I'm actually
going to go through with it.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,041
I am a woman of
principle, after all.

13
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,166
Well, then what exactly
are you planning to do?

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,000
We're the heroes here, right?

15
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,166
So that means the
law is on our side!

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,416
Forgive our intrusion.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,250
We are brave heroes in need!

18
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,625
As such, we invoke our right

19
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,833
to confiscate items
required to be successful

20
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,583

As you may know,

those ordered by the kingdom
to defend these lands

23
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,583
are known as heroes.

24
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,541
So, it is our privilege

25
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,708
to enter villager's
homes uninvited,

26
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,333
rummage through
their treasure chests

27
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,541
and take whatever we may
need to fulfill our mission.

[MAGE]
So sorry to bother you.

Is this okay?

32
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,875
Antidotes. And herbs, too.
Plus, twenty gold coins.

33
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,875
Hm. I wonder if
we'll need these?

Is it really okay?

Of course! It's our right!

We're putting our
lives on the line

Sorry if you feel guilty, but
small sacrifices must be made!

Yeah! When I save
up enough money,

You know, it's a good thing
heroes get special privileges.

Now we don't have to worry about
money to complete our quests!
