[NARRATOR] This is the
story of a group of young,

2
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,666
beautiful heroes who rise up and
fight to restore light and peace

3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,833
to a broken world torn apart
by the forces of evil.

So hot!

[DARKELF grunts, shudders]

10
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,791
S-S-So cold!

[PALADIN yelps]

12
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,375
Ah! It's melting right through!

--[thud]
--[FIGHTER] Hey, guy!

15
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,166
This armor you sold
us is a piece of junk.

16
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,875
We're heroes, not a bunch
of bimbos on a beach!

17
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,833
I've got some of the
latest armor in stock

18
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,125
if you'd like to try it.

19
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,416
I think it'd be a perfect fit.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,666
Yeah, it looks good on you.

21
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,500
Hey! These are the same
suits! You can't fool us!

22
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,208
--It's so cute!
--Huh?

23
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,375
This is, without a doubt,

24
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,416
the most beautiful
armor I've ever seen!

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,541
She's right.

26
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,166
It's fitting, but
not too revealing,

27
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,125
offering equal parts
comfort and protection.

28
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,625
It's the greatest!

29
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:44,125
When you're as good as I am,
you can tell the difference.

30
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,750
Our enemies will tremble in fear

31
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,000
when they see the four of
us approaching in these!

32
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,375
They're the same. Like, exactly.

33
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:51,916
[SMITH]
You gonna buy it or not?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,500
[GROUP]
Yes!

35
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,625
I'm sorry, but I
think I'm gonna pass.

36
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,291
[FIGHTER]
Ah!

[PALADIN gasps]

39
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,708
Hey, I'm not melting.

40
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,666
It looks like this new armor
was a good purchase after all!

41
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,875
No way!

He's burning me up,
but I'm not even hot!

45
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,791
I'm sure glad I decided
to buy this new suit!

46

[DARKELF gasps]

47
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,666
I don't feel a thing!

48
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,000
This new armor is even
better than I thought!

49
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,875
Oh, c'mon! You're kiddin' me!

50

--[thud]
--[FIGHTER] Excuse me, sir?

51
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,458
Any chance I can purchase
some of that bikini armor?

52
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,708
Sure thing.

53
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,291
Would you like me to put
a set together for you?

54
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,750
[MAN A] Is that the party
everyone's been talking about?

55
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,875
[MAN B]
They are so awesome!

56
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,958
[WOMAN]
What armor class are they in?

57
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,625
[CHILD] Mama! Can I have
a suit like that, too?

58
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,541
[DARKELF chuckles]
Guess we have fans.

59
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,958
I could get used to this.

60
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,125
No one's ever paid
attention to us before.

61
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,500
This is so awesome!

62
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,000
Finally, an outfit
that's worthy of

63
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,875
our bravery, nobility, and
our truly selfless deeds!

64
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:57,000
This new bikini armor is
the best! Woo! [laughs]

65
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,666
I'm happy to see you're
finally admitting it.

66
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,958
It's good armor.

67
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,375
But I just finished a set
that's even better.

68

[DARKELF moans]

72
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,416
Isn't this just
a bathing suit?

73
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,541
So filthy! So disgusting!
So obscene!

74
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,791
I... feel... cheap!

75
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,416
It's totally embarrassing.

76
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,791
How could I ever be seen
like this in public?

77
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,125
You, sir, are a disgrace!

78
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,541
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

79
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,625
How dare you ask us
to stoop so low!

80
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,208
But they look exactly like the
ones you were wearing earlier.

81
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,083
[ALL]
You're wrong!

82
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,041
These are completely different!
