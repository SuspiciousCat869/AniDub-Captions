1
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,333
[KING] We have long awaited
your arrival, Brave Warriors.

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,000
Raise your faces.

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,125
We have heard much
of your great feats.

4
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:21,833
Our lands would be ruined
if not for your heroism.

5
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,291
Valiant Fighter,

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,000
to have a warrior like you
in Our halls is a treasure.

7
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,208
Sire, you honor me.

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,791
[KING] Blessed are We to
have you with us, Paladin.

9
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,041
Verily, your feats
of strength in battle

10
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,708
are matched only by
your exquisite beauty.

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:40,291
You humble me with your kind and
generous praise, Your Majesty.

12
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,583
[KING] For one as young as you
to have such mastery over magic,

13
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:47,083
Mage, you truly are a prodigy.

14
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,458
Thank you, Sire.

15
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,250
Your words are far too kind.

16
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,000
[KING]
And you, Darkelf.

17
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,791
The tales of your intellect
and prowess in combat

18
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,458
reach far and wide.

19
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,625
[laughs]

20
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:58,791
Even to this decaying,

21
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,875
ramshackle little
town you call home?

22
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,291
[PALADIN]
You're so rude!

23
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,041
[KING] Your skill and courage
go unrivaled everywhere.

24
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,125
If only your aid
had arrived sooner,

25
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,833
we wouldn't find
ourselves plagued

26
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,833
by such a tragic situation.

27
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:11,666
[FIGHTER]
My Lord?

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,833
[KING]
Our very existence

29
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,958
now verges on the
brink of destruction.

30
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,125
No hope remains in this kingdom.

31
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,166
[FIGHTER]
Fear not, Sire, we're here now!

32
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,416
[PALADIN] We fight to restore
peace throughout the world,

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,708
no matter what the
personal cost may be!

34
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,125
[MAGE] Whatever ails
you and your people,

35
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,833
this party will not rest
until we see justice done!

36
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,041
[DARKELF] This darkness
will be no more, My Liege!

37
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,375
[KING] We were wise to
place such faith in you.

38
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,500
[KING]
Our fate is in your hands now!

39
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,500
Brave Ones! Defend us!

40
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,083
[ALL]
Right!

41
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,500
Uh, Sire?

42
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes? What's the problem?

43
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,625
We assumed we were
done speaking.

44
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,041
[FIGHTER]
Sorry about that.

45
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,958
But see, the thing is,
we can't just go out and fight.

46
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,791
We need equipment and
supplies and stuff like that.

47
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,958
Oh! Yes. Our apologies.

48
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,666
In that case, take some gold
to aid you in your quest!

49
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,833
--[FIGHTER] Uhh...
--[MAGE] One, two, three,

50
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,083
--four... Uh... Yikes!
--[DARKELF] Do my eyes

51
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,291
deceive me or am I
looking at a measly stack

52
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,125
of ten gold coins on that plate?

53
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,083
Go! Fight hard, Brave Ones!

54
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,875
Highness? The thing is...

55
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,083
We can't.

56
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,208
We won't!

57
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,791
Apparently you think
saving your people

58
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,250
is worth the price of a potion.
So as far as we're concerned,

59
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,375
you can take your ten
gold coins and shove it!

60
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,916
Hey! Don't be rude.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,666
I'm sure he means to give us
more gold than this paltry sum.

62
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,458
Unfortunately, this
is all I can give you.

63
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,875
Fight hard, Brave Ones!

64
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:23,708
[gasps]

65
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,833
My Lord!

66
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,125
Just to sleep at an
inn for one night

67
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,541
costs twenty pieces
of gold, per person!

68
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,000
With all due respect,
Your Majesty,

69
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,541
we'd be foolish to
put our lives at risk

70
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,291
for such a tiny amount of money!

71
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,291
Go fight hard, Brave Ones!

72
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,791
Wait! Just a second!

73
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,125
Couldn't you at least lend us

74
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,333
the legendary weapons that
you have in the castle?

75
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,833
Uh... Yes, those.

76
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,000
Um, well you see...

77
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,750
We have nothing
of the sort here!

78
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,791
Oh, come on!

79
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,833
What? Please.

80
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,041
You just said ya did!

81
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,458
Sorry, Brave Heroes,
but you are mistaken.

82
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,666
Now go and fight!

83
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,916
I've got an idea.

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,625
Why not sell the armor
off these guards?

85
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,125
Clearly they're not
getting the job done

86
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,041
on the whole defending
the kingdom front.

87
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,916
Then use that gold to
buy us some weapons.

88
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,583
[GUARD]
Hey! What did we ever do to you?

89
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,666
Your Majesty, you can't
possibly be saying that

90
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,583
our bodies are worth ten
meager pieces of gold, can you?

91
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,958
Uh, no... I don't
think anyone said that.

92
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,583
You guys, I know ten
pieces of gold isn't much,

93
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,791
but if we don't stand up
and fight for their kingdom,

94
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,250
then who will?

95
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,083
Give us your gold right now,
or your kingdom is doomed!

96
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,166
[DARKELF]
My Lord.

97
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,041
The decision is yours!

98
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,458
Why did it come to this?

99
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,708
[FIGHTER grunting]
Like you don't know!

100
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,708
[PALADIN]
Uh-oh!

101
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,708
This rope is in
an awkward place!

102
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,791
[MAGE]
Uh-huh! What were we thinking?

103
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,208
Please don't look at me!
