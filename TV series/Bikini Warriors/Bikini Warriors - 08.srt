1
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,208
[FIGHTER] So you two
want to join our party?

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,291
That's right.

3
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,875
You're lookin' at
a skilled Hunter.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,625
I'll admit I never been grouped
up with you city folk before.

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,208
I'm more nervous than
a cat around water.

6
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,625
[ALL]
What a hillbilly.

7
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm a valiant Valkyrie.

8
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,833
Unlike a lowly fighter,

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,958
I'm a noble warrior sent here by
the Gods to fight for justice.

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,625
If you don't believe me,
just stand back

11
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,583
and I'll demonstrate my
strength and unparalleled power!

12
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,958
[DARKELF] I find that
one extremely annoying.

13
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:44,958
Can I kill her?

14
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,250
[FIGHTER]
Not just yet.

15
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,625
We could use another companion,

16
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,791
but unfortunately,
we don't need two!

17
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,625
[VALKYRIE] Well, considering
who I'm up against,

18
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,916
I'd say the choice is
a fairly obvious one.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,791
Hey! I might be
from the country,

20
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,000
but I can whip your little
butt seven ways from Sunday,

21
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,208
you big boob'd bimbo!

22
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,625
Let's all calm down.

23
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,125
[PALADIN] Why don't you
start off by showing us

24
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,083
what you each have
to offer our party?

25
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,333
[FIGHTER]
Delicious!

26
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,375
This is too good!

27
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,500
I know.

28
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,833
That's 'cause I'm
a damned fine cook!

29
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,166
With a hunter like
me in your party,

30
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,416
it'll be good eatin' three
squares a day, everyday.

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,583
I guarantee it!

32
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,625
Having you around
could be a big help!

33
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,166
[FIGHTER] It's just so tasty,
I can't even handle it!

34
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,458
What did you put in this stuff?

35
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,041
Well... That there is my
famous dried slime soup!

36
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,875
[FIGHTER, MAGE retch]

37
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,041
[FIGHTER] How could you let me
eat something as nasty as this?

38
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,208
Nasty? But it's so juicy,
thick and delicious.

39
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,041
Welp! If you don't like that,

40
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,666
I got some harpy brains and
some basilisk eyeball soufflé

41
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,083
--I could whip up in a jiffy!
--[MAGE] Please, no more!

42
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,875
Well, that's what you
get with bumpkins!

43
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,750
She can't compare
to someone as noble,

44
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,875
dignified and powerful as I am!

45
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,250
You think you're
so damn special?

46
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,333
What can you do?

47
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,833
[VALKYRIE yells, grunts]

48
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,708
[MONSTER roars]

49
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,416
[GROUP gasps, applause]

50
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
[HUNTER grunts]
I could do that if I wanted to!

51
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,958
[VALKYRIE] Not to brag,
but few have been blessed with

52
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,500
the raw talent and supreme power
that I naturally possess.

53
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,666
Now you see the truth:

54
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,458
the Gods themselves
have bestowed me

55
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,875
with the holy gift
of their divine light.

56
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,041
I'm not going to lie,
I still want to kill her,

57
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,208
but she is good.

58
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,416
It's settled, then.

59
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,875
After seeing what they
both have to offer,

60
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,666
the Valkyrie seems
like the clear choice.

61
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,875
[VALKYRIE]
Phew!

62
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,500
All that showing off
has really worn me out.

63
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,208
We should all head back to town.

64
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:20,916
Here!

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,625
What?

66
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,041
We have horses, right?

67
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,250
Or do you guys have like
a wagon or something?

68
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,500
What are you talking about?

69
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,916
I'm sorry, but we have
nothing of the sort!

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,625
Isn't it obvious that
we're walking back to town?

71
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,958
You just said "walk"!

72
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,083
But walking's so common
and uncivilized.

73
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,875
I'm a dignified warrior,
so I'd never stoop so low!

74
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,583
--[VALKYRIE grumbling]
--What's this girl's deal?

75
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,625
Little brat.

76
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,458
She's a total snob,
that's for sure.

77
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,125
I knew she annoyed
me for good reason.

78
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,916
Can I kill her now or what?

79
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,916
Since these here city slickers

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,416
can't decide which
of us to take,

81
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,625
we'll have to settle this with
a good ole fashioned duel.

82
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,166
Sounds like a plan to me.

83
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,875
I sure hope you like
the taste of steel

84
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,916
'cause you're about to
get a mouthful of mine!

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,666
Then let's dance!

86
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,583
--[VALKYRIE squeals]
--Tell me,

87
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,791
who's the dignified lady now?

88
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,541
--[HUNTER moans]
--Fine! Two can play that game!

89
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,208
Yeah, you like that don't you?

90
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,291
[GROUP]
Uh...

91
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,666
[HUNTER]
I'm'a make you pay for that!

92
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,833
[VALKYRIE] Where do you
think you're touching?!

93
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:13,166
[yelps] No, not there!

94
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,750
Yep.

95
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,125
After fightin', the two
of us became BFFs.

96
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,791
You're a real sweet heart on
the inside, you know that?

97
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,583
This girl's the exact
type of companion

98
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,375
I've been searching
for my whole life.

99
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,625
With us together, that's all the
party I think I'll ever need.

100
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,041
[BOTH]
Aww!

101
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,791
[PALADIN]
Uh... Wow.

102
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,583
And they lived
happily ever after...

103
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,000
...I guess?
