1
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,291
[ASHIYA]
Ugh.

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,916
It's so hot out here.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,916
I'm only wearing
a polo and I'm melting.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,708
How are you good in that kimono,
aren't you uncomfortable?

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,500
Of course I am.

6
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,166
[ASHIYA]
What? Really?

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,416
All right, Mononokean, come.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,291
I feel like heat hits me way
harder than it does most people.

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,208
Yesterday I got super hot.

10
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,625
It wore me out.

11
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,833
So today I'm'a play with
Fuzzy here in the Mononokean.

12
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,166
Huh?

13
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,250
That's a lot better!

14
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,541
Nice and cool here!

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,708
Hey Fuzzy!

16
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:44,916
It's burnin' up today,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,791
and there's no shade
on the school roof.

18
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,958
So I figure we can
just play here instead.

19
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,083
Hmm?

20
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,791
Fuzzy?

21
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,000
You on the ceiling?

22
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,916
Nah, That wouldn't make sense.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,333
Hey Abeno, I can't find Fuzzy.

24
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,166
I'm about to ask you
a very serious question.

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,333
Okay.

26
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,041
Did you steal something
in the Underworld?

27
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:20,125
Well, uh...

28
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,708
Nothing that I remember.

29
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,666
And what exactly is
that supposed to mean?

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,916
You steal so much
you can't keep track?

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,916
[ASHIYA]
No!

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,625
Of course I didn't
steal anything!

33
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,208
But I thought it was possible

34
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,541
I might've taken
something by accident.

35
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,541
Uh.

36
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,208
When I'm asked
the same thing twice,

37
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,208
I get less sure.

38
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,458
[ABENO]
How about three times?

39
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,958
Did you steal or not?

40
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,083
No way.

41
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,458
Ah! You're not talking about

42
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,666
that scroll I took to the
Executive, are you?

43
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,541
I marched that scroll
all the way to his door

44
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,916
and handed it off
to his servant!

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,458
Fuzzy saw!

46
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,125
Right? Back me up!

47
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,000
Crap.

48
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,166
Did you even hear me telling you

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,875
about how Fuzzy
had gone missing?

50
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,750
Yeah, I heard you.

51
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,541
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

52
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:21,791
You're saying that Fuzzy
was accused of stealing?

53
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,500
[ASHIYA]
The Justice had Fuzzy arrested?

54
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,833
[ASHIYA]
No way.

55
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,000
Wait a sec.

56
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,708
Don't tell me.

57
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,333
Hey.

58
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,666
[ASHIYA shrieks]

59
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,833
What's wrong?

60
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,333
Do you have a sudden
confession to make?

61
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,500
No, Fuzzy wouldn't
do that either.

62
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,166
But I might know what happened.

63
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,166
I saw a yokai that looked
like Fuzzy the first time

64
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,541
I went to the Underworld.

65
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,500
And it was a thief.

66
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,625
We can't be sure,
but what if Fuzzy got arrested

67
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,041
because someone mistook
him for that guy?

68
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,625
Regardless, we need to
go to White Sand Prison

69
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,750
and see the Justice.

70
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,458
[ABENO]
Something isn't right.

71
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,166
What is it?

72
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,458
Mononokean, take us to him.

73
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,833
[ASHIYA] So uh, you're
going to Justice's place?

74
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,333
Yeah, and I'm gonna
need you to come, too

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,875
[SERVANT C]
Excuse me, sir.

76
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,666
Apologies, but uh...

77
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,583
[bubbly sound]

78
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:10,208
[EXECUTIVE]
Hello? Justice, you there?

79
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,791
[EXECUTIVE]
Justice.

80
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,583
Can you hear me?

81
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,125
You ate my tadpole
line again, didn't you?

82
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,708
I thought I forbade you
from eating meat.

83
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,708
Did you need something?

84
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,791
[EXECUTIVE] Just checking
to see if you finished the job.

85
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,291
[JUSTICE]
Oh, is that all you want?

86
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,458
Yeah, it's been taken care of.

87
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,958
The Mononokean employee
is in my custody.

88
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,708
[EXECUTIVE]
Excellent work.

89
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,958
This is Hanae Ashiya!

90
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,041
Employee of the Mononokean!

91
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,583
We brought him
here with great haste,

92
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,416
just as Your Honor commanded us!

93
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,125
[JUSTICE]
Hmm...

94
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,000
Wrong guy.

95
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,375
Huh?

96
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,583
[JUSTICE] I told you
that he had a human form.

97
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,375
Come on, transform already!

98
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,500
[SERVANT B]
You can do it, right?

99
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,583
Show him!

100
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,416
[JUSTICE]
I remember this yokai.

101
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,958
It was with the guy
I took to the Birdcage.

102
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,416
The one who
helped me find my ring.

103
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,666
I thought for sure
that he worked

104
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,708
for the Legislator, though.

105
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,333
Maybe he actually works
for the Mononokean?

106
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,458
[SERVANT C]
Pardon me, sir.

107
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,625
Do you have a moment?

108
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,375
[JUSTICE]
Sure.

109
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,750
We just received a
message from security saying

110
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,208
the Mononokean is
in the Underworld.

111
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,541
How interesting.

112
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,708
Tell me.

113
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,125
Was anyone with Itsuk--

114
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,333
With the master I mean,
someone in human form perhaps?

115
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,416
That's right.

116
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,666
The message we
got did mention that.

117
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,416
[JUSTICE] Looks like they came
here to rescue their friend.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,333
Now, what is it people
say about these things?

119
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:48,416
Oh. I think it starts with
"nothing ventured," right?

120
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,250
[SERVANT C]
Right...

121
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,833
[ASHIYA]
Whoa, he's awake!

122
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,416
Look Abeno,
the fake Fuzzy woke up!

123
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,958
Are you listening to me?

124
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,541
What? Oh. Morning, bud.

125
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,791
You doing okay?

126
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,500
I think he's still
feeling Koura's sedative.

127
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,250
This should help you.

128
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,250
The best way to capture
this little doppelganger

129
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,750
is by putting it to sleep.

130
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,583
One whiff of that potion and
he'll be zonked out all day!

131
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,666
[ABENO] You're not peddling
this to everyone, right?

132
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,541
[ASHIYA]
The fuzzy look-a-like!

133
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,750
He's here!

134
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,083
Well that turned out
to be a good deal easier

135
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,583
than I expected.

136
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,458
Hopefully it actually helps.

137
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,416
[ASHIYA]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

138
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,208
[ASHIYA]
I met you in the forest!

139
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,208
[JUSTICE] So you are an
employee of the Mononokean.

140
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,625
[ASHIYA]
Abeno! He's the one!

141
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,333
The yokai that gave me a
ride to the Executive's place.

142
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:50,166
Great. So it looks like
the Legislator was right.

143
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,750
[sighs]

144
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,875
Hey Itsuki.

145
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,791
You don't like this guy, do you?

146
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,375
Nope. How'd you guess?

147
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,625
It wasn't hard.

148
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,083
Your styles clash.

149
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,458
I bet you fight a lot.

150
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,250
He's just so damn noisy.

151
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,416
He was pretty loud
when I met him, too.

152
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,583
[ASHIYA] Man, this yokai was
supposed to be my friend!

153
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,000
Insulting me to my face is
pretty rude, but whatever.

154
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,208
I'm fine.

155
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,375
I already knew that
Abeno didn't like me.

156
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,625
And being noisy is
just part of who I am!

157
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,750
I appreciate the input, Abeno
but this isn't the best time!

158
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,541
Justice.

159
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,000
We want you to free Fuzzy.

160
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,250
[JUSTICE]
Hm?

161
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,500
[ASHIYA] The yokai
that's been stealing stuff

162
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,000
all over the underworld
wasn't actually Fuzzy.

163
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,583
It was this grungy
Fuzzy wannabe.

164
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,041
Take a good look and you'll see
that they're clearly different,

165
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,375
so please let Fuzzy go!

166
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,416
You sure are able
to talk quickly.

167
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,666
Can you speak even
faster than that?

168
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,000
Please say you will.

169
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,833
[ASHIYA] Did you even
hear the words I said?

170
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,000
Come on.

171
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,250
Uh-huh, sure.

172
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,291
I'll let your friend go.

173
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,375
[ASHIYA]
Eh... Do you mean it?

174
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,250
Yep. Leave the look-a-like
here at White Sand Prison,

175
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,416
and I'll judge him
properly later.

176
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,750
Take this little guy
and put him away

177
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,500
'Kay but...

178
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,958
We don't know the entire story.

179
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,083
I mean he might've had
a good reason for stealing,

180
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,958
so please be lenient with
your uh, punishment.

181
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,708
I know I said I'd let
your fuzzy friend go free,

182
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,458
and I meant it,
but I do have one condition.

183
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,416
Huh?

184
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,500
But I thought that Fuzzy had
been cleared of suspicion.

185
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,291
He was never suspected
of a crime in the first place.

186
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:23,000
I was trying to apprehend
the human named "Ashiya."

187
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,125
You mean...

188
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,458
So if you remain at
White Sand Prison,

189
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,291
your friend can leave.

190
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,041
Do you accept?

191
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,375
[ABENO]
So that's it.

192
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,916
I really should've
seen it sooner.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,416
Of course he was
the one behind all this.

194
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,333
Seemed out of character for you
to plan this scheme on your own.

195
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,791
Not even he has the power

196
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,875
to seize and hold someone
against their will.

197
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,916
But as long as you're willing to
cook up some baseless suspicion.

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,833
You do.

199
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,958
"Just charge him with theft or
something and apprehend him."

200
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,583
Right, isn't that what the
Executive told you to do?

201
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:09,708
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

202
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,541
The Executive?

203
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,041
Okay, so.

204
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,000
My guess is you only
arrested Fuzzy by accident.

205
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,375
But the charge of theft
was fake anyway?

206
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,916
And it was the Executive
that put you up to it?

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,250
I've never even met him, though.

208
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,875
Why would he want me arrested?

209
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm afraid that this has nothing
to do with you, personally.

210
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,083
The Executive hates
humans is all.

211
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,541
Isn't that right, Itsuki?

212
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,791
It's true.

213
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,375
[ASHIYA]
A yokai who hates humans?

214
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,666
So what's the deal
with the Executive?

215
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,458
May as well talk,
since I've been found out.

216
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,916
It's like Itsuki said;

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,416
the Executive told me
to apprehend you.

218
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,333
And I asked him what he
was planning to do with you,

219
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,958
but I just couldn't
get him to say.

220
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,458
At any rate, you know
as much as I do now.

221
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,125
If you wanna find out more,

222
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,416
you can hang around
for a little while.

223
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,208
He should be here soon.

224
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,750
He shuts himself in
the Birdcage year-round,

225
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,208
and now he's coming here?

226
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,500
I know, it's a rare sight.

227
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,250
I invite him to
all sorts of things,

228
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,458
but I can never get
him to come out.

229
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,000
[sighs]

230
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:24,041
He'll be here any minute now,
guess I'd better freshen up.

231
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,083
[ASHIYA gasps]

232
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,625
He transformed!

233
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,041
Like Yahiko.

234
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,125
Come on.

235
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,625
That's boring.

236
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,041
I was hoping you'd scream in
shock like you did earlier.

237
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,375
I've hit my freak-out
quota for the day.

238
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,375
Does it really surprise you
that I came in person, Itsuki?

239
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,083
Ahh! Hey! Who the heck're you?

240
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,291
Who do you suppose
I might be, Hanae Ashiya?

241
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,083
Are you the Executive?

242
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,500
Or...

243
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,333
[EXECUTIVE] Very good,
I can't imagine how you guessed.

244
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,375
[ASHIYA]
Huh? What is he doing?

245
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,041
I can't talk.

246
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,958
I can't move.

247
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,708
I can't even breathe.

248
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,625
Whoa.

249
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:05,708
Are you okay?

250
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,583
Yeah, I think so.

251
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,833
Yeah, you're right.

252
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,875
I am surprised that you came.

253
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,958
I was quite surprised myself,

254
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,958
upon learning that the
Justice had apprehended

255
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,541
the wrong employee of yours.

256
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,541
Luckily, you brought
him to me yourself.

257
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,000
Which means
I didn't make the trip in vain.

258
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:28,958
[JUSTICE]
Hm?

259
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,125
But I haven't said anything

260
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,458
about arresting
the wrong person.

261
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,916
I'm quite sure you have,

262
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,875
as I heard it through
the tadpole line.

263
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,791
The one I sent you
never left, you see.

264
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,375
Ah, so the line was
never disconnected.

265
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,666
You eavesdropped.

266
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,208
[EXECUTIVE]
Yes, and before I came in

267
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,083
you were trying to guess what
I might want with the human.

268
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,708
Is that still a
subject of interest?

269
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,416
Well now that he's here.

270
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,583
I'm happy to explain.

271
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,666
Ever since I learned of
Hanae Ashiya's existence.

272
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,291
I've been trying to decide
if I should let him live

273
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,875
or kill him.

274
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,708
[ASHIYA]
Kill... me...?

275
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,875
[EXECUTIVE]
He can see us yokai.

276
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,416
And despite the
danger that entails,

277
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,375
he has been permitted
to enter our domain.

278
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,416
Shall I simply kill him?

279
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,583
Or should I permit him to live

280
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,583
as an employee of
the Mononokean?

281
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,916
I thought I'd keep him
in White Sand Prison

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,291
until I could come
to a decision.

283
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,833
[ASHIYA]
I'm paralyzed.

284
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,125
Just like before.

285
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,125
What's wrong?

286
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,416
Revert now, before you kill him.

287
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,958
[EXECUTIVE]
It's too bad.

288
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,666
I always feel so
at home in this form.

289
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,875
But no one else
seems to like it.

290
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,291
Intriguing.

291
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,583
It would appear that your
employee can't even stand

292
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,833
to be in my presence.

293
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,791
Hm.

294
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,250
[JUSTICE]
Hey. Can you breathe?

295
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,041
[ABENO] If the Executive
stays in this form,

296
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,708
he could kill Ashiya
here and now.

297
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,833
Does he know that?

298
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,083
Executive, I think
you've made your point.

299
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,750
Executive.

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,708
Revert to your human form.

301
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,708
[JUSTICE]
Itsuki challenged the Executive.

302
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,791
No one's ever raised a hand
against him like that before.

303
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,166
[EXECUTIVE] How dare you
attempt to bend my will?

304
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,000
I did what I had to do.

305
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,750
[EXECUTIVE] You're quite intent
on protecting this human.

306
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,333
[ABENO]
Huh?

307
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,083
[EXECUTIVE] It became clear when
I sent Egen to investigate him.

308
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,208
You did all that you could
to come between them.

309
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,125
And this time, you went
beyond protecting a human.

310
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,416
You sided with one and raised
your hand against me: a yokai.

311
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,083
An act unbecoming of
the Mononokean's Master.

312
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,625
It's certainly not something
Aoi would've done.

313
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm asking you to listen.

314
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,333
You need to realize that the
human known as Hanae Ashiya

315
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,791
is far more dangerous
than you could fathom.

316
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,750
And now that I've seen the
influence he's had on you,

317
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,333
I know that he should be killed.

318
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,625
Now here's an idea.

319
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,708
If you don't want me
to dispose of this threat,

320
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,666
how about you do it yourself?

321
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,458
As the master of the Mononokean,
you're above our laws.

322
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,083
So kill him.

323
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,000
It needs to be done.

324
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,208
[JUSTICE]
That's enough!

325
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,666
I'll warn you not to
forget where you are.

326
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,041
This is White Sand Prison,

327
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,333
where those who
break the law are judged.

328
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,416
You should know better than to
incite murder in these walls.

329
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,583
This is the reason I refused
to tell you what I had planned.

330
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,875
See, if I'd admitted
my actual motives,

331
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,500
you never would've
made that arrest.

332
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,125
[JUSTICE sighs]

333
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,500
Both of you come with me.

334
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,458
Ashiya--

335
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,000
I said come.

336
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,083
I'll arbitrate
this quarrel of yours.

337
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,208
It's best if
Ashiya stays behind.

338
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,000
[ABENO]
Wait here. I'll be back.

339
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,833
I get that you're
glad to be acquitted.

340
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,875
But that doesn't mean you have
free run of the entire prison!

341
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,583
[ASHIYA]
Fuzzy.

342
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,291
I'm glad you're okay.

343
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,541
Really.

344
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,583
I honestly thought
I was about to suffocate.

345
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,833
If Abeno hadn't stood up
to the Executive when he did,

346
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:53,166
I... I would be dead right now.

347
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,000
[JUSTICE]
Hmm...

348
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,458
The Executive's in the wrong.

349
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,583
In Article Five
of the Prohibitions,

350
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,750
which bind our world's
Three Powers.

351
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,416
We're forbidden
from personal conflict,

352
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,083
and from causing fear
or suffering in others.

353
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,791
The Mononokean is under the
supervision of the Legislator.

354
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,208
That may be, but the
Legislator's supervision is lax.

355
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,291
He's been treating
this matter carelessly.

356
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,916
Which is why I had
no choice but to interv--

357
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,666
Yes, I understand.

358
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,541
Here's the thing, Itsuki.

359
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,125
The Executive's actions
went too far,

360
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,166
but I can't say I disagree
with his opinion.

361
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,083
The Underworld is the only place

362
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,375
where we yokai can live
comfortably, without worry.

363
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,916
If it becomes public knowledge

364
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,916
that humans are
coming and going,

365
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,125
many yokai will feel uneasy.

366
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,125
Perhaps even resentful.

367
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:46,541
As the Justice, it's my duty
to prevent unrest in this world.

368
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:50,916
Therefore, I would like
you to keep Hanae Ashiya

369
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,625
from entering the Underworld.

370
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,916
[ABENO]
Understood.

371
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,500
We're going back
to the Mononokean.

372
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,625
Yeah, sure.

373
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,291
Hey Ashiya.

374
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,083
Before you return to the
Mundane World, let's talk.

375
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,166
Okay.

376
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,958
You see.

377
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,291
So I can never come back
to the Underworld?

378
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,916
[JUSTICE]
If you accept that condition,

379
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,708
the Executive promises
to leave you be.

380
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,750
Well if that's what you want,

381
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,333
I understand.

382
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,416
I won't come back.

383
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,000
Then our dispute is resolved.

384
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,125
I've heard rather
positive things

385
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,583
about the work you've
done for various yokai.

386
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,041
As long as you prove to
be beneficial to my kind,

387
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,791
I'll remain civil towards you.

388
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,375
But if I determine that your
deeds have done harm,

389
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,041
you'll find no law in this world

390
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,291
or your own that can save
you from my wrath.

391
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,333
If you expect me to pretend

392
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,333
I didn't hear that,
you're mistaken.

393
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,666
'Twas but a jest.

394
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,291
To reiterate what I said before,

395
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,125
you're forbidden from
coming anywhere near Ashiya.

396
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,791
And I'm happy to comply.

397
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,500
I'm keeping my distance
even as we speak.

398
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,208
Now.

399
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,708
I'll take my leave.

400
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,583
Should you see the Legislator,

401
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,583
send him my warmest regards.

402
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,166
Yeah. He isn't who they wanted.

403
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,208
Hey, Mononokean.

404
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,500
Think you can take
Ashiya home for me?

405
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,458
I need to make a quick stop
at the Legislator's place.

406
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,333
He needs to know what
the Executive did,

407
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,916
so he can reprimand him.

408
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,458
Go home and rest, all right?

409
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,083
All right.

410
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,625
[ASHIYA] He said we'd
have a job today, too.

411
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,166
I wonder what kind of
yokai we'll be exorcising.

412
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:53,708
What're you doing?

413
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,250
[shrieks]

414
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,291
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
You scared the life out of me.

415
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,500
Morning, sunshine.

416
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,375
G'morning.

417
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,041
Your voice sure is hoarse today.

418
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,083
[ASHIYA'S MOM] That's
cause I just woke up, silly.

419
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,958
[ASHIYA] Thought
she was a yokai for sure.

420
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,916
So you're up early.

421
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,541
Have trouble sleeping, or what?

422
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,708
Uh, well I was sleeping fine,

423
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,416
but it's so hot that I got
thirsty and woke up.

424
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,166
It shouldn't be long until
summer vacation, right?

425
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,916
I'll be counting on your
help at the shop this year.

426
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,833
[ASHIYA]
Mm.

427
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:26,958
Mom!

428
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,125
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,416
I kinda just felt
like messing with you.

430
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,583
Anyway, I might as well
get started on breakfast now.

431
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,541
[ASHIYA sighs]

432
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,125
It's good to be alive.

433
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,375
Oh wow, you like
my noogies that much?

434
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,291
Want some more?

435
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,833
[ASHIYA]
Please have mercy, Mom.

436
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,416
[ASHIYA'S MOM chuckles]

437
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,333
[ASHIYA]
Abeno used some kind of power.

438
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:58,000
Is it something that anyone
who sees yokai can use?

439
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:02,041
And if it is, I wonder...
Could I learn it too?

440
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,541
[ABENO] Ashiya and I
end up tagging along

441
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,625
with the photography club
to a summer camp of theirs.

442
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:41,000
It might be a good chance
to teach him something useful.

443
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,208
Next time, "The Seedling."

444
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,666
Yahiko, wanna come with?
