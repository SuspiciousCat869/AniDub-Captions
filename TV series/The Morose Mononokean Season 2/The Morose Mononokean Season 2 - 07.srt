1
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,708
[FUSSHI]
Let us in, Abeno.

2
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,791
We wanna have a pillow fight.

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:13,625
I'm good.

4
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:14,833
[FUSSHI]
We insist.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,500
I warned them that
this was a bad idea.

6
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,458
C'mon man,
pillow fights are fun!

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,208
Let us in and we'll show you.

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,833
[SAGA] We already asked
Mr. Fuji for permission.

9
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:26,958
He talked to the inn's manager,

10
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,750
and he said to
knock ourselves out!

11
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,375
Or knock each other out.

12
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,208
[FUSSHI] We even got a hold
of a bunch of unused pillows!

13
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,000
[SAGA] Yeah,
so this is basically, like,

14
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,333
a club requirement.

15
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,916
[FUSSHI] Don't hole
yourself in there all night.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,750
Come out and play!

17
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,000
We'll have fun!

18
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,625
Aw yeah!

19
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,500
[ASHIYA] Looks like he had to
open his fort to let Fuzzy out.

20
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,541
I want a good, clean match.

21
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,750
[YAHIKO]
No fair.

22
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,333
I wanna have a pillow fight.

23
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,375
Why can't I play too?

24
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,791
Are we ready?

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Then go!

26
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,625
Hyaah!

27
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,708
Abeno! We're supposed
to throw the pillows,

28
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,375
not smack each
other with 'em.

29
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,458
[ASHIYA]
This isn't a pillow fight.

30
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a pillow massacre!

31
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,541
Your left hand?

32
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,250
That's correct.

33
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,583
For real?

34
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,541
You dizzy at all?

35
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,833
Not even a bit!

36
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,166
And I didn't hold
my breath this time either!

37
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,583
[ABENO]
Hmm...

38
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,166
Well then. I suppose you pass.

39
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,583
Aw, sweet!

40
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,125
Huh?

41
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,375
How are you gonna pass him

42
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,458
when he got four out of
his ten guesses wrong?

43
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,875
[ABENO]
Hmm...

44
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,291
Guessing which hand a yokai's
in is really hard, okay?

45
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,875
It's a lot harder than sensing
one's direction from far away.

46
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,541
[SAGA]
Ashiya!

47
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,083
Abeno!

48
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:21,916
The bus is here!

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,375
You guys comin' or what?

50
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,583
Time to go!

51
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,041
Thanks, Saga!

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,625
Give us a second.

53
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,500
Be right there.

54
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,208
Oh, by the way, Abeno.

55
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,500
And this applies to you
and Fuzzy as well

56
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,583
[YAHIKO]
Hmm?

57
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,583
Because of you three,

58
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,000
I've gotten a lot better
at using this ability.

59
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,125
So thanks for training me
these past few days.

60
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,041
I mean it. Really.

61
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,458
So... you all good now?

62
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,333
Yeah.

63
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,708
I feel way better.

64
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,500
Then during work tomorrow,
we'll test you for real.

65
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,625
See if that clairvoyance
is still useless.

66
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,583
[YAHIKO]
You trashboat.

67
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,833
[MR. FUJI]
Okay! Line up, everyone!

68
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,083
[ASHIYA] I thought
I already passed the test.

69
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,750
When does it end?

70
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,333
[MR. FUJI]
Squeeze in a bit if you can.

71
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,458
Rumor has it you and
Abeno are the only ones

72
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,958
who didn't take
a single picture.

73
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,083
We kinda forgot.

74
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,625
It's easy to get
distracted out here.

75
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,125
So, yeah.

76
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,875
See ya later.

77
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't work too much!

78
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:37,875
[ASHIYA]
I won't.

79
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,208
[YAHIKO]
Bye-bye.

80
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,875
Hey!

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,750
It's occupied.

82
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,125
[gasps]

83
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,208
Look. It's a bit
difficult to talk

84
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,833
when you're acting
so wary of me.

85
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,250
[ASHIYA] No offense,
but what are you doing here?

86
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,958
Oh. Did Itsuki not pass
my message along to you?

87
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,166
No, he didn't.

88
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,375
He intended to apologize.

89
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,916
[ASHIYA]
For what?

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,750
Itsuki and the Justice
told me about your encounter.

91
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,833
How you met the Executive.

92
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,833
I'm sure it was a
terrifying experience.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,458
[LEGISLATOR]
First, allow me to apologize

94
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,000
for his treatment of you.

95
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm truly sorry.

96
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:36,500
Oh, um, well, I'm all
right now, so don't worry.

97
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,083
Heh.

98
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,500
And now for a question:
Might you be a betting man?

99
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,875
Uh, what do you mean?

100
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,791
Like gambling?

101
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,916
I've brought some things that
could make it all up to you.

102
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,416
[ABENO]
Isn't that--

103
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,291
[LEGISLATOR]
Itsuki.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,166
[ASHIYA]
Hmm...

105
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,791
So can I ask what you
have inside the boxes?

106
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,416
[LEGISLATOR] One of them,
the losing box, is empty.

107
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,041
To find out what's inside the
winner, you have to pick it.

108
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:14,000
And what happens
if I choose right?

109
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,125
Uh?

110
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,666
[LEGISLATOR]
Hmm...

111
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,458
The truth of it is, I made a
little wager with the Executive.

112
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,375
Should you manage
to pick the winning box.

113
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,083
Your permission to
enter the Underworld

114
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,125
will be conditionally restored.

115
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,166
Huh?

116
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,125
What?

117
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,416
You're kidding.

118
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
You can really lift my ban?

119
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,583
Yeah.

120
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:37,166
And the Executive
agreed to this?

121
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,625
Do you think that
I'd suggest this if he hadn't?

122
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,875
I even convinced him
to sign a contract.

123
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,791
Care to read it later?

124
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,000
How the hell did you
make that happen?

125
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,666
[laughs]

126
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,041
Let me assure you, I did nothing
that wasn't my prerogative.

127
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,708
I oversee the Mononokean,
and therefore,

128
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,875
when one of its
employees is harmed,

129
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,000
it's my responsibility
to take action.

130
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,041
[ASHIYA] I'm grateful
that the Legislator did this.

131
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,250
So, I can never come
back to the Underworld?

132
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,791
[JUSTICE]
If you accept that condition,

133
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,416
the Executive promises
to leave you be.

134
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,291
[ASHIYA] But if going back
to the Underworld could mean

135
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,333
the Executive comes
after me again,

136
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,666
then I might be better off
letting things stay as they are.

137
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,333
You're quite intent on
protecting this human.

138
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,041
As the master of the Mononokean,
you're above our laws.

139
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,458
So if you don't want me
to dispose of this threat,

140
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,250
do it yourself.

141
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,916
[ASHIYA] Lifting the ban
might make trouble for Abeno.

142
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,875
Better if I just do nothing.

143
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,958
Thank you.

144
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,125
--But I don't think tha--
--[ABENO] Hey. Trashboat.

145
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,875
Eh?

146
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:49,791
[ABENO]
Pick the winner.

147
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,791
Huh?

148
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,583
If you pick wrong,
I'll revoke your passing grade.

149
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,000
[ASHIYA]
What's he talking about?

150
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,166
[gasps]

151
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,583
Okay. I'll pick.

152
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,791
Make your choice.

153
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,458
Right or left.

154
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,083
Be calm.

155
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,500
The left one.

156
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,333
[JUSTICE]
Looks like we have a winner.

157
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,166
I know that voice.

158
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,208
Did you hear everything?

159
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,583
Justice?

160
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,916
[JUSTICE]
Yeah.

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,916
I caught every last word.

162
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,333
Congrats.

163
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,458
It looks like you won the bet.

164
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,625
As promised, I'll lift the ban.

165
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,833
On the condition
we discussed, of course.

166
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,541
I can go tell the
Executive right away.

167
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,541
Wait a second.

168
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,041
Is this something you
can tell me about?

169
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,000
[JUSTICE]
The condition that was set

170
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,458
between the
Executive and Legislator

171
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,583
is that each and every time
you enter the Underworld,

172
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,666
the Legislator has
to get down on his knees

173
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,583
and beg the Executive.

174
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,708
[LEGISLATOR]
Hmm?

175
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,208
That's peculiar.

176
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,416
The condition I recall agreeing
to was somewhat different.

177
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,208
[JUSTICE]
Yeah.

178
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,458
I made that up.

179
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,208
But I honestly believe
that it could've been

180
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,416
a good alternative.

181
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,750
Anyway, I guess you want me
to say the real condition.

182
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,125
Hanae Ashiya is only allowed
to enter the Underworld

183
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,166
when I can accompany him.

184
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,041
That is the deal.

185
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,375
You have to be with me?

186
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,708
And since the
Justice is currently present,

187
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,958
that condition is fulfilled.

188
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,291
Why, you could enter right
now with no problems.

189
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,125
Whoa there,
Legislator, hold on a second.

190
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,250
You're gonna
make me fall in there!

191
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,833
It's okay if you come in.

192
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,583
I've given you my word Ashiya,

193
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,541
and I have no
reason to lie to you.

194
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,708
Oh. I don't think you'd lie.

195
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,416
And I really am grateful
that you helped me

196
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,375
to get my ban lifted, but...

197
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,375
...the thing is, I--

198
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,250
[ABENO] I'm not letting him
back into the Underworld.

199
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,875
So, yeah, when you
talk to the Executive,

200
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,041
feel free to let
him know that too.

201
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,208
'Kay. Will do.

202
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,833
It's too bad, seeing as
you picked the winning box.

203
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,541
Ah.

204
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,750
So be it.

205
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,833
We have to abide by
the master's decision.

206
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,416
And here I was planning
to throw a little celebration

207
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,916
once your ban had been lifted.

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,916
What a shame.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,166
Huh?

210
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,875
[JUSTICE]
A celebration?

211
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,125
Does that mean you made food?

212
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,833
[LEGISLATOR] Yes. I did
prepare a few appetizers.

213
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,750
[ASHIYA] I picked the winning
box, like Abeno told me too.

214
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:33,333
But was I actually supposed
to pick the losing box?

215
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,875
[JUSTICE] Well,
since Itsuki's forbidden it,

216
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,541
it seems unlikely
that you'll get a chance

217
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,083
to enter the Underworld again.

218
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:46,000
And judging from the way you
acted earlier, it seems like

219
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,500
you have a personal
aversion to coming here.

220
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,333
[ASHIYA]
Mm.

221
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,666
I can understand.

222
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,750
But anyway,

223
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,583
if you ever do decide to
come back to the Underworld,

224
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,416
I'll be at your side.

225
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,458
Partly to keep an eye on you.

226
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,583
Should I believe
that you're a threat.

227
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,625
And I mean to any
yokai in the Underworld.

228
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:22,083
I won't hesitate to give
you a good, hard bite.

229
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,375
But for as long as
you aren't a threat.

230
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:28,583
I will protect you, as an
employee of the Mononokean.

231
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,583
[ASHIYA] That certainly
isn't the same as saying

232
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,500
I'd be welcome there.

233
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:40,666
But regardless, someday,
I may decide to go back.

234
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,791
[ASHIYA] If I ever do return,
I'll be counting on your help.

235
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,625
[sighs]

236
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,166
Did I miss something?

237
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,083
Should I have picked
the empty box?

238
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:18,833
Huh?

239
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,375
Just thought I'd ask,

240
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,625
since you don't want me going
to the Underworld after all.

241
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,125
Oh. Yeah. I see.

242
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,791
Well, don't worry about it.

243
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,125
You did good.

244
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,416
In fact, the Legislator
deliberately put a yokai

245
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
in the winning box to be
sure that you would pick it.

246
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,041
Huh?

247
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,708
So the Legislator knew that I'd
learned how to sense yokai?

248
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,208
But you didn't
tell him, did you?

249
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,250
[ABENO]
Sure didn't.

250
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,500
I haven't even spoken a word
to him since I trained you

251
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,833
at that summer camp.

252
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,208
Then, how else
could he have known?

253
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,541
[ABENO]
I can think of one other source

254
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,500
he might've heard it from.

255
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,875
Mononokean?

256
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,583
How are you so bad
at playing dumb?

257
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,916
Wait! So are you
saying that he rigged the bet

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
against the Executive
and the Justice?

259
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,541
That's crazy,
even if he is the Legislator!

260
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,833
Oh no.

261
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,625
What if the Executive finds out?

262
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,916
[ABENO] No need to worry
about what happened

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,625
with the Executive now.

264
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,791
From the looks of things,

265
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,750
the Legislator's lost
patience with him.

266
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,750
Say what?

267
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,583
The Legislator's wrath
is a thing to be feared.

268
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,041
He won't risk
incurring it twice.

269
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,000
[ASHIYA]
Wrath?

270
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,833
That's a strong word.

271
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,125
Was the Legislator
really that mad?

272
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,750
[ABENO] Judging from
the smug look on his face

273
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,208
when you picked
the right box, yes.

274
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,208
[JUSTICE]
Are you satisfied?

275
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,208
[LEGISLATOR]
Hm?

276
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,916
No, not in the slightest.

277
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,291
What I wanted, was for Ashiya
to re-enter the Underworld.

278
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:42,375
And for you to have to tell the
Executive that it happened.

279
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,791
But Itsuki had
to go and stop me.

280
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,583
Well, on the bright side,
at least you won the bet.

281
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,958
If I could just see
the look on the Executive's face

282
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,791
when he finds out he lost,

283
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,416
perhaps I would feel
a bit more satisfied.

284
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,375
I'm pretty sure he'd prefer
if you weren't there for that.

285
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,958
You're probably right.

286
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,041
Well, anyway, looks
like the matter's resolved.

287
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,250
That should be the end
of our internal feud.

288
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,166
I hate when you two fight.

289
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,125
I always end up getting
stuck in the middle.

290
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,625
It can be a real headache.

291
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,000
[LEGISLATOR]
The blame for this one

292
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,375
lies with the Executive
and his aggressiveness.

293
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,458
I'm of a gentle and
kind-hearted temperament.

294
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,000
Yet I just can't
forgive him this time.

295
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,541
[sighs]

296
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,083
Gentle, you say.

297
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,250
Huh.

298
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,708
Yeah, here's the thing,
if that were true,

299
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,625
you could keep things
civil without having me

300
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,000
as your go between.

301
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,208
When you do see
the Executive again,

302
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,291
you'd better be nice to him.

303
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,250
That understood?

304
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,000
Fine.

305
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,208
By the way,

306
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,208
you've done a lot for me
these past few days.

307
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,416
When next we meet,
I'll cook you something.

308
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,625
Until then,
give the bird my regards.

309
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,375
It's a ghost!

310
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,416
It's just a tanuki.

311
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,625
Come on, Zenko, would you mind
walking a little slower for me?

312
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,208
Yes, I would mind.

313
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,750
Anyway, the lookout
point's just ahead.

314
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,416
[ZENKO'S DAD] Zenko,
is that one also a tanuki?

315
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,750
That was strange.

316
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,458
But I don't know.

317
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,416
Are you sure what we saw up
there was really a ghost?

318
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,291
Oh yeah. I'm sure.

319
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,625
She had long black hair
and a flowing white dress.

320
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,291
And her hand was see-through.

321
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:16,625
Huh? Hold on,
you mean you saw her hand?

322
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,000
Interesting.

323
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,541
All I could see
was a girl's hair

324
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,333
and dress
floating in the air.

325
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,583
Guess it was too dark for
me to make out the body.

326
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,416
[ZENKO'S DAD] It was probably
just some kid pulling a prank.

327
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,666
[ZENKO]
I wonder...

328
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,583
If dad could only see
the hair and clothes...

329
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,916
Oh, well.

330
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,041
I gotta call the neighborhood
council head now.

331
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,583
Why call him?

332
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:42,750
'Cause I saw an apparition,
and... he said to call if I did.

333
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,250
He's trying to decide
if he should cancel

334
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,083
the Bon Festival Dance
this year, you see.

335
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,541
Huh?

336
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,791
[ZENKO'S DAD] There was a
related incident last year.

337
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,625
A child fell and
was injured as a result.

338
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,083
Oh, I think I get it.

339
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,250
Her translucency.

340
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,083
It reminded me
of how Fuzzy looks.

341
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:10,083
It could be that this ghost
is really just a yokai.

342
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,875
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Hey, Zenko.

343
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,041
Remember those
weird priests we met?

344
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,583
[ZENKO]
Which priests?

345
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,208
What temple were they from?

346
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,125
One's name was Abeno.

347
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,125
Think the other was Ashida?

348
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,250
[ZENKO]
No. It's Ashiya, Dad.

349
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,291
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Right, right.

350
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,458
Point is, they're psychics.

351
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,625
Let's get them
to deal with this.

352
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,375
That's it.

353
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,291
Do you sense a yokai?

354
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,333
[ASHIYA]
Mm-hm.

355
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,333
[gasps]

356
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,083
At least I think it's a yokai,

357
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,666
but what if my yokai
radar also works on ghosts?

358
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,333
[ZENKO] It's broad daylight
and you're still scared?

359
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,083
We could always wait
for Abeno to get here.

360
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,166
He's finishing up a job, right?

361
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,083
Yeah, he is, but I'll be fine.

362
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,583
Let's do this!

363
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,916
The presence is over that way!

364
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,666
[ZENKO] Are you using me
as a human shield?

365
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,958
[ASHIYA]
Oh crap, she sees us!

366
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,250
It's not a ghost, okay?

367
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,500
Not a ghost.

368
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,541
She's just a yokai.

369
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,416
Totally safe!

370
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,750
Just a yokai!

371
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,791
Don't be scared, you'll be fine!

372
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,541
G'afternoon, how's it going?

373
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,041
My name's Ashiya and
I work for the Mononokean.

374
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,541
It's nice to meet you.

375
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,875
I'm here today because I
received a request to help you!

376
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,833
Finally, it took you
long enough to find me!

377
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:53,291
Mononokean,
make me a human being!

378
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,125
Make you human? But why?

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,333
No.

380
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,708
Her head.

381
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,666
I killed her.

382
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,458
Wait, is this a wig?

383
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,875
Put my hair back right now!

384
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,833
[ASHIYA shrieks]

385
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,541
[ABENO]
Hmm?

386
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,541
Welcome back, Master.

387
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,583
[ABENO]
What's he done this time?

388
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,125
So I found the ghost
Zenko mentioned.

389
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,250
It was really a yokai
just like we thought.

390
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,000
If you'd like to meet her,
she's right there.

391
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,416
We were careful not to
leave any pieces behind.

392
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,625
[ABENO]
Can you still hear us?

393
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,083
Of course I can.

394
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,250
This kind'a thing happens
to me pretty often actually.

395
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,375
It'll stick back on
if ya use water.

396
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,791
You can call me Keshi,
who might you be?

397
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,666
My name's Abeno, and I'm
the Master of the Mononokean.

398
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,791
A pretty good while ago.

399
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,750
I was talkin' to another yokai.

400
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,375
They told me they knew
of a magical place

401
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,416
that could make
my wish come true.

402
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,333
And so I started
searching far and wide,

403
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,208
looking everywhere I could
for the Mononokean.

404
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,708
But no matter how hard
I tried, I couldn't find you.

405
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,416
Then I had the idea
to make you find me.

406
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,083
I started wearing
a wig and clothes,

407
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,291
so that humans would
see me and get scared.

408
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,833
I made as much of
a fuss as I could,

409
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,916
so you'd have to come stop me.

410
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,875
These rumors about a ghost.

411
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,958
They've been going
around for about a year.

412
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:32,041
It seems like she's a pretty
determined yokai.

413
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,416
Tell me, Keshi.

414
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,708
What is the wish
you'd ask us to grant?

415
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,541
I want you to help me become
a human just for a day.

416
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,666
And I want it to be during
the Bon Festival dance

417
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,666
so I can join in.

418
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,375
You want to be human?

419
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,458
Ashiya already told me
that the Mononokean isn't able

420
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,250
to turn a yokai into a human
for real and that's okay.

421
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,958
I don't mind it.

422
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,833
But instead,

423
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,250
I'd like you to help me
make a disguise, please.

424
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,250
So humans can see me,
without knowing I'm a yokai.

425
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,708
[ZENKO] Going around
fulfilling requests from yokai

426
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,458
sounds like pretty hard work.

427
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,208
But to my father at least,

428
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,583
nothing's harder than
remembering Ashiya's name.

429
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,875
Next time, "The Removal."

430
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,333
It should be kind of fun.
