1
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:15,000
Hey, how's it goin', Abeno?!

2
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,833
It's going all right, I guess.

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,333
I'm looking forward
to us working later!

4
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,291
Don't be. I think you'd
better take the day off.

5
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,416
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,166
You're pretty easily
wound up as it is,

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,166
and after what
happened yesterday,

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,541
just take some time.

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,208
All right then.

10
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,500
Forget what I said!

11
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,541
I'm working today
no matter what!

12
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,791
Huh?

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,333
No, you're not, n' don't argue.

14
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,250
I've made up my mind!

15
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,250
I'm coming to work,
no ifs, ands, or buts!

16
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,583
Why are you acting
so damn stubborn?

17
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,583
Just take the day to rest up.

18
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,541
No can do, Abeno.

19
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,958
[ABENO]
Huh?

20
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,791
[ASHIYA] It might be hard,
but even if I'm scared,

21
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,375
I need to face this.

22
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,208
After everything that happened,

23
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:09,000
I've honestly become
a little bit scared of yokai.

24
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,625
If I keep avoiding them,

25
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,875
then this nervousness could turn
into an even bigger problem,

26
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,166
so...

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,166
...I have to do this, okay?

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,791
Stop talkin' about workin'!

29
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:19,916
Huh?

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,041
Why don't you just
take some time off,

31
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,833
so you can hang out
with me and Saga?!

32
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,083
Don't'cha think you should be
a little more specific, Fusshi?

33
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,041
Oh yeah, I guess you're right.

34
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,750
This invite is
for the both of you.

35
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,125
Come to the photography
club summer camp!

36
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,250
You guys do a camp?

37
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,375
[ABENO]
Uhh?

38
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,416
I got 'em!

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,458
I knew there'd be
some around here!

40
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,416
Fuzzy, c'mon!

41
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,833
Up top, Abeno!

42
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,708
I found another one!

43
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,750
There's one more!

44
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,500
Whoa, a whole bunch of 'em!

45
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,833
[shrieks]

46
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:50,958
Sorry bud.

47
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,583
It looked like I was
gonna squash you.

48
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,458
I hope I didn't
scare you too much.

49
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,958
[ABENO]
Huh...

50
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,625
It looks like you really can
sense yokai from a distance.

51
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,833
Yeah, sure can!

52
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,458
Ever since the incident
with the Executive.

53
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,875
Silver lining?

54
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,458
The thing is,

55
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,833
it doesn't really work unless I
concentrate and hold my breath.

56
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,250
[ABENO]
Hmm...

57
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,958
[ASHIYA]
Hey! What does that mean?

58
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,000
No point in finding yokai
if you're useless after.

59
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,041
It's just dangerous.

60
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,166
[cell phone ringing]

61
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,625
Fusshi's calling.

62
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,166
[ABENO]
So answer him.

63
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,333
Yo!

64
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,250
[ABENO]
I'll summon the Mononokean.

65
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,416
[ASHIYA]
Oh yeah.

66
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,958
I really appreciate the invite,

67
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,958
but I can't do the
summer camp after all.

68
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,500
I didn't realize it was
for three full days.

69
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,000
Abeno and I can't
take off work for that long.

70
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,125
[FUSSHI]
Aw man.

71
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,166
If you gotta work,
I guess that's that.

72
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,958
I'll let Mr. Fuji
know what's up.

73
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,416
[ABENO]
Hm. Maybe we should go.

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,458
Huh?

75
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,291
Hey Fusshi, hold on a sec.

76
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,541
Did you say what I think?

77
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,791
Because uh, if I heard right...

78
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,416
[ABENO]
We're going to camp.

79
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,666
[ASHIYA] He looks conflicted,
but I'll take it!

80
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,750
Forget about
everything I just said!

81
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,125
You can count both
me and Abeno in

82
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,125
for the photography
club summer camp!

83
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,250
Yeah! That sounds great.

84
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,208
I'll talk to you
guys soon, okay?

85
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,250
What made ya decide to go?

86
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,541
Oh. It's because of
your crummy yokai sensing.

87
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,291
If we can train it up
at this summer camp,

88
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,625
then it might
actually be usable.

89
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,791
Sounds more like boot camp.

90
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,833
I'm gonna work on
your regimen until then.

91
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,750
So... here's the thing,

92
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,958
I don't really mind
being useless.

93
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:24,791
[ABENO]
What?

94
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,458
Uh. I'll work hard! Sir!

95
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,125
I'm goin' out
to play for a while.

96
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,083
[ZENKO]
Hmm?

97
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,833
Yahiko?

98
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,083
[ASHIYA]
Oh yeah.

99
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,625
This is gonna be
like boot camp for sure.

100
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,166
Okay!

101
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,250
It's time to push
myself to the limit!

102
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,833
Calm down, this is a
camp for photography.

103
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,166
You're barely
gonna break a sweat.

104
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,333
Taking pictures isn't that hard.

105
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,208
I've got disposable
cameras for anyone

106
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,833
who didn't bring
one of their own.

107
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,416
You even have to wind it?

108
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,458
So retro.

109
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,000
Whoa, I remember those things!

110
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,708
You should let me
have one too, Teach!

111
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,458
Hold on. Where did Abeno go?

112
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,083
What the crap, man?

113
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,166
How did you end up
getting your own room?

114
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,625
Huh?

115
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Huh?

116
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,625
Ahh... Ashiya.

117
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,916
Didn't notice me, did you?

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,916
Even with the
long ride over here.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why're you here?

120
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,250
I can't believe you
failed so hard!

121
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,875
He was riding on top
of the bus we took here.

122
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,000
You're kidding me.

123
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,500
Nope, he hid his presence.

124
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,833
That is not fair.

125
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,791
I didn't know the
training had started.

126
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:50,583
Hey.

127
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,000
Wait.

128
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,458
You can't just come to
this camp without permission.

129
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,625
Zenko will be worried about you.

130
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,208
Why? I let her know.

131
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,125
And I only came because
Haruitsuki asked me

132
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,791
to play hide and seek with you.

133
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,333
Wait, really?

134
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,791
So does that mean?

135
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,416
Yeah, you're talking to
your new training partner.

136
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,750
Huh?

137
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,333
[ABENO]
Yahiko will be looking for you.

138
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,791
Hide wherever you like.

139
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,875
But Yahiko's good at
controlling his presence.

140
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,333
You'll have to track
and avoid him to win.

141
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,166
Which means you'll need to
make use of your clairvoyance.

142
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,041
What's more,
you'll need to use it regularly,

143
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,833
and without getting winded.

144
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,083
If you can figure out
how to relax a bit,

145
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,416
you shouldn't always
have to hold your breath.

146
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,875
Oh, so that's why
you picked Yahiko.

147
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,166
Promise you won't
pull punches with me.

148
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,958
Do your worst.

149
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:34,791
Gladly.

150
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,333
You're mine, ya trashboat.

151
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,541
Try not to make it too easy.

152
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,875
[ASHIYA]
I'm 'onna trash your boat.

153
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,916
[ABENO] It's like a three-year-
old facing a five-year-old.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,750
Let's go.

155
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,416
I'm ready to get hidin'!

156
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,666
[ABENO] We'll start looking
for you in ten minutes.

157
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,458
[ASHIYA] And all I have to do to
win is hide for an hour, right?

158
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,333
How many seconds do
I count to get to ten minutes?

159
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,416
Six hundred.

160
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,875
[ASHIYA]
An hour's not much time at all.

161
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:01,916
I got this!

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,791
I'm starting!

163
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,583
One. Two.

164
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:10,083
Oh, hey, you wanna
take pictures with us?

165
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,083
Guess he's in a hurry.

166
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,375
[ASHIYA]
This is perfect.

167
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,500
If I can get good at sensing
Yahiko's presence,

168
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,666
then I'll become a way better
employee for the Mononokean too!

169
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,708
Okay.

170
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,041
Fuzzy is the
only yokai in the area.

171
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,708
But if I don't concentrate,
I can't even sense him.

172
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,541
And he's right next to me!

173
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,625
I don't get how Abeno's able
to feel out yokai so easily.

174
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,583
Maybe I should listen
for footsteps, too.

175
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,791
It kinda feels like
I'm an escaped criminal.

176
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,625
I found you, loser.

177
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,166
[laughs]

178
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,750
Get up. We're playing again.

179
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,375
[ASHIYA screams]

180
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,750
[SAGA]
Ugh!

181
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,625
Man, that animal
just won't stop squawking!

182
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,083
It kinda sounds
a bit like Ashiya.

183
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,375
Honestly, it's like
you're not even trying.

184
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,375
Even someone who's
never played this before

185
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,083
would be able to avoid
him for half an hour.

186
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,750
You suck so bad!

187
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,500
[ASHIYA]
They're a demonic duo.

188
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,666
More importantly, what's
with all the jump scares?

189
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,291
That isn't part of my training!

190
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,791
[YAHIKO]
It's just a bonus.

191
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,916
[ASHIYA]
Not for me it isn't!

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,583
Cut it out!

193
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,166
[ABENO] We may as well
call it quits for the day.

194
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:31,958
Let's go.

195
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,791
[YAHIKO]
Aww!

196
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,791
Wow. I didn't realize
it was so late.

197
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,375
We'll have to hurry
to get back before dark.

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,916
[ASHIYA]
Not again.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,625
I spent the whole day
letting Yahiko torment me.

200
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:50,708
And I still can't sense
him very well.

201
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,000
But I'm not done yet.

202
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,500
I swear,

203
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,750
tomorrow I'm gonna stay hidden
for half an hour at least.

204
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,333
Hey!

205
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,708
Wait up, Abeno!

206
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,958
If I beat him tomorrow, too,

207
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,958
then you gotta buy me
a ton of ice cream.

208
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,291
Wait, I've gotta buy it?

209
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,458
Yup!

210
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,875
[STUDENT C]
Yeah, hold that pose.

211
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,083
[STUDENT B]
Cheese!

212
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,791
[ABENO]
You're not sleeping here.

213
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:19,791
Hey hairball.

214
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,750
Yahiko.

215
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,958
Make him get up.

216
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,041
[knock, knock]

217
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,083
[FUSSHI]
Abeno!

218
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,500
Good timing.

219
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,500
Take this back to its room.

220
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,875
Whoa, he's out.

221
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,000
The people who run this place

222
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,791
said they'd lend
us some yukatas.

223
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,166
[FUSSHI] We're on our way to
grab some before they run out.

224
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,208
[SAGA]
We'd better hurry.

225
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,125
They're first-come,
first served.

226
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,625
That does sound comfortable.

227
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,791
I'm in.

228
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,666
[FUSSHI]
What about Ashiya?

229
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,208
[ABENO]
Let him sleep for now.

230
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,250
I'll pick one up for him.

231
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,166
[YAHIKO]
Don't forget to grab me a snack!

232
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,958
Get your useless butt up!

233
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,041
Haruitsuki ordered me
to take out the trash!

234
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,208
I've been authorized
to bite you!

235
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,916
[ASHIYA]
Hmm? Why are you so loud?

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,708
[YAHIKO growls]

237
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,666
Don't blame me if Haruistuki's
mad at you when he gets back.

238
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,083
I'm gonna make you
pay for this tomorrow.

239
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,333
I'll scare ya so bad
you'll pee yourself.

240
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,458
[ASHIYA]
Quit being a meanie.

241
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,458
[YAHIKO]
Hmm?

242
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,500
[ASHIYA]
I don't like scary stuff.

243
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,458
[YAHIKO snickers]

244
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,583
[ASHIYA gasps]

245
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,583
[shrieks]

246
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,666
[ASHIYA]
The Executive?

247
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,083
[ASHIYA]
He's gonna kill me!

248
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,250
[FUSSHI]
I'm starving.

249
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,625
Let's grab something to eat!

250
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,000
[ABENO]
Something feels off.

251
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,333
[YAHIKO gasps]

252
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,708
Wait. A-Ashiya...

253
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,541
Revert.

254
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,041
[YAHIKO]
Forgive me.

255
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,583
Ashiya.

256
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,375
I'm really sorry.

257
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,875
Please don't kill me.

258
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,541
[ASHIYA]
What are you saying?

259
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:52,333
You're the one who's been
trying to kill me, Executive.

260
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,208
Ashiya.

261
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm scared.

262
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,458
This human's scary.

263
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,250
If I don't do what
he tells me to,

264
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,125
then he'll kill me.

265
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,250
Get away from him!

266
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,791
No way.

267
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,333
Did you...?

268
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,666
Hey, what's going on?

269
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,041
Was I just...?

270
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,833
Huh. I just had
the weirdest dream.

271
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,041
There's no way
we're in the Underworld.

272
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:46,958
[ASHIYA]
Wait.

273
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,791
What did I just do?

274
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,000
Was it real?

275
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,333
It felt like--

276
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,375
[YAHIKO]
Ashiya.

277
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,083
You can use Influence, too?

278
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,000
"Influence"? What is that?

279
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,333
The light that was
around your hands.

280
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,541
It can.

281
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,541
Uh.

282
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,750
Look.

283
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,416
I'll explain how it works.

284
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,958
Just gimme a second
to think, okay?

285
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,666
Sorry, Yahiko. I was...

286
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,416
We're good.

287
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,791
I shouldn't have
tried to scare you.

288
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:32,000
[ABENO] We'll talk about
how Influence works later.

289
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,166
For now, just tell
me what happened.

290
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,833
Everything,
from when I left the room,

291
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,625
to when I came
back and found you.

292
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,000
Then tomorrow,
we can discuss things further.

293
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,166
Once you've rested.

294
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,791
[ASHIYA]
Okay.

295
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,916
[ASHIYA]
Influence.

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The same power Abeno used.

297
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,375
Please don't kill me.

298
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,875
[ASHIYA]
Just try to sleep.

299
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,208
[frogs croaking]

300
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,500
Ribbit?

301
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,208
You shouldn't've snuck up on me.

302
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,833
I definitely said
your name a few times.

303
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,000
Think you destroyed
my solar plexus.

304
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,166
Way to go, buddy.

305
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,875
My stomach may
have just ruptured.

306
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:45,833
[ASHIYA's stomach growls]

307
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,125
It sounds fine.

308
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,500
Damn it all!

309
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,375
You're s'posed to be
on my side, Tummy.

310
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,166
Why would you betray me?

311
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,125
Bet your favorite
drink'll shut you up.

312
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,458
Here, this café au lait is
Abeno's way of apologizing.

313
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:58,958
We should talk.

314
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,833
About yesterday.

315
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,833
Try using influence again.

316
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:03,708
You mean.

317
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,250
Like, right now?

318
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,750
Remember what you said.

319
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,500
The power came to you when
you thought you'd be killed.

320
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,125
[ASHIYA] I need to recreate
that same feeling.

321
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,583
Desperation.

322
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,541
Panic.

323
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,750
Fear.

324
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,833
And nothing happened.

325
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,958
Try it again.

326
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,583
[ASHIYA]
Sure thing.

327
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,291
It's all right
if you can't do it.

328
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,541
[ASHIYA]
Hmm?

329
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,958
As you've already seen,
when wielded properly,

330
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,875
influence can suppress
even the strongest yokai.

331
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,958
The hairball and
Yahiko--are no exceptions.

332
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,041
With influence,
you can give any instruction

333
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,000
and supersede a
yokai's own will.

334
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,250
Forcing them to do
exactly as commanded.

335
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,125
Depending on the way it's used,

336
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,583
it can even kill a yokai.

337
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,958
You should know.

338
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,666
When you walked in on me
using influence last night,

339
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,041
I wasn't in control of myself,
but I remember what happened.

340
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,541
I feel like, if you hadn't
shown up when you did,

341
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,166
I'd've kept going.

342
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,833
I really might've killed Yahiko.

343
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,000
Influence is a powerful tool.

344
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,250
For obvious reasons,

345
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,041
it's important that the
user show discretion.

346
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,916
But it's our best weapon.

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,750
So when your life is in danger.

348
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,000
If you're about to hesitate,

349
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,500
don't.

350
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,791
When the day comes
that you stop working for me,

351
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,583
use that power
to protect yourself.

352
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,333
If you can, that is.

353
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,208
Judging from what
you told me about it.

354
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,041
Last night was a fluke.

355
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,791
If you don't mind,

356
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,458
could you teach
me to control it?

357
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,000
[ABENO]
Hold your breath.

358
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,416
[ASHIYA]
Fuzzy?

359
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,208
You were here?

360
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,541
[ABENO]
Just as I thought,

361
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,916
you still weren't able to
pick up on his presence.

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,750
We should work
on one thing at a time.

363
00:17:58,833 --> 00:17:59,958
The first step is training up

364
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,375
that useless
clairvoyance of yours.

365
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,625
Let's get going.

366
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, okay.

367
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,125
We're playing hide
and seek again, today?

368
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,208
[ABENO]
Yeah. I'm counting on you.

369
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,625
Right.

370
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,125
[ABENO]
Okay, let's start.

371
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,375
[ASHIYA]
Yes, sir!

372
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,625
[YAHIKO]
Found ya again, Ashiya!

373
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:48,875
All right!

374
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,625
[ASHIYA] I couldn't even stay
hidden for 30 minutes yesterday,

375
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,791
but I'm lasting
a lot longer now.

376
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,875
Could it have to do
with my Influence?

377
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,875
Or is it the training?

378
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,125
I need to focus
on sensing Yahiko.

379
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,375
I'm definitely improving,

380
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,041
but I'm still a little
off sometimes.

381
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,875
Yahiko's presence.

382
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,250
It's still distant.

383
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,875
But I sense it.

384
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,208
[gasps]

385
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,958
I'm getting stronger
in a lot of ways.

386
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:27,250
But the fear I felt
back then has barely faded.

387
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,625
Besides...

388
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,666
[ABENO]
It can even kill a yokai.

389
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,708
[ASHIYA]
...that power's dangerous.

390
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,541
[ABENO] The hairball and
Yahiko are no exceptions.

391
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,875
I bet I must've
freaked you out too, Fuzzy.

392
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,583
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,791
[ASHIYA]
I didn't mean to scare you.

394
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:55,666
Yeah.

395
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,041
I'm okay.

396
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:09,166
How fragile do I have to be
to lose my cool out here?

397
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,916
I'm glad Abeno and
Yahiko aren't around.

398
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,875
But...

399
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,125
[sighs]

400
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,250
Getting to relax has done
me some real good.

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,291
[ASHIYA]
This place is so calming.

402
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,791
Just now, from that direction.

403
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,041
If you can figure out
how to relax a bit,

404
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,583
you shouldn't always
have to hold your breath.

405
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,000
I see now.

406
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,583
So that's what
he was getting at!

407
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,291
[chuckles]

408
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,791
Guys!

409
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,041
Check it!

410
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,541
Uh, did the noob forget
how hide and seek works?

411
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,875
Coming to us
makes him lose again.

412
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,458
[ASHIYA] Abeno, I think
I just figured it out!

413
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,541
Really!

414
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,500
I calmed down
and then it was easy!

415
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,583
[ABENO]
Huh?

416
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,375
Judging from the
smug look on his face.

417
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,666
I can sense you two
without holdin' my breath.

418
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,791
[ABENO]
As I thought.

419
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,041
So, everything's good now!

420
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,583
We can quit training, right?

421
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,458
Instead of talking big,
why don't you show some results?

422
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,875
[ASHIYA] Abeno does not seem
to think everything's good now.

423
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:19,875
Hey Yahiko.

424
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,875
I want you to go
all out next time.

425
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,083
Not a problem.

426
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,291
[ASHIYA]
Ah! He was going easy on me?

427
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,166
Ugh!

428
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,500
I've been so
worried about myself

429
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,541
that I didn't even consider
how Abeno was doing.

430
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,958
I wonder if he got
any kind of punishment

431
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,875
after what he did for me.

432
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,458
[ASHIYA]
I hope it wasn't too bad.

433
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,375
[LEGISLATOR] My apologies
for calling you out so late.

434
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,833
I'd like you to deliver
a message for me.

435
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,875
It's about the Executive.

436
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,708
Feeling up to it?

437
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:33,958
[ASHIYA]
Camp's over,

438
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,958
so I can start enjoying
summer vacation now!

439
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,208
Or, so I thought, but then
the Legislator came to visit,

440
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,791
and we got a job about a ghost!

441
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,041
Next time: "The Dabbler"!

442
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,166
So much for my vacation.
