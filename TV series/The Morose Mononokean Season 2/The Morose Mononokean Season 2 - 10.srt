1
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,125
It appears he's been doing
quite a bit of research here.

2
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,791
But he hasn't found
what he's looking for.

3
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,250
Hm?

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,500
[LEGISLATOR] Well, he may
have found one clue, at least.

5
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,000
[ringing]

6
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,500
Now I see.

7
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,125
I got a report from my employees
of a shrill beeping noise

8
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,958
that was coming
from the archives.

9
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,291
It looks as though this little
slab of metal is our culprit.

10
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,666
Why do things from the mundane
world cause such a racket?

11
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,250
[cell phone alarm]

12
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,208
[ASHIYA]
Aw, man, break time's over.

13
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,416
Abeno said he'd be here by noon.

14
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,750
Where is he?

15
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,166
[FUSSHI]
Ashiya!

16
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,791
It's time for you to shine.

17
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,208
[ASHIYA]
I'm coming!

18
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,750
[ASHIYA]
Oh, hey, there you are.

19
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,833
[FUSSHI]
About time you showed.

20
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,875
[ASHIYA, FUSSHI]
Trick or treat, Happy Halloween!

21
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,333
[ABENO]
Huh?

22
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,583
Hmm?

23
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,583
[SAGA]
So you've finally arrived.

24
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,708
The mystery of your appearance
has been unraveled!

25
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,625
[ABENO]
Who is that?

26
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,416
[ASHIYA] I can't believe
he was late to the festival.

27
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,375
Was he being sneaky and
working without me again?

28
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,833
[SAGA]
Don't worry.

29
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,750
We've got an awesome costume
ready for you, too, Abeno.

30
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,791
[FUSSHI] Get changed quick,
or it's tricks for you.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,750
[SAGA]
You won't escape from my grasp.

32
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,333
[FUSSHI]
This'll be so fun!

33
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,375
[ASHIYA]
I'll ask where he was later.

34
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,583
Class 1-2 is putting on
a Halloween café today!

35
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,333
Visit us for some spooky fun!

36
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,666
It might even
scare you to death.

37
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,333
[ASHIYA] Come on, we're supposed
to advertise for our class.

38
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,583
You're the grim reaper,
play it up.

39
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,583
Do a little reaping.

40
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,458
Shut up or I'll reap you.

41
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,666
Witch boy.

42
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,333
[ASHIYA] Please forgive me,
Mr. Mopey Pants.

43
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,208
Seriously, a morose grim reaper
makes for a terrible PR guy.

44
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,458
Where did the customer
service face he uses

45
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,333
when he's with yokai go?

46
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,375
Please, visit!

47
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,416
Try our terrifyingly yummy menu

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,833
of pumpkin smoothies,
fondue, and skewers!

49
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,750
I personally recommend
the pumpkin cilantro pie!

50
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,250
Maybe we'd have more customers

51
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,250
if we weren't promoting
such a weird menu.

52
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,583
Or how about some
delicious kabocha tea?

53
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,333
It'll fend of colds
and warm up your bones!

54
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,875
If a witch and a grim reaper
tried to sell me this food,

55
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,958
I'd think they were
trying to poison me.

56
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:46,750
[ASHIYA grunts]

57
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,000
Dude!

58
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,500
If you're gonna act
like an evil monster,

59
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,416
ya may as well promote the café!

60
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,708
Just try and make me.

61
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,083
Whoa.

62
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,583
They're actually gonna
duke it out in the hallway?

63
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,708
Do you think they're
with the kendo club?

64
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,500
No more fighting.

65
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,541
I'll be taking these.

66
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
So, your class is doing
a Halloween theme, huh?

67
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,541
Yeah, you should drop by
and see how it looks.

68
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,791
[ZENKO]
Sure.

69
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,958
Did you bring anyone,
or is it just you here?

70
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,833
Yeah. I brought someone.

71
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,625
It was an accident,

72
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,166
but I mentioned the festival
to Yahiko yesterday.

73
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,916
[YAHIKO]
No! No! No!

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,625
I wanna play too, Zenko.

75
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,333
[ZENKO]
He's throwing a huge tantrum.

76
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,541
It's cute.

77
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,291
You have to take me
with you, Zenko,

78
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,250
if you don't, I'm gonna die!

79
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,291
No, you won't.

80
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,916
And if you go
without permission,

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,166
then Abeno will be angry.

82
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,458
Oh. Haruitsuki.

83
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,208
He is scary when he gets mad.

84
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,833
[ZENKO]
That was easy.

85
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,250
[YAHIKO] Hey, ya want
some help cleaning up?

86
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,500
What should I do?

87
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,583
I'll put you in charge
of sweeping the floors.

88
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,791
[YAHIKO]
Great!

89
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,625
[ZENKO]
This'll actually save me time.

90
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,166
No dust escapes
from his tail-broom.

91
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,791
I'm being super helpful,

92
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,708
so I can go to the
cultural festival, right?

93
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,708
Huh? Not a chance.

94
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,875
What?

95
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,083
Come on, please!

96
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,625
I want to make a
ball of cotton candy

97
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,666
that's two, no,
three times as tall as me.

98
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,666
I want to swim in
a pool of ice cream!

99
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,208
And then when I'm full I'll
throw all the stupid fake ghosts

100
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,458
out of the haunted house
and scare the humans myself!

101
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,708
And it's because you want
to do that stuff you can't go.

102
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,583
Uh...

103
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,000
[ASHIYA]
Yahiko's a total menace!

104
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,250
Just the thought of him
coming here scares me!

105
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,916
Please tell me you didn't
end up bringing him.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,208
I shouldn't have,
but yeah, I did.

107
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,208
[ASHIYA]
If that's true.

108
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,583
Then where is he right now?

109
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,458
About that,

110
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,208
he and I kind of got
separated in the crowd earlier.

111
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,250
[ASHIYA]
He got lost?

112
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,625
[ABENO]
More like he's hiding.

113
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,750
Think about it.

114
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,416
Even with all these people,

115
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,875
he'd be able to smell
Zenko right away.

116
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,708
And he must be actively
concealing his presence.

117
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,500
Or else the five year old
and I would sense him.

118
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,708
Yahiko's on the run.

119
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,833
He was planning
this from the start.

120
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,916
[ASHIYA] This is gonna
be a full-blown disaster!

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,583
We need to find him right now!

122
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,958
There is one place
he said he wanted to go.

123
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,208
[ABENO]
What was it?

124
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,708
[ZENKO]
This.

125
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,291
[ASHIYA] Oh man, why'd it
have to be the haunted house?

126
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,750
[NURSE]
Oh. Three new patients, is it?

127
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,916
Please.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,583
[coughs]

129
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,875
Come inside--

130
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,250
[coughs]

131
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,791
[screams]

132
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,916
Please, make it stop!

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,583
No!

134
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,375
The last part was
surprisingly touching.

135
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,916
Yeah.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,166
Doesn't a haunted house

137
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,791
with a happy ending defeat
the whole purpose?

138
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,083
And we didn't even find Yahiko.

139
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,416
Should we go through again?

140
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,625
No, if he had been in there,

141
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,666
I would've spotted
him the first time.

142
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,500
If not there, then
where do we look now?

143
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,833
[SHOP CLERK]
What can I get'cha?

144
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,125
Hi, I'd like a
vanilla cone, please.

145
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,250
[SHOP CLERK]
Cool. Here you go!

146
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,000
Huh?

147
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,791
The tip disappeared.

148
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,666
But how?

149
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,375
[YAHIKO] Yay! The cultural
festival's so fun!

150
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,541
I'm gonna eat every
dessert they've got!

151
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,125
That crepe is floating!

152
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,375
[YAHIKO] There are tons
of things to play, too.

153
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,958
Humans shouldn't get
to have all the fun.

154
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,083
It just not fair!

155
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,708
Wonder what I should do next!

156
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,541
[laughs]

157
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,750
Uh.

158
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,500
It's you.

159
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,041
Huh?

160
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,375
[gasps]

161
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,875
I'm pretty sure that Fuzzy
is sending me a signal.

162
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,875
Do you think he found Yahiko?

163
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,125
I was right to call
in the hairball.

164
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,333
If we track Fuzzy's presence,
we'll find our missing yokai.

165
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,333
Then start tracking.

166
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,416
We can't let him get away.

167
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,958
Right behind you!

168
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,625
[YAHIKO]
Let go of me.

169
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,041
I can't play like this!

170
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,166
Ashiya.

171
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,750
[gasps]

172
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,458
[YAHIKO]
Crap. Haruitsuki.

173
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,083
Uh...

174
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,375
Bad.

175
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,125
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

176
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,208
Haruitsuki!

177
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,041
I want you to play with me!

178
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,125
Hey.

179
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,875
You could at least
try to act sorry.

180
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:27,916
I don't think you understand

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,958
how much trouble
you caused, mister!

182
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,291
The darts started
throwing themselves,

183
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,166
and they set a new high score!

184
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,375
I just had a sick jam session
with a ghost drummer!

185
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,458
The brush just started
painting on its own,

186
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,625
but the worst part is that the
only color it would use was red!

187
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,416
Just go home before
you cause even more

188
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,833
of an uproar than you have.

189
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,166
What?

190
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,041
No way!

191
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,041
Go home!

192
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,541
No way!

193
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,708
No way, no way, no way, no way,
no way, no way, no way...

194
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,750
Yahiko seems even harder to
deal with than usual today.

195
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,958
[YAHIKO] No way,
no way, no way, no way...

196
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,250
About that,

197
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,291
I wasn't actually planning
to bring him but...

198
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,000
[YAHIKO]
Okay, fine.

199
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,666
I won't go to the dumb festival.

200
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,166
I hate the festival.

201
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,208
Are you okay?

202
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,166
[YAHIKO]
Humans are so selfish.

203
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,041
Why're you the only ones who get
to play as much as you wanna?

204
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,583
Why do I have
to hide and be quiet?

205
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,875
It's not fair.

206
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,708
I live in this world too.

207
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,166
Yahiko.

208
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,500
[YAHIKO]
It's fine!

209
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:34,625
I'll just hang out in
Okina's forest tomorrow.

210
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,666
[ZENKO] What snacks do
you want me to bring you?

211
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,791
I want some kinako
mochi and cocoa!

212
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,666
[ZENKO]
I don't have either of those.

213
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,250
Sorry.

214
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,625
Aww... Okay.

215
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,541
What should I have?

216
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,916
Then what about crepes,
ice cream, or cotton candy.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,458
Do you like any of those?

218
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,458
[YAHIKO]
Hmm?

219
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,750
Come to the festival
and get all you want.

220
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,458
I said despite myself.

221
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,458
That's a tough one.

222
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,833
Yahiko.

223
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,541
We need to go home now.

224
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,541
We can't let you cause
any more trouble at the school.

225
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,541
What're you doing?

226
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,666
Stop moping.

227
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,958
I'll play with you.

228
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,708
[YAHIKO]
Huh?

229
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,125
[gasps]

230
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,875
Now, that said,
we can't play here.

231
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,375
We should go
somewhere without people.

232
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,125
Ah! 'Kay!

233
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,541
I know! Let's go
to Okina's place!

234
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,791
I'll meet you there

235
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,000
after I've changed back
into my regular clothes.

236
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,291
[YAHIKO]
Cool!

237
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,541
I'm gonna race you to see

238
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,250
if I'm faster than the
Mononokean or not!

239
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,833
Later!

240
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,833
Hey, Abeno.

241
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,333
Don't you have more work
to do for the festival?

242
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,541
My real job is
working with yokai,

243
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,250
so they always come first.

244
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,083
Regardless, I'm sure
this human megaphone

245
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,250
can handle advertising himself.

246
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,541
I'm on it, sir.
You can leave the rest to me!

247
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,083
[ZENKO] By the way,
could I get a picture

248
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,916
with the two of you in costume?

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,875
--[ASHIYA] Sure thing!
--[ABENO] Not happening.

250
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,458
[ABENO]
You lose this round.

251
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,000
Aww.

252
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,041
I ran as fast as I could, too.

253
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,000
[ABENO]
What should we play?

254
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,458
I'm gonna decide while I rest.

255
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,958
[yawns]

256
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,541
[ABENO]
Yahiko.

257
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,833
[YAHIKO]
Hm?

258
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,666
Do you know of a human
named Sakae Ashiya?

259
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,541
Ashiya, huh?

260
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,333
Yeah. Course I know him.

261
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,375
We just saw him.

262
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,375
No, not him.
I said Sakae Ashiya.

263
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,541
[YAHIKO] Then I don't know
who you're talking about.

264
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,083
He's Ashiya, but not Ashiya?

265
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,125
That's confusing, Haruitsuki.

266
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,875
Who do you mean?

267
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,833
Guess the name's
a bad starting point.

268
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,541
This man could see yokai.

269
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,333
and he may have helped
with Mononokean business.

270
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,750
Although it would've
been in secret.

271
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,208
He was close to Aoi.

272
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,250
Both his hair
and eyes were golden.

273
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,125
Although his hair
was most likely dyed,

274
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,750
and he might've
worn colored-contacts.

275
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,833
That bring anyone to mind?

276
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,750
Sixteen years ago.

277
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:47,000
Or maybe about 60 years, if I
account for your sense of time.

278
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,333
That human died.

279
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,250
I don't know all the
surrounding details, but...

280
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,958
...it was the year
Ashiya was born.

281
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,458
If that's the case,

282
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,791
then the "Father" he told
me he met when he was three...

283
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,000
[YAHIKO]
I think I know your guy.

284
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,291
Huh?

285
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,750
Are you sure?

286
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,833
[YAHIKO]
Hmm...

287
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:07,875
Tell you what.

288
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,166
Play with me
until I'm satisfied...

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,208
[YAHIKO] ...and I'll transform
into his shape for you.

290
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,416
Who's ready to trick-or-treat?

291
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,958
Class 1-2 is running
a Halloween themed café.

292
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,291
Try the pumpkin cilantro pie.

293
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,416
It's really good. I hear.

294
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,875
Your cloak seems a bit long.

295
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,208
It's okay.

296
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:34,000
I feel bad that Yahiko put
a damper on things here.

297
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,833
So filling in was
the least I could do.

298
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,250
It's rare to see Abeno
letting himself have fun.

299
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,041
He even cosplayed.

300
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,500
Dressing him up
like the grim reaper

301
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,166
was our classmates' idea.

302
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,458
They made him.

303
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,500
He would want me to
tell you that he hated it.

304
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,916
But... regardless
of his feelings.

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,166
He looked good.

306
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,791
[ZENKO]
Yeah.

307
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,000
[ASHIYA]
It's strange, though.

308
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,958
Dressed like that,
Abeno kinda reminded me of Dad.

309
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,166
[ASHIYA]
Seeing him on Christmas

310
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,541
with that backdrop of snow,

311
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:17,333
well, I thought he
looked like Santa.

312
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,333
But in retrospect,

313
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,333
that outfit was
less like Santa's

314
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:25,583
and more like...
the grim reaper's.

315
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,416
[ZENKO]
Trick-or-treat.

316
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
[ASHIYA]
Trick-or-treat.

317
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,291
[YAHIKO]
Okay, Haruitsuki!

318
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,833
This time I'll seek n' you hide!

319
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,125
[sighs]

320
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,541
Isn't three hours of
playing enough for you?

321
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,916
[YAHIKO]
Sure isn't.

322
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,750
Zenko will worry if
you aren't back before sundown.

323
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,541
[groans]

324
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,333
All right, I'll go home.

325
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,333
[ABENO]
Not yet.

326
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,125
First you have
a promise to keep.

327
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,583
What kinda promise?

328
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,125
Oh yeah, I remember now.

329
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,666
I said I'd turn into that guy.

330
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,833
Ta-da!

331
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,333
It's been a while, but I think
this is what he looked like.

332
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,708
I was playing
with Yahiko in the woods.

333
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,291
[ABENO]
So that was him.

334
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,458
Sakae Ashiya.

335
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,208
Ashiya's father.

336
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,958
[ABENO]
A school uniform?

337
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,791
[YAHIKO] I used to go
and play with Aoi a lot.

338
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,458
One time, I saw
this guy there too.

339
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,458
We talked a bit, and I think
he told me what his name was.

340
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,666
But I forgot.

341
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,666
And you didn't realize
this human had died?

342
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,375
[YAHIKO] Hmm...
Didn't have a clue.

343
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,083
I don't really care about humans

344
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,916
unless they're
gonna play with me.

345
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,041
So I never thought about

346
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,958
if he was old enough
to be dead by now.

347
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,583
[ABENO sighs]

348
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,458
Oh. I just remembered!

349
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,583
When we'd just met
and I asked him who he was,

350
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:19,791
the human told me he was an
employee of the Mononokean.

351
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,750
[ABENO]
So he worked for Aoi before me.

352
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,083
But I scoured every last report,

353
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,583
and I couldn't find
any reference to that.

354
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,750
Could Aoi have been hiding him

355
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,791
from the Legislator
and the Mononokean?

356
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,083
[bell chiming]

357
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,583
Hold on a second.

358
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,083
[gasps]

359
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,166
Komon was here?

360
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,875
All right.

361
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,416
Huh.

362
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,208
Fuzzy!

363
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,125
[ABENO]
Uh? Hey, Mononokean.

364
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,083
Door's in the wrong spot.

365
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,833
[ASHIYA]
C'mon, Fuzzers, you can do it!

366
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,000
Just a bit more!

367
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,875
Keep on pushing!

368
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,541
Just like that.

369
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,333
You've almost made it!

370
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,375
Wait, was that a...?

371
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,791
[ASHIYA screams]
Fuzzy!

372
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,958
Hey! Abeno!

373
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,750
Fuzzy got kidnapped
by a friggin' bird!

374
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,541
Oh no! It's prolly
gonna eat him!

375
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,208
That wasn't actually a bird.

376
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,083
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

377
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,208
I'm pretty sure that was--

378
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,125
[bell chiming]

379
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,875
So who is Komon?

380
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,333
They're the client
we've come to meet.

381
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,750
Um, are you really sure

382
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,791
that it's the right
place this time?

383
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,375
I am.

384
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,500
Hope you're not afraid
of heights or lethal falls.

385
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,083
[ASHIYA] Why would
I not be scared of that?

386
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,291
[chirping]

387
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,208
Do I hear chirping?

388
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,041
[ABENO]
Forgive the intrusion.

389
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,375
Abeno?

390
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,000
Remember what you were
saying about lethal falls?

391
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,000
[ABENO]
Hairball. You all right?

392
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,750
Well at least they aren't
eating you, just making a nest.

393
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,708
You'll be all right.

394
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,500
Hey! What're you doing?

395
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,291
Get your grimy
beaks off Fuzzy's pure fur!

396
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,000
Shoo!

397
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,666
[KOMON] All right,
what's the matter, kids?

398
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,416
What? There are
humans in your nest?

399
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,541
Well, that's
certainly a surprise.

400
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,208
But remember what I told you,

401
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,000
humans can't see
or hear us yokai at all.

402
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,625
So there's no need
for you to be afraid.

403
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,916
Now watch closely.

404
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,083
I'm gonna make them go away

405
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,291
with these chestnut
burrs I just picked.

406
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,083
[ABENO]
That you, Komon?

407
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,208
Huh?

408
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,791
My name is Abeno.

409
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,708
I'm with the Mononokean.

410
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,708
What's that?

411
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,083
Did you just say
"the Mononokean"?

412
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,875
[ASHIYA] Is that
yokai seriously our client?

413
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,958
Don't think I remember you.

414
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,375
Oh! Yeah!

415
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,250
You've grown a fair bit,
but that blonde hair's the same.

416
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,291
You must be that human
employee of the Mononokean!

417
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,666
Itsuki, right?

418
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,875
[ABENO]
Yes.

419
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,708
[ASHIYA] So they knew him
when he wasn't the master?

420
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,458
I'm here to do that old job.

421
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,833
The one from
the first time we met.

422
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,541
[ASHIYA] If this is a job from
when Abeno was just an employee,

423
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,083
then it must have
started way back.

424
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,791
When Aoi was still the master.

425
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,958
Itsuki!

426
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,250
It's good to see that
you haven't forgotten us.

427
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,250
Even after all this time.

428
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,083
What should we do now?

429
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,583
I suppose they
should be exorcised

430
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,041
to the Underworld, but...

431
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,416
[ABENO] They're not strong
enough to be exorcised.

432
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,791
They wouldn't be able to adapt
to life in the Underworld.

433
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,541
There isn't much of a choice.

434
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,625
Now that I picked them up,

435
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,208
I can't just abandon
them somewhere.

436
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,583
I'll take care of them

437
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,166
until they're strong enough
to be exorcised, okay?

438
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,541
[ABENO]
What do you think, Aoi?

439
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,916
[AOI] That sounds like
a fine solution.

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,250
Just mind that you don't
take care of them too well.

441
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,208
Uh, what?

442
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,625
[AOI]
It's settled.

443
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,166
Please let us know when
they're ready to be exorcised.

444
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:54,250
Let's go home to
the Mononokean, Itsuki.

445
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,125
[ABENO]
Right.

446
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,750
[ASHIYA]
Can birds be quintuplets?

447
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,541
Would they have to come
from the same egg?

448
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,916
Anyway, we're exorcising
five yokai siblings,

449
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,875
but one can't fly.

450
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,708
Next time, "The Return."

451
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,833
It looks like maybe
there's a good reason?
