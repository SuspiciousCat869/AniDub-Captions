00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,375
[FUSSHI]
Hey, Abeno!

2
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,333
Ya wanna walk home with us?

3
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:12,958
Huh?

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,416
Uh-uh.

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,125
So about the class theme, uh...

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,208
Well...

7
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,500
Have you guys
come up with your ideas?

8
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,166
Mine's Russian Roulette
cream puffs.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,333
And mine's
a fake convenience store.

10
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,541
What was yours?

11
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,041
[ASHIYA]
Hmm?

12
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll see you guys later.

13
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,416
See ya, bro!

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,333
You take care, okay?

15
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,791
Hey, didn't you say you
have the day off, Ashiya.

16
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,000
[ASHIYA]
Yup.

17
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:40,958
Then let's go to the
store on the way home

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,583
and try out that new ice cream.

19
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,375
It's wagyu sukiyaki flavor!

20
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,500
[ASHIYA]
Uh. Hang on a sec.

21
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,041
Who is this?

22
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,291
Oh.

23
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,541
Last month's pork bone broth

24
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,208
and back fat ramen
ice cream sure was great.

25
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,625
Yeah. I have to admit,
it really surprised me.

26
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,875
Right? Even with
all that fat sprinkled on,

27
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,125
it wasn't too rich.

28
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,500
There were so
many different textures.

29
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,541
I didn't know what to think.

30
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,458
[ABENO]
Mononokean, come.

31
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,458
[ASHIYA pants]

32
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,708
Found you.

33
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,041
[ABENO]
Huh?

34
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,083
I told you I had business
in the Underworld today.

35
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,791
You can stay here.

36
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:29,791
What is it?

37
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,291
[ASHIYA pants]

38
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,666
I need a favor.

39
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,875
[ASHIYA]
Just now.

40
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,916
My mom passed out at the shop.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,250
Apparently, they
took her to the hospital.

42
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,583
I need to be there.

43
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,625
Can you take me to see her?

44
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,666
[ABENO]
Go change your shoes first.

45
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,833
I appreciate this.

46
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,333
[INTERCOM] Doctor Chikamatsu,
you're needed in pediatrics.

47
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,500
Doctor Chikamatsu,
please report to pediatrics.

48
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,708
Mom. Hey.

49
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,958
How're ya feelin'?

50
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,166
They said this
was an anemic thing?

51
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,166
I got dizzy out of nowhere.

52
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,625
I'll be fine,

53
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,000
but they'd like to keep me
here overnight just in case.

54
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,708
I had a good run actually.

55
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,083
Funny enough, I can't
remember this happening to me

56
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,625
ever since having you.

57
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,541
I'd pass out from anemia
all the time when I was young.

58
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,291
You know, getting sick like
this again kind of takes me back

59
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,625
to the good old days.

60
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,125
Strange as it sounds.

61
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,833
I'm just glad
you're doing so well.

62
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,333
[ASHIYA]
Fuzzy?!

63
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,583
Oh, sorry, honey,

64
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,083
my headache suddenly
feels a lot worse.

65
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,083
[ASHIYA]
Did Fuzzy give her anemia?

66
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,583
Uh. Hold on.

67
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,958
Fuzzy just got here.

68
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,458
Don't tell me.

69
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,875
Hey, Mom, could you do me
a favor and sit up real quick?

70
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,375
[ASHIYA'S MOM groans]

71
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,875
My body just feels so heavy.

72
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,208
[ASHIYA gasps]

73
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,875
I knew it!

74
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:06,833
What'cha doin'?

75
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,708
[ASHIYA]
Nothing, one sec.

76
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,375
Oh wow.

77
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,125
Do you feel any better now?

78
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,666
So much better.

79
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,916
My headache's gone, and I don't
seem to be nauseous anymore.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I feel incredibly light now.

81
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,500
I think I'm healed!

82
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,916
Uh...

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,291
[ASHIYA]
Hm?

84
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,166
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
That surprised me.

85
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,041
Remember how I said I used
to go through this pretty often?

86
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,333
[ASHIYA]
Mm.

87
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,916
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
When I'd get anemic,

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,625
there was no amount of medicine
or treatment that could help me.

89
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,500
But you know what?

90
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,291
No matter how bad I felt.

91
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,208
Sakae could always
make it better, just like that.

92
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,333
He'd take a look at
my back like you did,

93
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,000
then do some secret thing
and I'd feel good as new.

94
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,750
Seems you're more
like him than I thought.

95
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,833
Your dad, I mean

96
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,375
[HINOHARA] Are you part of
Ms. Ashiya's family, sir?

97
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,833
[ABENO]
No...

98
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,416
So how are we doing?

99
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,375
You're sitting up!

100
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,291
That seems like a good sign.

101
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,000
Now, that my son's here,
I suddenly feel a lot better.

102
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,458
Ah, so then you must be Hanae.

103
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,333
I'm Hinohara, we spoke on
the phone a little while ago.

104
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,083
Oh. Nice to meet you,
thanks for calling me.

105
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,416
I should ask you.

106
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,791
The blonde boy out in the hall,
is he your friend?

107
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,333
Did you say he was blonde?

108
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,750
[gasps]

109
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,291
[ASHIYA]
Abeno?

110
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,083
I came to retrieve
the escaped hairball.

111
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,541
So what's with the yokai
that stuck itself to his back?

112
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,708
[ASHIYA] It was doing this
to my mom until a second ago.

113
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,000
Once I took it off her,
she was fine.

114
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,750
Hello there.

115
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,458
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

116
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,458
It felt like I was hugging
something strangely fluffy.

117
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,583
I must've switched
perches in my sleep.

118
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:05,583
But at any rate, I need to get
back to that human now, so bye.

119
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,125
[ABENO]
Excuse me, sir.

120
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,458
I apologize for detaining you,

121
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,958
but would you allow me
a moment of your time?

122
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,166
[ARANAKI]
Huh?

123
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,250
You see,

124
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,875
I'm Abeno, Master
of the Mononokean.

125
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,250
You're with the Mononokean?

126
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,500
[ARANAKI] I was only clinging
on to the human for a moment!

127
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,000
Not long at all. I swear!

128
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,333
[sobs]

129
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,708
I had been walking for
such a terribly long time,

130
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,916
and then I saw a human
who looked easy to possess,

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,291
so I decided to
take a short rest.

132
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,666
I knew it would
weaken the human,

133
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,208
but I figured she had
a little strength to spare.

134
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,000
[sobs]

135
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,666
It wasn't like I was trying
to cause the human trouble!

136
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,541
So please, sir!

137
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,958
Don't exorcise me
to the Underworld!

138
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,208
I won't touch any more humans!

139
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:57,208
Please, I don't wanna
be buried in yokai hell!

140
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,000
[ABENO] At this rate,
he'll bust through the ceiling.

141
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,083
[ARANAKI]
I see.

142
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,875
So the Underworld isn't
a graveyard for yokai.

143
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:11,666
[ABENO]
Right.

144
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,708
I'm glad that's clear now.

145
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,500
Well, Aranaki,

146
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,416
would you like for me
to exorcise you now?

147
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,083
Or should I wait?

148
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,500
With my body like this,

149
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,166
I think I'd get tired even from
moving a small distance.

150
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,583
But if I get some rest, I think
I can return to my normal size.

151
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,083
So if I could ask a favor.

152
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,250
What do you need?

153
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,708
Ideally, I'd like to
cling onto the human

154
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,208
from before again.

155
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,375
She was exceptionally
comfortable.

156
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,750
To be honest,

157
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,166
I haven't slept that deeply
in a really long time.

158
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,291
So would you mind?

159
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,958
[ASHIYA]
Hmm?

160
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,541
[ABENO]
Let's try a substitute.

161
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,541
That really hits the spot.

162
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,708
This human's an
absolute joy to possess.

163
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,333
He's brimming with energy.

164
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,041
I feel stronger already.

165
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,416
[ABENO]
It looks like you're compatible.

166
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,041
I feel like I just
donated half my blood.

167
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,875
You've found your calling
as a yokai magnet

168
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,125
[ASHIYA]
This exhaustion.

169
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,458
It isn't like when
Fuzzy possessed me.

170
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,750
I'll be careful not
to suck out too much.

171
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,625
Hold on.

172
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,958
Just what are you "sucking out"?

173
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:15,875
Dude!

174
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,125
Stop whining.

175
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,041
If you're strong enough
to talk, you're fine.

176
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:24,333
Well, Aranaki, I'll send for you
in about two hours, all right?

177
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,000
Until then, please take
your time recuperating.

178
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,250
I'd almost forgotten.

179
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,333
You still have work
to do in the Underworld,

180
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,666
isn't that right, Abeno?

181
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,416
Yeah, I need to head
that way pretty soon.

182
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,208
Ready, Hairball?

183
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,625
You're comin' too.

184
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,291
Hanae, I need a favor.

185
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,458
[gasps]

186
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,333
Uh. Sure thing.
What's the matter?

187
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,875
Hello there, I'm Abeno.

188
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,666
It's a pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.

189
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,208
I'm Ashiya's mother, Nara.

190
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,958
It's a pleasure
to meet you as well.

191
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,875
Though I wish I wasn't
in a hospital gown.

192
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,166
The Monono--

193
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,333
Uh... I mean Abeno
brought me to the hospital!

194
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,125
That's very kind of you.

195
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,291
Did you come by bus?

196
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,208
Let me reimburse
you for the fare.

197
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,041
Oh!

198
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,875
But I don't have my wallet.

199
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,875
[ABENO]
Please, don't worry about it.

200
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,291
You mentioned needing
help with something?

201
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,666
--[ASHIYA] That's right!
--[ASHIYA'S MOM] Oh yeah!

202
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,208
 I forgot!

203
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,916
I didn't get to lock the house
before they brought me here.

204
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,791
Plus I never closed the store.

205
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,208
No worries. I'll head
back and lock things up.

206
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,250
Thanks so much, sweetie.

207
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,625
Golden hair and eyes to match.

208
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,416
They're the same hue.

209
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
The same as Sakae.

210
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,041
Just like a sunflower.

211
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,750
Door's unlocked,
but is anyone home?

212
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,000
Hanae!

213
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,000
Your beloved sister's here!

214
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,500
This is the last one, Ashiya.
You're doing a fine job!

215
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,416
You can do this!

216
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Just keep pushing!

217
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,875
Yeah!

218
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,166
[ARANAKI]
Whoa... Steady does it.

219
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,583
Baby steps!

220
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,083
Took long enough,
but we're done here.

221
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,291
I'm sure your mother
would be proud.

222
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,375
Yeah. I try.

223
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,083
[ASHIYA]
Can I sleep here?

224
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,833
[ARANAKI]
I probably wouldn't advise it.

225
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,708
[ASHIYA'S SISTER pants]

226
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,458
He's not breathing!

227
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,750
Live, damn it, live!

228
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,291
I'm not gonna let you die!

229
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,250
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
It's not enough.

230
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,916
Then here goes!

231
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,041
[ASHIYA grunts] Stop!
I was breathing fine, 'kay?

232
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,166
Just relax. Will you?

233
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,166
So I came back on a whim

234
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,125
to pay the two of you
a surprise visit.

235
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,875
Only to find out
Mom's in the hospital

236
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,375
and then to see you
splayed out on the ground.

237
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,041
I'm glad that you'd be quick
to act if I did need saving,

238
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,625
but maybe take a second
to check next time.

239
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,666
Felt like you were
gonna kill me yourself.

240
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,666
I dunno, kinda feel
like I did check first.

241
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,375
Well, ya didn't.

242
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,666
So how do you like it?

243
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,916
I've been trying to up
my omelet rice game.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,458
I can tell, it's tasty.

245
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,375
Now why don't you
stop watching me eat

246
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,583
and start working on yours?

247
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,541
Oh, that smells delicious.

248
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:39,166
You wouldn't mind if
I had a bite, would you?

249
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,000
You know, actually,

250
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,416
I think it could use
more ketchup.

251
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,625
Could you grab some?

252
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,625
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
You wanted more?

253
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,375
Yeah, just a little bit.

254
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,541
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
Okay.

255
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,750
[ASHIYA]
While she's not looking.

256
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:54,250
[ARANAKI]
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm! So good!

257
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,208
It's completely delicious!

258
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,833
Oh!

259
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,541
It seems that delightful flavor
turned my body back to normal!

260
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,041
[ASHIYA]
Nice, omelet rice!

261
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,791
Ya did good, gurl!

262
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,833
[ASHIYA]
No reaction,

263
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,041
even with Aranaki
talking right in front of her.

264
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,958
Doesn't look like
Sis can see yokai.

265
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,666
Mom either.

266
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,250
[ASHIYA'S MOM] Seems you're
more like him than I thought.

267
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,708
Your dad, I mean

268
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,166
[ASHIYA]
Are you Santa Claus?

269
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,500
No, I'm not.

270
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,666
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

271
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,083
[SAKAE] But it was Santa
who asked me to come by.

272
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,250
Oh.

273
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,666
Well are you my dad, then?

274
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,625
There ya go.

275
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,333
Sorry I took so long.

276
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,583
I'm glad to meet you.

277
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,541
Got enough ketchup?

278
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,291
Ya tryin' to drown out
the actual flavor?

279
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,083
[ASHIYA]
My hand slipped.

280
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,958
Can I ask you something weird?

281
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,166
Huh?

282
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,791
Back when Dad was around,

283
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,833
did you notice anything
strange about him?

284
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,416
What are you getting at?

285
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,458
[ASHIYA] Did he ever
say he could see yokai?

286
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,500
Or if not that, do you
remember him acting oddly?

287
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,833
Like, when Mom would get anemic,

288
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,666
do you remember what
he would do in response?

289
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,000
Did you ever see him try to wave
it away with his hand, or--

290
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,000
Hanae.

291
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:31,083
I'm not interested in discussing
a man who abandoned his family.

292
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,125
Don't make me remember.

293
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,041
[ASHIYA]
Okay.

294
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,291
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
Sorry about before.

295
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,958
It's fair to want to know
what kind of dad he was.

296
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,416
And aside from mom,
I'm the only person you can ask.

297
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,791
First off,

298
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,875
of course I don't remember
him saying he could see yokai.

299
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,000
Why is that on your mind?

300
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't tell me you started
believing in the supernatural.

301
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,916
What, did you watch one
of those ghost-hunter shows

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,041
over the summer?

303
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,333
You've always
been a scaredy-cat,

304
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,041
so I bet that stuff
really gets to you.

305
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,375
Yup, you caught me.

306
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,666
[ARANAKI]
Tell her, I'm right here!

307
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,250
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
But...

308
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,666
Huh?

309
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, what you said about
Mom's anemia reminded me.

310
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,083
She'd get sick pretty
often back in the day,

311
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,333
but then he
would go near her,

312
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,916
and she'd feel perfectly
fine all of a sudden.

313
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,958
On days like that, I'd catch him
throwing glances at no one.

314
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,166
or hiding in some corner,
nodding and talking to himself.

315
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,583
It was pretty strange.

316
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,000
Guess that's why those
memories stayed with me so long.

317
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,833
Anyway, that's about all
I can think of right now.

318
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,291
I'm glad you told me.

319
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,416
Thanks, sis.

320
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,625
Sure.

321
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,291
[ASHIYA'S SISTER] Let's go and
visit Mom together tomorrow.

322
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,875
She might pass
out again from surprise.

323
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,666
Huh?

324
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,833
Any guess what that was?

325
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,500
[ARANAKI]
Greetings, my fluffy friend!

326
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,750
You must be here to
take me to the Mononokean.

327
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,625
Ashiya!

328
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,666
You have my eternal thanks!

329
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,791
I feel that I'm ready
to be exorcised at last.

330
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:46,833
What's so funny,

331
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,291
and why're you
nodding to yourself?

332
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,500
It's nothing.

333
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,375
I think I'm gonna go
and take a little walk.

334
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,041
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
What?

335
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,125
This late at night?

336
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,125
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

337
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,458
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
Uh... I...

338
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,291
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
If you walk out on us

339
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,291
like your worthless father did,

340
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,500
I won't forgive you.

341
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,666
Abeno, I just found
out something huge!

342
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,833
That's odd.

343
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,750
Where is he?

344
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:20,791
Hey, Mononokean.

345
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,166
Where's Abeno?

346
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,333
[ABENO] Mononokean Master
Haruitsuki Abeno,

347
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,750
hearby requesting a
portal to the Underworld.

348
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,916
Thank you both
for all your help.

349
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,791
But you in particular Ashiya.

350
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,250
I shall never forget the
wonderful meal you provided me!

351
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,291
No prob.

352
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,333
It was just a
bite of omelet rice.

353
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:59,083
I wish only the best
for you and your family.

354
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000
Thanks!

355
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,583
[ASHIYA]
My family, huh.

356
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,750
So...

357
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,333
What is it you wanted
to tell me about?

358
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,666
[ASHIYA]
Uh.

359
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,458
It's not your mother, is it?

360
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,875
Don't tell me she got possessed
by a different yokai.

361
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,250
No, N'I don't think it's
too big of a deal for you,

362
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,125
or at least, it shouldn't
mean any extra work for you.

363
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,875
It's actually my dad.

364
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,041
I think he was
able to see yokai.

365
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,083
Huh?

366
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,041
He's not around, by the way.

367
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,333
He disappeared
a really long time ago.

368
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,250
So there's no way
to confirm this with him,

369
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,166
and it's possible that I'm just
reading too far into things.

370
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,708
But after hearing about his
behavior, I feel pretty sure.

371
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,500
Behavior?

372
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,958
Giving weird looks to no one,

373
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,458
nodding and talking to himself.

374
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,500
Pretty much everything
I'm scared I'll get seen doing.

375
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,250
And if he could see yokai,

376
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,125
then I wonder if he
knew of the Mononokean.

377
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,708
On that note, I don't
suppose you've ever heard

378
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,083
the name
"Sakae Ashiya," before?

379
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,333
Uh-huh.

380
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,041
Huh?

381
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,333
You've heard that name?

382
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,166
When was it? Where were you?
How'd it come up?

383
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,750
A while back,

384
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,250
but I didn't think it mattered
till I heard your mom say it.

385
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,791
Where is my dad?

386
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,041
Are you certain
you wanna hear this?

387
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,583
It ends bad.

388
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,750
Tell me what you know.

389
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,041
[ABENO]
I heard the previous master

390
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,666
of the Mononokean
speak that name.

391
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,125
Only once.

392
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,375
When I was a kid.

393
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,333
You're talking about Aoi?

394
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,583
Yeah, and from what Aoi told me,

395
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:40,000
Sakae Ashiya died
a long time ago.

396
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,500
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

397
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,708
[ABENO] I wouldn't know the
exact date or even the year.

398
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,208
But unless I'm
somehow misremembering,

399
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,708
he died close to
a hundred years ago.

400
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,125
[ASHIYA]
A hundred years?

401
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,708
Hold on.

402
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,750
Did my parents meet beyond the
boundaries of time and space?

403
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,041
Is my dad like the boy
who leapt through time?

404
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,083
No, but you can see why
I didn't connect this before.

405
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,625
Could it've been someone
else with the same name?

406
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,833
[ABENO]
It's not that.

407
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,083
I know what I heard,

408
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,708
but it's likely that the
number of years was off.

409
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,500
You may have noticed
that most yokai have

410
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,500
a pretty distorted
sense of time.

411
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,791
[ASHIYA]
Oh yeah.

412
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,333
When I first met Yahiko,

413
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,750
he said you two played
together 30 years ago, right?

414
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,958
But it had only
been eight years.

415
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,500
Besides, the power
to see yokai is rare.

416
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,750
Few humans can do it.

417
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,375
Even if we can't be sure,

418
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,958
let's assume it's your dad.

419
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,125
So he died, but how?

420
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,500
Did he get sick
or something like that?

421
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,875
[ABENO]
I don't know.

422
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,375
But if he was ever a
client of the Mononokean,

423
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,416
then we should be able
to find him in the records.

424
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,916
[ASHIYA]
He died.

425
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,666
He first disappeared
over 15 years ago.

426
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,458
Not long before
I was due to be born.

427
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,416
At first, people guessed
he was in a freak accident.

428
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,833
When no body was found,

429
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,458
they thought he must've
gotten involved with criminals

430
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,291
or been murdered or both.

431
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:02,291
But then, three years
later on Christmas.

432
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,541
Ahh!

433
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,166
Daddy, you came home!

434
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,958
[ASHIYA]
He showed up out of nowhere.

435
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,250
He stayed with us
for that one day.

436
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,750
And then, he left us for good.

437
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,458
That Christmas
was the first and last time

438
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,416
I ever saw my father's face.

439
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,000
So if he's already
dead like you were told,

440
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,666
well, I can't say
when it happened.

441
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,958
But maybe it was
sometime not long after that,

442
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,125
and that's why he never
came to visit us again.

443
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:29,958
[ABENO]
Well?

444
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:30,875
Huh?

445
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,250
[ABENO]
What now?

446
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,333
Do you want me
to look into it for you?

447
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,666
I...

448
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,291
I'm not interested
in discussing a man

449
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,666
who abandoned his family.

450
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,500
Where'd he run off to?

451
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,458
Maybe I should
try n'give him a call.

452
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,375
[ASHIYA]
I love my family,

453
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,750
but it's made of three people.

454
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,541
[ABENO]
I understand.

455
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,750
[ABENO]
The cultural festival.

456
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,125
Huh? Cosplay?

457
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,416
No. No way.

458
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,125
Hey, Yahiko.

459
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,625
Don't play at my school.

460
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,166
Tch! Or just do whatever.

461
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,333
Next time, "The Messenger."

462
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,958
Trick-or-treat.
