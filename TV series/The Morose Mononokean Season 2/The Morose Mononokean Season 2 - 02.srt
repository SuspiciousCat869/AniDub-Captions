This must be a yokai,

which means I should
be able to speak with it.

work for the Legislator?

something around here,

It's gold, shiny and
catches your eye,

it without much trouble, but...

Heh. This reminds me

of when we were looking
for Manjiro's ring.

How'd you do that?

back to the path we were on

something from the Legislator.

From the Legislator, you say?

I'm not gonna eat you.

At the moment, I'm not
allowed to eat meat at all,

so for now consider
me an herbivore.

I'm not really
sure how it happened,

130
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,750
but it looks like this scroll
was mixed up with a few of his,

131
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,166
so he sent me.

Is it too much trouble to
ask you to pass this along

133
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,291
to the Executive?

134

Not at all, I appreciate
you coming all this way.

135

No problem, just doing my job.

Forgive me for saying so,

Would you like to rest
inside for a short while?

Thanks, but I'll be fine.

Huh? Are you sick or something?

Nah, I feel fine!

143
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,416
I can get back on my own.

Don't be so shy.

Really, I can
walk back no problem.

Well, I suppose if you're sure.

[ASHIYA]
Why is he drooling?

148
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,958
I should get something
to eat anyway.

149

Looks like we'll be
going our separate ways

quite a long time

00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,458
to walk back to
Newt Lake, will it not?

154
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,250
I could take you back myself,
if you're open to it.

Thank you.

156

But it isn't as much of
a trip as you'd think.

157

I'll just have the Mononokean
take me part of the way.

are going to see Itsuki?

start heading back.

00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,416
for beast yokai.

165
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
This guy was pretty nice!

166
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,708
Tadpole.

167
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,166
I'm counting on you
to lead the way back.

168
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,541
Oh, speaking of which,
can you connect us again?

169
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,166
I need to tell Abeno
to come pick me up

170
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,458
at the same place
he dropped me off.

171
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,666
He actually patted my head.

172
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,041
It's embarrassing.

173
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,416
[EXECUTIVE'S SERVANT]
In all of my time working

174
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,875
for the Executive, I've never
seen those employees

175
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,083
at the Legislator's residence.

176
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,208
However, you seemed
very close to them.

177
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,125
Were you acquainted before?

178
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,666
First time.

179
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,291
We just happened to bump into
each other on the way here.

180
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,916
[EXECUTIVE'S SERVANT]
Oh, is that right?

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,166
Maybe they're newly employed.

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,333
[CAT]
Oh.

183
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,416
Now that I think about it,
I didn't ask for his name.

184
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,250
[EXECUTIVE'S SERVANT] I wonder
if the Executive can tell you.

185
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,208
Perhaps you should ask him,

186
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,875
Mr. Justice.

187
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,125
[SHIZUKU]
I made you some tea!

188
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,791
How thoughtful.

189
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,958
It's all done.

190
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,750
And with such a smile on!

191
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,583
You finished writing all
of this incredibly quickly.

192
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,916
To be honest with you,

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,916
I didn't think we'd
actually complete it today.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,250
[ABENO sighs]

195
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,208
You must be tired
after all that work.

196
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,000
Want some tea?

197
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:01,625
No thanks.

198
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,875
I'll pass.

199
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,375
I'm borrowing this guy, though.

200
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,333
Huh?

201
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,333
That's not a problem, but...

202
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,250
[ABENO]
Mononokean, come.

203
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,958
Where are you going?

204
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,458
[ABENO] To where I
dropped Ashiya off earlier.

205
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,958
You're gonna leave already?

206
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,958
Don't you think it makes
more sense to just wait here

207
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,666
until he calls
asking for a ride back?

208
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,500
[SHIZUKU]
Well, there he goes.

209
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,250
I don't know why he's
always in such a hurry.

210
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,458
He could have at least had
some of the tea I made.

211
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,583
[clattering]

212
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,083
[LEGISLATOR]
Hmm?

213
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,916
Ughhh!

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,375
Welcome back, Ashiya.

215
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,666
What does it even matter?

216
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,583
I delivered the
scroll, didn't I?

217
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,833
[ABENO]
Huh?

218
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,875
Am I supposed to ignore
that you said you rode

219
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,250
"a beast like Gorou"?

220
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,041
What does that even mean?

221
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,375
And what's a Gorou?

222
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,875
It's the name of a dog
who lived near me.

223
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:16,875
[ABENO]
I knew you'd do something

224
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,375
to mess this whole thing up!

225
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,000
And I was right!

226
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,416
[ASHIYA grunts]

227
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,666
Well, who cares?

228
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,625
It'd be one thing if he
was a dangerous beast,

229
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,083
but he was very civil!

230
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,333
He even told us he that
he was an herbivore!

231
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,208
So he couldn't eat us
if he wanted to!

232
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,708
What if he said that to make
you put your guard down?

233
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,500
Well...

234
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,708
I hadn't thought of that,

235
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,583
but I still think you're
being too negative!

236
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,541
It all worked out!

237
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,666
[ABENO]
You're so dumb!

238
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,416
[ASHIYA]
What?

239
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
[ABENO]
You heard me!

240
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,958
[ASHIYA]
Why do you have to be such a--

241
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,833
"Everyone's at
fault in a fight."

242
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,208
[LEGISLATOR]
Good job, everyone.

243
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,250
Thanks to your help, I was
able to finish my work on time.

244
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,458
So... Here's your promised pay.

245
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,083
[ABENO] Man, I can't believe you
can't even run a simple errand.

246
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,750
"Can't run a simple
errand" my butt.

247
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,291
I did exactly what
was asked of me.

248
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,166
It doesn't matter
how I got it done.

249
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,250
I seem to remember the
Mononokean warning you

250
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,083
not to go anywhere
with unfamiliar yokai.

251
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,041
Yet you jumped on one's back
the first chance you got.

252
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,291
Like I said,

253
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,750
I tried to run.

254
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,166
At first, anyway.

255
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,041
I didn't just tackle the
poor guy and yell, "giddy-up"!

256
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,208
Ugh!

257
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,791
[LEGISLATOR] Neither one
of them is listening to me.

258
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,250
[ASHIYA] Well maybe you
should have come with me,

259
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,583
like I asked you to.

260
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,875
I'm sure with your supervision,

261
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,416
none of this would
have happened.

262
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,750
What'd you say?

263
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,541
I don't care for
your tone, buddy.

264
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,375
[LEGISLATOR] Usually
"everyone's at fault in a fight"

265
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,583
works like a charm.

266
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,708
[LEGISLATOR] As the one
who sent Ashiya on his trek.

267
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,250
I can't let you two
go home still fighting.

268
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,291
Now then,

269
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,625
shall we have a drink?

270
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,125
--[ABENO] Huh?
--[ASHIYA] A drink?

271
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,833
[SHIZUKU]
Can we come in now?

272
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,500
[LEGISLATOR]
You may.

273
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,875
Mr. Legislator, the preparations
for the party are complete.

274
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,583
I know you wanted saké,
but we got more than just that.

275
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,708
They're either
really fast or psychic.

276
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,833
Or he's screwing with us

277
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,833
and planned to have
a drink anyway.

278
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,666
You caught me.

279
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,541
If it's not too much trouble,

280
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,500
I have a request
I'd like to ask of you.

281
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,666
What is it?

282
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,875
And there's no need
to be so formal.

283
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,416
Well, since we have the whole
Mononokean crew here already.

284
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,666
I was hoping to invite Koura
to our get-together, too.

285
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,375
That okay with you?

286
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,041
Koura from the Kiyakudo?

287
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,541
I wouldn't mind seeing her.

288
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,750
I've been planning to thank her

289
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,875
for taking care of
Fuzzy that one time.

290
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,750
She's usually pretty busy,
so we'll have to see.

291
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,833
Itsuki.

292
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,458
Yeah?

293
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,750
Use the Mononokean to bring
Koura here right away.

294
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,083
This is a rule.

295
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,291
[ASHIYA]
He only looks like a boss

296
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,833
when he's abusing his authority.

297
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,416
On it.

298
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,791
[ASHIYA] Abeno doesn't look like
much of a subordinate, though.

299
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,291
Aww, thanks bro,
you're the best!

300
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,375
Oh, Itsuki!

301
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,458
Why don't I go
with you to pick her up?

302
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,000
[ASHIYA, KOURA, LEGISLATOR]
Cheers!

303
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,791
[ABENO]
Why are we doing this here?

304
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,875
Because...

305
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,208
...if we don't,

306
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,875
the Mononokean can't
join in on the festivities.

307
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,250
Right?

308
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,500
There may not be much space,

309
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,625
but it feels like we're
a happy family this way.

310
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,708
[ABENO]
Hmm...

311
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,958
[ASHIYA]
He is so obviously not happy.

312
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,875
I agree, it's totally
cozier this way!

313
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,333
Your ears are exquisite
as usual, Ashiya.

314
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,750
My dear.

315
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,250
They would make such great
ingredients for medicine.

316
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,875
How can you let
them go to waste?

317
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,416
Is that a compliment?

318
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,125
I, uh...

319
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,375
Mine would be even better.

320
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,916
His are probably
all old and crusty.

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,750
Why even bother?

322
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,625
Would you like me
to pour you some?

323
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,875
It's not saké.

324
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,541
No way.

325
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,791
Uh... Forget about him!

326
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,958
I'll gladly have some myself!

327
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,125
It's gyomaroppe.

328
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,416
A kind of juice.

329
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,583
"Gyoma"? Hmm..

330
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,791
[ASHIYA] I'm not sure I want
to drink this, but if I don't,

331
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,541
I'll put a damper on this
party that they went through

332
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,041
all the trouble of preparing!

333
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,500
[ASHIYA] Seriously, what am
I drinking right now?

334
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,208
Would you like to try
some of this, as well?

335
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,666
Absolutely.

336
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,291
[ASHIYA] And what
am I eating right now?

337
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,375
[ASHIYA]
Abeno's having everything,

338
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,125
so it's gotta be fine.

339
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,333
It all tastes good, too,
so what have I got to lose?

340
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,041
Be honest, did ya have the saké?

341
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,291
[ASHIYA moans]

342
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,416
I... I thought everything
was non-alcoholic.

343
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,083
My stomach's on fire.

344
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,291
Abeno, please.

345
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,583
Water. Water.

346
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,666
I'll grab some
water and medicine.

347
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,166
Hang on a sec,
I'll be right back!

348
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,625
Now that I think about it.

349
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,125
We've never given you food
from the Underworld before.

350
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,958
He could be having
a bad reaction to it all.

351
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:39,166
Water would be great,
or tea if there is any.

352
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,291
But actually, café au lait
would be perfect.

353
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,958
[ABENO]
Hmm...

354
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,500
Hey, Mononokean.

355
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,958
Open a link to
the Mundane World.

356
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,416
[LEGISLATOR] I could always
have someone make us tea.

357
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,708
If he's thirsty,

358
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,875
water from the Mundane World
is probably best.

359
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:57,958
We don't want to
give him something

360
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,541
that'll make him sicker.

361
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,166
If you're heading to the Mundane
World, get some ice cream too.

362
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,375
My tummy is burning.

363
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,125
So hot. So hot.

364
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,708
So cold.

365
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,791
You sure changed
clothes quickly.

366
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,458
Mononokean,
I'll be right back,

367
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,125
so please keep the nijiriguchi
in the same place.

368
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,000
[KOURA]
Have a safe trip!

369
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,666
Is he unconscious?

370
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,416
[laughs]

371
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,083
Did I miss something funny?

372
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,291
Or are you just a giggly drunk?

373
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,125
No. Heh.

374
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,250
It's just that Itsuki's finally
showing some human kindness.

375
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,750
Right, Mononokean?

376
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,250
Really? Is that how it
looked to the two of you?

377
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,583
I hadn't noticed.

378
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,208
He seemed the same
as always, to me.

379
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,583
Well, he always treats us
yokai with respect.

380
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,125
Doesn't he?

381
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,958
But he has a tendency to be
strangely cruel towards humans,

382
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,166
almost as if to keep
them at a distance.

383
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,000
One time, I asked him
a rather tough question.

384
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,500
[KOURA]
Hmm?

385
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,000
[LLEGISLATOR]
If both were in danger

386
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,041
and you could only rescue one...

387
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,541
[LEGISLATOR]
Would you save the yokai,

388
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,458
or would you save the human?

389
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,000
The yokai.

390
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,041
No deliberation?

391
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,916
And why would you choose that?

392
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,041
The yokai over the human?

393
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,750
[ABENO]
Because for the human.

394
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,416
There's always someone else.

395
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,875
Someone who would
help them, even if I didn't.

396
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,916
[KOURA] That makes me worry
he would abandon Ashiya

397
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,750
if he were in danger.

398
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,708
I wonder how he'd answer now.

399
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,750
Just from what I saw today,
he was very worried about Ashiya

400
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,666
when we lost contact with him.

401
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,541
That's got to be the first time
I've ever seen him so invested

402
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,000
in the wellbeing of a human

403
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,875
And that makes you happy?

404
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,041
[LEGISLATOR chuckles]

405
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,375
I don't know that it
makes me happy,

406
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,083
so much as curious.

407
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,583
Heh. Perhaps I'll ask
him about it again soon.

408
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,375
Just be careful.

409
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,000
If you put him in
a tough position

410
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,375
by asking him that again,

411
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:20,583
he'll probably keep his
distance from you even more.

412
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,875
Even more?

413
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,875
Even more.

414
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,541
Maybe I won't do it, then.

415
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,958
Do you plan to do
something about him?

416
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,291
[LEGISLATOR]
What do you mean?

417
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,166
I'm not trying to say it
wouldn't be a good change

418
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,625
for Itsuki if he cared more
for humans from time to time.

419
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,166
But considering he's the
master of the Mononokean,

420
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,083
that may not be the
most desirable outcome.

421
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,041
Maybe not.

422
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,833
However,

423
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,500
I'd say the
opposite bet is safer.

424
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,875
Right, Mononokean?

425
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,875
[LEGISLATOR] I wonder
which bet is the safer one

426
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,166
in your opinion,

427
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,666
Aoi?

428
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,541
[EXECUTIVE] Who brought
this scroll to my domain?

429
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,875
[EXECUTIVE'S SERVANT]
Well, I believe it was

430
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,791
an employee
of the Legislator's, sir.

431
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,916
However, I've never
seen him before.

432
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,291
[EXECUTIVE]
Interesting,

433
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,208
I've heard nothing about him
employing someone new.

434
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,291
What was he like?

435
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,666
Other than looking very pale,

436
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,708
there was nothing
that stuck out.

437
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,250
Oh, actually, I remember
him mentioning something

438
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,583
about the Mononokean.

439
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,125
[EXECUTIVE]
The Mononokean?

440
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,916
I see.

441
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,750
[ASHIYA] I don't spend
all my time with yokai.

442
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,500
I'm a part-time normal guy, too.

443
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,166
I've got a regular
school life and--

444
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,166
Oh! Of course there's
one at school now!

445
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,791
Next time, "Greetings."

446
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,250
I'll tell you everything
you need to know

447
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,708
about having an average
school experience!
