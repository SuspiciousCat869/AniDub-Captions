1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,791
[ABENO]
Classified?

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,750
[LEGISLATOR] Whether the
Justice would grant me access

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:15,375
is a semi-open question, but the
simple act of asking about it

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,541
might be perceived
as suspicious.

5
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:21,208
Both by him,
and by the Executive.

6
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,875
I see.

7
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:23,583
[LEGISLATOR]
Now.

8
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,375
That being said,

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,333
White Sand Prison's outer
premises are heavily guarded,

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,166
but the interior, far less so.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,583
If you can sneak your way
inside, the rest should be easy.

12
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,916
Though, I daresay that's
a very significant "if."

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,791
Uh...

14
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,083
[chuckles]

15
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,000
[ABENO] Much like
with the Executive's place.

16
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,250
I can't use the Mononokean

17
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,291
to get inside the
Justice's territory.

18
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,125
Not that I would
seriously consider

19
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,125
sneaking in there anyway.

20
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,416
[KOURA]
Hi, Itsuki.

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,041
Huh? Koura.

22
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,000
I was just about
to stop by the Kiyakudo

23
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,458
to pick up some medicine.

24
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,750
Oh really?

25
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,208
You're a bit earlier than usual.

26
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,333
[ABENO] A different errand
brought me to the neighborhood.

27
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,291
[KOURA]
I see.

28
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,833
Well, I'd love to help you.

29
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,291
But unfortunately,
I need to deliver this package

30
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,625
to White Sand Prison right now.

31
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,833
To White Sand Prison?

32
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,291
It shouldn't take much time.

33
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,791
Why don't you tag along with me?

34
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,250
[ABENO] I don't really get why
you asked me to come with you.

35
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't pick up that medicine
without me at the shop,

36
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,875
and I thought this would be
less boring than waiting there.

37
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,041
What are you delivering?

38
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,750
Is that medicine, too?

39
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,250
Did the Justice get sick?

40
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,125
The prison ran out of
the anesthetic they use

41
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,166
on those who are tortured there.

42
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,750
Thought I'd go ahead

43
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,250
and make the Justice a more
potent version this time around.

44
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,500
Huh. Well, that's nice.

45
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,291
[JUSTICE SERVANT]
Greetings Koura.

46
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,583
We appreciate you coming all
this way to make a delivery.

47
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,333
Come on in.

48
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,458
I'll make a cup of tea.

49
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,625
Would you like to
come with us, Itsuki?

50
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:33,625
No thanks.

51
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,041
I'll wait for you.

52
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,166
Very well.

53
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,125
I'll be back before
you know it then.

54
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,875
[LEGISLATOR] The Justice
should have a record of it.

55
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,166
Secured within White
Sand Prison, of course.

56
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,458
[ABENO]
What the hell am I doing?

57
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,458
[ABENO] Now to just find
a report that references

58
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,541
the Mundane World somehow
and get out of here.

59
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,458
[JUSTICE SERVANT]
Here you go.

60
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,250
That's very gracious of you.

61
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,791
Thanks.

62
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,916
Here's the requested anesthetic,
you'll find it quite potent.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Excellent work.

64
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,833
The Justice is grateful.

65
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,916
[KOURA] Speaking of the Justice,
is he out at the moment?

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,875
My sincerest apologies, ma'am.

67
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,916
The Justice would have
come here in person.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,500
But he's attending
to another guest.

69
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,750
[EXECUTIVE] The archives are
quite close, if memory serves.

70
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,666
Oh, yeah.

71
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,250
[ABENO] A human
with golden eyes and hair,

72
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,541
who could use Influence...

73
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,833
...broke a taboo in
the Mundane World.

74
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,500
He was a dangerous sort

75
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,958
who broke many
underworld taboos.

76
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,833
[ABENO gasps]

77
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,125
[ABENO]
It's him.

78
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,250
Sakae Ashiya.

79
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,458
When we'd just met
and I asked him who he was,

80
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,583
the human told me he was
an employee of the Mononokean.

81
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,166
[ABENO]
This report confirms it.

82
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,750
Sakae Ashiya used to work
for the Mononokean.

83
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,583
This is bad.

84
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,416
I wonder where Abeno is.

85
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,708
Did he go to the
Underworld again?

86
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,458
Oh.

87
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,625
Zenko, what's up?

88
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,875
Hi, Hanae.

89
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:20,833
I wonder.

90
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,500
Are you free right now?

91
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,625
Uh. Yeah.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,333
A shrine?

93
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,833
Yes, it's a really old shrine,
and there've been rumors

94
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,375
that it's haunted
for several years now.

95
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,416
The head of the neighborhood
council asked my father

96
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,583
if he could do
something about it.

97
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,166
Just like the Bon Festival.

98
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,000
It's becoming a thing.

99
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,541
You have no idea.

100
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,041
Ever since then,

101
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,333
people seem to think that
my dad has spiritual powers.

102
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,083
Spiritual powers, huh?

103
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,458
That must be awkward

104
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,875
seeing how that stuff makes
him so uncomfortable.

105
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,333
[ASHIYA] Okay! I'll tell
Abeno about this tomorrow.

106
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,875
[YAHIKO]
So you came by yourself.

107
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,791
[ASHIYA]
Yahiko.

108
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,083
You headed home?

109
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,291
Actually, I was
looking for Haruitsuki.

110
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,416
I wanted to see
if he'd play with me.

111
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,708
Doubt you'll find him today,
he's been pretty busy lately.

112
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,791
Aw, that sucks.

113
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,416
He didn't seem
that busy the other day.

114
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
We played together for hours.

115
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,208
[ASHIYA laughs]
That so?

116
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,791
Yup! He did it to get me

117
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,666
to transform into that
Sakae Ashiya guy for him!

118
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,166
[gasps]

119
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,750
I don't get why
you came yourself.

120
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,208
Why not just send someone
to grab it for you?

121
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,416
That would've
been against the law.

122
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,041
You know full well
that it's prohibited

123
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,666
to remove any volumes from
the White Sand Prison Archives.

124
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,166
[ABENO]
The Executive!

125
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,291
It's not that strict of a rule.

126
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,541
You would've been fine,

127
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,000
as long as I gave you
permission to take one.

128
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,833
So... Uh?

129
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,291
[EXECUTIVE]
What's done is done.

130
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,750
Perhaps I'll ask next time,

131
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,958
but for now, please show
me the record in question.

132
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,208
I mean no offense,
but I am in a hurry.

133
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,875
I have business to attend
to at the Birdcage.

134
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,083
Sure.

135
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,250
Uh, yeah.

136
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,000
It's over there.

137
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,083
Uh. Damn.

138
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,375
I forgot I still
had this with me.

139
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:40,833
[SHIZUKU]
Here!

140
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,250
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

141
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,750
Thanks, it was no inconvenience.

142
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,875
It's always good to see you,

143
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,791
but I wish
you'd brought Ashiya.

144
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,750
I'll try to next time.

145
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,125
Huh?

146
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,333
I must say, you seem
a bit twitchy today.

147
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,375
I don't know what to tell you.

148
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,625
[KOURA] I could use a test
subject for the new restorative

149
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,833
I'm working on,
so if you're feeling lucky.

150
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,791
It's free.

151
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,541
Thank you, but I'll pass.

152
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,875
Come on Yahiko,

153
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,208
just transform into
Sakae one more time, for me?

154
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,625
Not happening.

155
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,750
But why not?

156
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,916
You had no problem
doing it for Abeno.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,625
You have my word,
I'll play with you until I drop.

158
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,666
Hide and seek maybe?

159
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,166
I'd also be down for tag!

160
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,916
I don't wanna play with you
unless Haruitsuki's with us.

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,791
Uh! What if I give
ya some treats then?

162
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,875
Treats? You mean it?

163
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,500
Yeah! Whatever you want!

164
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,750
You name it and I'll buy it.

165
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:30,791
How's that sound?

166
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,208
[YAHIKO]
Mm.

167
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,541
You bring me somethin' sweet,
and I'll think about it.

168
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,583
[ASHIYA] Finding out that Yahiko
met my father was a surprise.

169
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,333
I still don't get why Abeno
would want to know

170
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,708
what he looked like.

171
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,500
He didn't seem
that interested before.

172
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:55,333
[cell phone ringing]

173
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,791
Hey, what's up?

174
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:57,708
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
Not much.

175
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,958
How've you been, Hanae?

176
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:00,875
I'm all right.

177
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,208
Need something?

178
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,500
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
Yeah, I was calling to ask you

179
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,125
how Mom's been holding up.

180
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,916
[ASHIYA]
She's been wired lately.

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,458
Like she was never sick
in the first place.

182
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,958
I told her she should rest more,

183
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,750
but she re-opened
the shop the day

184
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,125
after she was discharged
from the hospital.

185
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,000
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
Okay, cool.

186
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,708
That's good to hear.

187
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,333
Why'd you call me to
ask instead of her?

188
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,916
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
I'm gonna do that now.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,333
I guess I just wanted
to get your perspective first.

190
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,666
Huh. Yeah? 'N why do that?

191
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,625
[ASHIYA'S SISTER] You know
how I went to pick her up

192
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,375
when they said
she could go home?

193
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,750
She seemed weird.

194
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,833
Once again, I really
can't thank you enough.

195
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,041
Hey, let's go!

196
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,375
You're rackin' up
the meter, mom.

197
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,375
They were all
so kind and helpful.

198
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,250
I couldn't leave
without giving my thanks.

199
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,083
That's nice, but they
don't wanna get thanked

200
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:54,958
for ten minutes by a patient
who only stayed for two days.

201
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,833
This was kind of
a nice change of pace.

202
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,958
I feel like I could
use more of it.

203
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,083
Think you could
change your pace

204
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,375
without collapsing next time?

205
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,625
Finding out you were in the
hospital really scared me.

206
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh yeah, that reminds me.

207
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,833
I met Hanae's friend yesterday.

208
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,166
It was funny.

209
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,916
He looked like--

210
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,583
Wait, so who are
you talking about?

211
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,000
Nevermind. Just forget it.

212
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,000
Ugh...

213
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,083
Jeez, Mom.

214
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,375
Hope it's fun for you.

215
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,958
Making your poor children worry.

216
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,083
I really do need to thank Sakae.

217
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,750
Did you say what I think?

218
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,000
Because he didn't
leave me alone.

219
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:48,375
He left me with two sweet
children to keep me company.

220
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,375
[ASHIYA'S SISTER] I'm pretty
sure that's the first time

221
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,750
I've heard Mom talk about him.

222
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,666
[ASHIYA'S SISTER] So, yeah,
it's been bugging me since

223
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,458
I got back.

224
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,041
Don't worry about it.

225
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,166
She's the same as ever,
I promise.

226
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,333
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
Okay, good.

227
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,083
I'll go ahead and
give her a call next.

228
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,333
Oh! Well, as long
as you're at it.

229
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,000
would you mind letting her know
that I'm on my way home now?

230
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,541
[ASHIYA'S SISTER]
Can do.

231
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:28,708
[ASHIYA]
Here ya go!

232
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,500
Wanna transform yet?

233
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,750
[YAHIKO]
Nope!

234
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,625
Why? Come on, Yahiko,
please, I'm begging you!

235
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,333
[YAHIKO] Hmm...
Ask me again tomorrow.

236
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,666
That's what you said yesterday,

237
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,833
the day before yesterday,
and the day before that.

238
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,041
You're never gonna
transform for me, are you?

239
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,291
You made me bring you cream
puffs, pudding, and dongo!

240
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,875
Not to mention the dorayaki!

241
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,708
You're running me dry over here!

242
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,125
Yeah, I think I want melon next.

243
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,708
[ASHIYA growls]

244
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,833
All right, fine, I'll back
off for the time being,

245
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,333
but if I do bring some
melon next time,

246
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,500
you had better transform,
you hear me?

247
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,666
[gasps] He-Hey Abeno!

248
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,250
Why do you look
so surprised to see me?

249
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,458
I'm right on time.

250
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,791
[ASHIYA]
Uh, right.

251
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,208
Well I came early,
so I was just talkin' to Yahiko.

252
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,500
Sorry for taking up your time.

253
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,166
No. It's not a problem.

254
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,791
Ashiya explained most of it.

255
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,375
Are you gonna play
with me, or what?

256
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,291
I'm working today, lay off.

257
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,750
Aw.

258
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,083
I see that you aren't done
cleaning up the garden yet.

259
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,625
No more treats until you finish.

260
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,958
Okay, I'll do that right now!

261
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,500
I'll see ya, Haruitsuki!

262
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,625
You come back anytime, Ashiya!

263
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,500
Yeah, for sure.

264
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,833
I guess I'll catch you later.

265
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,416
And don't forget
what I told you.

266
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,708
[YAHIKO] I wonder what I should
make that sucker bring me next.

267
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,291
[ASHIYA] He's gonna milk
this until the end of time.

268
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,833
[ABENO]
Wait a minute.

269
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,333
When did the two of them
get so chummy?

270
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,333
A growling sound, huh?

271
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,083
Ya sure it's not a stray dog?

272
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,500
Seems unlikely,
since several witnesses also saw

273
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,208
a pair of glowing red eyes.

274
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,875
We'll just have to go
and see it for ourselves.

275
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,791
Sounds good.

276
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,625
[ASHIYA]
Hmm...

277
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,666
What is it now?

278
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,750
Uh. Nothing, honest.

279
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,208
[ABENO]
Just say it.

280
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,541
Something's on your mind.

281
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,958
Spit it out.

282
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,625
We've been partners so
long you can read my mind now.

283
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,541
Every time you
look at me like that,

284
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,208
it's because you have
something you need to say.

285
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,625
Also, we're not partners,
and it hasn't been that long!

286
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,625
Uh, okay then.

287
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,416
Well, it's about my father.

288
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,208
Huh?

289
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,083
[LEGISLATOR]
So you snuck in after all.

290
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,958
I'm impressed.

291
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,333
I said you could
sneak a look at it,

292
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,083
but what possessed you
to steal the thing?

293
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,583
I didn't plan to.

294
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,041
Got surprised
and forgot I had it.

295
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:53,583
My apologies for the mistake.

296
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,208
We can figure something out.

297
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,791
The Justice isn't so organized

298
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,041
that he'll immediately know he
didn't just misplace it somehow.

299
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,500
So there's time.

300
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,416
Seems your flippant
nature works out for me today.

301
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,625
[LEGISLATOR]
Oh really?

302
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,833
Do you think I'm letting you
off the hook, just like that?

303
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,125
You've broken the law,

304
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,041
and I'm required to
dole out your punishment.

305
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,333
So what'll it be?

306
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,541
I'm considering.

307
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,875
Hmm...

308
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,333
I know, I was planning
to put on a banquet soon.

309
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,041
Why doesn't the
Mononokean host it?

310
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,625
You're kidding, right?

311
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:39,000
To think that a human would
use Influence to kill a yokai.

312
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,833
Hoho...

313
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,458
How very frightening.

314
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,125
Yeah. I asked Yahiko to
show me your dad's face.

315
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,125
I don't understand,
when I was telling you about

316
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,958
my dad a while ago, you didn't
seem all that interested.

317
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,500
So why would you care to know
what his face looked like?

318
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,958
Let's go.

319
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,791
[ASHIYA]
The heck's with him?

320
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,000
[ASHIYA] He asked if he
should look into it for me.

321
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,791
And I turned him down, but if
he's planning to do it anyway,

322
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,875
I think I have a right to know.

323
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,000
I definitely sense something.

324
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,833
It's in front of us!

325
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,041
Fuzzy!

326
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,458
Let's go!

327
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,583
Okay! Sic 'em, boy!

328
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,375
[ABENO]
Forgive us,

329
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,375
we were led to believe
you might be dangerous.

330
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,791
[BONTA] Mm.
Don't worry 'bout it.

331
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,333
I'm mostly just surprised
you can see me.

332
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,375
I'm Bonta, by the way.

333
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,250
We're with the Mononokean.

334
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,875
I'm Haruitsuki Abeno.

335
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,500
The current master.

336
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,708
And we're employees.

337
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,416
He's Fuzzy 'n I'm Ashiya.

338
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,166
[BONTA]
I've heard of the Mononokean.

339
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,750
You help exorcise yokai
to the Underworld, don't you?

340
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,541
[ASHIYA]
Yup! That's exactly what we do.

341
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,375
[BONTA]
Ooh!

342
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,083
That's great.

343
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,583
Ya know, I was just
thinkin' it might be nice

344
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,875
to go there myself
one of these days.

345
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,416
[ABENO]
In that case,

346
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,375
we can come back and exorcise
you the day after tomorrow.

347
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,083
Please meet us
in front of the torii.

348
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,250
[BONTA]
Got it! I'll be there!

349
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,166
We'll see you later then,
all right, Bonta?

350
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,625
[BONTA]
Yuh! See ya soon, Ashiya!

351
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,458
[ABENO]
Mononokean, come.

352
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,125
Aw, thanks a bunch.

353
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,875
[SASA]
Golden hair and eyes.

354
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,500
It's him.

355
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,541
[LEGISLATOR] The yokai's
whereabouts are still unknown.

356
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,875
And there's no way of knowing

357
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,916
whether it's alive,
dead, or sealed.

358
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,250
If it is alive, and someone
manages to find it,

359
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:38,083
then it's possible that
it could still be set free.

360
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,791
Hey, bro, just wanted
to let you know I'm back!

361
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,583
[LEGISLATOR]
Welcome home, Shizuku.

362
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,750
Looks like you've
still got your nose

363
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,250
to the grindstone.

364
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,458
Why don't you
hang tight for a bit,

365
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,125
and I'll make us
both a pot of tea?

366
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,208
Aww.

367
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,083
What are you doing, Zenko?

368
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,625
[ZENKO]
Cleaning the brush.

369
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,000
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Did you get a chance to talk

370
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,208
to those psychic boys?

371
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,916
Abeno and Ushiya?

372
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,208
It's "Ashiya," Dad.

373
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,708
You should know that.

374
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,166
They say it'll be gone
in the next couple days.

375
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,916
Tell 'em thanks for me.

376
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,291
[screams]

377
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,500
I'm glad to hear it isn't
giving them trouble.

378
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,000
It sounded like something
from a monster movie.

379
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,875
A giant spider ghost
is the last thing

380
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,500
I'd wanna deal with myself.

381
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,208
What? A spider?

382
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,958
Yeah, why do you
sound surprised?

383
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,000
The only description you gave
me was that it had red eyes.

384
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,208
What I was told is
that it was a giant spider

385
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,791
with one red eye.

386
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,333
Which is ridiculous, of course.

387
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,250
No one would believe that.

388
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,875
[ASHIYA] It was a cute little
yokai, looked like a piglet.

389
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,708
Oh, and its eyes
weren't red at all.

390
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,583
[YAHIKO moans]

391
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,416
[ZENKO]
That's weird.

392
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,000
Get him off my tail, Zenko!

393
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,958
Oh, sorry about that.

394
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,833
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Hm? Uh?

395
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,250
What was that about,
do you need somethin'?

396
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,791
No, that was just a love tap.

397
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:22,208
[BONTA snores]

398
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,458
[SASA]
At last,

399
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:58,416
I've waited so many years
for someone to save me.

400
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,166
Please.

401
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,041
[ASHIYA]
Hey!

402
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,958
You here, Bonta?

403
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,791
So what do you think happened?

404
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,541
I guess Bonta might've forgotten
where we were 'sposed to meet.

405
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,875
At any rate I can sense
Bonta's presence.

406
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,875
Maybe we should
split up and look around.

407
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,333
Sounds good to me.

408
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,250
Okay.

409
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,500
I'll start by looking out back.

410
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,958
[ABENO] He abused the
power known as Influence,

411
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,000
using it to break a taboo
in the Mundane World.

412
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:40,291
Sealing a yokai in
an unknown location.

413
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,750
[ABENO]
The other day.

414
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,791
I sensed another yokai,
if only for an instant.

415
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,958
[cell phone ringing]

416
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:54,875
[ABENO]
What's wrong?

417
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:55,916
I found Bonta!

418
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,583
Come back here
as fast as you can.

419
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,916
It's an emergenc--

420
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:36,208
[ASHIYA] Our latest client,
Bonta, is acting pretty weird.

421
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,833
And now, I'm not feeling right.

422
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,333
Abeno! Fuzzy!

423
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,208
Look out!

424
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,583
Next time, "The Intention."

425
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,083
You there. Who are you?
