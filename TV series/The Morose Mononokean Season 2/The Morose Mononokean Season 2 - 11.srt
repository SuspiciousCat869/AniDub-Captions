1
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:12,458
[KOMON] Ah. So you no
longer work with Aoi.

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,791
[ABENO]
Right.

3
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,333
I'm actually the current
master of the Mononokean.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,958
[KOMON]
That must be tough.

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:21,750
I heard the employee who worked
there before you left as well.

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,583
Wait a sec.

7
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,500
Did you know the last employee?

8
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, not personally, but Aoi
did mention him in passing.

9
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,416
All that comes to mind now
is that in his earlier days...

10
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,416
[KOMON]
...he was a dangerous sort

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,375
who broke many
Underworld taboos.

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,083
That said, he'd already left
the Mononokean's service

13
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,583
by the time I heard that.

14
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,333
I sure am glad
that it was Itsuki

15
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,958
who became the next master.

16
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,208
[BIRD YOKAI chirp]

17
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,500
Huh?

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,291
[KOMON]
Oh! I'll introduce you.

19
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,916
Meet Chunichi, Chunji,
Chinzo, Chunyon, and Chungo.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,625
I'm sure you boys'll
get along just fine.

21
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,583
How do I tell them apart?

22
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,041
[KOMON]
It took a good while,

23
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,541
but I feel like they've
finally grown up.

24
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,125
We didn't exorcise them earlier

25
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,458
because they were too young and
weak to adapt to the Underworld.

26
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,583
But looking at them now,

27
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,708
I think they would do
just fine there.

28
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:14,541
[KOMON]
Oh yeah?

29
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,041
So you'll exorcise them?

30
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,708
That would be quite
a load off my shoulders.

31
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,666
Did you hear that, little ones?

32
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,833
You can go to the Underworld.

33
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,416
[BIRD YOKAI chirping]

34
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,083
[chirp]

35
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,583
Should we get started now?

36
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,583
Sure, but I forgot to mention,

37
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,958
only four of the
five are ready to go.

38
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,250
One needs to stay a bit longer.

39
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,791
I don't think you
should exorcise Chungo,

40
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,625
he's still having some trouble.

41
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,416
What kind of trouble?

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,083
[ASHIYA]
His plumage is different;

43
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,708
it's like a crescent moon.

44
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,208
[CHUNGO chirping]

45
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,750
[KOMON] He's hasn't quite
gotten the hang of flying yet.

46
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,083
[ABENO, ASHIYA]
Hmm?

47
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,250
Well you can get into
the Underworld by walking,

48
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,500
so I don't think it
would be a problem.

49
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,458
That part would be all right,
but once they got in,

50
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,041
he would have
trouble keeping up.

51
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,083
If they wanted to
fly anywhere as a group,

52
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,625
they'd have to carry him.

53
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,916
[BIRD YOKAI chirp]

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,375
I think I get it.

55
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,166
I guess,
but doesn't it seem sad

56
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,416
for only one of them
to be left behind?

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,083
He doesn't look to be
any smaller than the rest,

58
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,250
so the problem must
be something else.

59
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,250
Could be a question
of technique.

60
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,833
Might be.

61
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,958
It's too bad he can't just tell
me what the issue is himself.

62
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,625
They talk to each other
and understand me,

63
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,791
but I never worked out

64
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,875
how to interpret those
chirps of theirs.

65
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,333
I trained them all daily.

66
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,916
Told them they couldn't
go to the Underworld

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,541
till they'd learned to fly.

68
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,041
And all the others
picked it up pretty quick.

69
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,333
Chungo just can't seem
to stay up in the air, though.

70
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,375
If you don't mind...

71
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,666
[KOMON]
Hmm?

72
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,250
[ABENO] Doubt I'll succeed
where you couldn't,

73
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,333
but could I watch them try to
fly together, Chungo included?

74
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,375
[KOMON]
Sure thing.

75
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,208
Why don't we head to the runway?

76
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,875
[ASHIYA]
The runway?

77
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,708
Abeno!

78
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,416
Can you hear me?

79
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,666
We're ready on our end;
how 'bout you?

80
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,458
I can hear you all right.

81
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,375
You're like an
emergency alert siren.

82
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,375
My ears might bleed.

83
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,041
[ASHIYA]
Did you answer?

84
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,083
Tell you what.

85
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,083
Just wave back
if you can hear me!

86
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,250
Tell 'em to go ahead
and get started!

87
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,000
We're good to go up here!

88
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,458
This is how I first taught them.

89
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,083
By having them fly up
from way down there.

90
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,625
The wind's a bit
gentler over here

91
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,333
than it is on top of the cliff.

92
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,708
The wind?

93
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,083
[KOMON]
Oh yes.

94
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,375
The wind can be somewhat
perilous, even where we are.

95
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,625
[ASHIYA whimpers]

96
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,208
[screams]

97
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,125
I think the bridge is
about to break!

98
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,000
Just hang on!

99
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,208
We're gonna get through this.

100
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,833
No, we're not. We're gonna die!

101
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,500
Looks like it's getting
gusty up around the bridge,

102
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,791
so be careful.

103
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,083
Mind that you don't
get blown away, all right?

104
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:29,083

You too, Chungo.

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,833
You're kidding.

109
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,041
Before you try to fly again.

110
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,916
I think we should practice
flapping those wings more.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,208
[sighs]

112
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,333
[ASHIYA]
Abeno looks ridiculous.

113
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,125
[KOMON]
He still can't fly.

114
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,333
It doesn't come naturally
to the poor thing.

115
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,583
[ASHIYA]
We might have to exorcise

116
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,791
the siblings
separately after all,

117
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,583
like Komon asked us
to in the first place.

118
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,000
But I would hate to see
Chungo get left behind.

119
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,291
Maybe Abeno will have
a breakthrough with him.

Hey! There's a

Hold on tight!

No! They'll fall!

Oh yeah, I forgot.

125
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,375
There's nothing to worry about.

126
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,875
All of you can fly just fine.

[BIRD YOKAI chirp]

128
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,750
[KOMON] It's a good thing
Chungo wasn't up here with us.

Hey, Abeno!

133
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,708
I could use a little help here!

A crescent moon...?

137
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,000
Huh?

138
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,333
Wait.

139
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,166
Is that Chungo?

140
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,250
You can fly now?

141
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,916
[ABENO]
Until Komon needed him,

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,583
he wasn't even
able to flap properly.

143
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,750
They were told they
can't go to the Underworld

144
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,708
till they learn to fly.

145
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,416
I see now.

146
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,791
That would explain things.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,833
Just try to make sure you don't
take care of them too well.

148
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,208
[ASHIYA]
What's up?

149
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,916
[KOMON] Hey! Stop
fighting up there, will you?

150
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,458
What do you suppose
they're arguing about?

151
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,708
Couldn't tell you.

152
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,916
I've never seen them get
so worked up before.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
You have any ideas?

154
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,916
Well I could be wrong,
but still,

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,333
it seems to me they're
upset with Chungo

156
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,041
for deceiving them.

157
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,208
He's been hiding the fact
that he could fly all along.

158
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,541
[ASHIYA]
What?

159
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,583
[gasps]

160
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,208
Chungo, is that true?

161
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,750
[chirping]

162
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,000
But flying will only
make life easier for you,

163
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,625
so why would you pretend
that you couldn't do it?

164
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,458
Again, this is just a guess.

165
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,000
But he may have thought that,
as long as he couldn't fly,

166
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,083
you'd let him stay with you.

167
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:46,291
Just try to make sure you don't
take care of them too well.

168
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,125
[KOMON] I didn't know
what it meant at the time,

169
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,416
but Aoi did warn me not
to care for them too well.

170
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,791
Now, after all these years.

171
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:59,458
I think I finally understand
what Aoi was getting at.

172
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,375
I wanted them to be happy,
and it seems I succeeded,

173
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,166
but I also made them too
comfortable here in this world.

174
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,208
They're too comfortable here?

175
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,083
[ASHIYA]
So Komon took good care of them,

176
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,416
only for it to
end up backfiring.

177
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,666
[BIRD YOKAI chirping

178
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,791
[KOMON]
Hmm...

179
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,833
Well! That settles it!

180
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm gonna tear down the nest
and move somewhere else.

181
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,958
What good is that gonna do?

182
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,916
[KOMON] If their home
here stops existing,

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,125
they'll have no
choice but to move on.

184
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,458
The Underworld will be
the only place left for them.

185
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,000
There's no time
like the present.

186
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,750
I'd like to get everything
cleaned up as soon as possible.

187
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,916
Why don't you
boys give me a hand?

188
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,375
[ASHIYA shudders]

189
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,833
[ABENO]
Don't be such an infant.

190
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,541
An infant would
be crawling right now!

191
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,291
Which actually
sounds much safer.

192
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,541
Ha!

193
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,208
You can't just
fling your stuff off the cliff!

194
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,666
Why not?

195
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,125
It's the way I always got
rid of my old things before.

196
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,875
To think that you
even have rules

197
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,666
for how to throw things away.

198
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,500
Being human seems
awfully inconvenient.

199
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,500
[ASHIYA]
Their stares feel so accusing.

200
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm destroying the
home they grew up in.

201
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,250
I don't wanna break it down,
but I have no choice.

202
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,916
Huh? Hold up, what's this?

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,250
I thought we lost
that a long time ago!

204
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,083
Boy does it take me back.

205
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,125
Yeah? Did you guys use
this for something?

206
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,833
[KOMON] I never used it myself.
It was for them.

207
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,375
Back when I was
building the nest,

208
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,916
I'd put them in there so the
wind wouldn't blow them away.

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
[BIRD YOKAI chirping]

210
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,541
Look at that.

211
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,291
Guess the youngins
remember it as fondly as me,

212
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,333
[ASHIYA] They seem
to like it an awful lot.

213
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,791
Maybe we should
let them keep it.

214
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,416
Nope, toss it!

215
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,208
[KOMON]
We don't need it.

216
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,166
Not anymore.

217
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,041
Uh?

218
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,291
[ABENO]
Hmm...

219
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,166
I can always sneak
it to them later.

220
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,250
Hey, Ashiya.

221
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,208
D'ya mind checking the time?

222
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,375
[ASHIYA]
Let's see.

223
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,000
It's just after 4:30.

224
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,000
[ABENO] Sun'll be
setting before too long.

225
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,541
We need to head back soon.

226
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,958
It'll be dangerous if we wait

227
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,458
till we can't see
where we're walking.

228
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,458
Komon.

229
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,708
We'd be glad
to keep helping you,

230
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,208
but we need to finish
our work before dark.

231
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,666
It's time we exorcised
the little ones.

232
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,666
That is, unless one of
them would rather stay.

[CHUNGO chirps]

[CHUNGO chirps]

235
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,916
Huh. I'm not sure
what he's saying exactly,

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,916
but it seems like he's willing
to go to the Underworld

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,291
with his siblings now.

238
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,666
Agreed.

239
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,916
That one's a real trouble-maker.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,500
Okay, Mononokean.

241
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,291
Go ahead.

242
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,125
Mononokean master,
Haruitsuki Abeno,

243
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,458
requesting a
portal to the Under--

244
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,458
[ASHIYA pants]

245
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,000
[ASHIYA]
Abeno!

246
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,583
This is what happens when you
forget cliffs are dangerous!

247
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,958
Anyway, try n' climb back up,
I won't let you fall.

248
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,458
[ABENO]
Ugh... Now, I've done it.

249
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,041
Now, you've done what?

250
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,541
[ABENO] I tried to open
a portal and failed.

251
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,583
It drains me just the same.

252
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,541
The next one'll be rough.

253
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,291
[ASHIYA]
Oh, gotcha.

254
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,791
Well, in that case,

255
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,791
we'd better move to a different
spot in case you collapse.

256
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,000
[KOMON] This place
never changes, does it?

257
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,583
Every time I've seen it,
it looks the same!

258
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,000
[ASHIYA sighs]

259
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,250
Compared to that narrow cliff,
this room seems huge.

260
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,333
[ABENO] Feel free to
join us as well, Komon.

261
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,958
Thanks, but no.

262
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,000
[ASHIYA]
Hmm?

263
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,416
[KOMON]
I'm not coming.

264
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,166
[CHUNGO chirps]

265
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,416
[ASHIYA]
Why not?

266
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,458
I need to find myself
a good place to sleep,

267
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,833
and set up a camp
before the sun goes down.

268
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,583
[ABENO] Would you like
to spend the night here?

269
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,500
It would be no inconvenience
for the Mononokean.

270
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,750
[chirps]

271
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,166
I can find a place just fine

272
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,583
if I start looking right now,
so don't worry about me.

273
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,958
And besides, I've made myself
a promise that the next time

274
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,000
I step foot into the Mononokean

275
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,166
will be the day
I request to be exorcised.

276
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,416
So that's that.

277
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,333
I'll be saying my
goodbyes from right here.

278
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,791
[BIRD YOKAI chirping]

279
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,333
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

280
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,625
[KOMON]
Oh! Hohoho.

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,416
[CHUNGO chirps]

282
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,000
[CHUNGO chirps]

283
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,000
[ABENO] Sorry for
pretending I can't fly.

284
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,125
Huh?

285
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:47,041
Look. That's what
he just said to you.

286
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,208
I'd usually say take our
translator with a grain of salt.

287
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:54,250
But in this case,
it seems right on the mark.

288
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,208
Ha. That's good to know.

289
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,500
Don't feel too guilty, I'm just
glad I got to see you fly.

290
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,291
This means I get to send you
all off with no reservations.

291
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,250
Chunichi 

292
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,000
Chunji 

293
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:05,958
Chunzo.

294
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:06,958
Chunyon.

295
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,708
And Chungo.

296
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,541
This is the day
when all five of you

297
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,458
finally get to leave the nest.

298
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,333
So I don't have to
take care of you anymore.

299
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,625
[KOMON]
Goodbye.

300
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,625
[ASHIYA] Abeno messed
up the portal earlier,

301
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,583
so this is round two.

302
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,041
[BIRD YOKAI chirping]

303
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,083
[ABENO]
Mononokean.

304
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,541
Connect us to the school roof.

305
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:54,250
[BIRD YOKAI chirping]

306
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,833
[ASHIYA]
They planned it together?

307
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,625
Hey, Abeno, listen.

308
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,166
[ABENO]
What?

309
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,541
[ASHIYA] I found out why Chungo
acted like he couldn't fly.

310
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,833
[ASHIYA] When they first
started flight practice,

311
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,041
they all
made an agreement.

312
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,083
They decided that
at least one of them

313
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,375
should stay behind
with Komon. Forever.

314
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,208
[ABENO]
Hmm?

315
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,750
And why is that?

316
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,875
Because they were so grateful
to Komon for taking them in.

317
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,666
They could see
that Komon loved them,

318
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,833
so they planned to leave Chungo
behind as a sort of present.

319
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,083
Then Chungo was a farewell gift?

320
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,500
They couldn't just tell Komon,

321
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,500
so they had Chungo
pretend he couldn't fly,

322
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,666
which meant he would have
to stay in the Mundane World.

323
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,666
The Mononokean
translated that for me.

324
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,208
[ASHIYA]
But...

325
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:57,958
[ASHIYA]
Now, they think that Komon

326
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,958
might be better
off without them.

327
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,250
More carefree.

328
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,291
If Komon would be
happier not having

329
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,875
to take care of any of them,

330
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,250
then there's no need
for Chungo to stay.

331
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,333
He may as well go to the
underworld with his siblings.

332
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,041
At least, that's
my understanding.

333
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:13,958
So?

334
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,916
So, what?

335
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,208
You'd go to the Underworld
cause Komon said to

336
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,333
or stay here because
of your siblings.

337
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,625
Stop that n' think.

338
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,916
Where is it that you
truly want to be?

339
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,375
[CHUNGO chirps]

340
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,208
Do you want to go to the
Underworld with your siblings?

341
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,125
Or...

342
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,583
Let's go to the Mononokean.

343
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,333
All right, Itsuki?

344
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,583
Would you rather get
to spend more time with Komon?

345
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,208
[CHUNGO chirps]

346
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,083
[CHUNICHI chirps]

347
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,000
[CHUNGO chirps]

348
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,416
[CHUNGO chirps]

349
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,375
[ASHIYA] I guess he decided
to go back to Komon.

350
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,833
[ABENO]
Yeah.

351
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,666
[ASHIYA] You don't think we
should expect a complaint,

352
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,625
do you?

353
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,041
I mean they did say the kids

354
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,583
would be a load off
their shoulders.

355
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,625
Possibly, but still...

356
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,541
Huh?

357
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,916
[ABENO] I get the feeling
that Komon was just pretending

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,041
to want the carefree life.

359
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,833
[KOMON whimpers]

360
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,625
[BIRD YOKAI chirp]

361
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,958
[gasps]

362
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,583
[KOMON] I wanted them to be
happy, and it seems I succeeded,

363
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,375
but I also made them too
comfortable here in this world.

364
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,208
[ASHIYA]
Abeno has a good point.

365
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,083
After all, you know
what they say...

366
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,333
[ASHIYA] ..."Two is always
better than one," right?

367
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,666
[ABENO] We were to exorcise five
yokai that had been raised

368
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,333
by the client,
who would stay behind.

369
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,208
However, one opted to remain
in the Mundane World

370
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,333
with the client.

371
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,750
[KOMON]
That must be tough.

372
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,833
I heard the employee who worked
there before you left as well.

373
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,375
[ABENO]
Mononokean.

374
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,708
Before I came,

375
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,958
did Aoi ever use a
different human employee?

376
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,416
All I recall is that
in his earlier days,

377
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,958
he was a dangerous sort who
broke many Underworld taboos.

378
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,416
[LEGISLATOR]
My, you've been working hard.

379
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
What? Is something the matter?

380
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,833
You look troubled.

381
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,208
How'd you get injured this time?

382
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,041
Would you believe
me if I told you?

383
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,916
I'd believe you like
the excuse for slacking off.

384
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,083
It isn't so bad,

385
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,083
since it's not my
dominant hand this time.

386
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,000
It's worse cause you've gone
from milking it to faking it.

387
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:22,958
Huh?

388
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,041
That a Mononokean report log?

389
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,333
I'd planned to look up
just one, but I couldn't quit.

390
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,625
The logs from after Ashiya

391
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,000
became an employee
are just so intriguing.

392
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,833
I couldn't help
but keep reading.

393
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:34,625
Oh?

394
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,583
Is that the latest issue?

395
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,458
These are formal reports,
not magazines.

396
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:43,291
Since you made the trip here,
you should stay for tea.

397
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,916
[ABENO]
I have a question.

398
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,791
[LEGISLATOR]
Another human employee?

399
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,875
Look. Uh, just forget I asked.

400
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,500
I'm not sure if this is related

401
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,791
to the subject
you're asking about.

402
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,208
[ABENO]
Go on?

403
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,750
But I am reminded of an
incident in the Mundane World.

404
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,583
One that occurred
before your employment.

405
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,958
[ABENO]
An incident?

406
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,500
[LEGISLATOR] The Justice
should have a record of it.

407
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,000
Secured within
White Sand Prison, of course.

408
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,333
I see.

409
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,958
Don't suppose the Justice
would let me read it.

410
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,166
Now that might prove difficult.

411
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,541
The details of this
incident are classified.

412
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,500
[ABENO]
Classified?

413
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,625
[LEGISLATOR] Whether the
Justice would grant me access

414
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:30,291
is a semi-open question, but the
simple act of asking about it

415
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,958
might be perceived
as suspicious.

416
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,958
Both by him
and by the Executive.

417
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,625
I see.

418
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,000
[LEGISLATOR]
Now.

419
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,416
That being said, White Sand
Prison's outer premises

420
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,791
are heavily guarded,
but the interior, far less so.

421
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,791
If you can sneak your way
inside, the rest should be easy.

422
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,875
Though, I daresay that's
a very significant "if."

423
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,583
[chuckles]

424
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,583
[ABENO]
Sakae Ashiya.

425
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:38,458
Ashiya's father and a former
employee of the Mononkean.

426
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:42,375
The more I learn about him,
the less at ease I feel.

427
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,625
Next time, "The Cobweb."

428
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,916
I hope my gut's
wrong about this.
