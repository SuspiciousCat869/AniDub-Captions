1
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:14,833
Huh?!

2
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,708
[KINAKO]
Hm?

3
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,166
I found you!

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,166
[KINAKO shrieks]

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,708
[OKINA]
Good job.

6
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,500
I'm impressed you could find
a yokai this small so easily.

7
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,041
[YAHIKO] Yeah, I'm pretty
great at hide-and-seek.

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,333
No big.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,708
Come play with me, it'll be fun.

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,083
Huh!

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,208
You look tasty!

12
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,291
[KINAKO screams]

13
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,666
Hmm? What's wrong little one?

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh, come on.

15
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,166
Don't sleep now,

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,083
or I'll eat you!

17
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,750
[OKINA] Well, I certainly
don't feel comfortable

18
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,375
just leaving them
here like this.

19
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,416
[YAHIKO, KINAKO laugh]

20
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,791
[YAHIKO]
You can't catch me!

21
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,000
[KINAKO]
I will!

22
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,000
--[KINAKO] Here I come!
--[YAHIKO] Over here!

23
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,916
[sighs]
Okay, guess you got me!

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,916
[OKINA]
Kinako really likes Yahiko.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,500
It's cute.

26
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,083
We should play even more!

27
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,666
You can go another round,
can't you, Yahiko?

28
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,333
Eh? Not right now.

29
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,666
[KINAKO whines]

30
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,458
[YAHIKO] But I'm down as
soon as I have a snack!

31
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,666
[KINAKO]
Huh?

32
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,750
That one's for you, Okina.

33
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:04,875
[OKINA]
Is it?

34
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,125
How considerate of you to share.

35
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,166
[YAHIKO]
Mm-hmm

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,000
[growls]

37
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,291
Huh? What's up your butt?

38
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,333
I believe I have an idea.

39
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,875
This is the first time she's
seen you in this form, correct?

40
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,791
Oh, is it?

41
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,333
[OKINA] By the way,
why name her "Kinako"?

42
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,375
[YAHIKO]
Because she looks like

43
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,375
the kinako-mochi
I ate the other day!

44
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,750
Are you really my Yahiko?

45
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,375
The one and only.

46
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,000
[YAHIKO]
See?

47
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,833
[KINAKO]
Yahiko! Yahiko, that's amazing!

48
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:46,666
I want to do that, too!
I wanna transform!

49
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,000
So do it.

50
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,625
[OKINA]
Say, Kinako?

51
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,708
[KINAKO]
What is it, Okina?

52
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,791
Do you think you'll be ready

53
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,708
to go to the Underworld
anytime soon?

54
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,750
No, I'm not going yet.

55
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,416
I'm not even close to ready!

56
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,750
I want to play more
hide-and-seek with Yahiko!

57
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,916
And play more tag with Yahiko!

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,791
[OKINA laughs]

59
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,625
Judging from the way you talk,
Yahiko has been spoiling you.

60
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,666
Whaddya mean?

61
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,541
I was just having fun,
like usual.

62
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,333
If we played a lot, it's
because I wanted to play a lot.

63
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,041
[OKINA laughs]

64
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,708
[YAHIKO] We won't be
able to hang out anymore

65
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,666
if she's exorcised
to the Underworld.

66
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,125
We'll play a bit more,
and then I'll get Haruitsuki.

67
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,250
[KINAKO pants]

68
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,916
I...

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,166
I did it. Yahiko.

70
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,166
[OKINA chuckles]
You did.

71
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,708
But just your ears.

72
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,416
[laughs]
You call that a transformation?

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,375
Man, you suck at this!

74
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,291
You should start by turning
into something simpler.

75
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,791
Like this rock!

76
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,875
Why can't you do it?

77
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,333
[KINAKO]
I can!

78
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,583
[laughs]
No, you can't!

79
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,166
[OKINA laughs]

80
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,291
When you two stand next to each
other with those matching ears,

81
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,875
you look like siblings.

82
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:13,958
Yahiko's the older brother and
Kinako's the younger sister.

83
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,458
I'm the little sister.

84
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,166
Yahiko's little sister!

85
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,125
[YAHIKO]
Siblings.

86
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,708
Well...

87
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,875
Guess I'll have to help.

88
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,250
Do you want me to teach you
how to transform better?

89
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,708
Uh-huh!

90
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,875
Maybe if you do it right,
I'll give you some rakugan.

91
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,375
Ah! Ah!

92
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,500
[OKINA laughs]

93
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,250
Huh?

94
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,833
Kinako?

95
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:49,166
Yahiko? Yahiko.

96
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,375
Yahiko.

97
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:59,416
Kinako, no!
Don't disappear on me!

98
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,791
[KINAKO]
Yahiko. Yahiko.

99
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,958
I tried carrying her
to the Mononokean, but...

100
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,666
Is she about to fade away, then?

101
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,041
That's right.

102
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,875
Listen, Kinako.

103
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,500
You should go to the Underworld,
you'll get better there.

104
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:36,500
But Haruitsuki can't
pick you up to take you.

105
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,083
None of us can.

106
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,291
It sucks.

107
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,458
But do you think you can
manage to walk on your own?

108
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,583
Kinako.

109
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,291
Do you?

110
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,583
Hey!

111
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,583
[ASHIYA] She doesn't
look like she can get up.

112
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,083
How are we gonna exorcise her?

113
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,625
We can just let her disappear--

114
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,083
[KINAKO]
I'm hungry.

115
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,708
[ABENO]
Yahiko, Okina.

116
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,208
Tell me what happened here--

117
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,500
Did anybody else just hear
someone say they were hungry?

118
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,250
I-I swear I just did.

119
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,875
I think it was a girl's voice.

120
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,250
It was pretty clear,
I definitely didn't imagine it!

121
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,500
[KINAKO]
I'm hungry.

122
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,625
[ASHIYA]
Yeah, there it is again!

123
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,791
Haruitsuki! Kinako
says that she's hungry!

124
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,750
And that she wants
some leaves to eat!

125
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,791
[ABENO]
Then go get her some.

126
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,166
[YAHIKO]
'Kay!

127
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,416
[KINAKO]
So good!

128
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,375
Hey Yahiko,
can I have another one?

129
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,916
I've got one right here, if you
don't mind it being from me.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,875
[OKINA chuckles]

131
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,000
She should be out
of the woods, for now.

132
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,125
[OKINA] I think she used
up all her energy at once

133
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,000
when she transformed.

134
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,083
What a relief.

135
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,166
I didn't think
she was gonna make it.

136
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,458
Yahiko! Just one more, okay?

137
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,958
Hello?

138
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,208
Exorcise her.

139
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,750
No thanks.

140
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,083
I gotta stay here,
so we can play more!

141
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,333
Huh?

142
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,250
You just want to stay
so you can play with me?

143
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,041
Don't you get it?

144
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,416
You almost faded away just now.

145
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,916
Someone as weak and frail as you

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,458
couldn't possibly play with me
here in the Mundane World.

147
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,458
I can, too.

148
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,625
Everything'll be fine if
I just eat lots of leaves.

149
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,916
Doesn't matter,
now go to the Underworld.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,416
But why?

151
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,291
I just told you, you're not
strong enough to play here,

152
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,208
so you gotta go!

153
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,958
No way!

154
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:48,833
[grunts]

155
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,458
Huh? Are you all right?

156
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,125
Yahiko! You can't
be so rough with her!

157
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,583
[KINAKO whimpers]

158
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,083
[ABENO]
Kinako,

159
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,958
to be perfectly honest with you,

160
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,625
if you stay in
the Mundane World,

161
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,541
you will fade away, very soon.

162
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,875
Please, allow me
to exorcise you.

163
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,833
[KINAKO]
I won't!

164
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,125
Don't be like that.

165
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,500
We all just want what's
best for you, you know?

166
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,166
We want you to
be safe and happy!

167
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,916
[KINAKO] I don't wanna go
to the Underworld by myself,

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,708
but I'll go if Yahiko
comes with me.

169
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,666
How about that?

170
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,250
Let's go together!

171
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,666
Together?

172
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,750
Yeah!

173
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:38,916
[YAHIKO]
No.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,958
Come on, it'll be fun!

175
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,416
We can play together
as much as we want there!

176
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,000
And I won't disappear!

177
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,000
[YAHIKO]
I said no!

178
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,291
[KINAKO]
Why not?

179
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,416
Come on, let's go!

180
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,083
[YAHIKO]
No.

181
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,666
I'm not going, okay?

182
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,875
[OKINA]
Kinako! That's enough.

183
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,750
[KINAKO]
Why are you being so mean?

184
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,125
If you're not gonna
come with me,

185
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,291
then I'm never going
to the Underworld!

186
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,083
So there!

187
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,791
Ugh. Shut up!

188
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,708
It's not like
I don't want to go!

189
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,125
Huh?

190
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,125
It's just...

191
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,666
It's just that
I have to stay here,

192
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,708
so I can't go.

193
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,958
You can't?

194
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,416
I don't get it, why not?

195
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,583
Why not?

196
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,416
Yahiko?

197
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,458
[YAHIKO]
Well, that's because...

198
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,833
...of Haruitsuki!

199
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,416
Huh?

200
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,041
He's punishing me by making me
stay and help out at the temple.

201
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,291
So I don't have a choice,
I gotta stay here!

202
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,875
[ASHIYA] Talk about throwing
someone under the bus!

203
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,500
[KINAKO]
Haruitsuki!

204
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,208
I really wanna go to the
Underworld with Yahiko!

205
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,041
Please tell me that
he's allowed to go too!

206
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,291
I'm sorry,
but I cannot let him go.

207
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,500
Huh?

208
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,333
[ASHIYA] What?
What are you saying, Abeno?

209
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,541
Don't you think Yahiko's done
more than enough by now?

210
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,500
Shut your mouth.

211
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,333
Just go to the other
side by yourself.

212
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,750
[KINAKO]
No!

213
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,625
I wanna go with you!

214
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,250
Hey. Listen to me.

215
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,916
If you keep being a whiner,
I'm not gonna like you anymore.

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,750
[gasps]

217
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,916
--Yahiko!
--Leave it be.

218
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,208
That's even worse
than disappearing.

219
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't want you to hate me,
so I'll just go on my own.

220
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,500
[ABENO]
Okina.

221
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,291
I'll need to borrow your garden.

222
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,583
[OKINA]
Of course. Please, feel free.

223
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,541
[YAHIKO]
It's like Okina said.

224
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,625
I've been spoiling
Kinako too much.

225
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,250
If I had called Haruitsuki
to exorcise her sooner,

226
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,375
she wouldn't have
almost faded away.

227
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:59,291
Or gotten so attached that
she didn't want to leave.

228
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,458
I should've had her sent off

229
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,125
before we had so
much fun together.

230
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,041
[ABENO]
What?

231
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,833
Huh?

232
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,333
Hey, uh... Sorry.

233
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,666
Am I allowed to talk now, or...?

234
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,250
Only if you're careful
with your words.

235
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay, uh...

236
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,083
I will be.

237
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,375
Let's wait until
tomorrow to do this!

238
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,375
Kinako. Don't listen to him.

239
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,291
He's a bad guy who butt's
into other people's business.

240
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,541
I should have kept
my mouth shut.

241
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,125
[OKINA]
Ashiya.

242
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,541
Considering the poor state
Kinako is in at the moment.

243
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,708
Wouldn't you feel better

244
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,166
if we exorcised her
as soon as possible?

245
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,750
Why is it that you object?

246
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,333
I just think we're
ignoring what she wants.

247
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,666
If we do that,
we'd feel better, but...

248
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,916
...she wouldn't.

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,625
[ABENO]
Hmmm...

250
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,958
And?

251
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,458
I mean,

252
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,666
I think we should exorcise her
ASAP too, but look at her.

253
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,208
She's made it pretty obvious

254
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,625
that Yahiko is more important
to her than her own health.

255
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,416
Don't you think?

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,958
Since Yahiko can't go with her,

257
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,875
and she can't get
what she wants.

258
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,625
I figured, why not compromise?

259
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,750
Whaddya say?

260
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,666
Since you can't accompany her,

261
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,583
how about you two play
together for one more day?

262
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,291
Sound good?

263
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,208
[ABENO] Waiting until
tomorrow to exorcise her

264
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,041
won't change the fact that
she doesn't want to go.

265
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,833
Bearing in mind
the state she's in,

266
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,458
she should be sent
off immediately.

267
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,291
Plus, I have another
job tomorrow,

268
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:48,375
so that would mean opening the
Mononokean twice in one day.

269
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,958
He looks so pissed.

270
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,333
[ABENO]
But I'd rather do it today.

271
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,208
I'll be good!

272
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,291
And I'm not gonna whine anymore!

273
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,375
I can go to the
Underworld all by myself.

274
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,250
Haruitsuki!

275
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,291
Please, Let me stay here
and play some more,

276
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,125
just until tomorrow!

277
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:12,250
Please, please!

278
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,916
[ABENO]
Hmm...

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,750
All right, have it your way.

280
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,416
I'll take care of
tomorrow's job by myself,

281
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,958
you guys stay with Kinako.

282
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,458
Huh?

283
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,000
For real?

284
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,208
I'm not saying that
I'm happy about it, but...

285
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,500
...if it's just till
tomorrow, then it's cool.

286
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,458
[ASHIYA]
The face of mercy.

287
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,208
[KINAKO]
Yahiko!

288
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,291
Did you hear that?

289
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,583
Haruitsuki said
I can stay another day!

290
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,458
We gotta play
as much as possible!

291
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,541
[YAHIKO]
What's with you?

292
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,375
Why are you so happy?

293
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,416
You're still leaving.

294
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,666
[sighs]
I guess that's fine.

295
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,791
We can play together
a little bit more.

296
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,375
[KINAKO]
Yay!

297
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,833
[YAHIKO]
Hey, Zenko!

298
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,416
Hurry up, isn't it my turn
to get brushed yet?

299
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,166
You've been brushing
Kinako for like, ever!

300
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,750
Almost done.

301
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:10,833
No, wait. Don't stop.
It feels so good!

302
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,208
[YAHIKO] I guess we
can skip me for today.

303
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,000
Are you sure?

304
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,125
I'll do it.

305
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,875
[YAHIKO]
Not today.

306
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,416
[ABENO]
Morning.

307
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,416
You look like you're
in fairly good health.

308
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,625
I'm happy to see that.

309
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,458
[KINAKO]
Mm-hmm. I feel super good!

310
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,583
I ate some leaves, too!

311
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,458
--Yeah?
--Haruitsuki,

312
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,125
I promise I'll be
ready to go later today.

313
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,125
Uh...

314
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,708
Okay.

315
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,791
All right, Yahiko, let's play!

316
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,333
You got it!

317
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,166
I should untie your rakugan!

318
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,166
[OKINA chuckles]
I was uncertain at first, but...

319
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,166
...it was the right move to
listen to Ashiya, wasn't it?

320
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,416
Hey, check it out,
the whole gang's here!

321
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,458
I gotta go now, but I'll
be back before sunset.

322
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,458
[OKINA]
Sounds good.

323
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,750
I'll be back sooner.

324
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,625
And I'll bring
Zenko along with me.

325
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,375
Fuzzy, why don't you play
with them in the meantime?

326
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,416
[KINAKO]
Hey!

327
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,125
We only have a little
bit of time left,

328
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,958
so we should play!

329
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,000
Come on!

330
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,541
[YAHIKO]
Mm!

331
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,333
[YAHIKO] We have to have
as much fun as possible

332
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:44,416
while we still can.

333
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,125
'Cause tomorrow, we...

334
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,666
...won't be able to anymore.

335
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,291
[KINAKO]
He's here, huh...

336
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:10,333
[YAHIKO] But it feels like...
we just started.

337
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:16,166
[YAHIKO] And she has to leave
for the Underworld already?

338
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,625
Yahiko?

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,833
[KINAKO]
Bye-bye.

340
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,875
[YAHIKO]
It's way too late now, so...

341
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,500
...why do I not want her to go?

342
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,208
I'm the one who told her
to stop complaining.

343
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,083
I should want her to go!

344
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,500
[YAHIKO]
Hurry up and do it.

345
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,625
All right, then.

346
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,750
May I exorcise you now?

347
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,833
[KINAKO]
Mm.

348
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,708
Yeah, you can.

349
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,375
[ABENO] Mononokean master,
Haruitsuki Abeno,

350
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,291
requesting a portal
to the Underworld.

351
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,375
What are you doing?

352
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,625
You're so far away
from everyone.

353
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,000
[YAHIKO]
I'm fine here.

354
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,625
[ASHIYA] Come on,
there's no need to be shy.

355
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,958
I said I'm fine! Ugh!

356
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,958
I hate you!

357
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,833
[ABENO]
Kinako.

358
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,125
If you're worried
about doing this alone,

359
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,500
I could come part
of the way with you.

360
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,291
Nuh-uh.

361
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,625
I can do it myself.

362
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,541
I'm not gonna be
a whiner anymore!

363
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,250
Bye-bye, Yahiko.

364
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,083
Bye-bye!

365
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,916
Kinako! Wait up a second!

366
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,208
Don't twist my head Ashiya-- 

367
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,750
Stop it. I don't
like this, one bit.

368
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,291
She has said goodbye
to you three times now.

369
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,750
And you never answered her back.

370
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,083
Are you really okay with that?

371
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,708
Yahiko?

372
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,291
[YAHIKO]
I don't like it.

373
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,333
I don't like that
you're leaving.

374
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,500
I want more time.

375
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,208
I want to play with you more.

376
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,916
I want you to be here tomorrow.

377
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,625
I don't want you to go.

378
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,416
But it'd be worse
if you disappeared.

379
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,666
So even though this hurts...

380
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,833
Bye-bye, then.

381
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,125
Go get strong enough that
you won't fade away anymore.

382
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,083
'Kay, Kinako?

383
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,291
Okay! I'm gonna get
so much stronger!

384
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,375
Strong enough to
transform like you can!

385
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,041
Super Duper-ly strong!

386
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,458
Heh!

387
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,166
[YAHIKO] I really wanted
to be with you longer.

388
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,916
To play and have
fun all the time.

389
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,958
But I'd rather you be
okay on the other side

390
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,875
than disappear here.

391
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:58,875
[KINAKO cries]

392
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,583
Bye-bye. Take care of yourself.

393
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,875
[ZENKO]
Kinako.

394
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,416
[ASHIYA]
She's gone.

395
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,708
[YAHIKO]
Yeah.

396
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:19,208
[ASHIYA] Hey, Yahiko, sorry if I
was being a little harsh there.

397
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,041
I didn't mean to be.

398
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,500
Great, I'm sure he hates
me more than ever now.

399
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,416
He's a tricky one.

400
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,333
[YAHIKO]
Haruitsuki.

401
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,791
[ABENO]
What?

402
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,625
[YAHIKO]
About Ashiya.

403
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:42,000
I thought he was useless,
but maybe I was wrong.

404
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,916
I don't hate him that much.

405
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,666
[ABENO]
Then go tell him that.

406
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,625
[YAHIKO]
Hm? No way.

407
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,208
[ABENO sighs]

408
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,375
[ABENO]
I'm so tired.

409
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,208
[ASHIYA]
Whoa! Don't drop him!

410
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,208
[ASHIYA] Fuzzy's been arrested
and taken to the Underworld?

411
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,916
There must be some mistake!

412
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,041
Wait for me, little buddy,
I'll be there to save you soon!

413
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,708
Next time, "The Tiger."

414
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,583
Wait. Is that the Executive?
