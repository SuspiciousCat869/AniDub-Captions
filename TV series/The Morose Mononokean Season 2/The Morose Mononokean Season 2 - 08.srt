Huh?!

162
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,625
[ASHIYA]
Abeno?

163
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,416
[ZENKO]
Huh? What's wrong?

164
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,625
[ASHIYA]
I don't get it.

165
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,125
He only collapses like this

166
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,583
when he opens a portal to
the Underworld twice in a day.

167
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,875
But if he did another job,
why didn't he tell me?

168
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,458
So what gives, Oisuke?

169
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,083
You say your home's nearby?

170
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,750
Yes, you can find my home
beneath the great sands.

171
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,000
Did we need to crawl
under the slide?

172
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,583
[screams]

173
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,791
Huh?

174
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,083
Who could've put such a
heavy thing there?

175
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,291
It'll crush my
poor home into pieces!

176
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,458
No sweat. I'll move it for ya!

177
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,125
[BOYS]
Hey, you!

178
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,916
[shrieks]

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,041
That's our watermelon,
so back off of it.

180
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,958
We're tryn'a play
split the melon here!

181
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,583
And we called dibs on
this spot first, so beat it!

182
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,708
[BOY A]
Yeah, scram!

183
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,791
I'm very sorry for
getting in your way.

184
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,333
But if you guys wouldn't mind,

185
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,791
I only came here to
look for something I lost.

186
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,416
So ya lost somethin'?

187
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
And how long will it
take you to find it?

188
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,708
Uh... Let's see.

189
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,791
Um, between three
and five minutes?

190
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,208
Okay, well, we're
gonna be finished

191
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,791
in about ten seconds.

192
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,000
So we should go first.

193
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,208
Um, gotcha.

194
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,875
Lemme just talk
to my friend about it.

195
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:45,875
Didja hear all that?

196
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,500
Whadda we do?

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,541
Ten seconds, right?

198
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,208
And that's all you need?

199
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,041
[BOY A]
Blond hair.

200
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,291
[BOY B]
A scraped-up face.

201
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,583
[BOY A]
And no mercy in his eyes.

202
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,291
[BOY A]
This guy's bad news!

203
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,083
[BOY B]
It's a kimono wearing gangster!

204
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,625
[BOYS] We've picked a fight
with one dangerous dude!

205
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,791
If you aren't
done in ten seconds...

206
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,541
...then my bro here's
gonna teach you a lesson.

207
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,000
It sure is bright out here.

208
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,541
We can just wait.

209
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,750
You kids go ahead
and enjoy your game.

210
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,291
But once you finish,

211
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,291
it's our turn,
and we'll take our sweet time.

212
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,666
We're done for even
if we let 'em go first!

213
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,333
It'll be okay. We just have
to finish in ten seconds!

214
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,416
Here goes!

215
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
I'll start the countdown!

216
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,000
Ten, nine, wait, uhh...

217
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,625
You're gonna hit
this fruit with a stick?

218
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,166
If you do that, you'll crack
my home like a nut!

219
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,541
This is bad.

220
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,208
Stop!

221
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,416
[echoing]
Stop. Stop.

222
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,708
Holy cow. You disarmed him

223
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,708
with a dropkick!

224
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,666
You gangster guys are awesome!

225
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,708
Gangsters?

226
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,875
Ah, you found my sweet home!

227
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,833
So I'm gonna be exorcising
Oisuke over there.

228
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,291
Think you can keep those grade-
schoolers from following me?

229
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,083
Yeah, not a problem.

230
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,041
You're coming with me, Hairball.

231
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,000
[ASHIYA] If this request
had come from the Executive,

232
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,500
Abeno would've
done it by himself.

233
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,125
I wouldn't even know about it.

234
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:47,208
And this time,
if I hadn't stopped him,

235
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,458
he would've done
something reckless again.

236
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,375
[ABENO] Mononokean Master
Haruitsuki Abeno,

237
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,083
requesting a portal
to the Underworld.

238
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,416
It's ready for you.

239
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,583
Your home didn't get
damaged at all, did it?

240
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,875
[OISUKE]
No, not even a bit.

241
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,750
My home is in perfect condition.

242
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,375
All thank to Ashiya. He risked
his body to protect it.

243
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,500
It was about to be smashed,

244
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,333
but he intervened
with a flying kick!

245
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,875
[ABENO]
Still, I can't help but feel

246
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,958
that the acrobatics
were unnecessarily risky.

247
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,500
Ashiya's a clutz.

248
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,708
And if he'd screwed up,

249
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,458
we'd've had to dig a
grave in that sandbox.

250
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,625
[OISUKE]
Pardon, Abeno.

251
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,666
Huh?

252
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,750
I truly am grateful
to both of you.

253
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,708
Might I ask that you relay
my thanks to Ashiya?

254
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,000
[ABENO]
I'd be glad to.

255
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,000
[BOY B]
Okay, now it's my turn!

256
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,625
To the left, to the left!

257
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,041
Wait, do mean my left or yours?

258
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,833
Oisuke asked me to
pass along his thanks.

259
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,791
For how you risked your body
to protect his home, and all.

260
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,791
Did he really say that?

261
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,625
'S cute how much he loved it.

262
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,916
His lil home.

263
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,083
Yeah, it worked out okay,

264
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,791
but you didn't need
to jump in there.

265
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,333
I couldn't just stand by
and watch

266
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,666
while you got whacked
trying to protect his home.

267
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,166
Like, wham!

268
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:42,000
That wasn't a possibility
I gave much thought to.

269
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,458
[ASHIYA]
You don't have to lie.

270
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,166
I know you were ready
to take that hit.

271
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,958
I was worried for you.

272
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,083
I thought you were gonna get
hurt right in front of me again.

273
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,833
You didn't have to get
that scratch on your cheek.

274
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,333
I could've caught you.

275
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,500
But since you didn't tell me

276
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,000
you were taking jobs
from the Executive,

277
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,583
I didn't know you'd fall.

278
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,333
I get why you kept
those jobs a secret,

279
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,375
and I appreciate that you
were just trying to protect me.

280
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,750
But from now on,

281
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,000
please tell me about
every job you get

282
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,583
even if they come
from the Executive.

283
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,083
So that next time
you act recklessly,

284
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,083
I can try and catch you,

285
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,333
or at least break your fall.

286
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,333
'N also,

287
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,958
I'm not sure if you already knew
this, but, believe it or not.

288
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,291
[ABENO]
Hmm?

289
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,250
I'm actually an employee
of the Mononokean.

290
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,416
What?

291
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,750
I know I'm not that strong.

292
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,000
But what I lack in muscle,
I've got in spirit.

293
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,833
So you can count on
my help with any job.

294
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,416
Oh, so let me get this straight,

295
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,166
you're saying you're an
employee of the Mononokean?

296
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,833
Crazy.

297
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,375
I thought you
were just a stalker.

298
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,541
Nope, I get money!

299
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,583
Side note,
I'm not your only worker.

300
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,958
Right, bud?

301
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,250
I knew he worked for me.

302
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,916
[BOY B]
Hey!

303
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,208
It's your turn to try it,
okay, Blondie?

304
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,250
I'll tell ya the rules
while we blindfold ya!

305
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,625
[BOY B]
No need to be nervous,

306
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,833
we're not gonna make it
harder for you or anything.

307
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,208
Just think of that
watermelon like it's the head

308
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,625
of a rival gang member!

309
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,125
[BOY A] And think
of the stick like the pipe

310
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,708
you use to break windows as
you vroom by on your bike!

311
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,166
[ASHIYA]
Hey, Abeno!

312
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,125
Huh?

313
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,000
You've got this.

314
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,250
I'll give you directions!

[EXECUTIVE]

316
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,583
As I'm sure you realize,

317
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,708
I'll have more requests for the
Mononokean in the days to come.

318
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,833
They may prove challenging.

319
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,166
So I do hope you'll
allow Hanae Ashiya

320
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,083
to provide you with assistance.

321
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,583
But of course,

322
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,750
that's assuming the human
opts to stay as your employee

323
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,166
when we both know he may as well

324
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,250
choose to run
for the hills, right?

325
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,166
[ASHIYA]
Be careful!

326
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,458
You're about
to take a step down!

327
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,666
[BOY A]
Oooh! Nice!

328
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,208
[BOY B]
Sweet! You can do it!

329
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,125
[BOY A]
Way to go! You got this!

330
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,791
Just keep on goin' straight!

331
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,250
[BOY A] Bet'cha two marbles
and a slinky he gets it.

332
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,875
[BOY B]
Deal.

333
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,583
You're there! Go!

334
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,333
[ABENO]
Executive.

335
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,041
Your plan failed.

336
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,166
You nailed it!

337
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,500
With just one try!

338
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,416
What a gangster!

339
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,041
Wow!

340
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,083
This watermelon looks so tasty!

341
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,500
Yeah. We tried to
head out at first,

342
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,458
but the kids were
just so insistent.

343
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,583
It would've been kinda awkward

344
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,041
if they had decided
to follow us back.

345
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,875
Mononokean, let's go
over next week's schedule.

346
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,375
Why the wardrobe change?

347
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,125
Could it mean that he's doing
another job after this?

348
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,208
[ABENO]
I can hear you,

349
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,500
and we're both done for the day.

350
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,166
Is that the truth?

351
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,916
Well, if the Mononokean
says so, it must be true.

352
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,708
[ABENO]
Ashiya.

353
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,791
Yeah?

354
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,916
[ABENO]
About the Executive's requests.

355
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,625
We don't have any currently.

356
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,083
We don't, right?

357
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:42,916
That said,

358
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,833
the next time we
get a job from him...

359
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,583
...please help.

360
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,166
[ASHIYA]
Was it that hard to say that?

361
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,958
But at least it sounds like he's
trying to be honest with me.

362
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,333
I'm glad to hear it.

363
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,083
And I'm ready whenever.

364
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,125
 It's pretty lukewarm.

365
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,375
[ASHIYA]
What do you expect from me!

366
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,875
I tried to cool it in water!

367
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:16,916
[ABENO]
Mononokean.

368
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,833
School starts up
again next week.

369
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,333
So we'll need to
adjust the schedule.

370
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:27,541
[ASHIYA] Felt like this
summer lasted forever, but...

371
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,041
...it was too fast
at the same time.

372
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:56,875
Huh.

373
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,708
Tastes good.

374
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,375
[ASHIYA] Mom passed out
and had to go to the hospital.

375
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,666
I see the flickering
shadow of a yokai.

376
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,166
And now my sister's come home!

377
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,166
Next time, "The Shadow"!

378
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,708
The Ashiya family secret
will be revealed at last!

379
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,208
Possibly.
