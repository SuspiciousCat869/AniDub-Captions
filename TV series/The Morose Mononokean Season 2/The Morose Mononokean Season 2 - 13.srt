Maybe Bonta thought this was
where we were gonna meet him?

[ASHIYA] Good thing
I'm here to check it out.

Oh, no.

It looks like he's been
possessed by a yokai.

That must be why his
presence felt a little strange

I won't let you do
something so cowardly.

you're already causing trouble.

Please, just don't kill me!

the hollow promises

begging for its life?

Hm...

If I trap you inside this shrine

I wonder if you'll be
stuck in there.

[SAKAE] I've never tried
sealing anyone before.

Maybe testing out
the limits of this power

95

on you isn't such a bad idea.

I won't let you kill this yokai.

inside the shrine.

this power against
a human before.

Get out of my way.

111
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,500
I will not.

I don't understand
your concern here.

You're human.

115
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,041
Why protect a monster?

116
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,208
Influence is a powerful tool.

117
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,541
It's important
the user show discretion.

118
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,916
Aoi is the one
who taught me about that.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,875
Everything we do is
for the sake of yokai.

120

Aoi.

121

[ABENO]
With Influence,

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,583
you can supersede a yokai's
own will and even kill.

123
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,958
Because of that,
I can't allow someone

124
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,125
to wield such a dangerous
power irresponsibly.

If there comes a time
when it must be used,

126
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:10,666
it's my job to do so as
Master of the Mononokean.

Oh, I get it.

It's not just that you want
to save this one yokai.

You intend to prevent Hanae
from killing any, as well.

[ABENO]
Why are you doing this?

00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,125
Do you have some
grudge against them?

132
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,458
Or is this your way of
protecting Hanae, as his father?

00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,291
I don't know why
you showed up today,

134
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,291
but whatever
the reason might be...

135
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,208
...you need to realize
that your son isn't you!

When I first met him,

Ashiya didn't like yokai--
he was terrified of them.

But after everything
he's been through,

he's grown to like yokai.

He started off as my employee,

but now, he's built
his own relationships.

143
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,208
He cares about yokai,

turn him into a killer.

00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,041
Please, don't!

166
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,208
Snap out of it already!

167
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,958
[ABENO]
Idiot!

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,375
[SAKAE]
Seems I overstayed my welcome.

169
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,375
I can't believe you're
clinging to Aoi's teachings

170
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,083
about acting for
the sake of yokai.

171
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,166
The foolish student
of a foolish teacher.

172
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,458
Well, you've made your decision,
so I imagine you'll stick to it.

173
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,375
Go ahead and follow
that asinine creed,

174
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,833
but pray our paths
never cross again,

175
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,583
"Master" Haruitsuki Abeno.

176
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,041
[sighs]

177
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:04,416
[SASA]
You're not going to kill me?

178
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,125
Of course not.

179
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,166
I'm Master the of the
Mononokean, not your enemy.

180
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,333
It's my job to exorcise you.

181
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,375
You'll be safe
in the Underworld.

182
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,875
[SASA] Ha. Like I would
believe anything a human says.

183
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,958
Hairball?

184
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,458
[SASA] You're saying these
humans actually saved you?

185
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,125
That I should trust them?

186
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,541
I don't know.

187
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,583
[SASA] Can I really
leave the Mundane World

188
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,875
and with the help of
the humans I fear so much?

189
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,041
Can I be rescued from
this cramped shrine

190
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,833
and live in the realm
where the yokai belong?

191
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,500
Where I can truly be free?

192
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,625
I can't imagine your pain.

193
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,166
You were trapped
here so many years,

194
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,583
forced to live in
solitary confinement.

195
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:39,750
It makes sense that you would
despise humanity so much.

196
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,958
Therefore, I humbly request
you allow me to help.

197
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,583
[BONTA oinks]
Um...

198
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,000
Don't worry,
I haven't forgotten you.

199
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,500
[ABENO] Just hang in there
a little longer, Ashiya.

200
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,208
[yawns]

201
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,291
[bell chiming]

202
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,916
Hello?

203
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,583
You finally woke up.

204
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,375
Um. Why am I in the Mononokean?

205
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,708
The last thing I remember

206
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,458
is climbing a bunch of
stairs looking for Bonta.

207
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,750
[ABENO] I exorcised Bonta to the
Underworld a few moments ago,

208
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,458
along with Sasa.

209
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,500
Who's Sasa? Should I know?

210
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,416
Yeah. We need to talk.

211
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,000
Sure, what's up?

212
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,000
It's about Sakae Ashiya.

213
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,500
[gasps]

214
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,916
What are these?

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,875
They're detailed work reports
that Aoi put together.

216
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,541
Sometimes, there
are drawings of a cat

217
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,000
seemingly unrelated
to the described job.

218
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,041
See?

219
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, yeah.

220
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,833
Look. Another one.

221
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,166
I think these are
meant to represent

222
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,666
when Sakae worked
a job with Aoi.

223
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,500
Like some type of symbol

224
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,958
[ASHIYA]
Really?

225
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,833
[ABENO] It seems the fact that
Sakae was employed here

226
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,041
was hidden not only
from the Legislator,

227
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,333
but from the Mononokean itself.

228
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:13,625
[ASHIYA] So Sakae was an
employee of the Mononokean?

229
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,250
But, why would Aoi have
to hide that from anyone?

230
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,500
The most likely reason is
because Sakae was a human.

231
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,750
Oh, yeah.

232
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,416
Can't forget there are
yokai in the Underworld

233
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,208
who believe all
humans are dangerous.

234
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,583
Y'know, we only met once, so my
dad always felt like a stranger,

235
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,291
but this makes me feel
a little closer to him.

236
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,541
After digging
through these reports,

237
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,250
I think I know when he died.

238
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,750
Huh?

239
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,041
[ABENO] Sixteen years ago,
on November 2nd.

240
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,833
[ASHIYA]
Wait, 16?

241
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,000
No way.

242
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,291
[ABENO]
Mononokean.

243
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,166
What happened on that day?

244
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,166
[ABENO]
Considering this information.

245
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,375
It seems probable that
this is the day Sakae died.

246
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,083
[ASHIYA]
How can you be so sure?

247
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,666
That's not proof.

248
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,125
[ABENO] A number of pages have
been torn out of this account.

249
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,708
I'm assuming they talked about
the events that transpired.

250
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:28,916
[ASHIYA]
That can't be true.

251
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,666
'Cuz three years later...

252
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,750
When I was three years old,

253
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,083
he came home on
Christmas to visit us.

254
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,458
My mom and my sister
both talked to him.

255
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,791
[ABENO]
That was probably Aoi,

256
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,333
transformed to
look like your father.

257
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,875
[gasps]

258
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,583
[ABENO]
My master possessed an ability

259
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,416
that normal yokai don't have.

260
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,333
Aoi could be seen by anybody
in the Mundane World.

261
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,875
Even by humans

262
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,625
who'd never been able to see
a yokai before in their lives.

263
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,583
Aoi could both
shapeshift into others

264
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,958
and appear as an ordinary human.

265
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,458
[ASHIYA]
Then...

266
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,000
[ASHIYA] The person who I
always thought was my father...

267
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,500
[ASHIYA]
...was really Aoi?

268
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,541
Makes sense.

269
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,208
That's why he didn't stay.

270
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,250
Because it wasn't
my dad to begin with.

271
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,541
I don't get it.

272
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,250
Why would Aoi do that?

273
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,583
Who knows.

274
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:39,041
The only one who could
answer that for us is Aoi.

275
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,791
So, in the end,
we're still completely clueless.

276
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,541
[ABENO]
Not so fast.

277
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,583
I wanted to see if there
were other records,

278
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,250
so I went to look through the
archives at White Sand Prison.

279
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,875
[ASHIYA]
Whoa, seriously?

280
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,541
Sakae Ashiya could
also use Influence.

281
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,666
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

282
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,500
[ABENO] What I read said that
he used that power improperly,

283
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,291
breaking Underworld taboos.

284
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,208
Sealing, maybe
even killing yokai.

285
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,208
Wait. Why would he do that?

286
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,500
All I know is Aoi
would never condone it.

287
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,375
Which means that
whatever Sakae did,

288
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,041
he did of his own free will.

289
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,625
Well then, maybe...
the Executive saw me as a threat

290
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,250
because he thought
I was capable of that too.

291
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:21,000
And honestly, if he was
doing stuff like that,

292
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,500
I guess, in a way,
my dad had it coming.

293
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,583
[ABENO]
Don't make assumptions.

294
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,833
Huh?

295
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,750
All we know is
after that particular day,

296
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,416
there were no more
records of him.

297
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,333
But there's no real
account of his death.

298
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,541
[SAKAE]
The seal's barely broken

299
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,166
and you're already
causing trouble.

300
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,500
This is one of the reasons
I hate you yokai.

301
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,166
There must've been a
reason he hated yokai.

302
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,125
Maybe something happened
that turned him against them.

303
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,708
It's weird.

304
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,708
The way you're talking it sounds
like you've met my dad before.

305
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,000
Huh?

306
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,875
No, of course I haven't.

307
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,666
I'm just going off of
what we've gathered.

308
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,375
Makes sense.

309
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,708
Whatever you say, boss.

310
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,291
But... I think you're right.

311
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,250
He must of had
some kind of reason.

312
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,833
Yeah. I'm sure.

313
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,125
So then...

314
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:12,250
Do you still want to know
more about the guy?

315
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,708
Well, yeah.
Of course I do.

316
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,291
I want to become the
best employee possible.

317
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,583
That means knowing
everything I can.

318
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:23,000
I wouldn't want to let the
Mononokean down after all.

319
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,291
[ZENKO'S DAD] I see, so
everything's been resolved then?

320
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,625
Yes, sir!

321
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,083
The yokai-aye-aye-I don't
expect anyone will be

322
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,166
seeing weird things again.

323
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,958
[ZENKO'S DAD]
Perfect.

324
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,541
Thank you so much, Abeya.

325
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,083
That's actually both of
our names spliced together.

326
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,166
If there's anything
else we can help with,

327
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,458
feel free to contact us.

328
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,041
Well, since I already
got the both a' ya here.

329
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,833
Why don't you take a look at
some of these job requests.

330
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,166
[ASHIYA, ABENO]
Huh?

331
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,625
So it turned out to
be a pig yokai instead.

332
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,500
Unfortunately I fainted
before we finished.

333
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,875
Fainted? Why?

334
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,083
Cause genius fell down
the stairs and hit his head.

335
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,166
Heh heh. Clumsy me.

336
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,833
But Abeno performed the
exorcism just fine by himself.

337
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,708
[YAHIKO]
Whoa there, Ashiya.

338
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,208
You leaving already?

339
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,750
Hi, Yahiko. What's up?

340
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,250
Oh, just wonderin' what kinda
treats you're packin' today.

341
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,625
Yeah, I didn't bring any.

342
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,041
Better double down
on the goods next time,

343
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,375
or you'll get nothin' from me!

344
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,166
That's fine.
I don't need your help anymore.

345
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,708
What? No fair!

346
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,416
Am I supposed to go hungry?

347
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,708
You want me to starve?

348
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,625
What about "treats"?

349
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,041
[ABENO]
Who knows?

350
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,125
[ZENKO]
Huh?

351
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:25,958
[YAHIKO]
Don't just walk away from me!

352
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,291
We had a deal!

353
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,291
That's right.

354
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,000
But based on what he's said,
Ashiya doesn't seem to remember

355
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,500
taking on Sakae's
personality at all.

356
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,333
I know, I know.

357
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,708
The Legislator.

358
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,208
The Justice.

359
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,750
And of course...

360
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,500
...the Executive.

361
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,500
If the Three Powers learned
the truth of what happened...

362
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:29,375
[ABENO] Fortunately, I just
need to keep my mouth shut.

363
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,333
Hey! Hurry it up already,
you slowpoke.

364
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,333
What, are you lost
in thought or something?

365
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:05,416
[ABENO] As long as I keep this
to myself, we can live in peace.

366
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,291
Right?

367
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,791
Aoi?

368
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,291
