1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,041
[ASHIYA]
A request from the Underworld?

2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,708
To come observe
the Mundane World?

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,833
They can do that?

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,833
We usually send them
away from here.

5
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,333
[ASHIYA]
If it's so complicated,

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,250
why would they go
through all that trouble?

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,750
You have any idea?

8
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:29,958
Abeno?

9
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,583
So they want to observe
a school in our world?

10
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,583
Huh.

11
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,166
Uhh.

12
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,458
All right, let's see
what it says here.

13
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,333
"The purpose
of my visit is this:

14
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,625
To observe a school,
as a necessary step

15
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,375
to advance the standards of
education in the Underworld,"

16
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,666
et cetera, the end.

17
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,875
You skipped way too much!

18
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,125
I got the gist of it.

19
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,541
Our job is to accompany them

20
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,291
during their three-day
observation.

21
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,583
Simple.

22
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,000
[ASHIYA] If we're showing
them around school,

23
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,500
I'll be a bigger
help than Abeno

24
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,833
since honestly he's a bit
lacking in communication skills.

25
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,416
I'll be the perfect guide!

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,083
Bring it on.

27
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,166
[SAGA]
What's up, man?

28
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,666
[FUSSHI]
You on your way home, I assume?

29
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,666
[ASHIYA]
Oh, hey guys!

30
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, I am.

31
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,666
[SAGA] We caught up
to you to ask you something.

32
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,041
Since tomorrow's Saturday,
we're gonna go bowling.

33
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,125
Wanna come with?

34
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,875
Cool! Sounds good!

35
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:51,458
Uh...

36
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,250
Huh?

37
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,750
Do you have plans already?

38
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,625
It's just...

39
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,000
When is the client supposed
to show up again?

40
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,375
Well, it's probably
not tomorrow.

41
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,416
Never mind, I can go!

42
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,958
[SAGA]
All right, I'm hype!

43
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,375
You guys ready to get wrecked?

44
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,208
[FUSSHI]
Don't go too hard on us, dude.

45
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,000
Morning, Ashiya.

46
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,750
Hey, Fusshi.
Good morning to you too!

47
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,666
[FUSSHI]
Saturday was fun, huh?

48
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,208
[ASHIYA]
As fun as eight games can be.

49
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,375
Saga really didn't want to stop!

50
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,458
I was so sore
I slept all day Sunday.

51
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,375
[FUSSHI]
Same, I was completely wiped.

52
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,583
Morning.

53
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,333
[FEMALE CLASSMATE A]
Good morning you two.

54
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,291
[SAGA]
What's up, Fusshi?

55
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,166
Hey, Ashiya.

56
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,958
[FUSSHI]
Morning, Saga.

57
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,375
Morning.

58
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,041
[EGEN]
Ashiya?

59
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,458
[ASHIYA]
Just ignore them!

60
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,750
[EGEN] If you can see me,
you're Ashiya, right?

61
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,791
Uh...

62
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,625
[EGEN]
That face tells me I'm correct.

63
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,833
I am Egen.

64
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,125
I wanted to thank you
for letting me come

65
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,541
to observe your school.

66
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,250
[ASHIYA]
Observe?

67
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,958
Oh! Right, right, I remember!

68
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,208
From last week!

69
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,333
[FEMALE CLASSMATE A]
From last week?

70
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,750
[ASHIYA]
Augh! I said that out loud!

71
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,291
Abeno!

72
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,666
I haven't seen you since last
week, hardly recognized you!

73
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,916
It's Monday.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,625
Most of us haven't
seen him since last week.

75
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,875
I see you're going
through the ol' textbook, there!

76
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,750
We do have a test
coming up soon!

77
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,166
I should probably study
for it myself, huh?

78
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,791
You got the right idea.

79
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,250
[ASHIYA] So this is the client
Abeno mentioned last week.

80
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,625
The one who came from the
Underworld to observe a school

81
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:26,750
in the Mundane World for,
what was it, three days?

82
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,666
Hey. Stop staring!

83
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,666
You guys see those bugs
flyin' around the room?

84
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,375
Heh.

85
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,625
[ABENO sighs]

86
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,208
[ASHIYA gasps]
Oh man, Abeno is so pissed off!

87
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,500
I gotta fix this
before he kills me.

88
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,791
[EGEN]
Excuse me. Abeno? Ashiya?

89
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,958
[EGEN] My presence here
may be a hindrance to you,

90
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,500
and for that I apologize.

91
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,708
But observing a school
in the Mundane World

92
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,666
is something I've wanted
to do for a while.

93
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,458
Believe me when I say
I will get the most out of it.

94
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,666
I'll absorb as much as possible,
and take notes on everything.

95
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,833
So I can start a school
where anybody can learn.

96
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,500
For that has always
been my dream.

97
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,500
[ASHIYA] So they're gathering
info to start their own school.

98
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,166
[EGEN]
But my goals are not so selfish!

99
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,125
I must make my dream
come true for all of those

100
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,333
who wish to pursue
higher education!

101
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,416
[ASHIYA]
All right!

102
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,875
I may have just
screwed up a bunch,

103
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,250
but I can make up for that!

104
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,458
I'll use my superior
communication skills

105
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,750
to be the perfect
guide for Egen!

106
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,375
G'morning class.

107
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,041
How is everyone today?

108
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,416
[CHEMISTRY TEACHER]
Let's review.

109
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,666
Atoms and molecules
have nuclei made

110
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,125
of a varying number
of protons and neutrons,

111
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,291
with electrons orbiting
around them in shells.

112
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,375
Those are the basics. Now...

113
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,666
[EGEN sighs]

114
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,541
[EGEN]
Ah! Amazing!

115
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,333
[ASHIYA] What about
this basic chemistry class

116
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,916
is so impressive?

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,333
[EGEN]
Every single one of the students

118
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:55,375
in this room can not only read,
but they can also write!

119
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,125
Superb, truly!

120
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,541
Not to mention how comprehensive
the materials are!

121
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,791
[SAGA]
I got a question.

122
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,458
This "knuckle" thing?

123
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,875
Am I saying that right?

124
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,125
Uh. What is it?

125
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,250
"NaCl"?
That's sodium chloride.

126
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,083
Salt.

127
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,041
[SAGA]
Just call it salt!

128
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,500
[EGEN]
So knowledgeable!

129
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,333
Fantastic instructors.

130
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,666
Wow!

131
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,458
Ah! I'm so envious of
this learning environment!

132
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,625
The big question on my mind
is how much it would cost

133
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,875
to create such an institution
back in the Underworld.

134
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,750
[ASHIYA] I didn't know
that having textbooks,

135
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,958
smart teachers, and the
ability to read and write

136
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,250
was such a big deal.

137
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,416
I guess I take
all that for granted.

138
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,125
What's wrong Ashiya?

139
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,125
Why have you been staring
at the ceiling for so long?

140
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,208
[ASHIYA]
I gotta stop looking at Egen!

141
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,916
[MALE CLASSMATE]
Watcha daydreaming about, buddy?

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,083
He was also caught
zoning out this morning!

143
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,833
Try keeping your eyes
on the textbook.

144
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,958
Uh. Sorry, will do.

145
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,458
Yes! He was sleeping!

146
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,833
Close call.

147
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,208
[LEGISLATOR] About the
beast Ashiya encountered

148
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,625
during his errand.

149
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,500
It was, without a
doubt, the Justice.

150
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,083
Did you truly not realize that?

151
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,958
I don't know about you,
but I can't list

152
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,708
more than a few yokai who
would dare enter the Birdcage.

153
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,125
Not to mention someone who would
do so in the form of a beast.

154
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,625
Well, maybe it wasn't
clicking because I was angry.

155
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,291
But when
I consider it now, yeah.

156
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,333
Since he was only
delivering a scroll.

157
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,833
I didn't think there were many
things that could go awry.

158
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,500
And I'd never have imagined
the Justice would appear.

159
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,583
It's entirely possible
that due to this encounter,

160
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,041
the Executive will
find out about Ashiya.

161
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,875
Heh. I was about to
suggest that you be careful,

162
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,541
but I can already tell
that you will be.

163
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,541
Turn to page 87.

164
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,208
Now I know some of you like
to selectively pay attention,

165
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,750
so let me warn you that this
next part will be on the test.

166
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,500
[ASHIYA]
"To Abeno.

167
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,541
I'm really sorry about earlier.

168
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,875
To make it up to you,

169
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,500
I'd like to show Egen
around the school myself.

170
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,458
Maybe take some
of the burden off of you!"

171
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, that sounds good!

172
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,458
He's still mad at me?

173
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,416
I know I shouldn't have talked
to Egen in front of the class,

174
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,125
but I played it off, didn't I?

175
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,416
And there's no way he
read my note that quick!

176
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,125
Guess who was able to snag
the last croquette bread!

177
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,041
Not that I want it,
but Saga does!

178
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,291
Did you get that just for me?

179
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,541
Thanks, man!

180
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,500
Wait.

181
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,541
[SAGA]
Uh... Where's Abeno?

182
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,625
[FUSSHI]
He was here when we left.

183
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,541
And we weren't
gone all that long.

184
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,416
[ASHIYA]
Huh.

185
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,125
Egen isn't here either.

186
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,166
[EGEN]
Abeno, sir.

187
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,250
Can you tell me
what this is, as well?

188
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,458
That's a place they
call the printing office.

189
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,708
Why?

190
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,416
[EGEN] And what's
the "printing office" for?

191
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,541
Huh?

192
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,583
So, uh...

193
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,125
Whatcha two doing?

194
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,125
Tch!

195
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,208
[ASHIYA]
I still couldn't find you

196
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,791
after I finished eating lunch.

197
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,416
You were hanging out up
here with Egen then, I take it?

198
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,291
You could have asked me
to help explain stuff too, man.

199
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, water under the bridge.

200
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,375
I could still give
a tour of the school--

201
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,291
[EGEN]
I'm sorry, Ashiya, was it?

202
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,833
Yes?

203
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,833
[EGEN]
I couldn't help but notice

204
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,500
you changed your clothing.

205
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,000
Why?

206
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:13,666
Oh, yeah.

207
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,750
I did!

208
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,791
We've got PE next,
so I kinda had to.

209
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:17,500
That's also why.

210
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,291
I came to get you.

211
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,708
Right, Abeno?

212
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,791
[EGEN]
PE?

213
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,958
Curious name.

214
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,875
What do you study in this "PE"?

215
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,375
You'll see.

216
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,208
But I promise you, it's the
most fun class we have here!

217
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,791
[EGEN]
Your most fun class?

218
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,250
[ASHIYA] You gotta
have PE at your school

219
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,500
in the Underworld, too!

220
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,916
[EGEN] I look forward
to observing this class,

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,500
and what makes it so fun!

222
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,166
Um, there's one more
thing I'm curious about.

223
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,875
Go ahead, ask away!

224
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,958
[EGEN]
You are also a human, correct?

225
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,291
That has nothing to do
with your school observation.

226
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,333
Why is he so tense?

227
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,125
[FUSSHI]
Didn't skip today.

228
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,458
It's pretty unusual to
see you out here with us.

229
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,750
Hello? Anybody home?

230
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,000
[EGEN] It's clear as day that
I angered Abeno up on the roof.

231
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,791
I'm lucky he didn't
cancel my observation.

232
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,375
But let's focus on
the positives!

233
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,708
I get to watch PE,

234
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,166
and Ashiya said it's the
most fun class they have!

235
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,666
I must learn all about it!

236
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,291
I won't let any
detail slip by me!

237
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,166
Abeno!

238
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,333
Guess we're on different teams.

239
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,041
No hard feelings, kay!

240
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,708
Hey, check it out!

241
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,541
We're on the
same team this time!

242
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,375
Oh. Yeah!

243
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,000
You can't ignore me now
that we're working together!

244
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,083
What's his problem today?

245
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,166
[EGEN] What are
they learning from this?

246
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,833
It just looks like
they're playing, to me.

247
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,791
Hmm...

248
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,625
I don't think we'll need this
in the Underworld's school

249
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,750
[SAGA]
Nice shot, Ashiya!

250
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,250
[ASHIYA]
All right!

251
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,333
[EGEN]
Huh?

252
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,875
[ASHIYA]
Hey, stop that!

253
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,250
[laughs]

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,250
[EGEN]
I see.

255
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,375
In PE, they learn how to
use not just their brains,

256
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,166
but their bodies, as well.

257
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,000
What a fun way to grow.

258
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,250
We'll definitely
be needing this!

259
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,666
It seems there are many
different ways to learn.

260
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,666
[PE TEACHER]
Fushimi! Abeno! Hustle!

261
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,458
I'm so sorry.

262
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,791
Please forgive me!

263
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,583
I was supposed to be
explaining things to you,

264
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,625
but I got too caught up in
playing a stupid game of soccer!

265
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,875
[EGEN]
Don't apologize.

266
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,083
I learned a lot
just from watching.

267
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,666
Are you sure it's okay?

268
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,416
Why don't I give you a
proper tour of the grounds

269
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,708
now that school's out?

270
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,041
Would that help?

271
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,708
[EGEN] Thank you,
but there's no need for that.

272
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,958
Huh?

273
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,625
Mononokean master,
Haruitsuki Abeno,

274
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,083
requesting a portal
to the Underworld.

275
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,750
Wait a second!

276
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,750
Was today the
last day of your trip?

277
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,208
[EGEN]
We started over the weekend,

278
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,333
so I got to walk around the
school when it was empty.

279
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,291
On the second day,
I explored other parts

280
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,833
of the Mundane World
with Abeno's supervision.

281
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,125
And to top it all off, I got to
witness an exorcism first hand!

282
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,875
[ASHIYA] I didn't know
there was work on Saturday.

283
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,958
What's that mean? If I didn't
show up to work, then I ditched,

284
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,166
but I was never
told to be there,

285
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,291
so how could I possibly ditch?

286
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,750
Did I ditch?
Did I ditch? Did I ditch?

287
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,958
Is that why Abeno's been
so angry with me all day?

288
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,500
Because I wasn't at work?

289
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,458
[EGEN]
Ashiya.

290
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,041
You don't look so good.

291
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,625
If there's a problem,

292
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,583
you should go to the place where
you can be healed of all things!

293
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,875
The nurse's office!

294
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,708
[ASHIYA] You are way
overestimating that place!

295
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,166
[EGEN]
I see.

296
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,333
So the nurse's office
cannot heal everything.

297
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,208
I'm glad I understand
better, now.

298
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,041
Even if it can't
remedy all ailments,

299
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,291
it's incredible that this school
has a place of healing at all.

300
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,916
This observation really has
been one surprise after another.

301
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,125
[EGEN] Instead of
studying a single subject

302
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,666
for the entire day,

303
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,166
you have set periods of time
dedicated to different subjects,

304
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,500
so you can study more at once.

305
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,000
I also discovered
that you can learn

306
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,708
not only while
sitting at a desk,

307
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:12,291
but also while exerting your
body, surrounded by your peers.

308
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,083
Schools in this world
really are amazing.

309
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,125
[ASHIYA]
To me, this is all normal.

310
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,666
But the only reason I can even
feel that way about school

311
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,625
is because there are
people just like Egen,

312
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:29,750
working hard to keep everything
running behind the scenes.

313
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,958
I'm all motivated!

314
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,041
Gotta study harder!

315
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay, Egen. Let's go.

316
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,291
[EGEN gasps]

317
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,375
I'm sorry, I got caught up
in our conversation.

318
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,916
Good luck!
See you again, soon!

319
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,166
[EGEN]
Thank you.

320
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,875
Goodbye.

321
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,916
Come to think of it.

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,708
How about I walk you partway?

323
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,500
[EGEN] My, that's very
considerate of you.

324
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,125
[ABENO]
Ashiya, you can go home now.

325
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,208
What? Why, I can come
with you, can't I--?

326
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,750
Abeno?

327
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,208
Is he still ignoring me?

328
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,583
[EGEN]
Ashiya?

329
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,125
Please, pay him no mind.

330
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,500
[EGEN] If you think
that's for the best.

331
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,875
So was your visit to a school
in the Mundane World

332
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,458
all you hoped it would be?

333
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,625
[EGEN]
Absolutely!

334
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,166
And thank you
for all of your help.

335
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,750
It was quite difficult
to get permission

336
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,791
to leave the Underworld,
even temporarily.

337
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,958
But it was well
worth all of that effort!

338
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,291
I couldn't see everything

339
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,666
I wanted to in just
three days, however.

340
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,916
Perhaps when we get
the opportunity, I can ask

341
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,208
you and Ashiya more about the
overall school experience--

342
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,500
Forgive me, but...

343
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,750
[EGEN]
Yes?

344
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,708
May I ask you a question
that's been on my mind?

345
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,666
[EGEN]
Of course, what is it?

346
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,583
[ABENO] How exactly
did you get permission

347
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,583
for this school observation?

348
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,458
[EGEN]
Um, by normal means.

349
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,333
Were you forced
to make a deal with someone?

350
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,291
Ordered to investigate
the Mononokean

351
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:25,541
in exchange for clearance
to go to the Mundane World?

352
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,125
By the Executive?

353
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,791
[EGEN gasps]

354
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:33,333
And more specifically,
to look into Ashiya?

355
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,958
[EGEN]
Do what?

356
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,375
No!

357
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,125
And there was no reason
why I asked if Ashiya is human.

358
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,291
I just happened to be curious!

359
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,416
Moreover, to suggest
that the mighty Executive

360
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,458
would ask a lowly
yokai such as myself

361
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,791
to investigate the Mononokean in
his stead is simply ridiculous!

362
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,666
Don't you think?

363
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,750
You said this was so you could
open up an Underworld school.

364
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,250
Was all of that talk
about your dream a lie?

365
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,333
[EGEN]
Not at all, that part was true!

366
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,625
"That part"? Seriously?

367
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,041
[EGEN]
Oh, no!

368
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,291
[ABENO]
What a bad liar.

369
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,875
[EGEN]
I'm such an utter fool!

370
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,958
The Executive won't be
happy my cover was blown.

371
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:08,875
[ABENO]
You're fine.

372
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,333
[EGEN]
Hmm?

373
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,958
Knowing the Executive,

374
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:15,041
he probably knew
I'd figure it out.

375
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,625
That bastard.

376
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,208
Oh, and just so you know,

377
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,791
I didn't actually think you lied
about wanting to see the school.

378
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,000
If I did get the
feeling you were lying,

379
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,416
I'd have exorcised
you on the first day.

380
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,208
[EGEN] At least you know
I wasn't lying about that.

381
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,833
It's as you suspected.

382
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:35,750
I was asked to investigate
the Mononokean by the Executive.

383
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:40,750
But to be clear, he didn't force
me to make a deal with him.

384
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,458
The Executive
has helped a great deal

385
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,500
with my plans to start a school,

386
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,291
so I accepted his request as
a way to repay that kindness.

387
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,458
Believe me.

388
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,375
He has not wronged
me in any manner.

389
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,541
[EGEN] I must go
report to the Executive

390
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,500
as soon as I'm able to.

391
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:02,041
Since I'm in a hurry, I'll
continue onwards on my own.

392
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,250
If you'll excuse me.

393
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,833
[ABENO]
Egen.

394
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,791
If you can believe it,
Ashiya didn't pick up on this.

395
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,333
He didn't suspect
anything of you,

396
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,333
and he certainly wasn't trying

397
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,250
to make you like
him or something.

398
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,916
You can report exactly
what you saw today.

399
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,666
However, if I can
ask you one thing,

400
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,708
it's that you don't tell
anyone but the Executive

401
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,416
that Ashiya is human.

402
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,541
Oh, and send him my regards.

403
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,291
[EGEN] If Abeno had told me
all of this on the first day,

404
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,916
then perhaps
I wouldn't have asked him

405
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,208
for so much during my time
spent visiting the school.

406
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:53,375
He must have waited until
now so I could learn more.

407
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,416
For my sake.

408
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,416
Wait.

409
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,291
The door is still here.

410
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,833
That's weird.

411
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,166
Does that mean Abeno's
coming back soon?

412
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,625
Hmm...

413
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,083
I can't just go home.

414
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,416
He's been pissed at me all day!

415
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,291
If I leave now,
it'll only get worse.

416
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,125
Hey. Stop staring!

417
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,500
[ASHIYA] That was
all he said to me today

418
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,000
until they were about to leave!

419
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,625
He never responded
when I talked to him,

420
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,000
and he avoided me
at every opportunity!

421
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,875
I thought he was mad
because I stared at Egen

422
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,125
when I got to class,
so I went out of my way

423
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,166
to be nice to him,
and look where that got me.

424
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,916
[EGEN] Today was the
third day of my observation.

425
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,625
[ASHIYA]
Man, he didn't even tell me

426
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,416
this gig started
over the weekend.

427
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,041
[yawns]

428
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,958
Are you mad at me because
I didn't work over the weekend?

429
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,583
I didn't mean to
not show up to work,

430
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,000
but you didn't tell me
Egen was coming

431
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,875
before the
school week started!

432
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,833
If you've got a problem with me,
or I'm doing something wrong,

433
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,000
tell me straight like
you usually do!

434
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,333
I know you're mad,

435
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,833
but that doesn't mean
you should just ignore me!

436
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:06,833
[ABENO]
Whoa, whoa.

437
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,208
Calm down,
I'm not mad at you, man.

438
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,750
Huh?

439
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,958
[ABENO] And I know I didn't
contact you over the weekend.

440
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,250
I didn't need you.

441
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,875
Hold on, if you're
not mad at me,

442
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,791
then why have you been
ignoring me all day?

443
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,583
You've barely spoken
two sentences to me,

444
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,375
and you kept avoiding me!

445
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,291
Don't creep
closer to me like that.

446
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,416
See? You've even avoiding
me as we speak!

447
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,666
[ABENO]
That doesn't make any sense!

448
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,416
You're just acting weird!

449
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,791
[ASHIYA]
Then why'd you dodge me all day?

450
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,875
Do I disgust you?

451
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,166
Dude, you gotta respond to that.

452
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,625
[ABENO] I guess I don't really
remember any conversations.

453
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,000
Did we really not talk all day?

454
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,583
You weren't aware of this?

455
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,791
So you didn't ignore
me on purpose?

456
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,666
You just didn't have
anything to say to me?

457
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,708
That's... probably the case.

458
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,625
[ASHIYA]
He subconsciously ignored me.

459
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,458
It wasn't because
I made you mad somehow?

460
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,083
There was no ill-will intended?

461
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,250
And here I was, desperately
trying to brighten the mood

462
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,833
because I thought you
didn't want to talk to me

463
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,708
because of
something stupid I did!

464
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,750
I thought it would make things
even more awkward between us

465
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,416
if I just ignored
you in response.

466
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,958
Do you have any idea
of stressed I was all day

467
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,500
because you wouldn't
say a word to me?

468
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,541
And now I find out you weren't
even doing it on purpose,

469
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,791
you're just
naturally anti-social?

470
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,166
You are such an idiot!

471
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:27,750
Hold on.

472
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:31,708
Did I just call Abeno an...

473
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,375
[shrieks]

474
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,416
[sighs]

475
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,958
That's true.

476
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,500
Guess you could say
that I am an idiot

477
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,416
for what I've been worrying
about over the past few days.

478
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,666
Huh?

479
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,708
What was that?

480
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,166
I didn't just hear you
lock that door, did I?

481
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,000
[ASHIYA] You can just
summon the Mononokean!

482
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,166
[ABENO]
What?

483
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,083
[ASHIYA] And by the way,
I didn't mean it.

484
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,208
You're not an idiot!

485
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,291
See ya tomorrow?

486
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,291
You've gotta be
kidding me, come back!

487
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,958
Unlock this door!

488
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,708
He actually went
home, didn't he?

489
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,416
I'll summon the Mononokean
after a quick nap.

490
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,416
I swear, he's got the social
graces of a five-year-old.

491
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,916
I'll get him back tomorrow.

492
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,416
But now that I think about it.

493
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,333
It'd make sense if it seemed
like I was ignoring him.

494
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,875
There was a yokai with us,

495
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,333
so I was already
watching who I spoke to.

496
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,500
And plus, there was that
whole thing with the Executive.

497
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,333
[gasps]

498
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,583
He's too unsuspecting.

499
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,208
[ABENO]
But maybe I'm overcautious.

500
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,708
[YAHIKO]
So bored!

501
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,166
Haruitsuki won't play with me.

502
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,250
Zenko's not home and
Ashiya's, Ashiya!

503
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,041
Ugh, come on!

504
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,000
I don't care who, but someone
better play with me real soon!

505
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,708
Next time, "The Mortar."

506
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,708
Ooo! Who are you?
