00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:41,442
[ASHIYA pants]

2
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:43,858
Fuzzy! Go around the other side!

3
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:52,692
[gasps]

4
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,983
Utakuni.

5
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,192
I understand that you
harbor regrets about your time

6
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:07,608
in this plane.

7
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:10,608
But you cannot stay in the
Mundane World any longer.

8
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:13,400
I ask you to prepare
to leave this place.

9
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:25,400
[ABENO] Allow me to exorcise
you, and I can promise this:

10
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:29,275
In the Underworld,
you won't be alone anymore.

11
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,442
How does that sound?

12
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,942
Mononokean master,
Haruitsuki Abeno,

13
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,025
requesting a portal
to the Underworld.

14
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,983
Safe travels!

15
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:03,567
[ABENO]
Ashiya.

16
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,150
[ASHIYA]
Yeah?

17
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,358
[ABENO]
Here's today's pay.

18
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:08,900
This is all you're giving me?

19
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:09,650
Huh?

20
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:10,983
[ASHIYA]
Come on, Abeno!

21
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,900
I may not have been able
to physically catch him.

22
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:15,317
But I worked my butt off
all day to corner him!

23
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I think that hustle
deserves more than change!

24
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,817
That "hustle" is the
entirety of your job.

25
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,775
You don't get a bonus
for not screwing up.

26
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,983
Do you want me to pay back
the debt I owe you or not?

27
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,233
Because you're
making it impossible!

28
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:26,900
Oh shut up.

29
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:29,025
We did what we came here
to do; the <i>yokai</i> 's exorcised.

30
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,900
Let's go.

31
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:35,858
Uh. I meant to
ask you something.

32
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:37,400
That <i>yokai</i> .

33
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,650
You told him he wouldn't be
alone in the Underworld, right?

34
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,192
[ABENO]
He's like the hairball.

35
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,233
Someone's poor pet
who passed away,

36
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:46,858
then quickly became a <i>yokai</i> .

37
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:50,442
Huh? Another one, huh?

38
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,067
Missed his owners so bad.

39
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,733
He'd possess everyone he saw.

40
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,858
Growing larger
and larger all the while.

41
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:59,817
If we'd waited much
longer to exorcise him,

42
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,983
he'd have gotten too big

43
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,067
to fit through the
door to the Underworld.

44
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,400
[ASHIYA]
Um. Abeno?

45
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,692
I have a favor to ask.

46
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,108
Fuzzy.

47
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,983
I think I'm balloon-ed out.

48
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,983
But we don't have
to stop playing yet,

49
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,025
we can do
something else.

50
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:26,108
Hang tight.

51
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:28,317
I'm just gonna
clean up the room first.

52
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:42,733
[chuckles]

53
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,733
He's all tuckered out.

54
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,525
[ASHIYA]
When Fuzzy became a <i>yokai</i> ,

55
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:50,358
he was just like the
one we exorcised today.

56
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:54,400
He stayed in the Mundane World,
hoping someone would notice him.

57
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:55,817
And by complete chance,

58
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,483
he ended up in the
company of two guys

59
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:00,150
who can see <i>yokai</i> ,
Abeno and I.

60
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,900
But most <i>yokai</i> aren't so lucky
and are all alone in our world.

61
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:08,567
It's because I met Fuzzy that
I became deep in debt to Abeno.

62
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,650
So now I'm working for him
to try and pay him back.

63
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:15,483
And trust me, this job has
put me through the ringer.

64
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,942
But it's because I know
how those <i>yokai</i> feel

65
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:20,025
that I want to keep
doing this job,

66
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:23,317
despite the craziness
that comes with it.

67
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,442
[ASHIYA'S MOM]
Hanae!

68
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:29,150
Hanae, time to wake up!

69
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,775
[ASHIYA]
Huh? Fuzzy?

70
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,817
Uh. Oh. That's right,

71
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,858
I asked Abeno to let me take
you home last night, didn't I?

72
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,192
Okay, Fuzzy, time to wake up.

73
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,942
All right.

74
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,025
I'm heading out.

75
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:46,817
[gasps]

76
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,858
Oh, sweetie?

77
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:49,358
What was all
that noise last night?

78
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:50,608
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

79
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,525
I noticed I've gained
some weight recently,

80
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:55,442
so I was just
exercising in my room!

81
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,942
With what? Gymnastics?

82
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:58,858
One second.

83
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,650
Hold still.

84
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,150
There was some lint
on your shoulder.

85
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:04,192
Oh.

86
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:05,817
Well, thanks for
catching that, then.

87
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,317
You're the best, Mom!

88
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,192
You're so jumpy, you're not
feeling sick again, are you?

89
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,775
Are kids at school
still calling you

90
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:12,858
"the kid from the
nurse's office."

91
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,275
Wait, where did
you hear that nickname?

92
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:15,192
I never told you!

93
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,567
But no, I feel fine!

94
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,983
Don't worry about me.
I'm as healthy as can be!

95
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,192
What?

96
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,817
Japanese rowan.

97
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,233
In flower, they mean
"I'm watching over you."

98
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,608
Come on!

99
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:28,567
Do you have to express
everything through flowers?

100
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,775
Anyway, I gotta go!

101
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,733
Stay out of trouble. 'Kay?

102
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:36,233
It totally feels
like summer now.

103
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:44,692
[TEACHER] Well, summer vacation
is right around the corner,

104
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:46,942
and since this is your
first as high schoolers.

105
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,317
I've got some advice.

106
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,442
It's never too early
to start planning.

107
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,692
You wouldn't want to waste
your precious time off.

108
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:53,900
Take me for example.

109
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:55,650
I'm already planning
my family trip.

110
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,900
I was thinking of going
camping in the mountains,

111
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,900
but my daughter says
she wants to go to the beach!

112
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:02,275
She's so cute
I can never say no to her.

113
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,067
[FEMALE STUDENT]
See you tomorrow.

114
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,567
[MALE STUDENT]
Later.

115
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,608
[ASHIYA]
I wonder where Abeno is.

116
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:15,067
He didn't say anything
about having work today.

117
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,567
Well, I should probably
still bring Fuzzy back--

118
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,025
[FUSSHI]
Yo, Ashiya!

119
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,067
[ASHIYA]
Oh, hey, Fusshi. Hey, Saga.

120
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,317
You doin' okay, man?

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,817
I saw you staring
at your shoulder there.

122
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,650
[ASHIYA] It's been stiff
since I woke up this morning!

123
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,192
You think we'll ever
get out of class on time?

124
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,150
Not with our teacher.

125
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:35,400
You guys wanna hit up
the convenience store?

126
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,275
I'm always down for ice cream!

127
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:38,483
Sorry, I can't.

128
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,358
There's somewhere
I need to go today.

129
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,650
Huh?

130
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:47,483
[ASHIYA shrieks]

131
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,442
[SAGA]
What?

132
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,275
[FUSSHI]
Are you okay, man?

133
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:52,858
Yeah, I'm fine. Uhh...

134
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:53,567
Whoa!

135
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,108
What's that behind you?

136
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:56,192
Anyway, see ya, bye!

137
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,233
[SAGA, FUSSHI]
Uh...

138
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:58,317
Can you not connect
the Mononokean

139
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,733
to the classroom door
without warning?

140
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:03,108
And where have you been?
In here sipping on tea all day?

141
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,608
[ASHIYA]
SOS?

142
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:08,275
What? Was there an accident?

143
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:09,692
Do we have a new case?
What's the deal?

144
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:10,817
Alcohol.

145
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,817
[ASHIYA]
What does that mean?

146
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,025
Did someone drink
themselves sick?

147
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:13,942
How much should I worry?

148
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,650
Probably not at all, in fact.

149
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:16,983
Also, volume.

150
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,192
[ASHIYA] Wait, don't tell
me it's the Mononkean--

151
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:20,025
[ABENO]
Decrease, not increase.

152
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,150
Look at the bottom.

153
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,525
[ASHIYA]
SOS.

154
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:26,400
With a chance of clouds?

155
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:27,608
Mononokean.

156
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:29,817
What does that
mark at the end mean?

157
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:36,900
Knew I could count on you.

158
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,608
If I remember correctly,

159
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,942
the Legislator is one of the top
three figures in the Underworld.

160
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,733
The one I met before.

161
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:44,525
[gasps]

162
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,025
So if this is his seal,

163
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,192
that means something
bad happened to him, right?

164
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,567
[ABENO]
Likely just a hangover.

165
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,233
[ASHIYA]
Me, too?

166
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:54,900
What does he expect?

167
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:57,442
Does he want us to nurse him
back to health, or what?

168
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,858
All I know is
we don't have to go.

169
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,150
[ASHIYA] You'd just
leave him hanging like that?

170
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:04,192
[ABENO] A guy like him
could easily get someone else

171
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:05,442
to take care of him.

172
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,150
[ASHIYA] It could be
a really bad hangover.

173
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,817
My! Hello there, come in.

174
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,108
We've been expecting you.

175
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,692
I am grateful you made
the journey here.

176
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:40,775
So this is what
the inside looks like.

177
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:43,567
Man, when I was here before,
I only saw the outside.

178
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,442
Enough gawking.

179
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:46,733
[LEGISLATOR'S SERVANT]
Mr. Legislator.

180
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,275
The young Master
of the Mononokean

181
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:51,608
and his employee are here
to see you, as requested.

182
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,275
[LEGISLATOR]
Send them in.

183
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:06,983
I'll be taking my leave now.

184
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,317
Legislator?

185
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,358
Aren't you hurt?

186
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,858
Sure am.

187
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:20,733
You came at just
the right time, Itsuki!

188
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:23,567
Do me a favor and refill
my pipe with tobacco.

189
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,108
It's such a bother
with only one hand.

190
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,108
He broke his arm?

191
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:32,025
This is broken, huh?

192
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,483
[LEGISLATOR]
Yes, I think so.

193
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,775
He's using his full grip
strength on an arm in a cast!

194
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:38,525
The tobacco, if you would?

195
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:39,817
I wouldn't.

196
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,525
[ASHIYA] Legislator,
what happened to your arm?

197
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,733
Also, you shouldn't
smoke if you're injured.

198
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:47,067
I mean, it's bad for humans at
least, I don't know about you.

199
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,650
Listen to this sweetheart!

200
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,483
He's showing more concern
for me than you are, Itsuki.

201
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,858
Even a master can learn
from their employees.

202
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:55,483
Now, I know this
may be embarrassing,

203
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,733
but perhaps you should
act more like him.

204
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,025
Coming from the guy

205
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,233
who sends out an SOS
every time he's hungover.

206
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:03,692
You realize this
interrupts my work, right?

207
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,567
Perhaps you should take
your own advice and think about

208
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,317
how your actions affect those
around you, O great Legislator.

209
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,025
So talkative today.

210
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:12,358
Are you angry with me?

211
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:13,900
You lied about a serious injury,

212
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,650
so we could stuff
your tobacco pipe!

213
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,067
This is a serious injury.

214
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,400
Honest.

215
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:21,400
Despite that, I'm still
lucky to have gotten away

216
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:23,525
with nothing worse,
all things considered.

217
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:27,067
I wasn't exactly prepared to be
attacked as abruptly as I was.

218
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,483
You were attacked?

219
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:31,150
Don't tell me someone was
trying to assassinate you!

220
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,108
It was dreadful,
I'll leave it at that.

221
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,233
[ABENO]
Liquor and women?

222
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,067
Uh! To be fair,

223
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,817
she didn't know she'd
be a violent drunk.

224
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,442
And afterwards she actually
apologized to me.

225
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,150
Isn't that adorable?

226
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,400
Anyway, as you can see,

227
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,817
the altercation
resulted in this cast.

228
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,192
I simply cannot make any
progress on my work now.

229
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,858
Which is why...

230
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,858
...I called you
here to lend me hand.

231
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,025
So will you?

232
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:01,317
[ABENO]
Ask your own employees to help.

233
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,858
I would,

234
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:05,400
but I can't very well let them
know I've been slacking off,

235
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:07,358
now can I?
I'd be in deep trouble.

236
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:08,692
[ASHIYA]
I'm starting to think

237
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,983
you didn't really
break your arm.

238
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,317
I don't know what I'll do

239
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,275
if you two won't help me,
I've run out of options.

240
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:18,150
Besides, I'm not
asking you to work for free.

241
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:23,317
Consider it a time-sensitive
job for the Mononokean.

242
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,817
Does this pay seem fair to you?

243
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,775
Obviously you'd
split it into thirds

244
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,608
with Ashiya and the hairball.

245
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:31,317
Ah! I'd get a third of that?

246
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,567
[ABENO] This fat cat just
grabbed a wad of cash

247
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,358
out of the drawer
without looking, didn't he?

248
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:37,483
We'd be crazy
not to take this job!

249
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,400
[ABENO] He's just trying
to take advantage of us!

250
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:40,817
Who cares,

251
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,400
if it gets me that much
closer to paying off my debt!

252
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:45,067
I don't plan to stop working for
you but I want to pay you back!

253
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,567
[LEGISLATOR]
That's the spirit, Ashiya.

254
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,817
Good boy.

255
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,692
Even if Abeno refuses,
I can do it by myself!

256
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,150
[ABENO]
This guy.

257
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:54,608
And he's not gonna quit even
after paying off his debt?

258
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,858
[LEGISLATOR]
Anything would be a huge help.

259
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,525
What say you, Itsuki?

260
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,108
You say yes!

261
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:08,858
[LEGISLATOR] I need you
to get through all of this...

262
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:10,608
...by today.

263
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:13,150
[ABENO, ASHIYA]
Now the SOS makes more sense.

264
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,358
Hey, Legislator?

265
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:27,608
I was wondering.

266
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,400
What's this scroll that
I'm stamping now for?

267
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:31,192
Nothing you need to worry about.

268
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:32,900
It's better if you don't know.

269
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:34,483
What's that supposed to mean?

270
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:35,858
Let me put it this way,

271
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,900
it's something that'll
be a problem if you mess up.

272
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,483
[ASHIYA] What kind of
problem are we talkin' here?

273
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:44,858
You can come in.

274
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:47,317
[SHIZUKU]
But don't you have guests over?

275
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,650
[LEGISLATOR]
It's fine.

276
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,442
Well, if you say so.

277
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:52,942
How's your hand doing?

278
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:54,317
It's Shizuku!

279
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,733
Oh. No way!

280
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,525
Didn't expect to see you guys.

281
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:00,192
Did you come to visit my brother
while he's recovering?

282
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,858
That's one way to put it.

283
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,233
Ow. It hurts.

284
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:06,900
Actually, we were sent an SOS.

285
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:08,900
By who? My brother?

286
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,567
Ah! Give me a break!

287
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,608
I thought you told me you were
done with all of your work!

288
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,108
[LEGISLATOR]
Well, I knew you'd yell at me

289
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:18,900
if I told you the truth.

290
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,108
Though I enjoy any time spent
with you, yelling or not.

291
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:24,858
And I can't believe
you're this behind, too!

292
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,150
[ABENO] Why don't
you jump out the window

293
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,400
and really break your arm,

294
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,608
so you have an excuse
if we don't finish this?

295
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:31,942
I keep telling you,
it's broken, probably.

296
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:33,817
[ABENO]
Forget it, just stop slacking.

297
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,025
I'm not used to signing my name

298
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,442
with my left hand,
it's very tiring.

299
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:39,150
I'm taking a quick break.

300
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,483
Look how squiggly my writing is.

301
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:42,942
[ABENO]
Does it even matter?

302
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,192
Would you take over?

303
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,400
I can't legally sign your name.

304
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,442
You can if no one finds out.

305
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:50,983
Technically Ashiya shouldn't
be stamping my seal either,

306
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,608
but he's willing--

307
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:53,608
Uh oh.

308
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,608
I'm screwed.

309
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:57,025
What happened?

310
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:59,483
[ASHIYA] Whoa, that's a
twisted expression on his face!

311
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:00,942
Is he pissed or excited?

312
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,567
[SHIZUKU]
What's the problem, Ashiya?

313
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,317
Well, uh...

314
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,983
I just noticed this.

315
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:09,233
But I stamped a seal
in the wrong direction.

316
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,900
Oh. Just once? That's fine.

317
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:14,525
You serious? What a relief.

318
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:15,733
[ABENO]
Tch!

319
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,858
[ASHIYA] Did he just
click his tongue at me?

320
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:19,067
[sighs]

321
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,108
I'm all jittery from that scare.

322
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,483
Let's take a break Abeno,
I need it.

323
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,317
[LEGISLATOR]
Let's all take a break.

324
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,192
[ABENO]
Weren't you already on one?

325
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:30,150
How many more times do I have
to stamp this stupid seal?

326
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,108
[LEGISLATOR]
Dunno.

327
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:32,358
[SHIZUKU]
Hey, bro?

328
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:35,067
I'll get back to it
once I finish this pipe.

329
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,192
Look it.

330
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,733
[LEGISLATOR]
Hmm...

331
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,067
Well, that is a problem.

332
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,108
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

333
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,733
Ashiya, you're fired
from stamp duty.

334
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,733
Huh?

335
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,983
What'd you do?

336
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,150
And in your place,

337
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,983
I appoint Shizuku
to be the new stamper.

338
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,025
I've got a new job for you.

339
00:15:59,108 --> 00:15:59,983
Me?

340
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:00,858
What?

341
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:02,067
I'd like you to take this scroll

342
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,275
to the Executive's place
as soon as possible.

343
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:07,817
[ASHIYA] I've never met
the Executive before.

344
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,942
If I remember right,
like the Legislator,

345
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:12,567
he's one of the leaders
of the Underworld.

346
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,858
[ABENO] Let me guess, that's one
of the Executive's scrolls then?

347
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,108
That's right.

348
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:20,192
It looks it got mixed up
with mine by accident.

349
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:22,525
Since Ashiya's not familiar
with this whole process,

350
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:26,233
he mistook it for one of mine
and stamped my seal on it.

351
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,900
Tell him I said.

352
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:30,233
"I accidentally stamped
my seal on your scroll!

353
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:32,608
No idea how it happened.
Sorry!"

354
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,900
And "also, I'm seriously
injured, so come visit me!"

355
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:38,400
Repeat that word for word
and give him the scroll.

356
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:39,400
[ASHIYA]
Word for word?

357
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,733
It's so casual!

358
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:43,150
[ABENO] Got any more BS
you want him to remember?

359
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,733
I do!

360
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:46,900
Make sure to say, "My deadline
is tomorrow, isn't it?" Heh heh.

361
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:49,900
You're extending your
own deadline by a day?

362
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:52,608
Won't I take the heat for
being the one to say all that?

363
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,067
[LEGISLATOR]
No, you'll be fine.

364
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,108
It's not so simple as having the
Mononkean connect to his door,

365
00:16:58,192 --> 00:17:00,275
it can't enter the
Executive's territory.

366
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:01,692
[LEGISLATOR]
I'm aware.

367
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,067
I guess we could have it take us

368
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,358
as close as possible
and walk from there.

369
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,775
Take "us"?

370
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,692
Don't you mean "him"?
I need you to stay here with me.

371
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,400
There's still work to do.

372
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:14,275
For real? I'm supposed
to go there by myself?

373
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:17,025
I'll have one of the tadpole
lines take you to him.

374
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:19,692
So you don't have to worry
about getting lost on your way.

375
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:22,192
[ASHIYA]
How are tadpoles gonna help?

376
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,275
Is chaperoning some
baby frogs supposed make me

377
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:25,733
feel better or something?

378
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:27,067
Because it doesn't!

379
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,442
Come on, Abeno,

380
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:31,358
you can't let me wander
around the Underworld alone!

381
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,733
I have a record, remember?

382
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:37,067
[ABENO sighs]

383
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,525
Itsuki stays here.

384
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:40,900
So it won't do you
any good to plead with him.

385
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:43,692
Then why don't I go with him?
I'd be happy to.

386
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,733
Because you're on
stamp duty, so you can't.

387
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,900
The hairball?

388
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:00,858
Hm. I appoint
the little one here.

389
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:01,858
[ASHIYA]
Huh?

390
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:03,692
[ABENO]
Wait, appoint him to what?

391
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,233
To be Ashiya's guard
on his excursion.

392
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:07,108
[gasps]

393
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:08,608
Allow me to translate.

394
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,275
The hairball said, "If you need
someone to protect Ashiya,

395
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,858
then I'm your <i>yokai</i> ."

396
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,025
I'll make sure he reaches

397
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:15,983
the Executive's
place safe and sound.

398
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:17,817
Just leave it to me.

399
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,942
Quite the reliable one,
isn't he?

400
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,608
You saved me Fuzzy!

401
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:22,983
[ABENO] I get the feeling
we can't completely

402
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,150
trust that translation.

403
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,608
I'm glad we've come
to an understanding.

404
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:30,067
Send my warmest regards.

405
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:56,483
[pants]

406
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,233
We're finally on something
resembling a path.

407
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:01,108
Hope I didn't get
these clothes dirty.

408
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:02,692
They're borrowed,
so I gotta be careful.

409
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,900
[bubbly sound]

410
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:06,025
[squeak]

411
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:09,108
[LEGISLATOR]
Ashiya? Ashiya?

412
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,275
Can you hear me?

413
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,650
[ASHIYA]
Uhh, sorta!

414
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,858
[LEGISLATOR]
Where are you right now?

415
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,400
Describe your surrroundings.

416
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:16,983
"Surroundings."

417
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:20,067
I just came off of a game trail
and now I'm on a narrow path.

418
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:25,067
[ASHIYA] Sorry I can't
describe it any better.

419
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,275
How much further do you
think I have left to go?

420
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:30,025
Just keep walking
along that path,

421
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:32,483
and you'll reach
the Birdcage soon.

422
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:33,650
[ASHIYA]
Birdcage?

423
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,442
[LEGISLATOR]
Where the Executive resides.

424
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,817
One more thing,

425
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
Itsuki expressed concern
that you may lose track

426
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,692
of the scroll as you
make your way there.

427
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:46,983
Did you drop it?

428
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,192
No, of course I didn't!

429
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:50,692
I have the thing tied
around my neck!

430
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,692
Hello?

431
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,025
Legislator?

432
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,233
Can you still hear me?

433
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,067
[ASHIYA]
We got disconnected.

434
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,567
[rustling]

435
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,858
[shrieks]

436
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:05,983
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

437
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:06,775
What was that sound?

438
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:08,817
I know I heard something!

439
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:11,942
[ASHIYA]
A bird.

440
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,650
Well, this is a forest.

441
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,192
So that checks out.

442
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,275
[ASHIYA]
I've got my own personal guard.

443
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:22,567
And my guide tadpole!

444
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,775
So I'm not alone.

445
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:24,483
I'll be fine!

446
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,983
Just fine.

447
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:27,817
[shrieks]

448
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,692
Don't just climb all
over me like that, Fuzzy!

449
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:43,692
Can you hear me now?

450
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:44,650
Legislator?

451
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:45,358
Abeno?

452
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:46,442
Anyone with ears!

453
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,858
SOS!

454
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:51,275
I guess it's no use.

455
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:53,192
It's hard to get a good
reception around there.

456
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:54,858
This was bound to happen.

457
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:55,983
Uh...

458
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,817
[ABENO]
Hmm...

459
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,400
I can tell that you're worried.

460
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,275
What gave you that idea?

461
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,108
[sighs]

462
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:07,483
I'm not worried.

463
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,317
I just hope he doesn't
cause any trouble this time.

464
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,983
The guy's my employee;
I'm responsible.

465
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,067
All right!

466
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,858
Who goes there?

467
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,525
Don't move a muscle!

468
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:23,650
[ASHIYA]
Uh, nevermind. Uh...

469
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,775
[sighs]

470
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:27,650
Sorry.

471
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,692
Didn't mean to startle you.

472
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:34,983
Just another bird, huh?

473
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,733
It scared me.

474
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:39,650
Well, "bird" is a bit
of an understatement.

475
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,567
It sounded more imposing
than that at first, though.

476
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,608
Guess it was
just my imagination.

477
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:54,692
[slurps]

478
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:36,150
[ASHIYA] All I wanted was to
come check on the Legislator

00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,275
