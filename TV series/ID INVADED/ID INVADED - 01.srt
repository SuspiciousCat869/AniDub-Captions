00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:52,692
[SAKAIDO]
Huh?

00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:11,233
[screaming]

4
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:18,442
The hell is this?
What happened to me?

5
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,025
[SAKAIDO (M1)] How did I
get broken into pieces?

6
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:21,192
Does this mean I'm dead?

7
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,400
[SAKAIDO (M2)]
Is this what death is like?

8
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:23,608
[SAKAIDO (M1)]
I feel like I'm alive, but--

9
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:24,983
[SAKAIDO (M2)]
But how can I be alive?

10
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,275
I've been chopped into bits.

11
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:28,733
[SAKAIDO (M1)]
Who am I?

12
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,775
--[SAKAIDO (M2)] Who am I?
--[SAKAIDO (M1)] Who am I?!

13
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:34,733
[SAKAIDO (M2)]
I've got no clue.

14
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:37,692
Don't even know my own name.

15
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:39,067
[SAKAIDO]
Shit!

16
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:08,983
[SAKAIDO] I'm in pieces,
but they're connected.

17
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:12,650
Was I broken just so I could
put myself back together?

18
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,733
Who would do that to me?

19
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:17,108
I'm making too many assumptions.

20
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:19,858
For all I know,
I came apart on my own.

21
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:22,150
I can't even be sure that
putting myself back together

22
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,108
is the right thing to do.

23
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,900
[SAKAIDO]
No, this is right.

24
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:30,483
I'm not supposed
to be in pieces.

25
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,192
[SAKAIDO]
Well, it isn't perfect,

26
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,650
but I seem to be more
or less functional.

27
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,483
At least for now.

28
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,233
[SAKAIDO]
What's with this place?

29
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,192
[yells]

30
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,567
[SAKAIDO] "I'm in pieces,
but they're connected."

31
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,233
There's a thought to cling to.

32
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,692
Hang on.

33
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:39,483
I'd better not be expected
to rebuild this whole world.

34
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,567
Couldn't even complete myself.

35
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,317
[SAKAIDO] There I go making
assumptions again.

36
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,233
Is it ridiculous to think
that I've been given

37
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:54,525
a role to play in this world?

38
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,483
[SAKAIDO]
'Scuse me!

39
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,525
Sorry to bother you, but could
ya tell me where we are?

40
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:06,442
Hey! D'ya hear me?

41
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,233
Look, I just have
some questions.

42
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:11,900
Like how did this world end up
getting smashed into pieces?

43
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:45,108
[SAKAIDO] To me, it's not right
that this world is in pieces.

44
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:47,525
Any more than it was
right when I was.

45
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:50,150
The word broken comes to mind.

46
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:11,442
[SAKAIDO]
I don't know if there's a point

47
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:13,983
to using the door
in a world like this,

48
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,108
but hey, why not?

49
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,192
That's Kaeru.

50
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:47,067
[SAKAIDO] I don't know this
girl, but I do know her name.

51
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,400
It's Kaeru.

52
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:53,233
And somehow, seeing her
and remembering her name

53
00:06:53,317 --> 00:06:55,650
has helped me to remember
more about myself.

54
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:59,858
I know my name too now.
It's Sakaido.

55
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,650
[SAKAIDO]
Still don't know my full name,

56
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,483
but that's irrelevant.

57
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,567
All that matters is this:

58
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,483
I do have a part to
play in this world.

59
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,442
I'm the brilliant detective.

60
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:15,067
And I'm here to solve the
mystery of Kaeru's death.

61
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:32,025
Inspector Momoki, it looks
like Sakaido's awake now.

62
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:35,775
So he finally survived
the fall into the bedroom.

63
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,150
How's the id well?

64
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,650
[TOGO]
It's stable, sir.

65
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:41,442
Good. You'll all be
assigned as follows.

66
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:44,983
Macro analysis: Togo,
assisted by Kokufu.

67
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:48,983
Times and places: Shiratake.
Human analysis: Habutae.

68
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,733
And Wakashika will try
to make deductions

69
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:52,192
about the murder.

70
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,025
This battle's just beginning,

71
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:56,900
and it won't end until
Sakaido solves the case.

72
00:07:56,983 --> 00:07:58,733
Till then, we'll scour
everything we see

73
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,983
for details about
the Perforator.

74
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,983
Remember that this is the
world of his drive to kill.

75
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,275
Everything has meaning.

76
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,567
[ALL]
Sir!

77
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,192
[SAKAIDO] Not only was the door
locked from the inside,

78
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,067
the window was as well.

79
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,442
She can't have stabbed
herself in the chest. Heh.

80
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:22,442
This isn't a period drama.

81
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:25,150
It's a classic
locked room mystery.

82
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:32,233
[SAKAIDO] Or it would be if
the room wasn't missing a wall.

83
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:33,858
What do I do now?

84
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:37,483
Puzzles are meant to be solved.
I can assume that much.

85
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,192
And something tells
me that my left arm

86
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,650
is still like this for a reason.

87
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,650
[TOGO]
Sakaido is on the move.

88
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:59,108
He's entering a room.

89
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:02,525
Let's expect a data surge.
Everyone be ready.

90
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:16,358
Well, this is interestin.
All the books appear to be real.

91
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:17,650
Any rare volumes?

92
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,150
A fair number of them are
out of print at least.

93
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,983
I can't see any rare enough

94
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,317
that would allow us
to track an individual.

95
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,442
Habutae, who's in the pictures?

96
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,150
[HABUTAE]
Beginning analysis.

97
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:33,192
[SAKAIDO] Is this the
family that lives here?

98
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:35,442
[HABUTAE] They're all actors
or pro tennis players.

99
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:37,650
Successful enough
to be known to most.

100
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,483
Odds are, the killer's
only aware of them

101
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,317
through TV and the internet.

102
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,567
That said, with a framed
picture taken in that style,

103
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,567
you'd assume these people
were friends or family.

104
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,275
In the real world,
you'd be right.

105
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:52,067
But the id well is a product
of the unconscious mind.

106
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,650
Anything goes in there.
Logic takes a backseat.

107
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,442
[TOGO]
Look at this calendar.

108
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,317
The dates and days of
the week match up perfectly.

109
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,983
That's just what March
of 2019 looked like.

110
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:05,775
Why would someone recall that?

111
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:08,567
There's a lot of variation
in human memory.

112
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,150
Could something significant
have happened during that month?

113
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,983
There's no telling as of yet.

114
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:14,150
Exactly.

115
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,608
When drawing information
from the id well,

116
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:18,192
we should avoid
jumping to conclusions.

117
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,025
All information is valuable,

118
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:23,192
but we needn't assign meaning
to everything we find.

119
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:26,525
Meaning will rise to the
surface on its own in time.

120
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,108
[HONDOMACHI]
The id well.

121
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:36,400
I can't believe that such
detailed knowledge and memories

122
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:39,400
can be hidden in a world formed
out of murderous impulse.

123
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:41,817
Try to focus, okay, Hondomachi?

124
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,567
Look at how the well-side
staff do their work.

125
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,983
Understood, Mr. Matsuoka.

126
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:50,192
But just to be sure
I'm following,

127
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,692
that image in the
center of the room

128
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,442
was generated by
the Mizuhanome, right?

129
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:57,608
It's the world of this
Perforator's urge to kill?

130
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:58,942
[MATSUOKA]
Yes.

131
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,275
As of this moment,

132
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,983
we've located five of
the Perforator's victims.

133
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,483
At the scene of
each of his crimes,

134
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,900
we collected his
cognition particles.

135
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:08,483
It's odd.

136
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,483
Trepanation is such a precise,
meticulous method of killing.

137
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:15,358
Yet his drive to kill created
this chaotic, jigsaw world.

138
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,942
[MATSUOKA]
There is a disconnect.

139
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,483
But that happens.

140
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:22,442
Method does not define motive.
The urge to kill is primal.

141
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,025
Conscious thought
about how to kill

142
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:27,192
comes from a whole different
part of the psyche.

143
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,983
I'm curious about what it would
be like to go inside a well.

144
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:30,650
You?

145
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,150
[MATSUOKA]
Hell no.

146
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,942
You can only enter an id well
if you've killed someone.

147
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,858
Furthermore, it takes
a special aptitude

148
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:39,817
to perform as the
brilliant detective.

149
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,942
Huh?

150
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:42,150
[MATSUOKA]
Think about it.

151
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,525
As you said, that world
is the manifestation

152
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:46,817
of a murderer's drive to kill.

153
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,567
For a detective to do well
in that type of setting,

154
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,025
they've gotta have
some loose screws.

155
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:53,983
[TOGO]
That calendar was a lucky break.

156
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,317
The letters are faint,

157
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,067
but it definitely bears
the name "Fujita's Wares."

158
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,150
It looks like there's
an address as well.

159
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,275
[MOMOKI]
Matsuoka.

160
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:02,858
[HONDOMACHI]
Got the address!

161
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:05,192
[MATSUOKA] Then it's time for us
field analysts to get to work.

162
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,483
Let's go.

163
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:08,858
[MOMOKI]
Heads up.

164
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:11,358
This next room
has people inside.

165
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:17,108
Hello. I'm coming in.

166
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:20,317
A visitor, huh?

167
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,567
Hello, sir.

168
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,817
You're welcome here.
Make yourself at home.

169
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,067
Do come in.

170
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,317
I believe you're
our first visitor.

171
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,483
[SAKAIDO]
I see.

172
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,608
So all of you live
here, that right?

173
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:31,858
Yeah.

174
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:34,358
We are family.

175
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:36,400
Kenta Obara. Wataru Takada.

176
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:40,358
Eiko Imanishi. Yoshito Fujita.
Masami Kitamura.

177
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:43,025
Those five match. They're
victims of the Perforator.

178
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,442
I'm looking up the last two!

179
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:45,983
Man, that's sick.

180
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:48,358
He's forcing all of his victims
to stay under the same roof

181
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:50,275
and make believe like
they're a family?

182
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:51,567
Don't lose your head.

183
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,692
This is just a product
of his psyche.

184
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,733
Though I do believe
it has significance.

185
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,733
Hey, Inspector, I got facial
matches for the last two guys

186
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,733
in the database
of missing persons.

187
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:04,858
Yuji Oonuki and Haruka Kazuta.

188
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:07,358
So then, are those
two already dead?

189
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:08,358
We don't know that.

190
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:09,858
She's right.

191
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:13,150
The report for Yuji Oonuki
wasn't filed until yesterday.

192
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,192
And from what we know
about the Perforator,

193
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:16,900
he tends to keep
his victims confined

194
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:19,358
for several days
before killing them.

195
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:21,608
So these guys may well be alive.

196
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:23,067
[HABUTAE]
Um.

197
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,525
Look, I didn't initially
recognize this image as a face,

198
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:29,233
and I don't think
Sakaido noticed it either,

199
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:31,400
but I see someone's reflection.

200
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:33,317
I'll send you the image now.

201
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,192
[gasps]

202
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:44,650
[MOMOKI]
John Walker. Can't be.

203
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:47,692
This guy had contact
with John Walker, too?

204
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:55,483
[OONUKI'S MOM crying]

205
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,358
Yeah, I just got confirmation.

206
00:13:57,442 --> 00:13:59,775
She confirmed his
identity for us.

207
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,775
The young man with the missing
mouth was Yuji Oonuki.

208
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:04,275
[MATSUOKA]
That "Fujita's Wares" place

209
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:05,942
off the calendar is closed.

210
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,525
The building's vacant.

211
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:11,483
But we're just 15 minutes from
the Oonuki residence on foot.

212
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:15,025
We'll retrace the steps Oonuki
took on the day of his abduction

213
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:17,317
and look out for any
cognition particles.

214
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
[MOMOKI]
Good.

215
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,400
It's possible that
you'll be entering

216
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,067
the Perforator's hunting ground.

217
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,400
Exercise extreme caution.

218
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,692
You know that I can
drive, right?

219
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:29,108
Just because you
have your license

220
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:31,567
doesn't mean I'm
letting a rookie drive.

221
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,983
Now focus.

222
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,650
You need to keep your eyes
trained on the Wakumusubi.

223
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:37,567
[HONDOMACHI]
The Wakumusubi.

224
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,983
It's strange.

225
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:40,108
To think that this machine

226
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:42,983
can glean a person's
murderous intent.

227
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,358
So, uh,

228
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:47,858
you know how "ido" is the
Japanese word for well?

229
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:50,317
I was thinking, if we call
these otherworlds

230
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
the Mizuhanome
creates "id wells,"

231
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:55,650
is that like a bilingual dad
joke or just a coincidence?

232
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,567
It isn't just a dad
joke. It's fate.

233
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,275
How do you mean?

234
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,150
[MATSUOKA] The kanji for
"ido" can also mean

235
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,775
"other" and "earth."

236
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:05,942
Put those together, and...

237
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:07,358
[HONDOMACHI]
You get "otherworld."

238
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:11,067
When words intersect in
that many ways, ya use 'em.

239
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,692
[MAN C]
So who is this girl?

240
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:16,317
[WOMAN A]
I've never seen her before.

241
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,942
[MAN D] She certainly isn't
a member of our family.

242
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:22,442
She's a visitor. Barged in
the same way you did.

243
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:26,233
Is it okay to come in uninvited
just 'cause the door's unlocked?

244
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:27,900
Of course it's not okay.

245
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:29,108
[OONUKI]
That said,

246
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,275
you think there's something
wrong with her?

247
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:33,817
[MAN D]
Hmm. Yeah, you're right.

248
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,192
It's more like there's something
wrong with this freaky world,

249
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:37,775
if you ask me.

250
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,150
[SAKAIDO] Silly of me to
think that these people

251
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,233
would question the
world they live in.

252
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:48,692
But as the brilliant detective,
that's precisely my job.

253
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:51,733
I have to question
everything about this world.

254
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,400
It's moving.

255
00:15:57,483 --> 00:16:00,358
The pieces will fall
into place soon.

256
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:22,650
What's with you, Sakaido?

257
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,817
You're the brilliant detective,

258
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,983
so why'd you leave
the damn crime scene?

259
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,733
That open locked room
wasn't solved yet.

260
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:30,275
The killer could've gotten
Kaeru in a number of ways.

261
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:33,525
We can't do anything if you
don't give us more material.

262
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:43,733
[WAKASHIKA]
Hey, Kokufu,

263
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:45,108
I need you to take the
part he just completed

264
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:47,817
and turn it
90 degrees clockwise.

265
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:53,942
[SAKAIDO]
Well, look at that.

266
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:57,525
No idea what it means,
but it's a start.

267
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:59,442
Seems the parts of this
world that are missing

268
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:02,025
are more significant than
the parts that are present.

269
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:03,317
But these meaningful voids

270
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,483
don't just make
their presence known.

271
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,900
Guess it's more of
an absence actually.

272
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,942
But the only way to find them
is to work on the puzzle

273
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,317
and look at the larger picture.

274
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
"Takoya," huh?
What could that mean?

275
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:18,442
We've got a font match with
Takoyaki House Pot Octopus!

276
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,233
There are four
locations in Chuuou

277
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:21,692
and one in Choufu as well.

278
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,650
That's the same neighborhood
as the address

279
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,483
from the calendar, right?

280
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,942
[MOMOKI]
Matsuoka's right next to it.

281
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:32,483
An assault team will
arrive in five minutes.

282
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:33,942
Stand by till then.

283
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,233
Mr. Matsuoka. Check it out.

284
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:38,525
It looks like these characters
are slightly tilted.

285
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:39,942
Oh, yeah?

286
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:44,233
[HONDOMACHI] For the sign
to look the same... hmm...

287
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:47,317
...you'd have to be
standing to the side.

288
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,358
What is this?

289
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,400
Think this is it.
I've got a reading.

290
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,650
It's Matsuoka.
We found our particles.

291
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,567
Pattern matches the Perforator.

292
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,775
Thanks for telling me.

293
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:21,025
The Wakumusubi link
beat you to it, though.

294
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,483
It's already affecting
things in the well.

295
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:30,400
[SAKAIDO] Looks like the world
is breaking apart again.

296
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:31,567
Huh.

297
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,275
Guess "broken" is just
the natural state

298
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:35,525
of everything in this world.

299
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,317
Except for Kaeru?

300
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:45,233
This reading.

301
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:46,483
Unless I'm mistaken,

302
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,733
it's supposed to reflect
a fresh urge to kill.

303
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:51,900
He's kidnapped two
people, hasn't he?

304
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:53,192
If this reading is correct,

305
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:56,317
then he might be about to
kill them as we speak!

306
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,650
What do we do?

307
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,067
[MATSUOKA]
Stay here. Wait for backup.

308
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,275
No!

309
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:01,692
Not when two people
just within our reach

310
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:02,567
are about to be murdered!

311
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,025
[MATSUOKA]
Pipe down.

312
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:07,192
I'm going in.

313
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,942
Stay put, Matsuoka.
Help is coming.

314
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,483
We've got information
on the house's occupant.

315
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:16,525
Name: Tamotsu Fukuda.
Age 33. No family.

316
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:17,650
That's--

317
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:21,067
Against regulations,
I'm well aware.

318
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,192
Just wait in the car for
the assault team, okay?

319
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:27,358
[SHIRATAKE]
The world's breaking apart.

320
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,942
It's less stable than ever.

321
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:33,608
He kills by drilling a precise
hole through the victim's head.

322
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:36,233
Yet his drive to kill
is a chaotic mess.

323
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,942
[sirens wailing]

324
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:42,900
[OONUKI]
Who are you?

325
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,650
What do you want with me?

326
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,608
[OONUKI]
Stop! Please stop!

327
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,400
Don't do this. Please!

328
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,150
No! No!

329
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:01,942
Damn it. No!

330
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:08,358
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER A]
He's still breathing, sir!

331
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:11,483
Medic! We need a
stretcher down here!

332
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,858
[SAKAIDO]
This is a fragmented world.

333
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:25,608
So for the locals,
it's natural to be in pieces.

334
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,817
I'm not even whole myself.

335
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,983
But... aside from
the blood she's lost,

336
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,317
Kaeru's all put together.

337
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,942
She should have missing
parts like the rest of us.

338
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,692
And I know why she doesn't.

339
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:43,858
Hey. I know you're there.
Get out of her body, right now!

340
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:48,650
What's he doing?

341
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,317
[SAKAIDO]
Huh.

342
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,192
He did it. Sakaido has
tracked down Kaeru's killer.

343
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:14,650
[SAKAIDO]
Now what? Do I arrest him?

344
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,817
Are police even a thing
in this world?

345
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,317
If they've got prisons here,

346
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,942
I hope they come with more walls
than that locked room had.

347
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:23,483
Heh. Tough luck, buddy.

348
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,525
You can't really catch
him from the well.

349
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,775
And we couldn't find
him from up here.

350
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:29,275
The brilliant detective
doesn't actually

351
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:31,358
have to arrest the
criminal himself.

352
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,358
He just needs to solve the case.

353
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:37,275
Inspector Momoki, would you
like me to eject Sakaido?

354
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:38,567
No. Wait.

355
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,650
Hey. An eighth
person showed up.

356
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:45,692
There were just seven victims
before, but there's a new one.

357
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:48,858
Once you finish
solving the case,

358
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:52,400
we would appreciate it if you'd
leave our house for good.

359
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:53,650
You're new.

360
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:54,817
We know that girl.

361
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,525
Yeah, she was with
the Field Analyst Unit!

362
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,358
So how did she
show up in there?

363
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,025
Matsuoka. You copy?

364
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:03,608
Hondomachi! Hey! Talk to me!

365
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:07,192
Damn it, Hondomachi!
Where the hell are you?
