00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:49,650
[NARIHISAGO]
The ceiling looks different.

3
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:52,150
Three years now

4
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:55,817
I've been staring at the exact
same one inside my cell.

5
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,900
So where...?

6
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:04,275
[AYAKO]
Good morning.

7
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,358
You're up early today.

8
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:15,733
[MUKU]
You're supposed to knock first.

9
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:17,108
[AYAKO giggles]

10
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:21,150
I'm talking in my sleep.

11
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,108
It's time to get up.

12
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:24,942
That's some serious bedhead.

13
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:28,775
[MUKU] Shh. Just gimme,
like, five more minutes.

14
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,733
You're so mean!

15
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,567
Is something wrong?

16
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,275
[NARIHISAGO] That's not Kaeru.
It's our daughter.

17
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:39,400
Which means... Wait!

18
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:41,275
[AYAKO]
Uh.

19
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:45,775
[NARIHISAGO] I'm not Sakaido.
I'm Akihito Narihisago.

20
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:47,233
But I remember.

21
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:50,525
Kaeru. The Mizuhanome. The Kura.

22
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:52,817
All the cases and
serial killers.

23
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,442
Those I've killed.

24
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,942
And how I got here...

25
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,150
[NARIHISAGO]
I remember everything.

26
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,775
[chuckles]

27
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:06,650
[SAKAIDO] Wait ten
minutes, then hit eject.

28
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,733
Only two minutes?

29
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:10,275
Aki?

30
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:13,567
Why're you running around
the house like a crazy person?

31
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:16,442
What's gotten into
you this morning?

32
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:17,650
[grunts]

33
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,650
Get a room, and just let
me go back to sleep!

34
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,275
[AYAKO] Did you have a
bad dream or something?

35
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:36,775
[NARIHISAGO] When I piloted the
bogus Mizuhanome in the id well,

36
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:39,858
this must've been the
world it constructed.

37
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:42,442
That's why it's different
from what I usually find

38
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:45,317
when I dive into a well.

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,150
There's no Kaeru,
and this place,

40
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:51,567
it's an undistorted
version of the past.

41
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,358
Could ya do me a favor
and stop staring at me?

42
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,608
It's creeping me out.

43
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:58,233
It's only because he
loves you, sweetheart.

44
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:01,525
Now stop being a little drama
queen and finish your breakfast.

45
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,067
[MUKU]
Fine.

46
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,692
[NARIHISAGO] For some reason,
I retained my memory.

47
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:10,317
I'm not some brilliant
detective. Just me.

48
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:17,442
Yeah, they found the body of
some person beaten to death.

49
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,317
Definitely sounds like the case
you've been working on.

50
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:26,775
[NARIHISAGO] In this reality,
my family's still alive.

51
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:30,400
I've got no idea how long this
time with them is gonna last,

52
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:34,483
but if this is the past,
I have an advantage.

53
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,608
I remember everything.

54
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:40,442
This guy sounds messed up.

55
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:41,942
[INVESTIGATOR A]
Tests on chemical traces

56
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,817
found on the body
came back positive

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,067
as a finish used
in boxing gloves,

58
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,983
or other similar protective
athletic hand gear.

59
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:52,775
As before, blood, brain
tissue, vomit and diarrhea,

60
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,025
vitreous humor
from prior victims--

61
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:55,358
[DIRECTOR]
Shut that door!

62
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,567
Take a seat or leave.

63
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:03,775
Who was that guy?

64
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,817
One of mine, Narihisago.

65
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,900
He's acting strange.

66
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:15,858
All right, spill.

67
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,775
It's really good
to see you, Momoki.

68
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,483
Then why haven't you
been answering my calls?

69
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,775
[NARIHISAGO] Just didn't
wanna get you involved.

70
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:26,108
What do you mean by "involved"?
What're you up to now?

71
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,817
[NARIHISAGO] Something with
no effect on reality.

72
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,942
Could you be more specific?

73
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:34,858
[MOMOKI]
Where are we?

74
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:37,108
Denshin Katsuyama's house.

75
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:38,483
Or should I say,

76
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,400
it's the home of the killer
we call the Challenger.

77
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:41,608
What?

78
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:42,900
I need you to go to
the rear of the house

79
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:44,608
and wait for my signal.

80
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,442
Don't walk away!
Do you have any evidence?

81
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:49,692
[NARIHISAGO]
I've been here before.

82
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:53,483
[doorbell rings]

83
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:54,692
[CHALLENGER]
Yes?

84
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:57,150
[NARIHISAGO]
Good morning to you.

85
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,400
[CHALLENGER]
Who're you?

86
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,275
Mister Katsuyama,
I mean, Mister Challenger.

87
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:05,692
Well, I'm a police officer and
I would like to speak with you.

88
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:08,733
Just one-on-one.

89
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,150
[CHALLENGER]
Enter.

90
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,483
[NARIHISAGO]
Thanks for your cooperation.

91
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,442
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

92
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:20,608
[CHALLENGER]
Of course not.

93
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:23,317
Now, what business
might you and I have?

94
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,942
It doesn't appear friendly.

95
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:28,775
Yeah, last time I was
racing the SWAT team,

96
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:31,483
so I had to come
in guns blazing.

97
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,900
Thought I'd take the
liberty of a redo.

98
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:36,358
We're lucky.

99
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:39,692
We can take our time,
and not have to rush.

100
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,608
In short, I'm here to
challenge the Challenger

101
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,942
to a fair and square
fight, like a man.

102
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:46,192
[CHALLENGER]
Hmm.

103
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:49,817
We've never met. What do
you mean by "last time"?

104
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,483
As for "lucky," I'm not sure
I would agree with you.

105
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:56,942
[NARIHISAGO] What I'm saying is,
this time, we'll do it your way.

106
00:06:57,025 --> 00:07:01,817
I'm assuming by "my way,"
you mean this? Correct?

107
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,983
Here or inside that little
basement arena you've got,

108
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,900
wherever you prefer.

109
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:11,108
That venue is
currently occupied.

110
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:20,525
[NARIHISAGO] How's this work?
You bang a gong?

111
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:23,150
True combat only begins
the moment both fighters

112
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,108
acknowledge it's inevitable.

113
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:27,442
[NARIHISAGO]
Heh. "Combat."

114
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:31,817
As if what you're doing has
any level of dignity to it.

115
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,400
What you are is
a fucking pervert

116
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:36,650
who got off by beating a
14-year-old girl to death.

117
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:37,817
[CHALLENGER]
Hm.

118
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Is that another event
I should remember?

119
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:42,108
[NARIHISAGO]
That's right.

120
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:45,233
And I won't let you
form a memory of it.

121
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:49,608
You've had your last match
in that arena of yours.

122
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:52,692
Not to brag, but I
am fairly strong.

123
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:56,067
[NARIHISAGO] Save it until
after you defeat an adult.

124
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,817
Oh, but I have.

125
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,358
[NARIHISAGO]
Oh, that's right.

126
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:04,150
You did kill a pro wrestler
and a martial artist.

127
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,275
So what?

128
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,650
A guy who gets off
on beating the shit

129
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:07,775
outta women and children

130
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:10,733
is the weakest kinda
scumbag there is!

131
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:16,733
Seriously, are you going to tell
me what you're going on about?

132
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:17,858
[NARIHISAGO]
I don't know about you,

133
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,400
but I'm done with the chit-chat!

134
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:29,608
[NARIHISAGO groaning]

135
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:31,733
[NARIHISAGO]
You won't make me scream.

136
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:33,900
You and I are just
getting started.

137
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,358
Are you sure you're
really a police officer?

138
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:38,442
You fight like a child.

139
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,483
[chuckles]

140
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,567
What happened to fighting
fair and square, like a man?

141
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,817
I said we'd fight your
way, and we are.

142
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,650
Only this time, you're the one
who was caught by surprise.

143
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:00,900
Dammit!

144
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,317
Good. You've still got
some fight in you.

145
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,067

[gunshots]

148
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,983
[NARIHISAGO]
Get up.

149
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,317
We're not finished!

150
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,942
Are you gonna let
a child beat you?

151
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,567
[CHALLENGER groans]

152
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,025
Not so tough when your
brains are bashed in!

153
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:23,775
The legendary Challenger? Ha!

154
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:32,192
I won!

155
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,567
[MOMOKI]
Narihisago!

156
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,025
What happened?

157
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:38,317
You just killed a man.

158
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,858
Don't die on me. I'll get help.

00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,858
All I see are flashes,

317
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,900
but you... you keep
experiencing it in full

318
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:47,400
with no way out except dying.

319
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:50,150
[KIKI ASUKAI] At first,
there was only one killer.

320
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:54,067
But later on, he began calling
others into my dreams.

321
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,650
[NARIHISAGO]
This man--

322
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:59,317
he wouldn't happen to have
a top hat and cane.

323
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,650
[KIKI ASUKAI]
Yes.

324
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:04,025
[NARIHISAGO]
Makes my stomach turn.

325
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,067
[KIKI ASUKAI]
Real quick.

326
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,400
Could you talk to the doctors

327
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:09,525
and make them stop
giving me sedatives?

328
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,525
Sleep's just part
of the problem.

329
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,483
Not only do I see
myself being killed

330
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:16,025
and reliving previous
deaths after I pass out,

331
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:19,483
the medicines also make
it hard to concentrate.

332
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,567
I'll see what I can do.

333
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,400
Why do you think the Challenger
tried to kill you?

334
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:26,108
In real life, I mean.

335
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:28,608
He couldn't murder you
in dreams if he did.

336
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:31,108
Dreams may be
similar to reality,

337
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,608
but they're no substitute.

338
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:36,983
That man wasn't only interested
in hurting other people.

339
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:39,150
He enjoyed being hit himself.

340
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,775
You don't get physically
injured in a dream.

341
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:43,108
I think he kidnapped me

342
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:45,983
because he needed to
actually feel that pain.

343
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,442
Not anymore.

344
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,942
Now that the
Challenger's is gone,

345
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:52,442
does it ease your pain at all?

346
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:57,108
[NARIHISAGO] I promise,
I'll find a way to end it.

347
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,400
I hope so, Detective.

348
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:11,650
Uh.

349
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:16,275
[FACE-LIFTER] The cop? How the
hell'd you find this place?

350
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:19,358
You told me about it
back when we met in prison.

351
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:22,567
Prison? I ain't never
been to prison!

352
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,775
'Cause I never had a reason to
be arrested in the first place!

353
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,317
[NARIHISAGO] No, at least,
not at this stage.

354
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,650
Yeah! That's right!
I'm innocnt.

355
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,358
All I did was mess
around in a dream

356
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,525
and there's no law against that!

357
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,817
Wait, you said "at this stage."

358
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,067
There's no point worrying
yourself about it.

359
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,858
Hey, who are you?

360
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,817
You're one of us, right?
With you-know-who?

361
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,317
You mean, the guy with the cane?

362
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,233
No, and I'm not one of you.

363
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,942
[FACE-LIFTER] You killed
the Challenger, didn't you?

364
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:56,733
Here to kill me, too?

365
00:20:56,817 --> 00:21:01,442
[NARIHISAGO] I'm in no shape
for that. Just here to visit.

366
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,733
You and I are going to
have a nice long talk.

367
00:21:03,817 --> 00:21:04,900
First, you're going to tell me

368
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:06,608
what you know about
this Kiki girl,

369
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:10,192
and the man who showed you
how to get inside her dreams.

370
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:13,275
And afterwards,
we can focus on you.

371
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:16,483
The reason why you like
to remove people's faces,

372
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,608
but you're too much of a
coward to rip off your own.

373
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:23,733
Oh, we're gonna
have a lovely time.

374
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:38,400
[inaudible]

375
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:42,317
You don't have to die anymore!

376
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,525
[AYAKO]
Morning.

377
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:49,150
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

378
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:53,192
[NARIHISAGO crying]

379
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:55,900
[AYAKO]
Another bad dream, huh?

380
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,567
So, who died?

381
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,108
Was it me?

382
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:04,775
I promise, I'm not gonna die,
you hear me?

383
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:08,817
Never in a million years would
I leave you or Muku behind.

384
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:11,650
Where is Muku?

385
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:13,858
She was still tired from
the firework festival,

386
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:16,358
but should be stopping by
sometime around noon.

387
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:17,525
Ah.

388
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:20,567
Are you sleeping well?
Tell me the truth.

389
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,650
Me? I haven't slept well.
Not for a long time.

390
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:25,858
[AYAKO]
Since when?

391
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:27,567
Oh, hard to say.

392
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,692
Aki! You should've told me!

393
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:32,442
Heh. I really wish
that I could have.

394
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:36,358
I'm serious! Do you realize
how important sleep is?

395
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,608
If you're not getting enough,

396
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:40,317
it's like chipping away
years of your life.

397
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,567
Ah.

398
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,108
[chuckles]

399
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:45,817
In that case, I guess
it's only right

400
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,483
to try and help her get
a good night's rest.

401
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,067
Who do you mean?

402
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,525
You're the one who
needs rest, Aki.

403
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:55,317
I'm sorry I didn't
realize it sooner.

404
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:01,442
[AYAKO]
What is it?

405
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:05,817
Honey, I'm not sure why you're
afraid to close your eyes.

406
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,358
But if I die, you'll
know it's just a dream,

407
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:12,233
and all you have
to do is wake up.
