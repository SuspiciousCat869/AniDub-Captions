[MATSUOKA]
Hm?

00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:33,317
Stop playing games with us, now!
Tell us where he's hiding!

5
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:38,233
Awfully kind of you to
just give us the evidence.

6
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:39,442
Hm?

Don't move a muscle.

11
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,233
It's Hondomachi.
Gravedigger located.

12
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:10,317
Two suspects.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,108
The perpetrator Haruka Kazuta

14
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,108
and the mastermind
directing him.

Name: Nahoshi Inami.
Arrest met with resistance.

On scene officer
has been injured.

17
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:22,525
Kazuta is armed and
still remains at large.

18
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:24,692
Send back-up immediately.

19
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,317
[SAKAIDO]
Hmm...

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,525
What?

21
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:59,858
Nothing, you just have
an interesting face.

22
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:01,233
Oh?

23
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:03,858
I haven't had the opportunity
to look at myself yet,

24
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,525
since there are no mirrors here.

25
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:09,400
Ah. Good point.

26
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,108
[UNKNOWN VOICES] This isn't how
I'm supposed to look, anyway.

27
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,275
He says it's to protect
me from the monster.

28
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:17,608
Yeah?

29
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:20,067
[KAZUTA]
Excuse me.

30
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,275
Would you mind stepping outside?

31
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:28,233
[MATSUOKA]
Think he ran for it?

32
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:29,942
[HONDOMACHI]
Seems unlikely.

33
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,442
Considering how
the princess here

34
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,108
has him wrapped
around her finger.

35
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:35,608
[MATSUOKA]
She's one cool customer.

36
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:38,358
Toying with someone's emotions
so they kill for you...

37
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:40,983
How else could you
describe her except cold?

38
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,858
You know what? Just shoot her.

39
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:44,317
What?

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,692
[HONDOMACHI] You heard me.
She doesn't deserve to live.

41
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:55,025
Fine then. I'll do it myself.

42

43
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:32,608

[KAZUTA groans]

45
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:48,275
[KAZUTA]
Huh?

46
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:02,108
Look at that. You do feel.

47
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,858
So what's your deal anyway?

48
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:22,483
This goes way beyond
having pride.

49
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:28,983
Not proud. Just being childish.

50
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,442
Sounds like he's asking for you.

51
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:39,692
Which is why I'm ignoring him.
Do you know how this works?

52
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:40,858
[SAKAIDO grunts]

53
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,358
Isn't there anybody
you have a crush on?

54
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,108
[SAKAIDO grunts]

55
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:56,442
Hey, man. Do you need a hand?

56
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:58,483
No, don't worry about it.

57
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,775
I appreciate the offer,

58
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:04,400
but she still should be able
to hear me, so it's fine.

59
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:07,733
Don't worry about it? You sure?

60
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:08,983
[KAZUTA]
Yeah.

61
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,192
[SAKAIDO]
Whatever you say.

62
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,858
[TOGO]
Shall I extract Sakaido, sir?

63
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,692
[MOMOKI]
Yes. He's through.

64
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,942
So including Kazuta,
John Walker's manifested

65
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:32,525
in a total of six serial
killers' id wells.

66
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:33,900
Did you find any connection

67
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,233
linking him to
the previous five?

68
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:39,025
I've run several queries
using different conditions,

69
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,983
but so far, we've got nothing.

70
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,067
Let's put aside the issue
of how he finds them a sec.

71
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,650
Just how does he turn
them into murderers?

72
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:49,442
Controlling someone's
emotions sounds unreal,

73
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,733
yet that seem to be
what he's doing.

74
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:54,067
Maybe we should look
into psychiatrists.

75
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,692
[HABUTAE] But none of them
had treatment records.

76
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,608
Also, he's not just ingrained
in the subjects' memories,

77
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:02,275
he exists within
their unconscious.

78
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:05,192
And what's up with that coat
and hat he's always wearing?

79
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:08,192
I don't get it,
some kind of cosplay?

80
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,525
I see.

81
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:11,067
While the mind's
capable of conjuring

82
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,733
all sorts of strange images,
all six share the same vision.

83
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:17,192
In other words, they must
have actually seen someone

84
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:19,358
dressed like John
Walker in person.

85
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:20,233
Right.

86
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,650
The other frustrating aspect

87
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,650
is that he never leaves
any witnesses,

88
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:26,317
he only appears to
whoever he's targeting.

89
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,025
It's nearly impossible--

90
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:30,358
No, I'd say completely
impossible.

91
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,067
[WAKASHIKA]
I was thinking...

92
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,358
It's a long shot,
but what if John Walker

93
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:36,775
has a machine like
the Mizuhanome?

94
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:40,525
Imagine if he... instead of
exploring data like the well,

95
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:43,275
he could invade a person's
unconscious mind.

96
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:44,400
Once he dove in,

97
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:47,067
he could wreak whatever
havoc he wanted.

98
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:49,983
There's the one we operate,

99
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,733
but maybe there's another,
like an original.

100
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:55,025
Despite working
with a Mizuhanome,

101
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,983
we're still being
kept in the dark.

102
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,983
Even we don't know
all of its secrets.

103
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:03,192
Its creator, Nishio Shirakoma,

104
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,650
isn't he missing,
Assistant Director?

105
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,733
Yes, and because of that,

106
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:10,692
no one can gain access to the
main unit's central component.

107
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:13,858
Is there anything we can do
to get some more information?

108
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:15,067
[TOGO sighs]

109
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,108
I'll reach out to Chief
Hayaseura about it,

110
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:20,067
but any details concerning the
project are intentionally kept

111
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,775
under lock and key to
prevent political pressure.

112
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,608
Or worse, using it for
military applications.

113
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:28,192
Don't any of you think about
getting your hands on it.

114
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:32,983
If you were discovered,
the punishment would be severe.

115
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:37,192
I won't deny more intel would
help with the investigation.

116
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,608
Wait a minute.

117
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,483
Considering the power
of Mizuhanome

118
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:41,733
we have at the wellside,

119
00:08:41,817 --> 00:08:44,983
another unit may not
even be necessary.

120
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:48,733
What if this individual is
closer than we suspect?

121
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:51,650
Like a member of
the wellside staff.

122
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,442
It's irresponsible to make
waves without proof.

123
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,108
But still, it'd certainly
explain a few things,

124
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:59,650
like why he's
obscuring his face.

125
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:04,108
If it's one of our colleagues,
they don't want us to know.

126
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:07,233
The Mizuhanome was
introduced a year ago.

127
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:10,525
However, we know for a
fact Fukuda's first kill

128
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,358
goes back at least three.

129
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:13,733
With that timeline,

130
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:17,067
the Mizuhanome would've
been in the prototype phase.

131
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,442
An early version of it.
It's possible.

132
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:23,150
We're working off
too many hypotheticals.

133
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,983
Then let's back up.

134
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,983
First, we need to find
out how John Walker

135
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,817
chooses candidates to
turn into serial killers.

136
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,483
Based on our data,

137
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,025
variation in geography
and timing means this,

138
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,817
there's no pattern.

139
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,525
Yet, there's no
denying a connection

140
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:40,608
between some of the killers.

141
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,233
Kazuta was the Gravedigger,

142
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:46,025
as well as a victim of
Fukuda, the Perforator.

143
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:49,692
I mean, it's hard to believe he
randomly selected two candidates

144
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,192
that just happened to
have a prior connection.

145
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,567
[HABUTAE]
Yeah, good point.

146
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,317
So, that means John Walker
arrived at Kazuta from Fukuda

147
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,733
by using some unknown method.

148
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,733
But Fukuda's only
contact with Kazuta

149
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:04,858
was when he was drilling
a hole in his head.

150
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:06,483
So did John Walker
just happen to be

151
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,858
at that exact same location
at that exact time?

152
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,317
Everything is all
too convenient.

153
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:18,067
[humming]

154
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,358
[WAKASHIKA]
Hidden cameras and microphones.

155
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:31,025
Seems John Walker was keeping
Fukuda under surveillance.

156
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,817
Then, do you suppose...?

157
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,483
If Kazuta was being
closely watched,

158
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:40,067
it's not hard to make the leap
and assume Inami was as well.

159
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,983
I want Narihisago prepped and
ready to dive into the well

160
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,067
as soon as I return.

161
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,567
[MATSUOKA]
Evening.

162
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,358
[MOMOKI]
Matsuoka. My condolences.

163
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:55,025
There's no need for that
when it's just the three of us.

164
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,275
Did you meet with
the officers' families?

165
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,775
[HAYASEURA]
We just finished.

166
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,525
How's your shoulder by the way?

167
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:02,942
It's nothing serious,

168
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:06,775
but that's not the
reason I stopped you.

169
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,608
Tomatsu Fukuda.

170
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,233
When he dives into the well,

171
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:13,858
I heard brilliant detective
Anaido's useless.

172
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,275
In order to be a
fit for the job,

173
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:18,858
you don't necessarily have
to be a criminal, right?

174
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:21,900
If having killed
somebody's a requirement,

175
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,442
as well as an aptitude
for investigation,

176
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,608
then I might know someone.

177
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:29,483
[SAKAIDO]
Kaeru.

178
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,358
[SAKAIDO] The moment her name
passed my lips, I remembered.

179
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:35,483
I'm Sakaido,
the brilliant detective.

180
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:38,775
I must solve the mystery
of Kaeru's death.

181
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:44,150
[SAKAIDO]
Killer walked to the next car.

182
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:47,067
After being covered
in her blood.

183
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:05,942
Guess I'm not getting
much outta you.

184
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,650
Still, when did they die?

185
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,733
And how long have they
been on this train?

186
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:13,692
Got a match on the train.

187
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,108
According to this,

188
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:18,983
Kazuta and Inami took this
line back in high school.

189
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:27,692
I recognize them. Those are
the Gravedigger's victims.

190
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:31,317
Minami Ayase, Shiki Kouda,
Toshiki Yamashita,

191
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,067
Kaori Shiina, Kazuyuki Masuda,
and Kana Mishima.

192
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,775
They're standing in
the order they died.

193
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,317
[TOGO]
We have more info.

194
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,858
Apparently, when Inami was 14,
her mother committed suicide

195
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:45,233
by jumping in front
of a moving train.

196
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,775
From what we've gathered,

197
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:50,317
it appears Sakaido is riding
the same one that ran her over.

198
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:57,025
Moreover, it was this very train

199
00:13:57,108 --> 00:14:00,192
that her daughter was aboard
the moment it happened.

200
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,775
See that?

201
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,233
[SAKAIDO]
Hmm...?

202
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,650
If the first and last car
are connected like this,

203
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,192
then the train must form a ring.

204
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,692
[INAMI]
Hello there.

205
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:28,025
And hello to you.

206
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,525
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

207
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:37,942
Did you kill that gir--?
You know anything about that?

208
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:40,650
You mean her? No clue.

209
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,025
Looks pretty dead to me.

210
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:50,942
I suppose you're gonna
tell me it wasn't you.

211
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:52,233
What do you think?

212
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,483
[SAKAIDO]
I'm leaning towards "no."

213
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,358
Your hands are bloody
from that handkerchief,

214
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:59,025
but there's no sign
of blood spatter on you.

215
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:02,025
If you did it, you would
have disposed of the cloth

216
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:05,150
and those bloody shoes by now.

217
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,317
Looking at the scene,

218
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,067
I'm noticing there's
not very much blood.

219
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,192
And the footsteps could
well be Kaeru's shoe size.

220
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:16,275
So that used to be
her name, huh? Kaeru.

221
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:19,817
Additionally, it seems you two
were complete strangers.

222
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,442
Meaning, you didn't have
a motive to kill her.

223
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,275
Still, what does it matter?

224
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:35,650
[gasps]

225
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:39,775
Are you dense?
Stop staring at him.

226
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:40,817
Boyfriend?

227
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,608
[INAMI]
Yeah, right.

228
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,442
[SAKAIDO]
Okay, let me get this straight.

229
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:47,858
Based on the clues,
Kaeru circled the train,

230
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:50,567
covered in her own blood,
and when she saw you,

231
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,233
asked if you could
wipe her feet off.

232
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:57,150
That's right.
I've no idea why, though.

233
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,775
[SAKAIDO]
But I do.

234
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:02,275
Kaeru did it to lead me here.

235
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:05,275
In order to lead
me to this girl.

236
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:10,525
Or possibly...
to bring me to this boy.

237
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:11,942
Oh, yeah.

238
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:15,567
The next station--do you know
if it's coming up soon?

239
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,525
My mom's probably
waiting for me there.

240
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,817
The train will never
reach the station.

241
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,150
Because it's in a loop, there's
a chance she won't be run over.

242
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,400
What's your take on this?

243
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:30,317
Do you think she's
protecting her mother?

244
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,567
I don't.

245
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,900
It was at the crossing
they passed earlier.

246
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:36,108
That's the location
her mother jumped.

247
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,733
The time of day
also fits perfectly.

248
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:39,692
Which means...

249
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,150
She's trapped forever.

250
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,858
Stuck on a train as it endlessly
runs over her mother.

251
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:47,150
[WAKASHIKA]
There. See that?

252
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,483
Our guy. Walker.

253
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,983
It makes you wonder.

254
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,942
Did Kazuta and Inami
commit these murders

255
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:57,983
they otherwise wouldn't
because of John Walker?

256
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,525
Impulses don't decide actions.

257
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:03,858
While that's the assumption,
how do we know?

258
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,275
It's the same as
saying that people

259
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,400
are fundamentally good or evil.

260
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:09,692
Or, when it comes to reason,

261
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,525
logic contains some
primal aspect

262
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:13,692
that's strong enough
to subdue impulse.

263
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,358
That idea.

264
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:22,650
Huh?

265
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:27,067
You sure I'm not interrupting?

266
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,233
C'mon, I thought we
went over this already.

267
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,858
Sorry.

268
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,150
[INAMI]
I hate it.

269
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:38,817
I hate the thought of
staring at a dead body.

270
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,233
When her mother died,

271
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:43,150
it must've completely
warped those feelings.

272
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,067
[DETECTIVE A] Nahoshi Inami
revealed the location

273
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,400
of a barrel.

274
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,858
You're being
awfully cooperative.

275
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,192
Well, sure.

276
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:53,442
Now that I can't watch the
camera feed any longer,

277
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:56,400
there's no reason
to keep them hidden.

278
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:59,442
Would you like to know where
the rest of them are buried?

279
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:17,192
Care to join us?

280
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,192
Could you not do that?

281
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:23,650
I want it to be
this way forever.

282
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,150
What now, sir?

283
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,567
Being that we have the location
of the remaining victims,

284
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,358
I'd say this case is closed.

285
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:34,525
I think we let Sakaido do what
he wants... a while longer.

286
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:36,150
Also...

287
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:39,692
...for some reason, I don't
wanna leave this world just yet.

288
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,442
Is that strange?

289
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:00,900
[DETECTIVE A]
Copy that.

290
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:03,192
We've recovered all the bodies.

291
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,108
That's good to hear.

292
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:10,483
Real quick.

293
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,733
That cute detective
who arrested me--

294
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,942
I believe her name
is Miss Hondomachi--

295
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,900
do you think I could meet her?

296
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,400
[DETECTIVE A]
It depends.

297
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,358
What did you need to tell her?

298
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:23,775
I know this is going
to sound strange,

299
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:27,150
but she has an injury near
her temple, like a hole.

300
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,775
Kazuta had one in the same place

301
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:32,650
and I was just curious if maybe
there was a connection.

302
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:35,067
[DETECTIVE A]
I'm not sure I understand.

303
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,817
Maybe not, but I know she will.

304
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,317
Call it intuition.

305
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
[HONDOMACHI]
Uh. Are you sure?

306
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,817
You want me to be
a brilliant detective?

307
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,483
Correct. Your deductive powers
make you a great fit.

308
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,483
Thanks, Matsuoka, for
bringing it to my attention.

Yes, sir?

Will you lend us your talents
to unmask John Walker

313
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,442
so we can bring him to justice?

00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:03,692
Of course, sir!

315
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,358
I'm delighted to hear that.

great things from you.

I'll try my best!

00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:16,733
[SAKAIDO] Kaeru killed herself
just to pass along a message.

319
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:19,567
This train isn't
headed anywhere.

320
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,483
It goes in circles, endlessly.

321
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:26,483
But why would she do
something like that?

322
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:32,192
Is Kaeru's death--is anyone's
death worth something like that?

323
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:34,358
I don't understand.

324
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:39,275
[SAKAIDO]
Where are we headed?

325
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,067
If we never reach our
destination, what's the point?

326
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:53,775
You don't have to die!

327
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:55,942
I don't want you to die.

328
00:20:56,025 --> 00:21:01,692
Kaeru, I swear. I was
just trying to save you.

329
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,858
[HONDOMACHI]
Matsuoka!

330
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:13,525
Thank you for recommending me!

331
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,233
[MATSUOKA]
There's no need for that.

332
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,692
[HONDOMACHI]
Hm?

333
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,025
You're right.

334
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:20,275
I guess you were just
doing your job, after all.

335
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:23,233
[MATSUOKA] No. I meant
it's not worth celebrating.

336
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:24,692
Huh?

337
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,983
Honestly, this is the last
thing that I wanted for you.

338
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,150
[sighs] I wish you didn't
have what it takes

339
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,025
to be a brilliant detective.

340
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:32,025
Why not?

341
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:33,525
I'm entrusted with
important cases

342
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,108
that're difficult to solve.

343
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:38,525
[MATSUOKA] Do you know what the
criteria is for becoming one?

344
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:41,108
Um. Deductive powers?

345
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:42,442
There's that,

346
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:45,400
but before you can even
dive into an id well,

347
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:47,942
the pilot needs to be a killer.

348
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:51,692
On top of that, a single
death isn't good enough.

349
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:56,983
To be successful, you need
to have a thirst for killing.

350
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,192
I don't fault you for
your attempted suicide

351
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:02,775
when you were captured
by Fukuda, but I wonder.

352
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:04,817
At Genpei Oono's house,

353
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,650
why'd you go to the
basement on your own?

354
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:12,275
When did you know it
was Nahoshi Inami?

355
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:14,317
That she was the Gravedigger?

356
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,567
No.

357
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,317
When you sent that photo,

358
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,233
just how high did you think
the probability was?

359
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:21,358
I didn't know!

360
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:22,858
And when you used
cognition particles

361
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:27,400
to justify killing Kazuta,
how good did it make you feel?

362
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,067
No. Wait!

363
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,317
It's fine. I'm not
condemning you.

364
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,525
This organization values
those traits, and in its eyes,

365
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:43,025
your actions were no
different than justice.

366
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:46,150
All I did was get
you transferred

367
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,900
to protect me and my colleagues.

368
00:22:58,067 --> 00:23:00,775
Listen, about the
cameras and microphones

369
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,858
we found inside Fukuda's place.

370
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:06,108
Turns out they matched evidence
from a previous case.

371
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:07,358
Which one was it?

372
00:23:07,442 --> 00:23:10,442
Involved a serial killer.
The Challenger.

373
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:13,650
The one who murdered
Narihisago's daughter.

374
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:18,317
The equipment we found hidden
in his house is the exact same.
