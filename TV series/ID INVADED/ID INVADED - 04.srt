Here's what I've concluded.

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,775
[FUKUDA]
Somehow, you've created a system

3
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:23,108
that can detect
the intent to kill,

4
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,942
which you use to catch
people like me.

5
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,567
To help solve these cases,

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,567
you've allied yourself with
at least one murderer.

7
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:33,858
And that's the reason
you now have

8
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:35,900
a dead prisoner on your hands.

9
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:38,692
In one night, the inmate
in the opposite cell

10
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:41,858
was able to talk him
into killing himself.

11
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,608
He referenced memories,

12
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:47,400
secrets he should have
no way of knowing.

13
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,525
I've noticed every time
this Narihisago

14
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,275
is led away by the guards,

15
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:53,442
he comes back
slightly different.

16
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:56,025
Like his already grim
expression was darkened

17
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:57,442
by some new layer.

And one other thing.

21

His voice was barely a whisper,
but like a deafening scream.

I wish you'd been there
to hear it in person.

Not only does the stream
attract numerous viewers,

except she appears to be
around ten years old.

161
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,483
This well, it's
overrun with fire,

162
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,442
but based on everything
that we've learned,

163
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,233
that's not the
Gravedigger's M.O.

164
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:38,442
True, but maybe the
flames aren't literal,

165
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,067
and they symbolize
something else entirely.

166
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,400
What do you think?

167
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,775
[WAKASHIKA]
Uh. Not again.

168
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,442
Third death caused by backdraft.

169
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,067
[MOMOKI] Extract Sakaido and
re-inject him immediately.

170
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,858
After dying in the id well for
more than six hours straight,

171
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:06,317
you are aware he's on
the verge of exhaustion.

172
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,275
He got plenty of rest
in solitary. Inject him.

173
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,233
[TOGO]
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:16,983
[gasps]

175
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:23,942
How did--?

176
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:25,983
He doesn't remember the
previous runs, right?

177
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,442
Correct.

178
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,942
It's thanks to his skills
as the brilliant detective.

179
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:33,275
Regardless, we've still
got a lotta work to do.

180
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:45,983
Sit tight! I'm coming
up to save you!

181
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:56,317
[MOMOKI] Do you need
a break, Narihisago?

182
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,483
[NARIHISAGO] I used the
bathroom a while back.

183
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:02,442
Bad news is, you're gonna
need to clean the cockpit.

184
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:05,692
[MOMOKI]
Noted. Inject him.

185
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,233
[screams]

186
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:17,567
That makes another death.

187
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,817
And in the same spot.

188
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,525
Extract him.

189
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:22,233
Give him the chance
to eat something first,

190
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:23,692
and then we'll resume.

191
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,150
Yes, sir.

192
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:27,317
I'll have personnel clean
the cockpit in the meantime.

193
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,525
We have no idea if
Narihisago's environment

194
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:33,275
is having an effect on
Sakaido's performance.

195
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:34,317
[MOMOKI]
Do that.

196
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,567
[KEIKO]
Why hasn't anyone saved me?

197
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,692
Don't they care?

198
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:42,358
Hey, we found cognition
particles this time, right?

199
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:46,483
So how come there weren't any
in the first six abductions?

200
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,650
[SHIRATAKE]
The Gravedigger's victims

201
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,317
are still buried somewhere,

202
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,025
and none have been
recovered yet.

203
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:53,067
We might not be able
to scan the bodies,

204
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,317
but even so, the drive to kill

205
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,733
should've been at the
point of kidnapping.

206
00:12:57,817 --> 00:12:59,025
[SHIRATAKE]
You're right.

207
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,108
But if there were
a minimal amount

208
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:02,275
of cognition particles
at the scene,

209
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:05,483
they could've been dispersed
by a gust of wind.

210
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,067
I find it hard to
believe someone

211
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,900
who buried six people alive
gives off such a faint reading.

212
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:14,442
Besides, the killer livestreamed
the victim's deaths,

213
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:17,192
left oxygen canisters to
prolong their suffering,

214
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:18,608
and then after they died,

215
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:22,275
continued broadcasting as
the bodies slowly decayed.

216
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:24,358
You wouldn't think an
individual that sadistic

217
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:26,650
would have a weak drive to kill.

218
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:27,858
What I'm getting at is,

219
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,108
the readings should've
been off the chart.

220
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:32,233
[SHIRATAKE]
Well, we found some this time.

221
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:35,025
After we catch the killer,
we'll have our answers.

222
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,025
My point is, this
abduction was different

223
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,608
from all the previous ones.

224
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,983
Why?

225
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:55,983
[SAKAIDO]
I want to save that girl.

226
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,817
But that isn't my task.

227
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,567
My only job here
is to shed light

228
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,442
on the mystery
behind Kaeru's death.

229
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:05,608
How was she rendered a
burnt corpse in a room

230
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,817
without any sign of fire?

231
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,483
Sakaido has died.

232
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:15,900
Extract him.

233
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,108
Give Narihisago a
five-minute break.

234
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,525
Understood, sir.

235
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,108
[door opens]

236
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:24,400
Speaking of which, you
all should get some rest.

237
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:27,567
[MOMOKI]
Really, it's no problem.

238
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,192
But that's where you're wrong.

239
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:32,608
If you're fatigued, you risk
missing a vital clue.

240
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:35,983
Keiko Kikuchi doesn't have
time for us to sleep.

241
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:39,275
Two nights is nothing.
Narihisago's good, too.

242
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:40,942
If he were still
a police officer,

243
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:43,275
that certainly might
be the case.

244
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:46,567
However, these days we're
dealing with Akihito Narihisago,

245
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,108
the serial killer.

246
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:50,692
You mustn't think of
him as a colleague.

247
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:53,067
The desire to save people
may not be enough

248
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,358
to motivate him any longer.

249
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:08,275
[yells]

250
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:17,192
He did it! Uh.

[SAKAIDO grunts]

Waiting long?

256
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:14,692
Yes!

257
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:24,025
You were scared, huh?
Everything's fine now.

258
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:28,192
This place, it's on fire
and full of dead people.

259
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:30,942
[SAKAIDO] That's what
so strange about this.

260
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:34,483
The building's ablaze, littered
with victims from the fire.

261
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:37,525
Yet this girl's the only
person I've seen alive.

262
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:40,067
Everyone else has
burnt to death.

263
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:46,983
[SAKAIDO] Furthermore, Kaeru's
the other anomaly here.

264
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:51,067
She was located in a room
that showed no signs of damage.

265
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,483
In other words, she
didn't die in the fire.

266
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:55,692
She was killed elsewhere,

267
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:58,942
and then was transported
to this location.

268
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,775
But why?

269
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:02,817
Because the killer
tried to conceal her

270
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,983
among the bodies
in this inferno.

271
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,358
They were trying to use a fire
started by someone else

272
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:10,692
to cover up the fact that
she died in a separate one.

273
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:13,233
Reminds me of that
G.K. Chesterton quote.

274
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:14,775
Where does a wise
man hide a leaf?

275
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:18,150
In a forest, or in this
instance, a pile of corpses!

276
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,733
We've been chasing after
the wrong killer

277
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:21,233
for this entire time.

278
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:23,442
It's the work of a copycat that
wanted everyone to think

279
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,442
the Gravedigger was behind this!

280
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:28,150
That explains why we found
the cognition particles.

281
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,483
Then who's actually responsible?

mystery thanks to you.

get outta here.

to do that?

[KEIKO] Mr. Oono's a failure,
so to start all over again,

was sleeping inside.

317
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:03,817
[grunts]

318
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,775
[HABUTAE]
What's wrong?

319
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:08,025
The video isn't a live feed.

320
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:09,650
Take a look.

321
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:14,192
The barrel's still nailed
shut on the broadcast.

322
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:18,067
It was a recording.
The cell phone was a ruse.

323
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,567
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER A]
I'd say the victim's been dead

324
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,025
for several days.

325
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,525
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER B]
You piece of trash!

326
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:24,983
Let me go! I'll kill him!

327
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:25,900
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER A]
Calm down.

328
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:27,733
[OONO laughing]

329
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:30,108
[KEIKO]
I don't remember Mr. Oono.

330
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:33,483
I kept telling him
I didn't see anything.

331
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,442
[SAKAIDO] But he decided
to burn it anyway.

332
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:38,567
Because Mr. Oono is a failure.

333
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,983
Now that I've got you,
he can't hurt you.

334
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,692
Let's get outta here.

335
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:55,483
[OONO screaming]

336
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,942
[KEIKO]
Why'd you do that?

337
00:19:57,025 --> 00:20:00,817
You've seen enough scary
things for one lifetime.

338
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,275
Thank you for coming to save me.

339
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:04,692
Thank you.

340
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:07,108
Without your help, I wouldn't
have found the truth.

341
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:10,817
[KEIKO] By the way, are you ever
gonna tell me your name?

342
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:14,067
[MOMOKI]
We got our guy.

343
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:16,733
That's a relief.

344
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,317
Have to wonder why
he chose a victim

345
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,817
that knew him, though,

346
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,567
and why he left cognition
particles behind this one time.

347
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,400
Was it actually the Gravedigger?

348
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:26,692
Unfortunately not.

349
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:29,858
A copycat.
Hide a leaf in the forest.

350
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,150
[MOMOKI]
Yeah.

351
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,317
So were you able to
locate the victim in time?

352
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,150
There was nothing we could do.

353
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,275
The broadcast was
a video recording.

354
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:41,233
She was dead when we got there.

355
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,067
Do you wanna kill
him, Narihisago?

356
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,233
[NARIHISAGO]
Is that an offer?

357
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:51,775
[MOMOKI]
I'm asking whether you want to.

358
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:56,150
--So that's a yes.
--[NARIHISAGO] Momoki.

359
00:20:56,233 --> 00:21:00,150
[NARIHISAGO] Since I was brought
on as part of Kura, I've killed,

360
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:03,108
driven, five people to suicide.

361
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:04,317
I fully admit it.

362
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,233
I acted of my own will
and gave into my urges.

363
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,525
But there's something
else you should know.

364
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:13,025
I didn't particularly
want them dead.

365
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:15,567
I had no malice
towards any of them,

366
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,067
but this overwhelming
urge to kill

367
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:23,275
just welled up inside me,
and that's when I realized,

368
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,775
I could take this person's life.

369
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:29,067
So I did. There's
no other reason.

370
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,067
What're you telling me?

371
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,858
You're just gonna keep
killing from now on?

372
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,192
[NARIHISAGO]
No.

373
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:38,858
Honestly, I'd like to think
I'm still a person,

374
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:42,442
but people don't decide to act
based on their impulse alone.

375
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:46,442
I can guarantee you, Narihisago,
you're still a person.

376
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:50,483
Though, one with
a horrid weakness.

377
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,858
There's one more thing
I wanted to ask.

378
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:58,608
After all this, do you still
consider me your friend?

379
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:02,192
[NARIHISAGO]
Hm.

380
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:06,192
Truth is, you're probably
the one lifeline I have left,

381
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:08,358
tethering me to reason.

382
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,025
That was one hell
of a resolution.

383
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:18,358
For this case,

384
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:20,442
but the Gravedigger is still
out there somewhere,

385
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:22,525
and we don't have
any idea where.

386
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:26,317
Yeah, well, that investigation
can resume tomorrow.

387
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,442
It's early, but
let's close shop.

388
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,442
[HONDOMACHI]
Hm?

389
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,442
Wait. I recognize him.

390
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,650
Guess that's that.

391
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:01,942
[HONDOMACHI gasps]

392
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:04,233
Uh. Hey, aren't you--?

393
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:07,233
[HONDOMACHI]
Mr. Kazuta!

394
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:10,442
Haruka Kazuta, right?
The missing person!

395
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:13,442
Oh, wait till everyone
hears you're still alive!
