00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:15,692
[NARIHISAGO] You won't be
seeing the Face-lifter again.

2
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:18,108
I'm in your debt, Detective.

3
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:19,358
You don't owe me anything,

4
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:22,358
but I'd like to ask you
a quick question.

5
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:24,983
A week ago, when you
and I met in your dream,

6
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,525
there were fireworks going off,

7
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:30,650
but the festival wasn't
until yesterday.

8
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:31,900
Where's Muku?

9
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,192
She's still tired from
the fireworks festival,

10
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,067
but she'll come.

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,900
I would expect her around noon.

12
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,942
[NARIHISAGO]
Was that just random?

13
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,983
Or did it have some
significance?

14
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,817
When a killer enters my dream,

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,525
it leaves a mark
on my subconscious.

16
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:49,317
This means their thoughts and
feelings can manifest themselves

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,317
within the worlds
I'm dreaming of.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,483
As can parts of their
plans for the future.

19
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:57,025
That's amazing. It sounds
like you're saying

20
00:00:57,108 --> 00:01:00,067
that your dreams can
sometimes predict the future.

21
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,067
[KIKI ASUKAI]
I wouldn't say

22
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,692
that they're
completely accurate.

23
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:06,400
But they have been right before.

24
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,858
[NARIHISAGO]
Interesting.

25
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,983
So your dreams give you
glimpses of potential futures,

26
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:12,400
is that right?

27
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:15,775
Although I suppose that's
one way you could put it.

28
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,858
Mostly, my dreams
are just painful.

29
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:25,483
[NARIHISAGO] I wonder, what if
everything I've been through

30
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,150
was just a never-ending dream?

31
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,317
[NARIHISAGO]
Heh. Doubt it.

32
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:38,650
One time, I accidentally
dozed off

33
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,942
for what must've been
around five minutes.

34
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:43,025
Somehow, that was long
enough for a murderer

35
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:45,483
to find me and tear off my arms.

36
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:47,233
The Arm-twister.

37
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:49,900
[KIKI ASUKAI] In my experience,
time within a dream

38
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:53,983
isn't actually related
to time outside of it.

39
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:58,567
Tell me, Detective, what
happened in your dream?

40
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,150
We'll come by again
tomorrow, 'kay?

41

[MUKU]
See ya then.

42
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:05,983
Bye.

43
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:15,067
[NARIHISAGO]
A dream.

44
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,150
What if everything I remember
from Muku's killing

45
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,775
to my waking up back at home

46
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:29,900
was just a long, painful dream
facilitated by Kiki Asukai?

47
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,608
Confusing and contradictory
as this theory seems,

48
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,358
I can't disprove it.

49
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:40,817
And if it's true,
this is reality.

50
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,733
[NARIHISAGO]
I still don't understand

51
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:46,108
how Miss Asukai's dreams work.

52
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:49,025
Especially the
"potential futures" bit.

53
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:52,567
But this is the world I'm in.

54
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,483
And here, at least,
I've taken out two killers:

55
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,983
The Challenger and
the Face-lifter.

56
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:02,192
But there are still more out
there, so I'll keep going.

57
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:09,150
[NARIHISAGO]
Hey, Momoki.

58
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:12,067
Hey there. It's good to see
you back on your feet.

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,108
No argument here.

60
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,192
So tell me, just what
have you been up to?

61
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:22,233
Strange choice of words.
Been with the wife and the kid.

62
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:23,983
For someone who's been
resting with his family,

63
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,275
you sure look beat.

64
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:27,192
Recovery is hard work.

65

I'm really spending time with
my family. Every second I can.

That's good to hear.

I've turned in my report
on the Challenger's death.

I won't press you further.

It really was just a hunch.

Yeah. You, too?

Mh-hm. But it's been a while.

I'm sorry.

88

I'd get up to talk to you,
but I don't have the strength.

Oh, I understand.
You just take it easy, okay?

90
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,733
The three killers were
scattered all over the place

91
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:51,067
so they took a while
to track down,

92

but track them down I did.

It's done. They're all gone.

I let them decide how to
end it for themselves.

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,858
Judging by what they chose,

98
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:07,650
it seemed I turned their drive
to kill other people inward.

99
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,858
There was something
poetic about it.

100
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,108
I wonder if by taking
their own lives

101

through the methods they'd used,

102
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:17,942
they were somehow able
to complete themselves.

103
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,775
I interrogated all
three of them,

00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,817
While I'm still human.

159
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:42,358
No. No way could I do that.

160
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,358
[KIKI ASUKAI]
My life is nothing but misery.

161
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:45,775
You can put me out of it,

162
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:48,442
or you can stand and
watch as I wither away.

163
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,233
Please make the right choice.

164
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:53,942
No, I can't.
I'm a police officer.

165
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,733
[KIKI ASUKAI] If you won't
do it to ease my suffering,

166
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:58,733
then do it for everyone else.

167
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:01,400
It's the only way the
world can be saved.

168
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:02,608
Miss Asukai.

169
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,608
[KIKI ASUKAI]
I've seen it in my dreams.

170
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,983
In the near future,
I'll dissolve into the world

171
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,192
and damage it beyond recovery.

172
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:11,858
Please, Detective Narihisago.

173
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,692
I need you to stop me before...

174
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,025
All I can do is hunt
down the serial killers

175
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,817
who've attacked you.

176
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,317
I'll keep searching for
the man with the cane,

177
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,192
but I can't come
back here anymore.

178
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:28,275
Miss Asukai, about
the man from before--

179
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:38,692
[NARIHISAGO]
Yeah? What is it?

180
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:39,983
[MOMOKI]
Sorry for calling so late,

181
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,567
but Miss Asukai disappeared
from the hospital.

182
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,067
[gasps]

183
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,233
[MOMOKI] At the same time,
13 nurses lost consciousness.

184
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:50,525
Furthermore, there's no
sign they were drugged.

185
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,192
[NARIHISAGO]
D'you say 13?

186
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,233
Three of them have woken up now.

187
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,067
According to the
statements they gave,

188
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,733
all of them went comatose
one after another,

189
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:01,108
in the order they
entered her room.

190
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:03,900
By the time they
came to, she was gone.

191
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:06,650
To top it off, the security
cameras malfunctioned,

192
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,858
so we don't have much to go on.

193
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,692
I thought I'd ask if she
said anything to you

194
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:13,525
that could help us
figure this out.

195
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:16,483
[NARIHISAGO]
Uh... no. Not really.

196
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,567
I haven't seen her
in over a month.

197
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,983
[MOMOKI] Miss Asukai was
plagued with nightmares,

198
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,608
did you know that?

199
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:26,025
From what I heard,
they were really bad.

200
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,692
The poor kid was
terrified to sleep.

201
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:32,275
[NARIHISAGO]
Huh. That's news to me.

202
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:36,400
I see. I brought up her
nightmares for a reason.

203
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,858
The nurses who've woken
up reported dreams,

204
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,025
and ridiculous as
this may sound,

205
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:44,150
the details of the dreams
they had matched up.

206
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:47,150
As if all of them were
in the same dream.

207
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,608
Well, that's a funny
coincidence.

208
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,233
But putting that detail aside,

209
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,817
it sounds to me like Miss
Asukai found a subtle way

210
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,358
to knock the nurses out so she
could escape from the hospital.

211
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,733
[MOMOKI] I went to
see her two days ago

212
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,858
and she was barely conscious.

213
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:05,400
She was in no condition to sit
up, let alone stage a breakout.

214
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:06,942
[NARIHISAGO]
Weird.

215
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:10,650
I don't have anything for
you then. Sorry. Bye.

216
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,483
[AYAKO]
Everything okay?

217
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,150
[NARIHISAGO]
Yep.

218
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,442
It was nothing important.

219
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,233
The world'll fall
apart like her.

220
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:40,900
[NARIHISAGO]
Are you still investigating

221
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:42,317
Miss Asukai's disappearance?

222
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,775
Yeah. Not that I've found
any real leads lately.

223
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:51,150
I'm told that the kid had some
sort of psychic ability.

224
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,442
And that she'd become a subject
of research at the hospital.

225
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:55,900
What kind of research?

226
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:59,858
"Invasion of the Unconscious
Mind Mediated by Dreams."

227
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,442
You might remember.

228
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:04,483
That Shirakoma guy we met in her
room was in charge of the study.

229
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:05,358
So...

230
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:07,233
I don't think he abducted her.

231
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:10,358
He's got a solid alibi for
the mass coma incident.

232
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,025
And on top of that,

233
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:15,275
he hadn't had any contact
with her for some time.

234
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:17,942
Her health was failing
even with treatment.

235
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,358
I don't know how
long she can last.

236
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:23,483
What's wrong?

237
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,608
A visitor, huh?

238
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,108
You recognize that guy
from somewhere?

239
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,858
Nu-uh.

240
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,983
[NARIHISAGO]
The Perforator.

241
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:53,317
Can't believe I
forgot about him.

242
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,733
Stop where you are!

243
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:57,275
Drop your pistol to the ground,
show me your hands,

244
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:59,650
and slowly turn to face me.

245
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,150
[gasps]

246
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,650
[NARIHISAGO]
You.

247
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:12,983
Akihito Narihisago.
How did you get here?

248
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,025
[gasps] Please listen to me.

249
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,400
I know you.

250
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:19,567
My name is Hondomachi,
and I'm a Kura field analyst.

251
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,483
If you're here, then you must've
entered a well within a well

252
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,108
like I did.

253
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:31,317
That's impossible.
This world is real. I'm sure.

254
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,817
It can't be a well
within a well!

255
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,192
I knew it.

256
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,567
You dived in as Sakaido
a while ago, didn't you?

257
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,483
I don't know who Sakaido is!

258
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,858
I'm Akihito Narihisago.

259
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,692
And this is the place
where I live.

260
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:42,900
This is my home, okay?

261
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:46,067
I'm sorry, but this
really is an id well.

262
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,150
It may closely resemble the
real world, but it's artificial.

263
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,275
You're lying!

264
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:52,400
Why are you so adamant?

265
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,567
Mr. Narihisago, how long
have you been here?

266
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,483
My entire life!
This world's real!

267
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,192
You have a gun.

268
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:00,400
Is the well set in a time
when you were a cop?

269
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:02,525
I've always been a cop!

270
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:08,067
Look, I'll start by
telling my story.

271
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,525
I came here by diving in
through a cockpit that I found

272
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:14,150
while I was exploring
your id well.

273
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,692
That was about 20 minutes ago.

274
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,983
[NARIHISAGO]
What's today's date?

275
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:30,358
The 20th of April
in the year 2019.

276
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:44,567
[HONDOMACHI] Mister Narihisago,
I have to ask you again.

277
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,858
How long have you been here?

278
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,192
[NARIHISAGO]
Two years.

279
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:57,817
[HONDOMACHI]
Huh?

280
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,858
[HONDOMACHI]
What's happening?

281
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:12,150
This world, it's-it's
falling apart.

282
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,858
I think the id well's
breaking down

283
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:16,233
because of the two of
us found each other.

284
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:19,567
I can't be certain, but maybe
the contradiction of having--

285
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,817
[NARIHISAGO grunts]

286
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:25,275
[AYAKO]
Hello?

287
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,150
Listen, it's me!
You need to run.

288
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,442
Is Muku there?

289
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,775
[AYAKO]
Well, yeah.

290
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,192
[NARIHISAGO] Then grab her
and start running, now!

291
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:33,025
[AYAKO]
What? Run where?

292
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:35,192
Heh. What's with you?

293
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,483
Who is it?

294
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:39,483
[AYAKO] It's your dad.
He's talkin' kinda crazy.

295
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,275
[MUKU]
Oh, yeah?

296
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:44,108
You have to let them go.

297
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:49,108
Hey, Aki. Where are
you right now?

298
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,567
[NARIHISAGO]
I...

299
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:28,483
[NARIHISAGO] The real me...
is in the real world.

300
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,192
The world where you're gone.

301
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:32,358
Where Muku's gone.

302
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,067
Where I'm alone.

303
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,567
[AYAKO]
Heh. What are you talking about?

304
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,233
Hey, Dad.

305
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:40,942
Muku.

306
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:44,442
I hate that I can't be with
you and Mom right now.

307
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:47,608
I miss you so much it kills me.

308
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:49,025
[MUKU]
What's going on, Dad?

309
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,900
Are you going somewhere?

310
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,067
[MUKU]
Just don't die. Okay, Dad?

311
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,067
[AYAKO]
I promise.

312
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,358
I'm not gonna die, you hear me?

313
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:02,317
Never in a million years would
I leave you or Muku behind.

314
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:12,067
[NARIHISAGO] You're asking...
if I'm going somewhere?

315
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,650
[NARIHISAGO]
What do you mean?

316
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:21,858
You and your mother are
the ones who left me.

317
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:26,942
[MUKU]
But we're here.

318
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,067
[AYAKO]
Let me.

319
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,025
Aki?

320
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:31,567
Yeah?

321
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,775
[AYAKO]
Are you okay?

322
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:36,108
Uh. Yeah.

323
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:38,567
I'm fine.

324
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,692
I'm gonna be okay. You don't
have to worry, all right?

325
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:47,317
[MUKU] You are coming back
home, aren't you, Dad?

326
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
[NARIHISAGO]
Mh-hm.

327
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:51,483
Yeah, you can count on it.

328
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:54,858
There's no doubt in my mind
that I'm gonna go back.

329
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,442
Sorry, Mister Narihisago.
I didn't know.

330
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:06,442
[NARIHISAGO]
You're fine.

331
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:08,817
It feels better this way.

332
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:14,608
[HONDOMACHI] I've never
seen an id well collapse.

333
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,317
Do you think we'll die with it?

334
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,817
[NARIHISAGO] No idea.
This is a first for me, too.

335
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,275
[HONDOMACHI] It's sort of
pretty, don't you think?

336
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:27,692
Not just this world,
but the way it falls apart.

337
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:31,400
[NARIHISAGO]
Yeah. I agree.

338
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:34,525
This is a beautiful world.

339
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:37,817
[HONDOMACHI] Mister Narihisago,
were you really here for years?

340
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,525
How'd you spend the time?

341
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:42,817
[NARIHISAGO] With my family.
And did some work.

342
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,067
Both at my job as
a police officer

343
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,900
and on something more personal.

344
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:49,483
Oh, yeah.

345
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:52,400
Listen, I need to tell you what
we've learned about John Walker.

346
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:56,483
[HONDOMACHI]
Director Momoki? There's no way!

347
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,358
[NARIHISAGO] Our only hope is
to find the real culprit.

348
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,025
Chances are, my partner died

349
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:04,108
or left my body in the
desert, so I'm a goner.

350
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,525
But you still have
a chance to get back.

351
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:09,692
Momoki and the others will
find a way to rescue you.

352
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,858
It looks like we still have
a little more time

353
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,608
before the id well
collapses completely,

354
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:17,150
so as long as we're
trapped in this world,

355
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:20,317
let's scour it for more
clues about John Walker.

356
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,233
[ANAIDO]
9:59, and done.

357
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:25,233
That was tedious.

358
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:29,317
[gasps]

359
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,442
[NARIHISAGO]
What? After all this time?

360
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,650
They're extracting you?

361
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:34,692
It looks like it. Take this!

362
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,150
[HONDOMACHI]
What is it?

363
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,317
[KOKUFU]
Sakaido's back.

364
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,317
[TOGO]
Extract him.

365
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,358
Welcome back.

366
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:53,400
So? What was it like?
I'm dying to know.

367
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,817
[SAKAIDO groans]
Couldn't tell you.

368
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,400
I can't remember.

369
00:19:58,483 --> 00:19:59,942
[ANAIDO]
Are you crying?

370
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,942
Am I? Wonder why.

371
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:07,358
[SAKAIDO]
Hey, what's all this?

372
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:11,358
[ANAIDO] Got kinda bored
so I started counting sand.

373
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:14,525
Heh. You really are
a strange one.

374
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:39,108
The tanlines on our wrists
weren't from stolen watches.

375
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:40,817
They were left by
the strips of cloth

376
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,108
which were tying each of us
to one of Kaeru's hands

377
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:43,983
when we got here.

378
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,358
Why did you take them off?

379
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:48,067
You really are a
brilliant detective.

380
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,942
Talk about the power
of observation.

381
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:54,150
I got crazy bored during the
time I had to wait for you,

382
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,317
so I thought I'd do
some sleuthing myself.

383
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,275
Answer the question right now.

384
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,192
These cloths were meant
to serve as a warning

385
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:02,358
that we would need to
stay at Kaeru's side.

386
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:03,692
[gasps]

387
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:05,692
Does something about
this feel kind of familiar?

388
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:07,567
Just listen for a second.

389
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,358
I examined our recently
vindicated watch thief in depth.

390
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,525
He didn't kill us or Kaeru.

391
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,692
but he didn't lend
us a hand either,

392
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,400
and when I searched his pockets,
I found the damnedest thing.

393
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:20,483
[ANAIDO chuckles]

394
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,733
[ANAIDO]
Whaddaya make of that, Sakaido?

395
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:24,817
A photograph!

396
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,733
How did we miss him
picking that up?

397
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:30,025
You probably don't understand
who those people are.

398
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:32,650
You forgot them
when you dove in.

399
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,025
But I'm not like you.

400
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:38,525
For some reason,
I remember exactly who I am.

401
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:41,650
I remember everything
I've ever known.

402
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,983
It doesn't look
like the function

403
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,650
that's meant to give
a pilot amnesia

404
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:47,775
when they enter a
well works on me.

405
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:49,567
I think I know why.

406
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,442
When my brain was adjusting
to its new shape,

407
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,775
it moved some wiring around.

408
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:58,608
Anyway, I can tell you the
stuff you've forgotten.

409
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,400
[ANAIDO] You aren't a brilliant-
if-single-minded detective

410
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:04,733
named Sakaido.

411
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:08,233
You're a former cop named
Akihito Narihisago.

412
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:10,192
You used to have a family.

413
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:12,733
And you're a murderer.

414
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,525
[HABUTAE] Facial reconstruction
is now complete!

415
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,442
It's a match with Narihisago!

416
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:21,067
And because Fukuda
entered the well

417
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,108
with his consciousness
and memories intact,

418
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:25,608
he managed to figure it
out before we could.

419
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:27,858
The man played us all for fools.

420
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,900
[gasps] Get them out
of there right now!

421
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:31,108
It won't work!

422
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:32,358
They're out of sync with us,

423
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,775
so the extraction system
doesn't recognize them!

424
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:36,233
[gasps]

425
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:38,692
The lightning well started
with the exact same warning.

426
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,483
"You need to stay with Kaeru."

427
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:42,817
[ANAIDO]
Sorry.

428
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,233
I figured out what this
place was a while ago.

429
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:48,275
I recognized it from
when they sent me here

430
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:50,817
to search for Hondomachi.

431
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:56,692
[SHIRATAKE] This isn't
Director Momoki's id well.

432
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,692
It's the end stage
of Narihisago's!

433
00:22:58,775 --> 00:23:01,650
When someone remembers who
they are in their own id well,

434
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:04,608
the conscious mind encroaches
on the unconscious mind.

435
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:07,067
And to prevent that, the well
whips itself into a storm.

436
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,358
He's fallen into dogma!

437
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:12,067
So this is it. A well-storm.

438
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,400
[gasps]

439
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:18,150
[SAKAIDO]
John... Walker.
