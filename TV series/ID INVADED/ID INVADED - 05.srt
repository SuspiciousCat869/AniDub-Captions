1
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,733
[gasps]

2
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:26,608
[gasps] Mister Kazuta, wait!
I need to speak with you!

3
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:34,233
What was all that about?

4
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:38,483
[MATSUOKA]
What's up?

5
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,400
I just saw Mister Kazuta.

6
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:43,025
Yeah? And who is that?

7
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:44,192
Not Haruka Kazuta.

8
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:45,733
One and the same.

9
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:47,275
There was a hole
drilled in his head,

10
00:00:47,358 --> 00:00:48,608
but he was still alive.

11
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:50,525
I saw him in the crowd
a moment ago,

12
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:53,025
but he ran away after
I called out to him.

13
00:00:53,108 --> 00:00:54,358
[MATSUOKA]
You're sure?

14
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:57,942
Then this is an emergency.
We need to find him.

15
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,442
I'm surprised.
Figured he'd be dead.

16
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:02,733
Fukuda lived through it, too.

17
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:05,483
People are able to survive
all kinds of serious trauma.

18
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:08,733
You're right. I guess they can.

19
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:11,525
What's the deal?
Why're you so worked up?

20
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:12,817
[gasps]

21
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,525
[MOMOKI]
Let's talk about Haruka Kazuta.

22
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:49,150
We know he managed to
survive the procedure,

23
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,525
the same as you.

24
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:51,858
Huh.

25
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:53,942
And yet, you shouldn't assume

26
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,567
the holes in our
heads are similar.

27
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,733
I'm listening.

28
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:03,108
[FUKUDA] I'm simply telling you,
no two are exactly alike.

29
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:05,817
The next time you see him, ask,

30
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,358
"Does the wind blowing
through your hole feel cold?"

31
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:13,108
And if it does,
is that more ideal?

32
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,608
I can only speak from
my own experience,

33
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,442
but if it doesn't,
that means trouble.

34
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:23,150
[MATSUOKA] Remind me,
how old are you, again?

35
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:23,733
Hey.

36
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,483
Oh. Sorry.

37
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:26,858
[MATSUOKA]
What's your age?

38
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:30,067
[HONDOMACHI]
Oh, uh. I'm 23 years old.

39
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,858
[MATSUOKA] So clearly
not a middle schooler,

40
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:34,483
but this is how you react
to getting kissed?

41
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:37,108
As if that's all it would
take to get me flustered.

42
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:38,317
Yeah, right!

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I mean, it was just
so sudden and bizarre.

44
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:42,775
Besides, I wasn't even
thinking about that.

45
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:44,692
I was trying to figure
out what Mister Kazuta

46
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:47,608
was doing at the crime scene.

47
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:50,942
[MATSUOKA] Well, we're dealing
with a sensational case.

48
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:52,817
The entire nation's
been obsessed with it

49
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,942
for the last three days.

50
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,483
Not to mention
the police presence

51
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:59,692
caused a bunch of curious
onlookers to show up.

52
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:03,692
Heard there were roughly 2,000
people in that neighborhood.

53
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,942
[HONDOMACHI]
Why was he there of all places?

54
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,233
It's too big of a coincidence.

55
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:13,025
When you think about how
the Gravedigger would feel

56
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:16,150
discovering there's
someone copying them.

57
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,067
[gasps] Unless...

58
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,733
What if--? Yeah, I suppose it
could be possible, couldn't it?

59
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,567
What's gotten into you?

60
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,275
Okay, but don't say I'm jumping
to conclusions when I tell you.

61
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:29,650
[MATSUOKA]
Let's hear it.

62
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:30,983
[HONDOMACHI]
What if Haruka Kazuta

63
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,775
wasn't there as an onlooker?

64
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:37,817
But instead, he came to the
scene to check out the copycat?

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,275
Okay then, I'll bite. And what
was his reason for doing that?

66
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:46,650
[HONDOMACHI] Maybe Kazuta's
the one we've been looking for.

67
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,942
He's the real Gravedigger.

68
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,108
Oh, come on.

69
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:52,400
That's why he snuck
away from the crowd.

70
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:55,067
He figured staying meant
we would arrest him.

71
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,608
So, you're saying
the real Gravedigger

72
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,317
kissed you to evade arrest?

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,650
Weird, I know.

74
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,650
Obviously, I was surprised
by what was going on,

75
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:07,233
but his expression made it seem
like he was shocked, too.

76
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:09,192
I think he was caught
off guard by his actions

77
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,317
just as much as I was.

78
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,608
[MATSUOKA]
Like it was inadvertent?

79
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,067
What would you have done
if you were in his shoes?

80
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,358
Imagine a police officer
stops you at the scene

81
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:25,817
of your copycat's arrest and
you have no chance to escape.

82
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,983
[MATSUOKA]
Me?

83
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,692
I would've found
some way to lose you.

84
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:34,025
No. I'd probably go further
to keep you from talking.

85
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:36,442
That's exactly the
point I'm making.

86
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,442
Killing me would've
been the logical choice,

87
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,858
and must've been
Kazuta's intention.

88
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,983
But then, somehow,
he got mixed up.

89
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,317
One more thing.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,067
We haven't been able to
catch the Gravedigger

91
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,858
because of the lack
of cognition particles.

92
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:53,942
Without them, we can't create
an id well and we're paralyzed.

93
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:55,150
That's right.

94
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,150
The suspect traps his
victims in a barrel

95
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:00,567
and streams them slowly
dying of suffocation.

96
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,608
They've done it six times
that we know of.

97
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:05,608
There's no way the Gravedigger
has zero drive to kill.

98
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:06,983
Agreed.

99
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,233
[HONDOMACHI]
Then why haven't we detected

100
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:10,108
any cognition particles,

101
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:12,650
even at the scene
of the kidnappings?

102
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,275
[HONDOMACHI]
Here's my theory.

103
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:20,150
Kazuta's neural pathways,
it's like they've been rerouted.

104
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,233
Specifically, the urge
to kill and express love

105
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,442
have been switched around.

106
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,858
Most likely brought on by
brain damage he suffered

107
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:29,900
at the hands of the Perforator.

108
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:31,192
Huh?

109
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,900
[HONDOMACHI]
Go back to where he kissed me.

110
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,858
Genpei Oono's house.

111
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,108
[MATSUOKA]
We got a hit.

112
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,692
You bet we did.

113
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:46,942
There's no other explanation why
he would've kissed me like that.

114
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:49,983
In his subconscious, when he's
feeling the urge to kill,

115
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,858
it manifests as a
show of affection.

116
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:56,817
But if that's true, that asshole
was trying to murder me!

117
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,525
[HONDOMACHI] I feel like my
innocence has been tarnished,

118
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,525
but this makes up for it!

119
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,108
We may've solved the case

120
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,817
and discovered the
Gravedigger's identity.

121
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,775
[MATSUOKA]
There's no reason to think--

122
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:11,317
Yes, sir?

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,108
[MATSUOKA]
Nothing. It's not important.

124
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:14,650
So let's assume that kisses

125
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,400
somehow override
Kazuta's drive to kill.

126
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:19,150
"Kisses," huh?

127
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,275
[MATSUOKA] Seriously,
if we corner this guy,

128
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,150
is he just gonna try
to lock lips with us?

129
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,567
[HONDOMACHI laughs]

130
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,942
Sorry. In my opinion,
not likely.

131
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:31,442
Since an impulse is just
the impetus for action.

132
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:34,067
If he puts some conscious
thought into murdering someone,

133
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,108
I'm sure he'll be able to.

134
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:39,400
Thing is, when he tries
to kill someone suddenly,

135
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:41,650
just like he did with
me earlier today,

136
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:45,358
the wires end up getting crossed
and influence his behavior.

137
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:50,983
[HONDOMACHI] What makes Kazuta
kill are his feelings of love,

138
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:54,692
and his expressions of love have
murderous intent behind them.

139
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,525
[MATSUOKA] That's why
he buries people alive?

140
00:07:57,608 --> 00:08:00,275
And they say romance is dead.

141
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,442
[gasps]

142
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,400
[sighs]

143
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:47,817
[gasps]

144
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:53,942
Her name's Kaeru.

145
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,358
[SAKAIDO]
That's right.

146
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:58,442
And I'm Sakaido,
full name unknown.

147
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,192
But I am the
brilliant detective,

148
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:03,525
and will uncover the
mystery behind her death.

149
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,775
Oh. I think I've got it.

150
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:09,525
Hey, come on now!
That's way too fast!

151
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,192
[SAKAIDO] Cause of death
was a stab wound to the chest.

152
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:21,692
The weapon is missing,
so the killer must've taken it.

153
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:24,983
Furthermore, the wound
was obviously deep enough

154
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,567
to cause a massive
loss of blood.

155
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,650
Still, something feels off.

156
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,900
In a weightless environment,

157
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:35,858
stabbing would've
made the blood spatter

158
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,942
in several different directions.

159
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:42,692
Instead, it's pooled
around her body.

160
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:46,442
It couldn't have floated up
from the floor either,

161
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:50,025
the tatami would be stained red.

162
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:52,025
The tiles look pristine.

163
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,775
No evidence the killer
tried to clean them.

164
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:58,192
Meaning Kaeru was
stabbed in mid-air.

165
00:09:58,275 --> 00:09:59,900
To keep the blood from
staining the floor

166
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,775
or spraying across the room,

167
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:07,067
her murderer must have carefully
spread it in this pattern.

168
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,775
But why?

169
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:15,025
To hide something underneath
the canopy of the blood?

170
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,650
Hello.

171
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,942
Hello to you.

172
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:25,442
[HABUTAE] This girl, she's
not one particular person.

173
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,275
Voice, eye colors,
and mole position--

174
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,900
they're constantly changing.

175
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,192
Standby for pattern analysis.

176
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,608
It's an amalgamation of
the Gravedigger's victims.

177
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:37,942
Minami Ayase, Shiki Kouda,
Toshiki Yamashita,

178
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:42,817
Kaori Shiina, Kazuyuki Masuda,
and lastly, Kana Mishima.

179
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,817
[MOMOKI]
Then I hereby acknowledge

180
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Haruka Kazuta as
the Gravedigger.

181
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,858
Secure an arrest warrant.

182
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:49,608
[SHIRATAKE]
We've identified the residence.

183
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,900
A detached house Haruka
lived in during high school

184
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,025
on the Kazuta's family property.

185
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,733
Looks like both it and
the main house are empty,

186
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:58,108
but there's a brewery
on the grounds

187
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,775
used for making soy sauce.

188
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,775
Maybe the Gravedigger doesn't
trap his victims in coffins.

189
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:05,025
They could be barrels
for some other purpose.

190
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:06,817
Like fermentation.

191
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:09,275
[HONDOMACHI]
Got the address.

192
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:11,233
Mister Nishimura's
near the scene.

193
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:14,108
You heard what she said.
It's all yours.

194
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,025
Headed that way now.

195
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:21,150
So what are you
doing down there?

196
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:24,733
[SAKAIDO] You're the brilliant
detective. Think.

197
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,608
I wonder, is the killer trying

198
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,358
to keep someone
from finding you?

199
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:32,233
[UNKNOWN VOICES]
There's a super scary monster.

200
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,817
[SAKAIDO] Can you tell me
where this monster is?

201
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,650
I can't be sure.

202
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:39,067
[SAKAIDO]
Then maybe you can tell me

203
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,067
where the person who
killed Kae--this girl is?

204
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,192
[UNKNOWN VOICES]
I don't know that either.

205
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,150
But if I had to guess,

206
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,650
he's out there somewhere
fighting the monster.

207
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:52,525
I see.

208
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:55,900
Can you to do me a favor and
sit tight for a while longer.

209
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,358
[UNKNOWN VOICES]
All right.

210
00:11:57,442 --> 00:12:00,025
[SAKAIDO]
What can I use as a weapon?

211
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,358
Guess that's the best I got.

212
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:07,108
A photograph?

213
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:08,858
Hurry! Piece it together!

214
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:11,400
[HABUTAE]
Ma'am!

215
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:14,358
It's from Kazuta's final
year of middle school.

216
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,900
After he was considered a
victim of the Perforator,

217
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:19,650
the investigators searched
his room for any clues

218
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,692
and discovered the same picture.

219
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,400
It's a memory of an
actual possession.

220
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:25,817
[TOGO] I want thorough
background checks

221
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,150
on everyone else
in the photograph.

222
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,150
If we're right and love
is what's driving

223
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,067
the Gravedigger's
desire to kill,

224
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,817
he could be longing
for one of these people.

225
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,275
[HONDOMACHI] One of his
middle school classmates?

226
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:47,275
Love is what's motivating him.

227
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,400
That's what serves as
Kazuta's impulse to kill.

228
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,525
He's publicly sending
snuff films to people

229
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:55,442
he has feelings for like
they were valentines.

230
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,900
But still, could he operate
off impulse alone this long?

231
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:00,608
All he'd need is
just a little thought

232
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:03,108
before realizing his
actions were crazy.

233
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:05,442
The guy's got a hole drilled
clear through his head.

234
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:07,067
When you consider that,

235
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,317
there's no telling what other
brain functions were damaged.

236
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,900
I suppose.

237
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:15,233
Also, you've gotta wonder about
the person he's doing this for.

238
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:18,733
How will they react after
learning they were the reason?

239
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:21,108
Not that I'm saying it's
their fault or anything.

240
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:22,192
Who knows?

241
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:23,567
But go ahead and
send that picture

242
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,608
out to the other officers.

243
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:27,025
[HONDOMACHI]
Yes, sir.

244
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:30,817
Um. Just one thing. Can I
choose which one we visit?

245
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,275
[MATSUOKA]
Sure. Just pick the cutest one.

246
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:34,900
[HONDOMACHI]
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:43,483
[NISHIMURA] Is the Wakumusubi
ever going to react?

248
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:46,275
Hondomachi got a kiss
because she's a girl,

249
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,358
but what if the gender
doesn't matter?

250
00:13:58,692 --> 00:13:59,650
[gasps]

251
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,275
Inspector, look!
That's John Walker!

252
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,608
[SAKAIDO]
So he's the one!

253
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:27,817
Son of a bitch!

254
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,900
[SAKAIDO yells]

255
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,733
[SAKAIDO] Just who the
hell was that anyway?

256
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,442
[NISHIMURA]
Lots of barrels at the brewery.

257
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,692
But one of them's got a wire.

258
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:57,567
[NISHIMURA] The previous
victims might still be inside.

259
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,150
Or he could be recording
a new one to upload later,

260
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,025
similar to what Oono did.

261
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,567
[MOMOKI]
And the Wakumusubi?

262
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,025
Still nothing.

263
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:06,108
[MOMOKI]
Can you open it?

264
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,025
[NISHIMURA]
We're trying now.

265
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,358
[MOMOKI]
Keep your guard up.

266
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,733
[NISHIMURA]
Copy that.

267
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,025
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER A]
I don't hear an echo.

268
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:19,400
It's gotta be filled
with something.

269
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:22,150
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER B] I don't
know if this lid is coming off.

270
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:23,483
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER C]
Reading any signals?

271
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:24,817
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER D]
Still analyzing. Standby.

272
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,150
[knocking]

273
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:28,733
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER C]
Hey! Is anybody in there?

274
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,775
[doorbell rings]

275
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:34,025
One more thing. Don't let
your guard down for a second.

276
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,400
[NISHIMURA]
I'll be careful.

277
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:38,817
[INAMI]
Coming! How can I help you?

278
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,317
[HONDOMACHI]
Uh. Good afternoon.

279
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,608
We're with the police.

280
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,192
Would you mind answering
a few questions?

281
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,567
I'm afraid the boy
ended up dying.

282
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,150
[UNKNOWN VOICES]
Oh.

283
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:02,150
Then will you protect
me in his place?

284
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,108
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER C]
Can you hear me? Hello!

285
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:15,233
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER B]
It's too tough to break through!

286
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,817
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER D] Copy.
Sir, no luck with the signals.

287
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,442
They're too heavily encrypted.
They'll take time to analyze.

288
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:28,067
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER C]
Cut the power cables.

289
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:37,483
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER A]
Soy sauce? No! It's gasoline!

290
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:40,650
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER C]
What happened?

291
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,442
[NISHIMURA]
Everyone out, now!

292
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:48,067
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER A]
This place is rigged to blow!

293
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,567
[NISHIMURA] I'm still not
picking up any drive to kill.

294
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,192
It's him, Momoki!
The Gravedigger!

295
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:00,108
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER E]
Put that fire out...

296
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:01,192
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER F]
Shit! Pull back!

297
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:02,400
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER G]
Keep clear!

298
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:03,650
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER H]
There could be more!

299
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:04,983
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER I]
We need emergency units!

300
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,025
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER J]
The flames are everywhere!

301
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,067
[MOMOKI]
Dispatch rescue immediately.

302
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,317
[HONDOMACHI]
Please look at this photo.

303
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,817
You've been here three times.

304
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,067
Once at age 13, and
twice when you were 14.

305
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,983
Is that right, Miss Inami?

306
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:20,442
To be honest,

307
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:23,233
I'm glad I can finally meet
someone he was close with.

308
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,692
Excuse me.

309
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:29,358
[HONDOMACHI] So, um, were you
aware of any other girls

310
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:31,692
who may've been close
with Mister Kazuta?

311
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:33,192
Perhaps even someone with whom

312
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:36,775
he may have had a
romantic connection?

313
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:38,233
Is something wrong?

314
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:40,608
[INAMI]
Nothing at all. Forgive me.

315
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:45,400
It's Miss Hondomachi, correct?
Such an unusual name.

316
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,275
I guess.

317
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,733
[INAMI] You're injured.
I hope it's nothing serious.

318
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:51,942
[HONDOMACHI]
Oh, this.

319
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:54,150
It's healing, but no
need to worry about me.

320
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:57,525
Sometimes if I move around
too much, it opens up again.

321
00:17:57,608 --> 00:18:00,358
Sorry for how
unpleasant it looks.

322
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,608
[INAMI]
Not at all.

323
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:06,025
There. You're good as new.

324
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:09,358
[HONDOMACHI]
I appreciate it.

325
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:12,233
Um, thank you very much, ma'am.

326
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:16,650
[INAMI]
No problem. So back to Kazuta.

327
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,942
It didn't seem like he was
dating, at least to me.

328
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:22,983
Plus, I never heard any
rumors saying otherwise.

329
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:26,442
I always assumed he wasn't
interested in seeing anyone.

330
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,650
At least, not during
middle school.

331
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,275
Well, that settles that.

332
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:33,233
Or could it be he was
actually dating someone,

333
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:35,192
possibly you, Miss Inami?

334
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:37,858
[INAMI]
Me? Don't be ridiculous.

335
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,192
To tell you the truth,

336
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,483
it didn't feel like we were
actually very close.

337
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,233
Even the times I
was invited over,

338
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:46,192
it was always with other people.

339
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,775
[HONDOMACHI] So the two
of you were just friends?

340
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,358
[INAMI]
Umm...

341
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:51,692
That's a bit of a stretch.

342
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,275
I'd say we were something
more distant than that.

343
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:56,692
[HONDOMACHI]
Oh, I see.

344
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:59,233
So then, it'd be safe
to say you had

345
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:01,567
no romantic interest
in him whatsoever?

346
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,942
[INAMI]
Right.

347
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,817
[HONDOMACHI] However,
you did go out of your way

348
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,650
to seek information on him.

349
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,900
Like if he was
in a relationship.

350
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,442
And in my eyes,

351
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,400
that's not something you do
if you don't have any interest.

352
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:16,692
[INAMI chuckles]

353
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:19,608
Guilty as charged, officer.
You caught me.

354
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,858
[HONDOMACHI] So what was
your relationship, really?

355
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:22,983
Oh...

356
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,317
[INAMI laughs]

357
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,817
You see, it's not like
the two of us dated

358
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,317
or anything like that.

359
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,400
It's just, surely, you
understand, Miss Hondomachi.

360
00:19:32,483 --> 00:19:33,733
Knowing someone likes you,

361
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:36,358
but they never seem able
to confess their feelings.

362
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,442
Honestly, I'm a little oblivious
to those sorts of things.

363
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:40,858
[INAMI giggles]

364
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:43,358
Don't expect me to believe
that a girl as cute as you

365
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:45,608
can't tell when somebody's
attracted to them.

366
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:47,067
Nah.

367
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,233
I never felt I was really all
that cute to begin with.

368
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,858
Though my situation wasn't
as bad as it is now.

369
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,025
You shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

370
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:56,733
Appearance doesn't determine
a girl's beauty.

371
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,983
In fact, I find you very cute.

372
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,275
Really, I appreciate
the compliment.

373
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:03,483
I just wish men and women
were more alike.

374
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,900
At least in terms of their
standards of beauty.

375
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:08,442
[INAMI giggles]

376
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:12,233
Same here. But I still mean it.

377
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:15,025
[HONDOMACHI] So, um, getting
back to the questions,

378
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:16,650
and you'll have to
forgive me for asking,

379
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:20,025
but you're not married,
correct, Miss Inami?

380
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,442
[INAMI]
That's right.

381
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:22,817
[HONDOMACHI]
And do you have a boyfriend

382
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,942
or anything like that?

383
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:25,025
[INAMI chuckles]

384
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:27,192
[INAMI]
Why? Are you interested in me?

385
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:29,192
[HONDOMACHI]
Uh. Sorry.

386
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,858
I think you may have
gotten the wrong idea.

387
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:33,275
[INAMI] I know you're just
investigating a case.

388
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,650
Of course you're not
really interested in me.

389
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:36,733
[INAMI chuckles]

390
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,275
I'm only joking with you.

391
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:42,108
As for dating, nope, no one.

392
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:43,650
[HONDOMACHI chuckles]

393
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,567
Have you ever had one?
A boyfriend?

394
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,358
Wow. Amazing how easily you
can pry without reservation.

395
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:53,150
It's just part of my job
to be overly curious.

396
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,400
Forgive me.

397
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:57,608
This is related to
the investigation?

398
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:59,817
I'm not sure yet.

399
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,942
[INAMI]
Of course I have. I am 27.

400
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:06,025
You're bound to date
someone by that age.

401
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:07,150
[MATSUOKA]
Hey! We've gotta go!

402
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,317
There's been an emergency!

403
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,817
I'm almost done here.

404
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,525
[MATSUOKA]
What?

405
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:13,192
[INAMI]
Are you sure?

406
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:14,733
[HONDOMACHI]
It's fine.

407
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:17,942
Now, you've had a boyfriend,
but not someone you truly loved.

408
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,275
Wow, you're good.

409
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:22,275
I suppose deep down
that's the way I truly felt.

410
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:24,525
[HONDOMACHI]
Why didn't you didn't love him?

411
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,900
Is it because you had feelings
for Haruka Kazuta instead?

412
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,067
I'm right, aren't I?

413
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,358
Don't be ridiculous, officer.

414
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:33,900
[INAMI chuckles]

415
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:36,108
[INAMI]
Then again, you may be right.

416
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:37,692
[MATSUOKA]
We need to go now.

417
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:39,108
[HONDOMACHI]
Understood.

418
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:40,900
Just one more thing.

419
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,817
Oh, I hope there's not any more
blood running down my forehead.

420
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,483
No. Sorry.

421
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,233
Forgive me, I have a habit
of staring sometimes.

422
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,608
Not a problem. So, um...

423
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,608
There's more?

424
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:56,817
[HONDOMACHI]
Actually, I'm finished.

425
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,858
Tell me, you love violence
and watching people die,

426
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:02,400
isn't that the truth?

427
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,150
Miss Inami, I think
there's something

428
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:05,817
you should know about me.

429
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,608
It's just, your old friend
Kazuta and I have kissed.

430
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:10,983
[chuckles]

431
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,483
[HONDOMACHI]
But you haven't, right?

432
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,192
Since your relationship
was platonic

433
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:16,150
and wasn't going anywhere.

434
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:17,567
Meaning?

435
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,483
Looks like I was wrong.

436
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:24,025
There is no conflict between his
romantic and murderous impulses.

437
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:25,275
Hands in the air!

438
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,900
Get up slowly and turn
your back towards me!

439
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:30,775
Then get on your knees! Do it!

440
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,358
[MATSUOKA]
Hondomachi! What's with the gun?

441
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,567
I was taking a page
from your book.

442
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,400
Oh. Also, this woman's
the Gravedigger.

443
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:42,067
Say what? But isn't it
supposed to be Kazuta?

444
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,275
[HONDOMACHI] She was the reason
he committed the six murders.

445
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:47,942
They were presents
for this sadist.

446
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:53,067
[HONDOMACHI] You're gonna tell
us where's hiding, right now!

447
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:33,900
[SAKAIDO] It's a shame
about your boyfriend dying.

448
00:24:33,983 --> 00:24:36,525
[UNKNOWN VOICES]
Not really. We weren't dating.

449
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,733
You weren't?

450
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:39,775
But I could've sworn
he was in love with you.

451
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:42,942
I don't think it's
your place to say.

452
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:47,275
If he feels that way,
then he should tell me himself.

453
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:51,108
[SAKAIDO]
Yeah, you're right.
