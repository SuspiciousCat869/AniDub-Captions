[HABUTAE]
Kiki Asukai.

2
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:18,150
Family resided in
Fukui Prefecture.

3
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:21,608
Rarely attended elementary
and middle school.

4
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:23,483
Expelled from boarding school.

5
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:26,275
Sent to an institution after
her parents disowned her.

6
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,650
First suicide attempt was at 18.

7
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:31,275
Hospitalized, released,
becomes an artist.

8
00:00:31,358 --> 00:00:34,775
Repeatedly institutionalized
after three more attempts.

9
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:37,900
At 21, she's kidnapped
by the Challenger.

10
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:40,275
Rescued by Momoki after
Narihisago went rogue

11
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:42,942
and shot her abductor.

12
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:44,483
She disappeared
three months later

13
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,650
while recovering
in the hospital.

14
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,650
Has never been found.

15
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:52,442
The night she vanished, several
nurses experienced comas.

16
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:55,275
Connection is unclear.

17
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:57,692
That's all the relevant
information Director Momoki

18
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,025
had stored on the cloud.

19
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:02,442
The director was independently
investigating what happened

20
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:04,650
to this Kiki Asukai person?

21
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,608
What for?

22
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:07,150
Unknown.

23
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,442
[WAKASHIKA] For 13 nurses
all to lose consciousness

24
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:11,025
at the same time...

25
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:12,942
Was some drug responsible?

26
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:14,317
[HABUTAE]
Also unknown.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,942
The only files here are
on the Challenger

28
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,150
and articles about
the coma incident.

29
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:19,858
Everything else is gone--

30
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:21,775
school, institution records,

31
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:24,733
hospitalization charts for
Asukai and the nurses.

32
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:26,275
They were wiped?

33
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:29,192
[HABUTAE] However, we do know
the person who scrubbed it.

34
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:31,608
It'd have to be
someone with access.

35
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:35,233
From the wellside... Momoki.

36
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:37,733
Bingo.

37
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:40,067
[TOGO]
Notify the Metropolitan Police.

38
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,567
[HABUTAE]
Ma'am.

39
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,775
As for now, let's continue
with Hondomachi's extraction.

40
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,692
Numbers, numbers,
and more numbers

41
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,983
as far as the eye can see.

42
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,567
This lightning feels like
it goes on forever, too.

43
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,775
That's what I'm workin' with.

44
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,025
Do they share some connection?

45
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,483
Could this seemingly random
arrangement of digits

46
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,233
hold any meaning?

47
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:37,317
Or are they just merely random?

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,192
Yeah. That's it.
There is no meaning whatsoever.

49
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:42,900
Deriving any sort of sequence

50
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:46,608
the lightning makes
is humanly impossible.

51
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:50,942
Too many numbers, and the
strikes are too far away.

52
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:54,150
In other words, you don't need
to ascertain the sequence

53
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,233
to survive this world.

54
00:03:56,317 --> 00:04:00,983
Which is perfect. Since there's
no way with so many numbers.

55
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:03,942
[gasps]

56
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,858
[TOGO]
That run lasted 137 seconds.

57
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,358
The third one that's
gone over two minutes.

58
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:10,900
You're improving.

59
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:13,983
That makes over 20 times
I've been struck by lightning.

60
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,358
You'd think I'd be used to it.

61
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:18,858
[TOGO] We're keeping a
close eye on your vitals.

62
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:22,317
Though we've noticed your
heartbeats become irregular.

63
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,108
There's no need to pretend
you're concerned about my life.

64
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:29,442
I realize I'm not the most
important one here.

65
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:32,942
[TOGO]
You saw the cockpit?

66
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:33,900
[FUKUDA]
Yeah.

67
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,067
[TOGO]
Good.

68
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,317
Seems it was no more
than 89 meters away.

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,067
Can you reach it?

70
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,192
I'm not sure. Shall we find out?

71
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:43,900
[TOGO]
No, that's not necessary.

72
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,192
Great news.

73
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,900
We've got another well
for you to dive into.

74
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:48,775
[FUKUDA sighs]

75
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:50,567
[FUKUDA]
Of course you do.

76
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,525
[humming]

77
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:04,150
We scanned the body
and the outfit,

78
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:07,817
but particles show up
in the bedroom?

79
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,150
Damn!

80
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,358
[TOGO] We're entering
Director Momoki's id well?

81
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:15,025
That's right. Akihito
Narihisago's had a cockpit,

82
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,858
so I imagine we'll also
find one inside Momoki's.

83
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:23,192
If there is and if it happens to
have Kiki Asukai's well loaded,

84
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:26,650
we might be able to bring
Miss Hondomachi back home.

85
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,900
But in order for this to work,

86
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:32,525
there needs to be a third
party to eject the pilot.

87
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:36,483
What a thought. Having serial
killers working together.

88
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:41,650
[FUKUDA]
Good to see you, partner.

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,067
Tell me, how's it feel

90
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,525
having someone wandering
around your unconscious?

91
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:59,108
Whatever goes on in the id
well doesn't affect my mind.

92
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,442
[FUKUDA]
True,

93
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,942
it's merely a drive to kill
gleaned from the past.

94
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:05,817
It couldn't possibly contain
your entire psyche.

95
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,358
And you of all people
must know

96
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:11,108
that's the core for
serial killers like us.

97
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:15,400
The kind of thing one could use
to drive a person to suicide,

98
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,317
if they were so inclined.

99
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,817
[GUARD A]
Cut the chit-chat.

100
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,150
Surely a courteous greeting

101
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,650
between colleagues
is allowed, right?

102
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,358
[TOGO]
It's Togo.

103
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:28,900
Fukuda and Mister Narihisago
will dive into the same well.

104
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:33,108
Why'd she address you as
"mister"? Do you know her?

105
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,733
[TOGO] Once inside,
you'll be strangers.

106
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:37,733
Try your best to work together.

107
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,817
[FUKUDA]
Permission to ask a question.

108
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Granted.

109
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,692
[FUKUDA]
If there're two detectives,

110
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,483
will there be two Kaerus?

111
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:46,317
We can't say for certain.

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,567
It's never been
attempted before,

113
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,567
but if there's any danger,
we'll extract you.

114
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,233
[FUKUDA]
Right. Right. One more thing.

115
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:56,817
I'm curious if you've
ever read a mystery.

116
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,942
What?

117
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,067
[FUKUDA]
A mystery. A detective story.

118
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,525
A few back when I was a student.

119
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:05,775
[FUKUDA] The classics,
with a brilliant detective?

120
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,942
Yes, of course.

121
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,817
[FUKUDA]
Then you'll understand.

122
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,317
You see, generally
speaking, two aren't able

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
to simultaneously exist
within a single novel.

124
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,317
If there's only one solution,

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,817
it stands to reason one of
the detective's theories

126
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,775
has to be incorrect.

127
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,233
The first detective
reveals the initial mystery

128
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,942
to the audience, only for
the second detective

129
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:29,483
to peel back the layers,
revealing an even deeper one.

130
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,692
Thus, turning the
story on its head.

131
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:34,233
You can't reasonably be
considered a brilliant detective

132
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:36,400
if you come to the
wrong conclusion.

133
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:39,608
Though I could see the first
detective being correct

134
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,983
if they only pretended their
initial findings were flawed.

135
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:46,150
In short, one of us will
inevitably lose their status

136
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,108
as "brilliant detective."

137
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:50,567
Then what will the
repercussions be?

138
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,775
Will this cause the fabricated
world to unravel?

139
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:56,942
[TOGO] I see no point in
debating the issue further.

140
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:58,442
[chuckles]

141
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:01,400
Well, if anything goes wrong
down there, then who cares?

142
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:03,942
You'll only be short
two serial killers.

143
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,317
You can't deny that's a
pretty fundamental problem

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,733
with this scenario.

145
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:11,358
[TOGO]
Injecting Sakaido and Anaido.

146
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:15,483
[KOKUFU]
Anaido's opened his eyes.

147
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,733
[HABUTAE] We aren't
receiving information yet.

148
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:20,317
Every aspect of this
is untested.

149
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,525
Be sure to make observations
with ample documentation.

150
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:25,608
Note anything out
of the ordinary.

151
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,900
Ma'am, Sakaido's waking up, too.

152

Data stream received.

153
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:53,483
[ANAIDO]
So, you're finally awake.

154
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,108
[SAKAIDO]
And who are you?

155
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,608
My name? I couldn't tell you.

156
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:08,733
Same here. I don't
know who I am either.

157
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:12,192
Heh. Well, that's
certainly inconvenient.

158
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:15,692
I wonder if that girl's
suffering from amnesia as well.

159
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,525
Wait, what girl?

160
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,025
[SAKAIDO]
Oh, crap!

161
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,692
It's Kaeru.

162
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,317
Kaeru, huh?

163
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,858
Seems they've awakened
and synced up.

164
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,900
Any warning signs so far?

165
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,358
None I see.

166
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:40,942
Good.

167
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:44,608
As of now they're both operating
successfully in the same well.

168
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:48,275
I'm not seeing anything but
sand for miles and miles.

169
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:51,233
Momoki's well is an
utter wasteland.

170
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:57,025
Sakaido.

171
00:09:57,108 --> 00:10:00,358
I suddenly remembered my name,
and one other thing,

172
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,650
I'm a brilliant detective.

173
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,400
No last name though.

174
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,650
I know my name is Anaido.

175
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,567
I guess I don't have
a last name either,

176
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,233
but I'm a brilliant detective.

177
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,650
A pleasure.

178
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,150
Yeah.

179
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:17,108
Wow! So cool!

180
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm trying to focus on the job.

181
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:20,900
Hey, same here.

182
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:25,108
Your job is to solve the mystery
of Kaeru's death? Really?

183
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:29,608
Regardless of how we got here,
it seems we share a common goal.

184
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:34,608
All right, so Kaeru doesn't
have any external wounds.

185
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:39,275
But... the hole indicates
she was looking for water.

186
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,692
We were unconscious
and buried in sand,

187
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:46,025
but she was awake,
exposed to the elements.

188
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:47,942
Which wore out her stamina.

189
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:52,067
Dehydration set in and
she died of organ failure.

190
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,108
Her cause of death doesn't
seem to be a mystery.

191
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,983
[SAKAIDO] Were we wearing
watches or something?

192
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,358
They're missing.

193
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:09,858
Seems someone stole them.

194
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:13,400
Whaddya say you and I track
down this watch thief?

195
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:15,858
His footprints
are still visible.

196
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,067
We can catch up to him
by following them

197
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,108
and see what he knows.

198
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,900
[SAKAIDO] Before we do,
let me ask you something.

199
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,692
Do you have any belongings?

200
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,317
Not a thing.

201
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,525
We have neither food nor water,

202
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:38,817
and if we move
around in this heat,

203
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
then chances are,
we'll end up dehydrated

204
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,733
and might even die ourselves.

205
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:45,692
Incredibly brutal,
but also pragmatic!

206
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:46,983
Could you not point at me?

207
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,483
[ANAIDO laughs]

208
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,108
[ANAIDO]
My turn to deduce.

209
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:53,483
Kaeru's body is here so
we can drink the blood

210
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:56,275
and eat the meat,
and thereby survive.

211
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:58,150
What the hell's wrong with you?

212
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:01,400
Blood has a fairly high amount
of salt concentration.

213
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:04,275
If we drink it, we'll only
end up being thirstier.

214
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:07,775
Besides, now's not the time
for us to be eating anything,

215
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:11,192
seeing how water is used
in the digestion process.

216
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:12,608
[ANAIDO]
Oh.

217
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:14,733
You sure you're a
brilliant detective?

218
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,608
[ANAIDO chuckles]

219
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:17,358
There's not a doubt in my mind.

220
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:18,733
[SAKAIDO]
Great.

221
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:21,442
We have to conserve
our hydration.

222
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:22,567
You know how?

223
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,608
Take your coat off.

224
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:25,483
I suppose I could
leave it behind.

225
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:26,608
It is rather warm.

226
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:27,942
No. Look.

227
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:29,983
You're still going to need
it to protect your body

228
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,358
from direct sunlight.

229
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:32,817
Why remove it then?

230
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,233
So you can soak it in urine.

231
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:38,192
[trickling]

232
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:40,900
[ANAIDO] Isn't this a waste
of perfectly good urine?

233
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,233
[SAKAIDO
"A waste"?

234
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,483
[ANAIDO]
It's our only source of water.

235
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:47,525
[SAKAIDO] You may as well
be drinking from the ocean.

236
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:51,358
Consuming it will just cause us
to dehydrate in the long run.

237
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:54,108
There are better uses.

238
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:57,400
Well, my clothes are
thoroughly drenched.

239
00:12:57,483 --> 00:12:58,942
Good.

240
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:01,817
This way, we should prevent some
water loss through our skin.

241
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,983
Hurry and wrap your coat
around your head.

242
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,275
This stinks.

243
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,442
But at least we don't have
to worry about heatstroke

244
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,858
and dehydration for a while.

245
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,733
Now, we can focus
on other matters.

246
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:25,233
Right. We're properly equipped
to track down our watch thief.

247
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:26,525
[SAKAIDO]
Not yet.

248
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:29,483
We haven't finished
processing the scene here.

249
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,317
And after we leave, the sand
will cover our footprints,

250
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,650
making it nearly impossible to
find our way back to her body.

251
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,067
Which means the thief's trail
will also get buried

252
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,067
if we don't follow it soon.

253
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,983
Maybe we should split up.

254
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,275
It's best not to act rashly.

255
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,650
We don't know anything
about our situation,

256
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:49,817
and we might not even
catch up to whoever was here.

257
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,275
The trail might disappear
partway, or more likely,

258
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:57,108
we both might run out of
steam before locating him.

259
00:13:57,192 --> 00:14:00,358
"Might." That word seems
to keep coming up.

260
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:01,567
I counted four times.

261
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,108
You mean three?

262
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:05,067
[ANAIDO]
I wish.

263
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,983
But I'll remind you of what
you said to me earlier.

264
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:09,900
"If we move around in this heat,

265
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,108
then chances are,
we'll end up dehydrated

266
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:15,067
and might even die, too."

267
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,233
Right, but that
still remains fact,

268
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,608
and I'm not saying we should
ignore the footsteps,

269
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,483
just that our deductions
should be prioritized.

270
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,317
What's left to deduce?

271
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,233
There's nothing suspicious
about her cause of death.

272
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,608
Meanwhile, we have prints
leading us to an actual mystery.

273
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:32,983
But not for long.

274
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:34,775
[SAKAIDO]
Just hold on.

275
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,858
[ANAIDO] The way I see it,
there are two of us here,

276
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:42,108
so maybe we're supposed
to split up.

277
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:44,983
Listen, I'll go on ahead,

278
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,608
and after you're through
solving this head-scratcher,

279
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:51,108
you can follow my trail.

280
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:54,983
Finish before the
wind erases mine.

281
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:57,817
Why is he in such a big rush?

282
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,233
I just want to assure you
not all brilliant detectives

283
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,108
act the same way as him.

284
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:07,858
Trust me.

285
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,483
[KOKUFU] No sign of
a single insect so far.

286
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,442
[SHIRATAKE]
And no plant life either.

287
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,025
One more observation.

288
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:22,317
As of yet, the sun hasn't
moved from its zenith

289
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,108
Time's frozen in place.

290
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:25,733
I'm impressed with
how long Anaido's

291
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:27,608
been able to survive out there.

292
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:31,025
Hopefully he'll be able to reach
whoever made those footprints.

293
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,108
Sakaido's on the move.

294
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,567
[SAKAIDO grunts]

295
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,733
I wondered when you'd catch up.

296
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,317
You all right?

297
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,858
Just peachy.

298
00:15:55,942 --> 00:16:00,108
Your legs are wobbling.
You're low on energy.

299
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,150
Do you think we'll be able to
find a way outta this desert?

300
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:04,275
Not likely.

301
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:05,317
[ANAIDO laughs]

302
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,067
What makes you so
sure, detective?

303
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,233
[SAKAIDO]
This place isn't normal.

304
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,983
The sun hasn't moved.

305
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:16,025
[ANAIDO]
Yeah. I was curious about that.

306
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,275
Could Earth's revolutions
have suddenly increased?

307
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,108
Or the speed of rotation slowed?

308
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:24,192
I don't think either
is the issue.

309
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,942
This place, I get the feeling
it's an endless desert world

310
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:30,942
and nothing else exists
except more dunes.

311
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:33,400
Even if there was
something out of sight,

312
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:36,983
I doubt it's possible
for us to reach it.

313
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,900
So this planet's comprised
of five things.

314
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:42,442
There's a ton of sand,
Kaeru's body,

315
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:44,608
the wristwatch thief
who may hold the truth

316
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,358
about what happened to her,

317
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:48,983
and of course, us,
the brilliant detectives.

318
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:50,650
[chuckles]

319
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,692
Sounds like once we've
wrapped up this case,

320
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:55,650
the world will lose
its raison d'être.

321
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:57,650
You forgot him.

322
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:02,858
[yelps]

323
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,817
[ANAIDO laughs]

324
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,317
Who's the one unsteady
on his feet now?

325
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,900
[SAKAIDO]
The sand gave way. Not me.

326
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,358
Dammit!

327
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,483
That's quicksand. This I know.

328
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,275
Don't panic.

329
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:30,900
The more you struggle and flail,
the faster it'll suck you in.

330
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,567
And here I was thinkin' you were
well-versed in desert survival,

331
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,317
but it looks as though
you're only an expert

332
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,942
when it comes to piss and blood.

333
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,192
You think this is funny?

334
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,025
[ANAIDO]
All pits are the same.

335
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:50,692
The more you struggle to escape,
the stronger its hold becomes.

336
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:52,275
[SAKAIDO]
Ugh. Spare me.

337
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:54,442
I'm not finished yet.

338
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:55,858
Hell is a sinkhole,

339
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,817
but it takes time before
completely swallowing someone.

340
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,983
Before that happens, you can
gradually crawl your way out.

341
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:22,525
I'll be damned. Guess he really
is a brilliant detective.

342
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:23,983
Hey, I heard that!

343
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,692
I told you, didn't I?

344
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:27,650
Heh.

345
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,650
I don't know if you'll be
more or less impressed

346
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,900
when I tell you I know how to
avoid sinking in quicksand,

347
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:35,817
but not the way to escape.

348
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,442
I just applied general theory

349
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,567
concerning hell
to the situation.

350
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,192
Glad it worked out for you,
though. Brother.

351
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:45,650
Brother, huh? Heh.

352
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,817
You're a strange one.

353
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:51,233
[DETECTIVE A] Not gonna
give us anything, huh?

354
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:54,233
Come on. Help out
a fellow officer.

355
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,400
I would if I was
in your position.

356
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:57,650
Fine then.

357
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,983
Guess we'll just have to
depend on your friends.

358
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:01,317
Why get a confession

359
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,067
when they can deliver
the missing pieces, right?

360
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,442
[DETECTIVE A laughs]

361
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:07,067
So how does it feel knowing
the people you once led

362
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,150
are busy trying
to take you down?

363
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,817
They're inside a well?

364
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,275
[DETECTIVE B] That's right,
pal. Guess which one.

365
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:15,150
Not mine.

366
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,317
[gasps] Get them out!

367
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,192
[thud]

368
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:19,650
[COLLEAGUE C]
Huh?

369
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:20,983
[MOMOKI grunts]

370
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:23,233
They need to extract, now!

371
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:28,650
[SAKAIDO]
Are you okay?

372
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:31,983
Yeah. Don't pretend you are.

373
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,233
I could still carry you.

374
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:37,192
Don't expect you'd
make it too far if you did.

375
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,817
[ANAIDO]
Only one of us needs to survive.

376
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,525
But if we go down
at the same time...

377
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,483
[SAKAIDO]
You bring up a good point.

378
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:48,733
Then I volunteer to die. I kinda
get the feeling I should.

379
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:50,858
[SAKAIDO]
Hold on before you do.

380
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:52,358
I mean it.

381
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,650
I'm sure, but I don't think
you need to just yet. Look.

382
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,067
[ANAIDO]
Hm?

383
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:07,400
Something tells me the
wind didn't cause this.

384
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:09,942
That is brilliant.

385
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:11,525
[SAKAIDO laughs]

386
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:14,900
[BOTH laugh]

387
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:17,108
I solved the mystery!

388
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:20,442
[SAKAIDO]
He made it all this way

389
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:22,817
only to drown in the quicksand.

390
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,525
Talk about unlucky.

391
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,275
[ANAIDO chuckles]

392
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,192
What do you say we get a look
at this watch thief of ours?

393
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,692
Sure.

394
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:34,525
We made it here together, huh?

395
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,567
[WAKASHIKA] Give us a break
and just dig him up.

396
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:45,275
Quicksand alone didn't
do that to his face.

397
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:52,192
Run a facial reconstruction.

398
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,358
[HABUTAE]
Ma'am.

399
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:57,275
Hey. What's that?

400
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:00,275
[gasps]

401
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,692
[WAKASHIKA]
A Mizuhanome.

402
00:21:03,817 --> 00:21:06,400
Some kind of chair?

403
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:20,358
The quicksand may
have taken his life,

404
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:22,775
but since his footprints
lead right up to this,

405
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:24,817
he must've wanted us to find it.

406
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,942
[ANAIDO]
Mh-hm.

407
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:27,525
Maybe that was the whole point,

408
00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:30,733
since stealing a watch in the
desert seems a little peculiar.

409
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:33,525
Don't tell me you're
just realizing that.

410
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,275
I thought you called
him the "watch thief"

411
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:37,525
because we needed
a moniker for him.

412
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:38,858
[ANAIDO]
What?

413
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:43,567
Well, regardless, this
machine was waiting for us.

414
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:47,567
[ANAIDO]
Hmm...

415
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,483
Look at this.

416
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:52,483
[gasps]

417
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,233
Kiki Asukai.

418
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:57,942
Name doesn't ring a bell.

419
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,817
And I've no idea
what this means.

420
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,483
But for now, we'll hit "enter"
and see what happens.

421
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,983
Wait ten minutes,
then hit eject.

422
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:15,275
Well, that's not very long.
We may even be alive by then.

423
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:18,775
And finally close this case.

424
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:22,567
I guess so. Best of
luck, Detective.

425
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,900
Yeah.

426
00:22:24,983 --> 00:22:27,775
Are you sure, Director?
No extraction?

427
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:31,317
I'm acting director.
Nothing has been finalized.

428
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,192
Yes. We're letting
Sakaido do this.

429
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:37,775
It seems like the Mizuhanome
wanted them to find it.

430
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,775
Not to mention this
is why we dispatched

431
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,275
two brilliant detectives
in the first place.

432
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:45,567
Best case scenario, it leads
to a well within a well,

433
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,775
and diving in will help us
find where Hondomachi is.

434
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:51,650
And it could provide
more info on Kiki Asukai.

435
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:54,192
It'd help to know
more about her.

436
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:58,025
[ANAIDO] My sixth sense is
telling me something's wrong,

437
00:22:58,108 --> 00:22:59,150
but oh, well.

438
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:01,525
Then trust me. Let's do this.

439
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,692
"Let's" do this.

440
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:06,192
[SAKAIDO] You and I are
brilliant detectives.

441
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,317
We were right about everything.

442
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,358
All the events were
carefully arranged

443
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:12,775
so we would arrive
at this point...

444
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,400
...this conclusion.

445
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:19,400
They need to extract!
It was all a trap!
