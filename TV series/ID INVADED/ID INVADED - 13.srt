1
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:13,775
What?

2
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:17,942
[screams]

3
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,358
[URAIDO]
How very cruel.

4
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:30,317
This id well must derive from
the killer's first memory.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,025
One that was equally as cruel.

6
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:35,067
[SAKAIDO]
Take this!

7
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:46,692
[cries]

8
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:49,567
[URAIDO] I'd suggest not
shouting beforehand--

9
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,275
ruins the element of surprise.

10
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:54,275
Hm?

11
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:56,400
Plus, it seems you woke him up.

12
00:00:56,483 --> 00:01:01,150
Bastard! You're in no
position to lecture anyone!

13
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,233
[SAKAIDO yells]

14
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,483
[URAIDO]
I'm disappointed.

15
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:13,108
Such speech is unbefitting
a brilliant detective.

16
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:16,650
I take it you remember
who you are, Narihisago.

17
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:17,900
Well, yeah.

18
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:19,983
If you don't remember
your own tragic past,

19
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:23,483
you can't take revenge on
the person who's responsible.

20
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,233
That's a terrible notion.

21
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:27,525
What's all this talk
about revenge?

22
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:31,650
You and I are both brilliant
detectives and serial killers.

23
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,192
Why can't we get along?

24
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:36,233
[SAKAIDO] We're not alike,
you fucking psychopath.

25
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:38,233
[URAIDO] I'm astonished
to hear you say that.

26
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:41,900
Precisely what
distinguishes you from me?

27
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:45,900
A brilliant detective is one
who inquires. I'm doing that.

28
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:47,817
Making inquiries for
the sake of justice,

29
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,025
although in my own way.

30
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:53,775
Still, I can't help it if you
don't appreciate my methods.

31
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,233
Ha.

32
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,983
Yes!

33
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,817
Nice, Hondomachi.

34
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,942
[HIJIRIIDO]
Glad to help, Mr. Sakaido,

35
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:10,775
but please, call me Hijiriido
when we're in the well.

36
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:12,025
[SAKAIDO]
Okay.

37
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:15,400
But your real name is...
Never mind. You got it.

38
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:20,817
[chuckles]

39
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,358
[URAIDO]
That wasn't very nice of you.

40
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:27,442
Though it does illustrate
my point. Yes?

41
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:29,192
You and I are no different.

42
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:32,483
The three of us are driven
to ensnare and kill.

43
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:37,150
As for justice, that depends
on the criteria used to judge.

44
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,858
Even if my version can't
be found in this world,

45
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:42,692
outside is another
story, is it not?

46
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:45,775
I simply must do what
I can from within here.

47
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:48,067
Unfortunately,
I'm unable to leave.

48
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,442
So the Mizuhanome has no choice
but to repair my data.

49
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:57,483
And, Miss Hondomachi-- Oh.

50
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:01,483
Excuse me, you prefer to
be called Miss Hijiriido.

51
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,275
I applaud your creativity,

52
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:06,317
but you're dealing with
a brilliant detective.

53
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,483
I recall you were trapped in
a storm within your well--

54
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,733
till you exploited Fukuda's
abilities to escape.

55
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,400
[HIJIRIIDO] I wouldn't
have made it without him.

56
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:19,233
But still, that doesn't
mean I used him.

57
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,108
The way I understand it,

58
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:26,317
a gentleman's hat
is important to him.

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,650
[URAIDO]
Hm?

60
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:31,692
[sighs] I suppose that
was meant to provoke me.

61
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:34,025
Guess I'll play along.

62
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,942
[gunshot]

63
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:41,067
[MATSUOKA]
You okay, Momoki?

64
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,733
[MOMOKI] My head was spinning
as soon as I entered.

65
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:45,108
Also nauseous.

66
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,942
Seems Kiki Asukai's
powers have grown

67
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:51,233
and the suit can't keep up.

68
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:54,108
[MATSUOKA]
Unfortunately, it's all we got.

69
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,817
I'll hurry.

70
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:03,067
[yells]

71
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:09,150
Boom! Down you go!

72
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,150
Quick, put it on!

73
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,942
You truly think playing hide and
seek will accomplish anything?

74
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,733
Are you joking?

75
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:38,108
You don't have brains!
I'm the smart one!

76
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,983
There it is!
Just past the house.

77
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:05,650
[SAKAIDO]
You!

78
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:13,358
[groans]

79
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,775
My friend, I believe revenge

80
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,817
should be executed
more elegantly.

81
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,525
No one asked.

82
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:27,942
Can you stand?

83
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,483
[URAIDO] Please, don't strain
yourself on my account.

84
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:31,983
Remain seated.

85
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:36,150
Now let's all calm down and
talk like civilized people.

86
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:39,525
So, where is Fukuda?

87
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:42,317
You went through all the trouble
of luring me into his well.

88
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Let me guess, he's waiting for
your signal to spring a trap.

89
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:49,150
Of course, it's doubtful whether
you can depend on him

90
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,900
to be a third pillar.

91
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,567
The man's an insult to
brilliant detectives like us.

92
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,608
Well, I think you're gonna
be in for a nasty shock.

93
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,025
Just you wait.

94
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,275
Not another unsophisticated
surprise attack, I hope.

95
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:04,442
Come on. You don't know?

96
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,067
[URAIDO]
Hm?

97
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,442
[SAKAIDO chuckles]

98
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,358
[BOTH chuckle]

99
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:10,900
He still hasn't noticed.

100
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,608
It must've slipped his mind
that he's dealing with

101
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:15,067
a couple of brilliant
detectives.

102
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,192
[URAIDO]
Hmm.

103
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:18,733
[SAKAIDO]
Hold on.

104
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:20,192
What's wrong?

105
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:23,733
I thought we were gonna be
civilized and discuss this.

106
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:27,817
Now, that's more like it.

107
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,858
Narihisago, I wanna
do the honors.

108
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:36,442
But before I start,
I have a question.

109
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,108
It's about the number seven.

110
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:40,358
What it's mean to
you, Mr. Uraido?

111
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,108
Sorry, I mean, Chief Hayaseura.

112
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:46,025
It is a divine number.
The Bible aside, it's--

113
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:47,483
[HIJIRIIDO laughs]

114
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,567
[HIJIRIIDO]
That's what I thought.

115
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,692
So this was all about
your God complex.

116
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:57,233
What you said earlier,
about justice,

117
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,400
how you had your own sense
of the word, I believe you.

118
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:01,983
Look at the facts.

119
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,442
Not only did you
limit the number

120
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,733
of serial killers you created,

121
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:09,192
but you extended the same
rule to their victims.

122
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,150
Never more than seven.

123
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:14,025
And once you hit your goal...

124
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:16,942
...you intended
to kill yourself.

125
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:18,108
Clever.

126
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:19,775
Except, you're only counting

127
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:22,733
the Challenger, the
Gravedigger, et cetera.

128
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,525
It seems I ended up
creating an eighth. Him.

129
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:26,567
Huh?

130
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,150
[URAIDO]
"The Cornerer." You like it?

131
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:32,275
You can't be serious. That's
even worse than the others.

132
00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:35,358
You're wrong, because he's
not a serial killer.

133
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,983
His victims, all of
those murderers,

134
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,400
were pushed into suicide.

135
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:45,192
In other words, to make sure
you'd be apprehended in the end,

136
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:46,775
you created the Cornerer.

137
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:47,900
[gasps]

138
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,317
That's absurd!

139
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,025
What you're saying is the serial
killer rules he invented

140
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:53,858
apply directly to himself.

141
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:56,650
And once you reach your
limit of seven victims,

142
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,233
it's either death or arrest.

143
00:07:58,317 --> 00:07:59,775
With zero exceptions made.

144
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:01,900
[URAIDO] You're wrong!
I did no such thing.

145
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,192
[HIJIRIIDO] You can deny it,
but there's always

146
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,483
the possibility you
acted unconsciously.

147
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,317
You're a detective, too.

148
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,858
I guess you have some
sense of justice.

149
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:15,275
But I have a job to
stop people like you

150
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:17,067
from carrying out their plots.

151
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,775
I won't let Mr. Narihisago play
out the role you assigned him.

152
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:24,733
You manipulated people's lives
as if you were a god.

153
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:28,608
No one else will ever
have that misfortune.

154
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:29,983
What?!

155
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,650
[URAIDO]
This isn't the plan.

156
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,275
Hey. You were right.

157
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,858
If you really do want a
surprise attack to work,

158
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,567
it's best to keep
your mouth shut.

159
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,858
It's over.

160
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:44,358
Oh. One more thing.

They say management's
biggest failure

162

is that they don't
know the work.

00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:51,400
Or maybe, I have
a slight advantage

164
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:54,108
since the hole in my head
does affect my perception

165

when it comes to missing pieces.

00:08:56,608 --> 00:09:01,567
Take you for example.
You're not sitting in a chair.

What I can see is the

And, Chief, we had
a little help.

From Fukuda.

Stop. Don't do this!

So he's in the well,
and it should be collapsing.

Where do you think
that he'll appear?

before you went to Fukuda's.

[SAKAIDO] Nope. Just hope

we should embrace hope.

in a stranger

321
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:17,358
Sakaido and Hijiriido.
They're alive inside the well!

322
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:19,233
Extract!

323
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,817
[GUARD A gasps]

324
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,900
[HONDOMACHI] Calm down.
Just go get the medics.

325
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,150
[NARIHISAGO]
Hondomachi.

326
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,900
[HONDOMACHI]
Mh-mh.

327
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,358
[NARIHISAGO]
It's okay.

328
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:41,692
You're allowed to cry, you know.

329
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:44,733
Yeah. That's really
all I needed.

330
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,900
One tear is perfect for him.

331
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,900
All right.

332
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:56,108
[MUKU] You are coming back
home, aren't you, Dad?

333
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:59,442
I am.

334
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:03,817
One day, I'll be
with them again.

335
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,108
But not today.

336
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:14,150
Sometimes it's good
to run out of tears.

337
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,317
[HONDOMACHI] And so,
the curtain has been closed

338
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,900
on the John Walker case.

339
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:24,275
Hayaseura's death was
labeled a suicide

340
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,358
caused by mental breakdown.

341
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:32,858
Once again, the truth about the
Mizuhanome has been concealed.

342
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:36,775
And, as always, the facts
surrounding the case,

343
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:39,483
the victims, and the
existence of personnel

344
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:45,817
who remain comatose
will never be made public.

345
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,525
All staff involved knew
the Kura Organization

346
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:51,650
requires absolute
confidentiality.

347
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,650
Whatever happens here,
be it a life-changing event

348
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:58,733
or just a workplace
secret, stays hidden.

349
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:03,025
[MOMOKI]
Narihisago. Hondomachi.

350
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:04,233
You ready?

351
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:05,942
Let's do this!

352
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:07,233
[groans]

353
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:09,233
[MOMOKI]
Are you up to this physically?

354
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:11,067
I can handle it.

355
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,233
[MOMOKI] This is a new id well.
Don't lose your head.

356
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:15,483
I know.

357
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,067
But once we dive inside,
we won't be ourselves.

358
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,067
Will that make a difference?

359
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,108
We're counting on you to make
a difference, Hondomachi.

360
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,275
[HONDOMACHI]
Roger! I'll do my best!

361
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:28,733
I'm actually pretty excited to
see a new killer's id well.

362
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:30,983
Good luck to you guys!

363
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,483
She might be a little too happy.

364
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:34,858
Heh.

365
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:38,108
This is perfect
for her. No doubt.

366
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:40,942
C'mon, rookie!

367
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,025
[KOKUFU]
Sorry I'm late.

368
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:44,108
We have authorization
for the well.

369
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:45,608
[MOMOKI]
Copy that.

370
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:48,233
I imagine we'll have some
confusion about the new system.

371
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:50,983
But I know you can
handle it, acting chief.

372
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,358
Sir!

373
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:55,483
[NARIHISAGO] I thought we'd
be working in shifts.

374
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:56,692
[MOMOKI]
Not this time.

375
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,692
The real-world investigation
takes priority

376
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,150
over the mystery in the id well.

377
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:03,608
We'll need quantity
and quality information,

378
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:05,858
plus analysis gathered
from the well.

379
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:08,233
Roger that.

380
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:11,150
Now, ready to inject.

381
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,525
[NARIHISAGO]
Across this expanse,

382
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:18,233
their voices don't reach me.

383
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:20,400
Even if I could hear them,

384
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:23,192
I would have no idea
who was speaking.

385
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,692
I have no idea who I truly am.

386
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:29,358
My old self waits
on the outside.

387
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:33,025
And when I open my eyes,
ready to face death,

388
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:38,733
what I see out before me
is a strange new world.

389
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:42,650
The only familiar thing here,
the one constant,

390
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:46,192
is the lifeless face of a girl.

391
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:50,525
She's been murdered.
I'm here to solve her mystery.

392
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:55,067
I learn my new name.
Then, I understand.

393
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,650
Everything in this world
holds some meaning.

394
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:03,400
My life and her death
are intertwined.

395
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:06,692
There's a job that can only
be done in this world

396
00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:10,942
and I'm the only one who can
see it through to the end.

397
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:14,317
My name is Sakaido.

398
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,733
The brilliant detective.
