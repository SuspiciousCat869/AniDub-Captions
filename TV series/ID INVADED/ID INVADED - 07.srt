The "Challenger,"

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,317

a martial artist.

I'll do my best.

54
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:56,692
[MOMOKI]
As we predicted,

55
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,608
when our pilot dived into
the Challenger's well,

56
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:00,942
John Walker was present.

57
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,733
We can assume the following:

58
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:04,650
While watching Tamotsu Fukuda,

59
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:08,567
he found Kazuta,
as well as Nahoshi Inami.

60
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,733
His surveillance on
Denshin Katsuyama,

61
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:12,525
also known as the Challenger,

62
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:16,442
may have been an effort to
create a new serial killer.

63
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,025
Furthermore, the only
people who entered

64
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:20,358
Katsuyama's house
were his victims,

65
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:21,983
as well as the man who shot him,

66
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,942
former-officer...
Akihito Narihisago.

67
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:30,233
Okay, but Narihisago
shot the Challenger

68
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:32,275
right as he entered
the residence,

69
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:36,817
so doesn't that rule out John
Walker influencing the crime?

70
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,233
Walker may have already
had his sights on him

71
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:41,025
and entered his unconscious.

72
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,233
It could've been before
he met the Challenger,

73
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:45,525
perhaps even many years before.

74
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:48,858
It's possible, but for
that to be the case,

75
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:51,067
then not only did John
Walker turn Narihisago

76
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,650
into a serial killer,

77
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,858
he's also responsible for
creating the murderer

00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:03,442
Why?

161
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,900
Kaeru! Do you want me
to die here, too?

162
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,483
[HIJIRIIDO]
No.

163
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:14,067
Death isn't important,
and neither is surviving.

164
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,983
Escaping the lightening
isn't my task.

165
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:20,317
I'm here to solve the
mystery of Kaeru's death.

166
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,108
Simply put, the mystery is:

167
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:28,067
Why is Kaeru dead and
handcuffed to my arm?

168
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,317
[HIJIRIIDO]
Did she attach these herself?

169
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,025
No. That's impossible.

170
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:37,442
If she put the cuffs on me,

171
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:40,692
I'd be dead from the lightning
bolt that struck her.

172
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:43,525
It must've been a third party.

173
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:46,900
[HIJIRIIDO]
But why?

174
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:53,650
[HIJIRIIDO]
Got it.

175
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:08,275
[HIJIRIIDO]
It was him.

176
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:09,692
[gasps]

177
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:13,150
[NARIHISAGO'S WIFE]
Aki!

178
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,150
Dad, if you can hear
us say something!

179
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:18,650
[NARIHISAGO grunts]

180
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,317
[FUKUDA]
Heh. What good will that do?

181
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,317
Do you think hitting your
head against the wall

182
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,317
will make the machine respond?

183
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,358
[NARIHISAGO] Killing myself
wouldn't erase my id well,

184
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,650
and it wouldn't stop
the Mizuhanome.

185
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,233
[FUKUDA] See? No point in
getting worked up, brother.

186
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,025
[NARIHISAGO]
Shut up!

187
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:43,400
What's wrong with them?
They're insane.

188
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,900
[HIJIRIIDO] These handcuffs
were placed on her

189
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:50,275
after she was dead.

190
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:54,025
To make it so I wouldn't
move from this spot.

191
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:56,108
I'm guessing this man
probably believed

192
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,525
lightening doesn't strike
the same place twice.

193
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,025
[HIJIRIIDO]
But that's just a myth.

194
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,900
The truth is, the
probability of lightening

195
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:09,150
striking a particular
spot doesn't change much.

196
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,733
In actuality,

197
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:13,817
it's possible for real lightning
to strike the same place twice,

198
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,275
or even more.

199
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:18,650
If this is real lightning...

200
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:24,358
[HIJIRIIDO] You'd think so,
but there's something off.

201
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:28,275
Almost like it's fake.

202
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:37,567
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

203
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:46,442
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

204
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,900
I knew it!

205
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:49,275
[HIJIRIIDO]
It only feels random

206
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:50,942
because the distance
of the strikes

207
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:53,650
changes the interval
of the thunderclaps,

208
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,483
but the lightning strikes
remain constant.

209
00:13:56,567 --> 00:14:00,983
There's about nine seconds
between each of the flashes.

210
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,692
This isn't a natural phenomenon.
It's artificial.

211
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:09,192
Chances are it won't strike
the same place twice.

212
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:13,192
Which is why I was
being kept here.

213
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:16,317
Based on how everyone
is running and screaming,

214
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,942
they don't know.

215
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,942
But he did, so why
keep it a secret?

216
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:28,817
Whatever the case, he saved me
first, then was struck himself.

217
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:34,858
[HIJIRIIDO] He's gone. But
there's something I can do.

218
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,233
[HIJIRIIDO]
Everyone! Calm down!

219
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:54,858
Listen to me!
There isn't much time.

220
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:57,233
Find a tile that's
already been hit.

221
00:14:57,317 --> 00:15:00,067
The lighting won't
strike there again!

222
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:21,483
[HIJIRIIDO] One, two,
three, four, five, six,

223
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,817
seven, eight, nine.

224
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:33,400
Every nine seconds,
I can move between the panels.

225
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,067
Don't worry.

226
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,067
As long as you remember
to stay on the tiles

227
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,275
that have already been struck,

228
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,108
then you should
be perfectly fine.

229
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,483
What do you mean "fine"?

230
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:47,358
There's no telling how long
this is gonna go on!

231
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:50,067
You know something?
You're right.

232
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,942
But I know the longer it does,

233
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:54,983
the more the safety zone will
gradually keep expanding.

234
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:58,900
Look around us! There are
people dying over there!

235
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:02,233
How're we supposed to help them?

236
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:03,692
You're right.

237
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:06,150
They need somebody to
come and rescue them.

238
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,358
Thing is, that's not my job.

239
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:09,608
As the brilliant detective,

240
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:13,358
my responsibility is
solving mysteries.

241
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:16,233
I've already explained
how the lightning works.

242
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:18,775
If you're really concerned
about helping others,

243
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:21,483
I think you should go
do something about it.

244
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,025
Besides, if I made it this far,

245
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,317
you should be able
to reach them.

246
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:29,692
Well, she isn't wrong,

247
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:32,650
but the way she worded it,
just seemed kinda cold.

248
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,692
Every brilliant detective
has quirks unique

249
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,858
to their personality.

250
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:40,275
She's right. We know how
to escape the lightning.

251
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:42,567
This lady gave us
everything we need.

252
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,067
It's up to us to make this
world a better place.

253
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,192
So we have to go and try to
rescue those people, mom.

254
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,733
Okay.

255
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:53,067
Ha. Amazing.

256
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,192
She sounds exactly
like the real Muku.

Yep. All of us.
We have to do our part.

258
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:07,400
Speaking of, I've
gotta go. Best of luck!

259

Thanks for everything,
Miss Detective! I mean, um--

260
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:14,025
Name's Hijiriido.

261
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:26,150
It can't be.

262
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,483
That's a cockpit.

263
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:30,150
But how? The Kura
launched a year ago!

264
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,525
This well is from particles
way before that.

265
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,775
Someone's been using it.

266
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:38,775
Do you mean... that Mizuhanome
is linking this id well

267
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,692
to his present unconscious?

268
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:42,067
Appears so.

269
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,442
But shouldn't it always link us
back into the past?

270
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:48,358
Oh, man. What's next?

271
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:59,442

Looks like some kind of chair.

I don't believe it.

00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:09,192
Run a search! Who is she?

[MOMOKI]
The Challenger's last victim.

After Narihisago took
revenge... I rescued her.

but I never thought I'd see
her name in his well.

279

Everyone! Stay where you are!

You're joking.
We're mid-investigation.

Get out, now!

[MOMOKI]
Hm?

Please respect whatever orders
these investigators give.

286
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,025
What's going on?

287
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:50,942
Funetaro Momoki, you're
suspected of inducing a murder.

288
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:54,567
That's quite an accusation.
Who, exactly?

289
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,775
[DETECTIVE B] At least half
a dozen serial killers,

290
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:58,442
Mister Momoki.

291
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:01,692
Or rather, should I address
you as John Walker?

292
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:02,942
[gasps]

293
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:05,108
We've analyzed the data
from the mic and cameras

294
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:06,692
found in Fukuda's house

295
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:09,442
and confirmed you accessed
them on several occasions

296
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,858
from your computer.

297
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:11,900
That can't be.

298
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,317
It's some sort of mistake!

299
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,317
Mistake? More like a setup!

300
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,525
And what's more,

301
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:19,233
we found a body buried
in the director's yard.

302
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,692
As you can imagine,

303
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:23,900
we've got a few questions
concerning how it got there.

304
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:25,483
[HAYASEURA]
Look here.

305
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,775
This was taken outside
Momoki's residence.

306
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:31,442
We've received a
match on the DNA.

307
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:35,150
It belongs to Nishio Shirakoma.

308
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:39,025
Seems we've found the missing
inventor of the Mizuhanome.

309
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:42,525
Momoki, I'm afraid you'll
need to explain this.

310
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:45,067
He's been dead all this time?

311
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,442

312
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:49,692
[TOGO]
What does she think she's doing?

313
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:50,983

[TOGO] Unable. The apparatus
isn't responding!

315
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,608
She dived in a well
within a well.

316
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:00,233

317
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:04,275
This man is under arrest!
No one move.

318
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,233
He's been relieved of his duty.

319
00:20:06,317 --> 00:20:09,942
As for the new director,
I appoint you, Miss Togo.

320
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:10,942
[TOGO]
But, sir!

321
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:12,650
We have an emergency.

322
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,733
Your first priority
is finding a way

323
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:17,400
to extract your
brilliant detective.

324
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,275
[TOGO] Everyone,
return to your stations.

325
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:24,692
[INVESTIGATOR A]
We need forensics in here.

326
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,067
You're not gonna believe
what we found.

327
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:32,067
Dammit. I don't know
what's going on anywhere!

328
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,692
Did you find John Walker
inside my well?

329
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:39,025
[TOGO]
How did you know we--?

330
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:41,358
Was he there?

331
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:44,108
A brilliant detective
even outside the well.

332
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:46,442
Here's our conclusion.

333
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:49,942
When our pilot went in, John
Walker was nowhere to be found.

334
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:51,317
That's a relief.

335
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,317
But if he was, it wouldn't
change the fact

336
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
I have to take responsibility
for my actions.

337
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:59,400
There's another matter I need
to inform you of today.

338
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:00,775
It's about--

339
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,400
[NARIHISAGO] Something to do
with Momoki's absence.

340
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:05,817
Regardless of whatever
you found in my well,

341
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,442
he'd tell me in person
and never send someone else

342
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:10,108
to deliver the message.

343
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:13,108
So, you gonna tell
me where he is?

344
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:15,733
The director has been--

345
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,150
Momoki was placed under arrest.

346
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,317
Charges?

347
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,608
In addition to being involved

348
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:24,567
in the murder of the
Mizuhanome's inventor,

349
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,150
he's been charged with
causing the deaths

350
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,650
of at least 44 individuals.

351
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:33,900
Also, creating numerous serial
killers as John Walker.

352
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,692
You're lying.

353
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:38,567
Where's the proof? I wanna see!

354
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:48,192
[TOGO] A body was discovered
buried on his property.

355
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:54,150
Don't move!

356
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,108
[WAKASHIKA gasps]

357
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:56,483
What did you find?

358
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,275
It's just... I'm not sure
if I found this too late

359
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:01,817
or figured it out right
in the nick of time,

360
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,025
but I think I cracked
the sequence.

361
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:07,692
Look at this. It's a
recording from earlier.

362
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:10,817
Five, three, eight, six,
seven, one, four.

363
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,692
This was the section within
Hijiriido's field of vision,

364
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:17,233
so I tried something and bingo.

365
00:22:17,317 --> 00:22:18,358
It's pi.

366
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:20,275
Archimedes' constant.

367
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:21,442
[WAKASHIKA]
Right.

368
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:23,483
They say every possible
pattern of numbers

369
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:25,650
appears within its sequence.

370
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:30,442
Even though they seem random,
they adhere to an order.

371
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:31,983
The section we
managed to pick up

372
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,233
in the id well is no different.

373
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:41,817
It shows up for the first time
at the 10,375,576th digit of pi.

374
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,775
The lightning occurred
every 9.03 seconds.

375
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:52,775
The first was 93,691,451.28
seconds prior.

376
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:57,150
Let's see. That should make
1,084 days, which would be...

377
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:58,817
The same day
Narihisago's daughter

378
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
ended up being
murdered, correct?

379
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:02,817
How the hell did you know that?

380
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,483
It is his id well.

381
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,942
And you weren't making it
that difficult to guess.

382
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:08,567
[sighs]

383
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,442
[WAKASHIKA]
I suppose.

384
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:13,983
[NARIHISAGO]
Once you have Momoki's well,

385
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,025
I want in.

386
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:18,775
I need to see what's
in there myself!
