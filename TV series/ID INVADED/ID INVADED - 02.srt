[HONDOMACHI gasps]

2
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:49,733
[HONDOMACHI] It's picking up
more cognition particles.

3
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:51,067
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER A]
That's odd.

4
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,525
Are you sure they're coming
from inside the house?

5
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,692
[HONDOMACHI] There have been
instances of Wakumusubi

6
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:59,275
detecting windborne particles
from distant crime scenes.

7
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:00,983
But since we haven't
heard reports

8
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,233
of any murders occurring
elsewhere,

9
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:05,608
I think this reading
must be from the house.

10
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,108
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER A] Could
it be sensing our willingness

11
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,108
to gun down the killer?

12
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:10,108
[HONDOMACHI]
Your willingness to kill

13
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:12,067
is tied to your
sense of morality.

14
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,692
It's derived from
higher thought.

15
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:16,692
This device only
detects base impulses.

Freeze! You're under arrest!

Comply or we'll shoot!

Drop the weapon right now!

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,942

right there! Get on your knees!

moving or we will open fire!

[gasps]

00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,483
That head wound isn't bleeding.

[MEDICAL UNIT MEMBER B]
You're right.

Suspect captured.

00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,733
He's the only other
person down here.

32
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,650
Wait a minute.

Yuji Oonuki.

Hey! You all right?

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,983
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER A]
Huh?

38
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,817
The hell? What's going on?

39
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,692
The Perforator
kidnapped Hondomachi

40
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:31,817
and fled through the sewers.

41
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,650
But how was he able
to pull this off?

42
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:34,900
I get it.

43
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,192
The man posed as a victim,

44
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,275
just as he did
within the id well.

45
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:39,442
Interesting.

46
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:42,192
It seems there's a hole
in his head, too.

47
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:44,400
He gives people wounds
that match his own.

48
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:45,733
Question is why.

49
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,733
Once you finish
solving the case,

00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:51,150
we would appreciate it if you'd
leave our house for good.

You're new.

[SAKAIDO] But yeah,
of course I'm gonna leave.

Just as soon as I've
caught the bad guy.

[SAKAIDO] How is he able
to move like that?

58
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,733
He's ignoring the
structure of this world.

00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,817
There must be a reason.

00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,483
It's John Walker!

66
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,150
I want everyone but Togo and
Kokufu to shift their focus

67
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,567
onto John Walker.

Focus on finding her!

72
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:27,025
We haven't abandoned the search
by any means, Matsuoka.

73
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:28,733
But this demands our attention.

74
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:29,775
[MATSUOKA]
Why?

75
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:32,108
Because it's him. John Walker.

76
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:34,775
It looks like the Perforator
knew him, too.

77
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:38,900
Shit. She's got the Wakamusubi.
We should've put a GPS on it!

78
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:40,775
I would have.

79
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:42,608
[HAYASEURA]
But that's not an option.

80
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:44,442
As it would be antithetical
to our goal

81
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:47,275
of keeping this tool secret.

82
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,025
Hello, Chief Hayaseura.

[MATSUOKA]
I blame you for this, Chief.

84
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:52,108
Hondomachi was kidnapped

85
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:54,400
because you don't think
enough of your field officers.

86
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:55,608
I assure you,

87
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:57,525
I think quite highly
of our field officers.

88
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,483
You do very important work.

89
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,358
[MATSUOKA]
I'm not talking about our work.

I know you value that--

91
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,567
it's our lives you
don't care about!

92
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,400
We step into dangerous
situations every day.

93
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,650
We should all have clearance
to carry side-arms!

94
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:12,108
I've been telling you
that for months now!

95
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:14,233
[HAYASEURA] Your request
hasn't been rejected,

96
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:15,817
but these things take time.

97
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,525
As I think you must be aware,

98
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:19,358
the Kura and the Wellside
already receive

99
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:23,275
preferential treatment over
other police organizations.

100
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:26,525
My apologies,
but for the time being,

101
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:29,608
we should focus on finding
Ms. Hondomachi and the suspect.

102
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:32,733
Yeah, no shit!

103

Dammit!

104
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,900
[SAKAIDO] This tells me
something else about myself.

105

I'm not the fighting type, but
I'll still do it if I have to.

So what are you?
Are we enemies?

That went well. Too well.

00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:10,608
Okay. Well, let's just say
I'm overpowered and move on.

00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,025
Go me!

00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:16,692
[SAKAIDO chuckles]

112
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:22,067
Now then.

[gasps]

114
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:33,900
[FUKUDA]
So you're awake.

115
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,733
You located my house,

116
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:39,275
but I also built hideouts
throughout the city.

117
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,442
It always pays to
be prepared, right?

118
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:45,025
So you've been confining
your victims here as well.

119
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:48,483
I don't get it though.
Why not kill them right away?

120
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:52,025
Let's just say I've got
a whole lot on my mind.

121
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:54,733
[FUKUDA]
Hey.

122
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:57,775
This odd device of
yours, how's it work?

123
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,108
[FUKUDA]
Listen.

124
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm about to drill a hole
in your head to match mine,

125
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,150
but few people have
been able to answer

126
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,150
my questions afterwards,

127
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:13,025
so it would be best if you
and I talked now, understand?

128
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:16,525
"Few people"? You mean they
don't all die instantly?

129
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:20,775
No one I drill dies instantly.
All of us linger for a time.

130
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:22,858
There's a chance that
the guy I left in my house

131
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:25,067
could live as long as I have.

132
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,733
Assuming he hasn't been
shot in my place yet.

133
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:31,108
It sounds like you're saying
you drilled a hole

134
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:32,733
in your own head first,

135
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,233
and then started
doing it to others.

136
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:38,567
So what, are you trying
to start a club?

137
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,817
First wind comes in this hole,
then it goes out of the other,

138
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,567
and it makes the world
a little bit clearer.

139
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,108
Wait a sec.

140
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,525
Do you think that these holes
are somehow helping people?

141
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:52,358
However things may appear
in that scrambled head of yours,

142
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,608
you're dead wrong.

143
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:54,942
You're nothing more
than a killer,

144
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:58,025
and hide though you might,
you will be found again.

145
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:01,108
My colleagues are gonna put
you behind bars, understand?

146
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,650
If you really wanna help people,

147
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:06,025
then you can save them some
trouble and turn yourself in!

148
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:11,525
Right, so, are you gonna tell me
how this thing works or not?

149
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,150
I can start drilling now,

150
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,192
or you can buy some
time by explaining

151
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:19,400
how you managed to find me.

152
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:23,567
[SAKAIDO] Of all places,
why did the killer decide

153
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,275
to hide inside Kaeru?

154
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,900
And why didn't he
try to run for it

155
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,942
once the coast was clear?

156
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:32,192
I was outta the
room for a while.

157
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:35,192
Could've escaped easily...

158
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,442
With that wall missing,

159
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:40,525
he wouldn't even need to
open the door or window.

160
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:47,817
[SAKAIDO] Wait...
what if from his perspective

161
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
there were four walls
in this room?

162
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:53,900
This disjointed world is
a product of his mind.

163
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:58,275
So maybe to him it seems like
everything's connected normally.

164
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:02,942
If so, then maybe to his eyes,
this room is as good as sealed.

165
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:05,692
But what about the guy who
was freaking out the residents?

166
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,733
How does he play into this?

167
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,317
Now there's an idea.

168
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,733
It could be that the killer was
afraid of this guy as well.

169
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,567
So he locked himself up in here

170
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,150
and used Kaeru's corpse
to play possum.

171
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,942
I get it now.

172
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:22,608
For our serial killer,
Tamotsu Fukuda,

173
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:24,608
that broken world seems
perfectly normal

174
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,692
because it matches
his broken mind.

175
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:29,525
The guy doesn't seem to realize
how messed up he is.

176
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:31,233
That does seem to be the case.

177
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,733
I think it might have something
to do with the gaping hole

178
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,692
he has in his right
frontal cortex.

179
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,900
The profile we've built
so far would suggest

180
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:40,400
that he thinks people are
fundamentally broken.

181
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:42,567
If he believes the hole
in his head fixed him,

182
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,608
then he might wanna fix us now.

183
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:49,608
And he's got the rookie.
So it's a matter of time... Oh.

184
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,567
[MATSUOKA]
Momoki.

185
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,650
We still haven't
found Fukuda yet.

186
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,692
But if things get desperate,

187
00:10:55,775 --> 00:11:00,358
Hondomachi does have a way to
alert us... and guide us to her.

188
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:02,692
Not that it's pleasant
to consider.

189
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:06,608
Right. We'll be ready for that.

190
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,067
[SAKAIDO]
Hm?

191
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,942
[MATSUOKA]
Hondomachi.

192
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,692
Just don't do
anything too crazy.

193
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:40,567
[HONDOMACHI] Okay. I'll tell
you about the device.

194
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,900
It's called a Wakumusubi.

195
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:45,900
It was named after the son of
the well goddess, Mizuhanome.

196
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:47,275
He's a harvest god.

197
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:50,525
In a way, the Wakumusubi
is a harvesting tool.

198
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:53,192
[HONDOMACHI]
Hey.

199
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:56,108
Don't just stand there spinning
your drill while I talk.

200
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:02,150
Do wanna know how to use it?
All right, then I'll show you!

201
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,025
It looks like another id
well's beginning to form.

202
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:09,817
Checking our field
officers' Wakumusubis.

203
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,483
Let's see what we've got.

204
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,983
Crap, the new id well's coming
from the rookie's device, sir!

205
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,983
Extract Sakaido! He needs
to switch wells at once.

206
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,483
This isn't my home! Let me go!

207
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:27,900
[SAKAIDO yelling]

208
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:32,858
[MOMOKI]
Sorry, Narihisago,

209
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:35,650
but I need you to dive
into a different well.

210
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:36,942
[NARIHISAGO sighs]

211
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:38,692
[NARIHISAGO]
Understood.

212
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,192
You okay?

213
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:42,400
[NARIHISAGO]
Livin' the dream.

214
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:44,483
Go ahead and drop him in.

215
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:01,900
[SAKAIDO]
I've got no idea where I am.

216
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:05,900
Or what the hell's
going on here.

217
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:10,233
What I do know is that
dead girl's name.

218
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:14,275
She's Kaeru. And I'm Sakaido.

219
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,150
I can't remember my full name,

220
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:19,150
but I know I'm the
brilliant detective.

221
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:23,942
Which means it's my job to solve
the mystery of her murder.

222
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:27,192
Wait. Was she murdered?

223
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,025
It doesn't look like
there's an actual mystery

224
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,275
for me to solve here.

225
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:42,775
[SAKAIDO]
But if that's the case,

226
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:45,817
what's the point
of my existence?

227
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,192
Odd that her feet are bound.
Why would she tie them together?

228
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:52,108
Did she think she'd look
more composed that way, or--?

229
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,358
Sakaido was just killed!

230
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:01,358
He was in the well
for 68.25 seconds.

231
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:03,442
Now beginning analysis.

232
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:05,400
I found Koharu Hondomachi.

233
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:08,067
There's a reflection of her
face on the tip of the drill.

234
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,858
Then there should be other
things reflected on it, too.

235
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,108
Find them!

236
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:14,108
It appears she's tied to
a stainless-steel table.

237
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,400
The kind used in restaurants.

238
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:17,858
There's a nearby industrial
refrigerator, too.

239
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,400
[TOGO]
I found her Wakumusubi.

240
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,608
Based on the angle that the
light it emits was reflected,

241
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:24,692
we can put the room's size
at roughly six by six meters.

242
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:26,067
There's an abandoned restaurant

243
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,525
just about three kilometers
from Fukuda's house.

244
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,483
Blueprints are downloaded!

245
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:33,442
Our projection is a match for
the restaurant's basement.

246
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,067
Did you hear that, Matsuoka?

247
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,900
Yeah. I'm on my way now.

248
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,317
That's what it detects?
The intent to kill?

249
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,275
You told the truth.

250
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,233
It really didn't
kill me right away.

251
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:57,817
Thank you.

252
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,608
What for?

253
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:02,442
[FUKUDA] I drilled into
quite a few people's heads,

254
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,108
but it never helped.

255
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:08,025
And now, thanks to you,
I see why that is.

256
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,858
I wasn't doing it right.

257
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:14,275
People have to fix themselves.
Drill their own holes.

258
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:17,067
Did you really drill
through your own head?

259
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,858
[FUKUDA]
Yeah. I felt like I had to.

260
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:22,775
What does that mean?

261
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:26,650
[FUKUDA]
How's the breeze?

262
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:31,317
Right now,
everything is just cold.

263
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,733
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER D]
Freeze!

264
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:33,775
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER B]
Get away from the girl and drop

265
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:35,900
to your knees,
you hear me, dirtbag?

266
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,942
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER C]
Move in!

267
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,233
Hondomachi!

268
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:40,317
[ASSAULT TEAM MEMBER D]
Her head's bleeding.

269
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,150
But she has a pulse!

270
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,150
Get her outta here! Now!

271
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,525
You'll come and pay me a visit

272
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:49,275
if you manage to pull
through, won't you?

273
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:54,900
[TOGO]
Subject has been apprehended.

274
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:56,525
En route to HQ now.

275
00:15:56,608 --> 00:16:00,317
[MOMOKI] Got it. Let me
know when they arrive.

276
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,567
How's the rookie?

277
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,358
[TOGO]
We just heard from the hospital.

278
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,858
She's holding on,
so far at least.

279
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,900
What are you--?

280
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,067
Thank you, everybody,
for your help.

281
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,358
Now I need to thank him.

282
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,317
[MOMOKI]
Good work in there.

283
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,067
Thank you for saying so.

284
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,025
Well, we did it.
The killer's in our custody.

285
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,733
[NARIHISAGO]
Oh. That's good.

286
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:33,358
That was a close encounter
with John Walker.

287
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,525
Your thoughts?

288
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,025
I dunno.

289
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:39,483
He was all blurry n' hollow--
there wasn't much to see.

290
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,692
Do you know why he
was like that?

291
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,317
This was the killer's
unconscious mind.

292
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,442
There are countless
interpretations.

293
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:47,817
For now at least.

294
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,608
Even with a team of analysts?

295
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:52,025
Ya must've found
at least one clue.

296
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:53,400
[MOMOKI]
No.

297
00:16:53,483 --> 00:16:56,025
When it comes to John Walker,
we're at square one.

298
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:58,233
[NARIHISAGO]
I could dive again.

299
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:04,192
Yeah. I'm sure.

300
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,108
I feel just fine, I swear.

301
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,275
I've kicked the bucket in the
well plenty, ya get used to it.

302
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:12,192
[MOMOKI] You're still
experiencing death each time.

303
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:14,483
That takes a toll on you.
I'm sure of it.

304
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,233
[NARIHISAGO]
Are you now?

305
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:18,483
Then I won't bother arguing.

306
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,442
I can dive again.

307
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,483
[NARIHISAGO] Is that girl
from your unit okay?

308
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,150
I know the killer had
her for a while,

309
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:30,442
but she fought back, right?

310
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:31,858
How did you know?

311
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:33,483
A switch flipped somewhere,

312
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,358
and she went from
a docile little drone

313
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,233
to a determined rebel.

314
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,400
Since no one else changed,

315
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:40,150
I figured the real
girl did something

316
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,650
to shake up the
killer's view of her.

317
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:46,192
Yeah. She fought and
paid the price.

318
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,650
But it's thanks to her
that we got the guy.

319
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,233
[NARIHISAGO]
I get it now.

320
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:54,192
So the second id well
I dove into today was hers.

321
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:58,025
That's pretty damn impressive.
A determined suicide.

322
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:00,733
This was a single incident,
but as a result of it,

323
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:04,192
I bet there'll be new elements
in the killer's well now.

324
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:06,317
I really look forward
to seeing them.

325
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,567
[MOMOKI]
Whenever you dive,

326
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,233
you forget who you are
and everything you know.

327
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:13,233
I'm surprised that
doesn't bother you.

328
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,650
[NARIHISAGO] Oh, that's
part of the fun for me.

329
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,275
Plus, I get to see Kaeru,

330
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:19,775
which is almost like
seeing my daughter.

331
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:22,400
In that both of them
are always dead.

332
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,817
It's been about two
years, right?

333
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,525
[NARIHISAGO] Noticed something
funny about the killer.

334
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,817
The way he hid with Kaeru

335
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,525
showed that he knew
they were both broken.

336
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,442
But he wasn't able to
see that the same thing

337
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,608
was true for his world.

338
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:39,942
Self-deception works
in strange ways, huh?

339
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:43,025
We all wanna think we see
the world for what it is.

340
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:45,233
It's just that simple, right?

341
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,608
It might be. I'm not sure.

342
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,025
You okay?

343
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:52,525
I mean, you saw the killer
hide inside Kaeru's body.

344
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,983
Seeing her corpse get
used like that,

345
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,692
it must've bothered you.

346
00:18:57,775 --> 00:18:59,900
Kaeru isn't Muku.

347
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:01,483
You need to insulate your psyche

348
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,442
from the worlds
you're diving into.

349
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,650
Also, remember that you dive

350
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,733
in order to assist
our investigation,

351
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:10,525
not to root out the killer's
mental weaknesses.

352
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,692
You've driven some to suicide.
We can't have a repeat.

353
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,192
[NARIHISAGO]
A repeat?

354
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:22,108
Think at this point it'd
be more like a five-peat.

355
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,108
I'm just teasing.

356
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:28,608
I never intend to
do that again.

357
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:30,400
But for me to stop completely,

358
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,983
I think I'd probably have to
stop going into wells at all.

359
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:35,650
And let's be real,

360
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:39,025
that isn't much of an
option for either of us.

361
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,067
[HAYASEURA]
Tamotsu Fukuda makes five.

362
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,483
Five serial killers that
appear to have dealt

363
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,317
with this John Walker.

364
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,275
[TOGO] Do you think it's
possible that this guy's

365
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:58,858
manipulating their
unconscious minds?

366
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:00,067
[HAYASEURA sighs]

367
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,858
It's hard to say.

368
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:05,025
Kura has been in operation
for about six months now.

369
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:07,358
A brief time, but you've
used it to peer into

370
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:10,817
a great number of serial
killers' wells already.

371
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,567
So I'd be curious to hear
what you think is possible.

372
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:20,442
[TOGO] In the past, I doubted
that John Walker was real.

373
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:22,858
I believed he was meant to
embody some characteristics

374
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:26,025
shared by a number of
different serial killers.

375
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:29,275
I thought he was a symbol
made by the Mizuhanome.

376
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,900
I see.

377
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:34,900
Like how it always creates Kaeru
as a freshly murdered corpse.

378
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,275
Right.

379
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:38,358
I thought he might be a
default setting of the wells

380
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:40,067
that the Mizuhanome generates,

381
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,858
one with a function
that we hadn't

382
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:44,067
fully come to understand yet.

383
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:46,608
Well, I haven't
seen any evidence

384
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,483
that would contradict
that line of thinking,

385
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,317
so far at least.

386
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,108
And furthermore,
there's the Mizuhanome.

387
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:55,067
It remains a mystery
with all of us

388
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,442
still trying to interpret
how it works.

389
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,483
Perhaps Momoki is
overly concerned

390
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,733
with this John Walker fellow.

391
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,358
[TOGO]
I think he has a natural desire

392
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:06,233
to understand the tool
he's using, sir.

393
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:08,692
In any case, seeing
the residents' reaction

394
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:10,442
to John Walker when he appeared,

395
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:12,650
and how it seemed to
frighten all of them,

396
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,025
was enough to convince me.

397
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:19,067
They were completely
unfazed by Kaeru's corpse.

398
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,400
Because that was created
by the Mizuhanome.

399
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,275
The fear they displayed
was a reflection

400
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,525
of the feelings
of the well's owner.

401
00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:29,317
We know John Walker is real

402
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,942
because we know the
Perforator remembers him.

403
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,192
Moreover...

404
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,067
...we know he can leave
quite the impression,

405
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,858
one that can be felt in the id.

406
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:38,525
This is more theory than fact,

407
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:41,150
but I think he can affect
a person's urge to kill.

408
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,608
As for how or why someone

409
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:45,442
would go about doing
that, I can't say.

410
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:47,775
I've already done a great
deal more speculating

411
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:49,608
than I'm comfortable with, sir.

412
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:51,192
I see.

413
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,358
Then we have no choice

414
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:54,608
except to consider
the matter in earnest.

415
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:57,108
If someone is making
serial killers,

416
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,192
then we need to stop them.

417
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:49,067
[NARIHISAGO] You chose
to die, but by hanging.

418
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,067
You never wanted to be
torn apart by a drill.

419
00:22:58,775 --> 00:23:01,067
[NARIHISAGO]
I'm sorry, Kaeru.

420
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,025
I should've moved you to safety.

421
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:08,192
Next time I dive into that
well, if there's time,

422
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:13,108
I'm sure Sakaido will find
a way to do that for you.

423
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:16,358
He's the brilliant detective.

424
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,900
He'll know.
