to the three of you,
but the truth is,

43
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:07,567
I've never in my life
actually killed anyone.

44

[HAYASEURA]
I am an officer of the law.

Although you may
not be convinced,

46
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:17,358
I possess my own
sense of justice.

In accordance with that,

48
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,525
I'm turning the Kura
into a giant Mizuhanome.

49

That way we'll be
able to investigate

on a much larger scale.

[NARIHISAGO]
You call any of this justice?

54
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:43,983
I made the Kura, used it to
catch numerous serial killers,

55
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:47,775
and yes, I'm responsible
for creating some.

But look what it's accomplished.

57

The world will realize
it was the moral choice,

58
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:56,275
and the benefits far
outweighed the costs.

drastic, but to me...

[URAIDO]
Obviously the little bitch

82
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:41,025
made it easy to solve her murder
because she wanted me to be free

00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:44,983
to uncover the larger
secret of this world.

84

[URAIDO] Upon seeing this face,
I remember who I am.

My real name is
Takuhiko Hayaseura.

Under any other circumstance,

87
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,608
that revelation would
cause a well storm

I'm already dead,

Heh. As though it matters.

If that's one of the
rules of this world,

I've never seen an id
well like this before.

Not to mention only killers
can go into an id well.

There's no sign of Kaeru.

[WAKASHIKA]
You mean Kiki Asukai.

131

Last we saw her, she was
walking the halls of the Kura.

132
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:54,192
So if we assume that's the
Mizuhanome's true form...

133
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:57,067
...then she is the Mizuhanome.

Which explains the
well within the well.

Of course it belonged to her.

[TOGO gasps]

137
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:04,983
My theory is this is happening

138
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,608
because she was released
from the machine.

139
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,567
Think back to the
hospital incident.

140
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,817
She vanished, then what?

141

fell into a coma.

Exactly.

143
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:21,817
What if we're still in wellside,

unconscious and sharing
the same dream,

145
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:27,233
just like what happened
with the nurses?

146
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,442

Uh. Look!

Run!

152
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,150
So if we get killed
while we're in here,

153
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,233
do we just wake up
back in the real world?

154
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:55,692
You got a theory on that?

Excellent question!

156
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,817
So if 4 out of the 13
nurses are still in a coma,

157
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,317
that comes out to a 69% chance
of us exiting this nightmare,

00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,692
Any word from wellside?

164
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:29,900
Right now, we still don't know
what's really going on in there.

165
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:33,067
All we have to go by is
this security footage.

166
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,650
Look.

167
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,067
[MOMOKI]
No.

168
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,525
It's happening again.

169
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:40,067
Again? What do you mean?

170
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,442
Asukai.

171
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:42,608
Who?

172
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:44,025
Are you taking about
the missing victims

173
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:45,400
from the Challenger case?

174
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:48,692
I had suspicions that she
was kidnapped and used

175
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,275
to develop the Mizuhanome.

176
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:54,942
I never imagined all this time
she was under our noses.

177
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,775
[MATSUOKA]
This gets stranger and stranger.

178
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:05,942
You said it.

179
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,692
The Kura has turned into
one giant Mizuhanome.

180
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,025
[MOMOKI]
There's Chief Hayaseura.

181
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:17,567
Yeah.

182
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,733
He was busy while we were in
shock over the arrest warrant.

183
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:22,608
Must've entered his own well.

184
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,858
And he intends to live there.

185
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:28,900
It's pretty obvious
that's his escape plan.

186
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,900
Our options are limited.

187
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,358
We've no choice.

188
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:37,608
If this phenomenon is being
caused by Kiki Asukai,

189
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,192
we're going to have
to contain her.

190
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:42,442
Contain? You mean put
her back in a hospital?

191
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:45,192
No. Inside the Mizuhanome.

192
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,650
Huh?

193
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,650
If I'm being honest,

194
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:52,067
I don't think there's any
other place she can go.

195
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,442
And how do we do
that? See them?

196
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,525
If we storm the Kura or
get anywhere near her,

197
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,150
we'll end up the same.

198
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:03,317
[MOMOKI] Simple.
We'll take countermeasures.

199
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
The last time this happened,

200
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:08,150
someone was able to
get in and abduct her.

201
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:10,525
We'll use the same
method they did.

202
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,192
What is this place?

203
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:18,733
Stay alert, Hijiriido!

204
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:19,858
We're gonna need more than

205
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:22,358
our brilliant detective
skills for this!

206
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:23,567
[gasps]

207
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:28,108
[laughs]

208
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:30,858
An astute observation, indeed.

209
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,942
However, no matter
how brilliant you are,

210
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,483
this place holds a secret
that's beyond you!

211
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:36,525
[gasps]

212
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,483
[URAIDO]
So I'll ruin the mystery!

213
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,150
Your name is Koharu Hondomachi.

214
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:45,108
And if you're curious where
we are, this is your id well!

215
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,358
[gasps]

216
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,983
[laughing]

217
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,317
Hijiriido!

218
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,150
Quick, before you're
caught in the storm!

219
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,525
Whatever you do,
don't let him get away!

220
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,275
Go to the lightning well!

221
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,942
Find it and remember
who you are!

222
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:06,442
What you have to do for
the world, then find me!

223
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,942
[HIJIRIIDO]
I'm not dead.

224
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:48,067
[FUKUDA chuckles]

225
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,400
Hey, good catch, huh?

226
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:53,733
I knew you'd make it, Fukuda

227
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,275
[MATSUOKA]
That it?

228
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,817
[MOMOKI]
Yes.

229
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,108
This is the same helmet used
during the hospital incident.

230
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:48,150
Sort of a prototype Mizuhanome.

231
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,817
'Fraid we're gonna need
to seize this as evidence.

232
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,858
But you can't!

233
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:54,900
Sir, we should go.

234
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,358
Especially since we don't
have a court order.

235
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:01,608
Not just yet. Confiscate
their med supply.

236
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:13,650
Fukuda?

237
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:16,567
Right here.

238
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,983
[HIJIRIIDO]
Thanks for saving me.

239
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,567
But how'd you remember
the exact number of steps

240
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,067
it took to reach Kaeru?

241
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,858
[FUKUDA] What can I say?
I love and hate numbers.

242
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,775
So, what's the plan?

243
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:31,858
I'm going after him, of course.

244
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:32,983
You coming?

245
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,567
Perhaps if I was a
brilliant detective,

246
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,317
but I can't keep up with you
and have no reason to follow.

247
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,067
Plus, I found your drive
to kill quite stunning.

248
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,942
I think I'd enjoy spending
some more time there.

249
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:48,775
Well, that sounds
a little creepy.

250
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:50,483
Oh, real quick:

251
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:53,275
I wanted to get your expert
opinion on something.

252
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:54,900
How do you feel about seven?

253
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,775
It's not that bad of a number,

254
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:59,775
though I don't like the
people who're into it.

255
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,567
So pretentious.

256
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,942
What do you mean?

257
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,483
[FUKUDA]
For just a prime number,

258
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:07,942
it has all this societal and
storytelling weight attached.

259
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:11,400
People have fallen in love
with it for the wrong reason.

260
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:14,733
I see. Good to know.

261
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,608
Well, later!

262
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:20,692
[FUKUDA] Come on!
How could you be so cruel?

263
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:33,942
Just one hole... and no more.

264
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,567
[HIJIRIIDO]
Fukuda!

265
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,442
[FUKUDA chuckles]

266
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:43,858
Funny.

267
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:48,275
I meant to shout out,
"Here's my chance!" just now,

268
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,442
but for some reason,
it all came out wrong.

269
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,400
[HIJIRIIDO]
One hole?

270
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:58,817
It's my one-track mind. Sorry.

271
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,358
[HIJIRIIDO]
Mind outta the gutter.

272
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:01,775
What?

273
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:06,442
Oh, I, uh... wasn't being
crass just now.

274
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:09,858
[HIJIRIIDO]
Nahoshi Inami.

275
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:15,608
[FUKUDA chuckles]

276
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:20,233
It's my turn to give
you my thanks.

277
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:23,983
I'm so happy that I was
able to save you.

278
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:29,608
"Here's my chance" to have
two wishes granted.

279
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:36,567
[HIJIRIIDO]
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

280
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:43,692
[HIJIRIIDO]
Your scar? I stopped seeing it.

281
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:47,692
Whenever something's missing,
removed, fragmented,

282
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:51,108
it doesn't look that way to me.

283
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:53,442
I see it as complete.

284
00:18:56,317 --> 00:19:02,400
[HIJIRIIDO] That's how...
I managed to find Nahoshi Inami.

285
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:04,650
It was no coincidence.

286
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,733
[chuckles]

287
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,275
Oh, yeah?

288
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,567
Never got the opportunity
to visit myself,

289
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,483
but I'm sure you would've
liked my id well.

290
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:23,650
So, you no longer see my hole.

291
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:26,567
That makes three wishes granted.

292
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:33,942
And three... is beautiful.

293
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,317
[INAMI chuckles]

294
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,858
[INAMI] You killed my man,
and I killed yours.

295
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:49,733
Guess we're even now.

296
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:52,608
[HIJIRIIDO]
He wasn't "my man."

297
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:57,525
[INAMI] After all this, I think
my wish'll be granted, too.

298
00:19:57,608 --> 00:20:00,983
This mask, it'll let me
see Kazuta, right?

299
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,483
No, don't!

300
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,608
Kazuta.

301
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:23,150
Hey, Inami. I missed
you so much.

302
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,233
But you really need
to hide right now.

303
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,817
There's a super scary
monster here.

304
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:53,233
[INAMI chokes]

305
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:57,650
K... Kazuta...

306
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:03,692
I always... I loved...

307
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:22,733
[SAKAIDO]
Hondomachi.

308
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:27,483
[HIJIRIIDO] You remembered,
didn't you, Narihisago?

309
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:31,567
I did. Are you okay?

310
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:36,317
Yeah.

311
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,525
Once we find a way
out of the well,

312
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:41,192
everyone who lost their life,

313
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:44,858
do you think their deaths
will be undone?

314
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,067
[SAKAIDO]
Who knows?

315
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,775
But I have a feeling the people

316
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:51,900
who still have a reason
to come back will.

317
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,775
I really hope that's true.

318
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:56,025
Me, too.

319
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:59,025
I'll live. How about you?

320
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:01,900
For sure.

321
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:04,650
Hear that, ya
cane-toting bastard?

322
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,692
The brilliant detectives
that you created

323
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:08,775
are gonna send you
straight to hell!

324
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,400
[HIJIRIIDO]
That's way too dark.

325
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:13,650
I say we hit him with the
spark of life, instead!

326
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:14,900
[SAKAIDO]
What?

327
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:16,775
Fine, we'll go with that then.

328
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:18,275
[HIJIRIIDO]
All right!

329
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:59,025
I'm sorry, sir. It'll be a
little tight in the chest.

330
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:01,942
We couldn't get the size
right on such short notice.

331
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,067
It'll work.

332
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,858
We'll be observing
you the whole time,

333
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:07,317
monitoring your vitals
from in here.

334
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,900
If you want to track them,
just use the helmet display.

335
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,150
[MOMOKI]
Got it.

336
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,775
It's time.

337
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,942
[MATSUOKA]
Momoki.

338
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:20,358
What if she refuses to go
back in the Mizuhanome?

339
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:30,150
So be it. The lives of my
subordinates come first.

340
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:34,733
[MOMOKI]
You're in charge, Matsuoka.

341
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:37,983
Right. Good luck in there.

342
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,983
I'll see you soon.
