[NARIHISAGO] I've never
seen this building before,

2
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:19,942
but... must be my apartment.

00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:25,358
[NARIHISAGO]
Because my wife, she's here.

[NARIHISAGO]
My wife is laughing.

6
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,233
[NARIHISAGO] Back then we didn't
even need a reason to laugh.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,733
[MUKU] Dad, you've made
outstanding contributions

8
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:41,567
at work several times, right?

9
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,817
Do you think that's
probably because

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,275
you were just cut out
to be a police officer?

11
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:48,275
I think it's more likely
I've been really lucky.

12
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:50,567
Am I cut out for it,
though? Can't say.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,525
You're lucky, huh?

14
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:54,275
Then, uh, can you
say if you think

15
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:56,525
I might be cut out
to be an officer?

16
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:58,358
Huh... Hmm...

17
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:00,567
[NARIHISAGO]
This never happened.

18
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,733
From the moment I became
a homicide detective,

19
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:05,525
I was always busy with work.

20
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:09,608
And I doubt Muku would've
ever wanted to be an officer.

21
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:13,483
Truth is, I was never cut
out to be on the force.

22
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,608
I couldn't even protect
my own family.

[MEDICAL EXAMINER A] She and
the killer had a fistfight.

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,900
She must have defended
herself bravely.

25
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:30,442
She's perfect.

26
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,817
[NARIHISAGO]
It didn't look like this.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,233
She had nearly all
her bones broken.

28
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:39,233
Her lungs, liver, spleen,
and heart demolished.

29
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:42,150
Half her brain splattered
out of her skull.

30
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:44,858
That is how my daughter died.

31
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:48,108
A serial killer called the
Challenger forced her to fight

32
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,650
until she was injured
from head to toe.

33
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:54,817
She suffered excruciating agony,
and then she was killed.

It's good to see you.

I still get light-headed

be going pretty well.

That's good. Just try
to take it slow.

45
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:44,567
Don't need to push
yourself too hard.

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,942
Matsuoka, sir.

47
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:47,942
I have a question about
the Perforator case.

What did I just say? Don't push.

49
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:53,733
[HONDOMACHI] The Mizuhanome
created an id well

50
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:55,442
from me, right?

51
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,358
Can you tell me
what it was like?

52
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,108
[MATSUOKA]
It's better you not know.

53
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:02,400
[HONDOMACHI]
Sakaido entered it, didn't he?

54
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:05,525
Lucky. I wish I could.

55
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:06,692
[MATSUOKA]
You can't.

56
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:09,400
Entering your own
id well is prohibited.

57
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,650
Your well comes from
your unconscious.

58
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,775
To dive inside it is
to become conscious

59
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,400
of the unconscious.

60
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,150
Now this is all theoretical,

61
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:22,400
but in an attempt to avoid an
invasion of consciousness,

62
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:25,942
the id well would likely render
itself invisible and expand.

63
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,900
Like a rising storm.

64
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:30,483
Soon the storm swallows
the conscious self,

65
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,067
and the brilliant
detective would be left

66
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,358
wandering their well forever.

67
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:37,400
Apparently, they call this
"falling into dogma."

68
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,775
Dogma? What's that
supposed to mean?

69
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:42,192
Hell if I know.

70
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:45,025
They say the pilot location
data becomes lost.

71
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:47,817
The pilot's retrieval will
be impossible then.

72
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,650
The pilot doesn't just die?

73
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,442
The body in the
cockpit, you mean?

74
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,067
I'm sure it might
struggle to maintain

75
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,858
its functions eventually.

76
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:56,567
However, even if the body dies,

77
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,275
the mind will live on
inside the Mizuhanome.

78
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:00,650
[HONDOMACHI]
Oh.

79
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,733
The pilot losing their
memories inside the well

80
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,442
and becoming the brilliant
detective is no accident.

81
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,108
Most likely it's
a safety feature

82
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:09,983
in case a pilot decides to
enter their own id well.

83
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,150
Are you listening?

87
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,317
[HONDOMACHI] To think
other people are looking

88
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,192
at a part of my mind
that I don't know,

89
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,608
and going in and out of it.

90
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:24,400
That sounds fun.

91
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,317
Where's your mother?

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,525
[HONDOMACHI] Oh, yeah,
she's didn't show up today.

93
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:34,192
My mom doesn't exactly take
too much of an interest in me.

94
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,233
Hey, now.

participate, too.

97
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:43,650
[MATSUOKA]
You barely got through

98
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,483
the last operation alive.

99
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,817
Aren't you scared?

100
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,067
[HONDOMACHI]
Hmm.

101
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,983
I wouldn't say I'm
necessarily scared.

102
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:55,942
It's difficult to describe,
but it's more like I'm angry.

103
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,192
And not just...

104
00:04:57,275 --> 00:05:00,400
...not just at the Perforator,
Tamotsu Fukuda.

105
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,483
I think I'm angry with
all serial killers.

106
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,275
Oh. From what I understand,

107
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:08,983
I did end up losing a little
bit of my frontal lobe,

108
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,108
but it seems there's no damage
to the limbic system,

109
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:12,650
which is located farther back.

110
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:16,192
So emotions like anger or
pleasure shouldn't be affected.

111
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,108
Anger or pleasure.
Interesting.

112
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,983
You know, now you might
be like Narihisago.

113
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:24,650
Oh, like Sakaido?
The brilliant detective!

114
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:27,900
No, not the brilliant detective.
I mean the real-world pilot.

115
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:29,483
He didn't say it in those words,

116
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,275
but the same thing
happened to him, too.

117
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:32,692
He talked about it.

118
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:34,608
Said it was like a
strange combination

119
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,067
of pleasure and anger.

120
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,067
Right. I forgot.

121
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,942
You and Narihisago were
once colleagues.

122
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,900
That's so cool.

123
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:45,192
Do you think I could be
a brilliant detective?

124
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,983
[MATSUOKA] You formed a well,
so you're probably eligible.

125
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:49,317
But whether you can
actually do it

126
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,483
is a question of capabilities.

127
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,067
That's true.

128
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,983
I guess someone's capabilities
depend on how much of a boost

129
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,858
the Mizuhanome's
adjustments provide.

130
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:58,900
[MATSUOKA]
Give up on this.

131
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,233
Huh?

132
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:03,858
Becoming a pilot is too
dangerous. It's suicidal.

133
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:06,233
Thankfully, you
survived your first.

134
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:09,900
There is no reason to
attempt it a second time.

135
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,275
If I didn't know better,

136
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:14,650
I'd say it sounds like you're
a worried about me.

137
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,442
[MATSUOKA] I didn't much
care for Narihisago

when we were both detectives.

139
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:21,233
And now, I truly hate the man.

140
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:25,483
If I'm being honest,
I think he's hopeless trash.

Anyway, try to rest.
Leave this guy to us, okay?

I can let you in on one bit
of good news, though.

The cognition particles were
not blown away this time.

[NISHIMURA]
No mistake about it.

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,442
We collected samples
from the remnants

of some unexploded gunpowder.

They are the Pyrotechnician's.

00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:55,275
And by remembering her,
I remember who I am, too.

161
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:59,442
My name is Sakaido,
the brilliant detective.

162
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:00,525
I don't know my full name,

163
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,775
but that's not
important right now.

164
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:06,025
I must solve the mystery
of Kaeru's death.

165
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:09,483
[MAN A] What is this? Does
anyone know what's going on?

166
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,983
[gasps]

167
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,400
[SAKAIDO]
A sniper?

168
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:15,942
Hey! Don't stand in the open!
You need to take cover!

169
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:17,525
[MAN D screams]

170
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:20,317
What are you doing over there?
You have to get down!

171
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,567
Whatever. Let him stand there
and die if he wants!

172
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,192
[SAKAIDO]
Huh? Oh, yeah. I might die.

173
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,650
Can't have that.

174
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,733
[WOMAN A screams]

175
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:32,567
[SAKAIDO]
The shooting stopped.

176
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,525
Is it because everyone hid
in the shadow of the wall?

177
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:38,567
If there's a blind spot,
there's only one sniper.

178
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,608
Where is he?

179
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:40,733
It appears as though the bullets

180
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:43,150
are coming from
inside the waterfall,

181
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,108
but the water's spray
is obscuring everything.

182
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,067
I can't even spot
the muzzle flash.

183
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,942
Water on the round has
washed away the blood,

184
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,483
so I can't follow the
trajectory of the bullet.

185
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,525
I won't be able to
locate the sniper.

186
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:56,650
That's all right.
Focus on observing.

187
00:08:58,775 --> 00:08:59,900
Damn.

188
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:02,150
[SAKAIDO]
I didn't come here to die.

189
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:05,067
But my job is not
survival, either.

190
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,192
What I'm supposed to do

191
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:10,108
is solve the mystery
of Kaeru's death.

192
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:14,858
Something here is wrong.
But I can't quite grasp it yet.

193
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:17,233
Yes, something is wrong.

194
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:18,483
What though?

195
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,942
[HABUTAE] A total of 75
people are on the tower.

196
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,442
None have been recognized.

197
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:24,525
[SHIRATAKE] The tower doesn't
appear to be a real place.

198
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:26,525
Time cannot be narrowed
down beyond midday.

199
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,400
But, Habutae, identifying those
people will prove impossible.

200
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:31,608
Look.

201
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:35,025
Oh, that's why.

202
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,275
They're no one. It doesn't
matter who they are.

203
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:39,650
Are they just generic "others"?

204
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,900
Basically, they're like dolls
that have been produced

205
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:44,817
from mixing together features
of multiple different people.

206
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,608
Fitting, given how
indiscriminate

207
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:47,858
this guy has been.

208
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:49,942
The clothing is
haphazard, as well.

209
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:51,650
We can't determine any brands.

210
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:52,900
That's okay.

211
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,817
Let's keep identifying
what we can't determine.

212
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,358
Most people tend to hide
things unconsciously.

213
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:00,900
If the Pyrotechnician is
a meticulous individual,

214
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,650
then they might also hide
things meticulously.

215
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,317
This person not only made bombs,

216
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,150
but they arranged
gunpowder and fireworks

217
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,233
in order to create
pleasing displays.

218
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,233
Wouldn't they have
to be meticulous?

219
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:12,608
That's a good point.

220
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:15,983
I had been imagining a thrill
seeker, but maybe...

221
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:20,358
I wish I knew what was
causing this feeling.

222
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:22,900
Extract him, now!

223
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,400
Reinject Sakaido. Can you?

224
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,067
[NARIHISAGO]
Of course.

225
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,775
[SAKAIDO]
My name is Sakaido.

226
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,983
[MOMOKI]
Extract him!

227
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,733
What feels wrong
about Kaeru's body?

228
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:04,942
[CROWD screaming]

229
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:07,150
More than one sniper?

230
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,692
The bullets do seem to be
coming from everywhere.

231
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:11,400
I don't get it.
What did we do wrong?

232
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,567
Why do we have to be killed?

233
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,525
[SAKAIDO]
That I don't know.

234
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,650
But if this is a senseless
slaughter to the victims,

235
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,358
then there might not be
a reason in the first place.

236
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:24,025
The number of victims
excluding Kaeru and Sakaido

237
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:25,567
keeps changing every time.

238
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,650
So far, it appears anywhere
between 71 and 83.

239
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,567
Continue analyzing.

240
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:37,275
I can't take it! Anything is
better than getting shot!

241
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,858
I can't stay here! I can't!

242
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:42,233
[screaming]

243
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:43,567
[thud]

244
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:51,233
[SAKAIDO] Is it better
to be shot or to jump?

245
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,025
I wonder.

246
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:55,483
Keep moving! Get away!

247
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:01,983
[FUYUKAWA]
Ah! Dammit!

248
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,233
Dammit!

249
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:06,275
[SAKAIDO]
Compared to staying put,

250
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,900
how much of a difference is
all that effort going to make?

251
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:13,192
Either way, death
will come for you.

252
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,525
[SAKAIDO]
Remember though,

253
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:17,900
my purpose here
is not to survive.

254
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:20,525
Don't be afraid.

255
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:22,567
I am a brilliant detective.

256
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,150
My purpose here is to solve
the mystery of Kaeru's death.

257
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:29,942
Please help me! Can you
do something? Anything?

258
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,358
Hey, wait!

259
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,608
[WAKASHIKA] There's something
about Kaeru's body!

260
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:36,733
Come on, think! Look close!

261
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,525
[SAKAIDO]
What is it?

262
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,025
What's wrong with this picture?

263
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:43,442
Please help!

264
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:45,483
I can't. I don't wanna die here!

265
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,025
Feel free to, though.

266
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:49,567
At least it'll be
a little quieter.

267
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,692
Stop it! Let go!

268
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,942
I won't.

269
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:02,525
Please, I can't take this!

270
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:05,358
I want it--I need
it all to stop!

271
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:09,358
[SAKAIDO]
Guess it pays to get involved.

272
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:10,817
The mystery is solved.

273
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,775
What? What is he talking about?

274
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,233
[SHIRATAKE]
Yes, of course.

275
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:17,650
We couldn't tell because
the sun is directly overhead.

276
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:20,817
[HABUTAE] Right, you can't tell
if you're always moving.

277
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,608
Well, that's great. You guys're
making me look like an idiot!

278
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:26,983
[screaming]

279
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,275
[thud]

280
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:35,442
[SAKAIDO] The guy who jumped
from the other side earlier

281
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,650
is now directly below me.

282
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,442
How would that happen?

283
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,400
[screams]

284
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:52,192
[SAKAIDO]
The tower is what's moving.

285
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:55,025
That's how the sniper
repositioned so quickly.

286
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:58,567
Or rather, how they made
it appear that way.

287
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:02,692
[SAKAIDO]
It started off with rapid fire,

288
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,733
but the aim was precise.

289
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:07,817
That's not a feat you can
accomplish while moving.

290
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,483
The sniper must have
been sniping us

291
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,567
from the same location
as we ran around.

292
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,608
What happened was this...

293
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:19,483
[SAKAIDO]
Kaeru was shot in the chest.

294
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,275
She went down.

295
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:25,150
However, she was still conscious
and spotted the sniper.

296
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:31,650
[SAKAIDO] To help the rest of
us, she indicated the direction.

297
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,942
The tower was moving then, too.

298
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:37,608
So Kaeru's finger deviated from
the trajectory of the bullet.

299
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:43,608
[SAKAIDO] That deviation is what
made things look wrong to me.

300
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:55,400
Oh, what's this?
Are you still alive?

301
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:58,400
[FUYUKAWA]
Everyone, run randomly

302
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,567
so you're harder to target!

303
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,983
I see.

304
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:06,483
That way you're the only one
going at a steady pace.

305
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:13,817
Please, don't give up yet!
We can find the sniper!

306
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,150
[chuckles]

307
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:16,400
Yes.

308
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,525
Well, he's having fun.

309
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,817
The sniper wasn't actually
the one moving, after all.

310
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,567
We're okay! Just don't
stop moving! Keep running!

311
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,900
Huh?

312
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,608
[SAKAIDO] What happens when
this guy is eventually

313
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,483
the last man standing?

314
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:40,567
Will another group of casualties
be brought up, then?

315
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,483
New victims arrive to
experience a new slaughter?

316
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,192
Ah, figured me out?

Yes. I'm a brilliant detective.

[FUYUKAWA] Careful. You might
be holding your head too high.

No, it's fine.

[MOMOKI]
Extract Sakaido.

322
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,067
The puzzle is solved.

323
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,067
Of the 75 victims
present this time,

324
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,775
74 had faces and body parts
broken down and reassembled.

325
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,525
It looks like they
were soldiers.

326
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,358
All 74 were victims of a bombing

327

four years ago.

It's a political alert.

What do we do?

There are ways for us to
obtain the information.

and we don't even know that.

[MOMOKI] You said 74 were
soldiers. Who was 75?

[HABUTAE]
My apologies, sir.

339

The last one is the
man Sakaido found.

Strangely, he's had his

Right.

[MOMOKI]
There's one more thing.

346

In the well, the killer also
made an appearance

[HABUTAE] Then could the
Pyrotechnician be a soldier?

[TOGO] Suppose he was at the
scene of the bombing, too.

[KOKUFU]
A firefighter?

Or police.

352

Or maybe he was among
the crowd of bystanders.

353
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,358
He could be...

354

He pretended to be a
freelance news photographer

[MATSUOKA]
Good. Bring him to me.

358
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:22,817
So seven procedures
in four years.

359
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,942
Makes for quite a
different appearance.

360
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:27,400
Well, I guess it was worth it
to become so handsome.

361
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:30,025
To be honest, I don't
really care how I look.

362
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:31,942
But if you say that to
a plastic surgeon,

363
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:35,275
they might get suspicious and
ask unnecessary questions.

Yes, I see.

[OFFICIER B]
Matsuoka, sir,

366
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,317
these are the photographs
you asked for.

367

Thanks.

368
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,067
I've been wondering how
clean the images he took

369
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,942
of his own firework
bombs would be.

370
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:54,150
[FUYUKAWA] Can you believe
the people in this world?

371
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,525
They're dead long
before I kill them.

372
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:01,692
[NARIHISAGO] You like that
photograph that much.

373
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:04,067
[FUYUKAWA]
It isn't a matter of liking it.

374
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,817
It's just real.

375
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,942
[NARIHISAGO]
I suppose that's true.

376
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:11,400
All humans do love
beautiful things.

377
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,942
Even if they're terrifying.

378
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,233
[FUYUKAWA]
I believe what it captures

379
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:18,692
is the empty soul of modern man.

380
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:21,733
"Empty" seems a pretty strong
term, if you ask me.

381
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,025
Those people are simply trying
to preserve a record

382
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:27,650
of the fact they were present to
witness something incredible.

383
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,192
That's what most
onlookers do, isn't it?

384
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,233
[FUYUKAWA] They're obviously
lacking in empathy.

385
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:36,150
But people only died
because of your bombs.

386
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:40,358
Certainly can't deny that,
can you, Mr. Pyrotechnician?

387
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:44,150
All I did was expose the
emptiness of modern humanity.

388
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,692
We're all insignificant.

389
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:48,608
Whether anyone happens to be
alive or dead doesn't matter,

390
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,525
and that even includes you.

391
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:52,858
Doesn't matter whether
you're alive or dead.

392
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:54,733
Fair enough.

393
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,567
[FUYUKAWA] There's no inherent
value in life or death.

What, do you think I'm wrong?

396
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:02,858
[NARIHISAGO] I think deep down,
you don't actually believe that.

397
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,900
At my core,
I believe and know it.

398
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:06,983
People's lives have no value.

399
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:08,942
My life doesn't matter,
neither does yours,

400
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:12,733
and neither does the life of
your dearly departed daughter.

401
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,692
Whether someone
is alive or dead,

402
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,858
either way, it's meaningless.

403
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,275
[NARIHISAGO]
People die.

404
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:23,400
They do it all on their
own all the time.

They die of old age.

They die of disease.
They die in accidents.

407

But the death you brought about
was always mass murder.

408

Unless a bunch of people die,
unless it's a massacre,

409
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,525
to you, it doesn't
count as death.

So badly that you had to
find a way to recreate it.

it happened over and over.

of your handmade hell,

whether someone's alive

you want other people to die.
