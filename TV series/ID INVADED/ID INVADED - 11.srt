00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,108
[SAKAIDO]
A well storm?

2
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:20,983
Because I remembered
who I am? My real self?

3
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,692
This well, it belongs to me!

4
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:27,442
If that's true,
then this entire time...

5
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:31,150
...John Walker was
manipulating me, too!

6
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,817
[screams]

7
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:11,317
[KOKUFU] Not only is
the storm getting bigger,

8
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
the well itself seems
to be expanding!

9
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:15,275
[HABUTAE]
We've lost Sakaido's position!

10
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:18,025
It's impossible to track him!

11
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:19,858
Cut the Mizuhanome's power!

12
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:21,233
But that's unheard of!

13
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,567
[TOGO] So is the formation
of a well storm.

14
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,400
Hurry up and do it!

15
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:28,650
[grunts]

16
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,567
I can't! No response!

17
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,358
The Mizuhanome's protecting
itself from termination.

18
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:34,733
[TOGO growls]

19
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:39,150
[WAKASHIKA] This id well
wasn't from our repository.

20
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:43,108
It was created from cognition
particles gleaned at Momoki's.

21
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:45,650
That rules out the Kura
making an error.

22
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,233
The Wakumusubi-Mizuhanome
link wouldn't allow it.

23
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:49,650
There's no mistake.

24
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:52,775
Which means, the switch
happened at the scene.

25
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:55,150
Either Mr. Matsuoka set us up,

26
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,317
or somebody else is
trying to set him up

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,317
and he fell into the trap.

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,025
I need a review on
Matsuoka's movements now!

29
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:02,692
[WAKASHIKA]
Ma'am!

30
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:03,775
I'm already on it.

31
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:04,817
What?

32
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,067
[SHIRATAKE]
When you think aloud,

33
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,192
you forget about all
your other duties.

34
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:11,483
Heh. That's what I call backup!

35
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,317
[SHIRATAKE]
What are you so proud of?

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,317
Huh. Got it.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,150
Between entering the bedroom
and the Wakumusubi scan,

38
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,400
Matsuoka did nothing suspicious.

39
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:24,233
I need you to run a check to
see if any other investigators

40
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:25,150
entered the bedroom.

41
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,275
Yes, Ma'am.

42
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:29,067
Get Matsuoka on the
phone, right now!

43
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,692
[MATSUOKA]
I'm headed back to the scene.

44
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:35,150
Whoever did this...
they're gonna pay!

45
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:43,275
[SAKAIDO]
Why? What was your motive?

46
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:47,400
What the hell are
you playing at?

47
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:50,067
[chuckles]

48
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,858
Answer me, dammit!

49
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,858
[ANAIDO]
Something wrong?

50
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,858
[SAKAIDO]
You want me to kill you. Why?

51
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:03,150
[ANAIDO]
I deserve it, don't I?

52
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:06,817
After what I did, purposely
trapping you in the well

53
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,733
after dreaming about it...

54
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:10,858
That's pre-meditation.

55
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:14,275
When the opportunity arose,
something drove me forward,

56
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:19,858
and I embraced it, despite
knowing the consequences.

57
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:25,067
What are you waiting for?
Take your anger out on me.

58
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,608
[SAKAIDO]
No.

59
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,608
I reject your little offer.

60
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:29,733
[gasps]

61
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:35,817
Gotta clear my head and think!
Same goes for you!

62
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,983
Giving in to my anger
and beating you to death

63
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:41,108
would be playing right
into John Walker's hands.

64
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:43,442
If I fulfilled the role
he designed for me,

65
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:44,858
you'd be dead.

66
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:46,525
The fact you're
somehow still alive

67
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:49,650
is an inconvenience for him.

68
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,775
I want to know why.

69
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:55,192
Why you went along with him.

70
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:58,442
Of course. You want to die.

71
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:00,483
Is your life so unbearable?

72
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,483
I mean, you survived drilling
a damn hole into your head.

73
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:08,400
Tell me, why did you drill a
hole in your head like that?

74
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:11,400
What was so awful back then?

75
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:13,983
You don't have that scar
as a brilliant detective,

76
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:18,067
and you still want out
of this existence?

77
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,150
Say something.
What are you looking at?

78
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,192
[SAKAIDO]
The numbers?

79
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,192
[SAKAIDO]
Hey, what's all this?

80
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:33,983
[ANAIDO] Got kinda bored
so I started counting sand.

81
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:38,067
[SAKAIDO]
And who are you?

82
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,942
[ANAIDO chuckles]

83
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:40,942
My name? I couldn't tell you.

84
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,483
Wow! So cool!

85
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,483
Incredibly brutal,
but also pragmatic!

86
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,775
Could you not point at me?

87
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,525
[ANAIDO laughs]

88
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,858
Your favorite number.
It's three, right?

89
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:53,900
[ANAIDO chuckles]

90
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,192
[ANAIDO]
Guess I'll have to pass up

91
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:57,692
another opportunity to die.

92
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:03,317
Ah, and regarding the number
three, what an elegant number.

93
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,650
If things worked out the way
John Walker had planned,

94
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,817
you'd already be dead.

95
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,067
Because once the sand is gone,
this is a world of numbers.

96
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,067
They captivate you.

97
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,817
You can't help but be
a prisoner to them.

98
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:21,608
That's why. Why you
used the drill.

99
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:25,942
You have arithmomania and
wanted to escape the agony.

100
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,733
Thing is, every time you
dived into an id well,

101
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:32,608
the hole would seal up
and your condition

102
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,567
would start to plague you again.

103
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,983
Must be a curse, paired with a
brilliant detective's intellect.

104
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,775
Death is your only way out.

105
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,275
[ANAIDO laughs]

106
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:44,150
You nailed it!

107
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,942
I sympathize,
but unfortunately,

108
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:48,567
I can't grant you
the death you seek.

109
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,025
Because there's an important job

110
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,775
that John Walker
doesn't want you to do,

111
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:55,983
but you're the only
one who's capable.

112
00:06:56,067 --> 00:07:00,942
Though I find it hard to
believe, you have my attention.

113
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,817
What is this job?

114
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,525
[SAKAIDO]
You haven't noticed?

115
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:07,942
The cockpit that used to be
here completely disappeared.

116
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:10,525
[ANAIDO]
It was huge. How could it--?

117
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:14,358
[SAKAIDO] My other well,
you dove into it, right?

118
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:18,192
It was a world of numbers with
the same layout as this one.

119
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:20,650
Kaeru was also there
at the starting point.

120
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,400
When you woke up,
I imagine you found yourself

121
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:26,317
next to her dead body,
attached at the wrist.

122
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,858
With handcuffs.

123
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:31,983
Likely a remnant from the days
when you were a police officer.

124
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,692
[SAKAIDO]
I suppose.

125
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:38,192
As for Hondomachi's cockpit,
did you stumble upon it?

126
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,942
[ANAIDO]
Inevitably.

127
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,817
Your well didn't
exactly provide me

128
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,567
with an efficient way
of killing myself.

129
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,108
Sure, there was lightning,

130
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:50,025
but it was hell having to wait
forever to be electrocuted.

131
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:53,108
Regardless, you still
located the cockpit.

132
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:55,775
Are you able to remember
the exact sequence of numbers

133
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,567
to retrace your steps?

134
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,192
Yes.

135
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,567
[ANAIDO]
Not only for that path.

136
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,983
I can recall every last number
that entered my field of vision.

137
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:13,192
Naturally, the more
numbers that are present,

138
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:16,817
the more compelled I am
to take them all in.

139
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,983
I see. Guess that means
you can navigate.

140
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,942
Since you have the map of the
entire well inside your head.

141
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,150
[ANAIDO]
Easily.

142
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,900
However, the thing
you're searching for...

143
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:30,067
I wonder if you'll find it.

144
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,317
[SAKAIDO]
The storm is expanding,

145
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,358
so the Mizuhanome
and this id well

146
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:37,525
are most likely
continuing to update.

147
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:41,400
Which must be the reason why
the cockpit disappeared.

148
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:42,567
What the--?

149
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,692
Assistant Director!

150
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,858
[TOGO]
Yes?

151
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,233
I looked away from
Narihisago's first well,

152
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:50,775
and when I went
check on it again...

153
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:52,608
...the cockpit's not there!

154
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:53,525
Where did it go?

155
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:55,983
[KOKUFU]
Standby, looking for it.

156
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,692
It seems the moment the storm
appeared in the desert,

157
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:02,358
the cockpit disappeared
from the lightning id well.

158
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,650
Keep monitoring the situation.

159
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,983
I know our brilliant detectives
will find a way back.

160
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:15,025
[SAKAIDO] When the Mizuhanome
automatically updated,

161
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,858
I bet it brought the
cockpit to our location,

162
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,775
and Hondomachi along with it.

163
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:22,942
This well's huge.
Where do we look?

164
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:24,442
In the same spot.

165
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:27,608
The well's not different,
only the time is.

166
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,067
[ANAIDO]
Holy hell.

167
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,150
Why does your subconscious
always have to be so brutal?

168
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,275
Guess what.

169
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:34,858
If it were any more forgiving,

170
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,900
we'd have to worry about someone
above observing our actions.

171
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:40,025
Now we stand a chance.

172
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:41,567
[ANAIDO gasps]

173
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,275
[SAKAIDO] Sometimes you fall
asleep for only a short time,

174
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:47,233
but it feels like the dreams
last much longer.

175
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:48,733
You know what I'm talking about?

176
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:50,567
Why does that matter?

177
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,608
[SAKAIDO] The very same
thing happened to me

178
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,525
when I entered the well
within this well.

179
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:57,358
You were in there ten minutes.

180
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,858
By the time I was extracted,

181
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,150
over a year had passed
in that reality.

182
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,817
[ANAIDO] Over a year!
Incredible! Lucky you!

183
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,483
[SAKAIDO]
Yeah, actually.

184
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,817
Only thing is,

185
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,067
that's never happened before
in a normal id well.

186
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,317
When you dive in,

187
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,525
time is synchronized with
the outside world.

188
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,733
So what made it different?

189
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:18,650
Or more importantly,
how does it relate to dreams?

190
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:22,358
Perhaps the temporal factor
is dependent on whether

191
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:24,358
a third party is observing you.

192
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:25,733
Your actions.

193
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:28,108
If someone else is witnessing
the events occur,

194
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,608
time is synchronized.

195
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:32,608
Otherwise, it's free
to dilate or contract.

196
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,983
Don't you see?

197
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:37,067
Five minutes in the outside
world is 300 seconds,

198
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,317
but in this well, there's no
telling how long we have.

199
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,233
[SAKAIDO] And the same
situation would be true

200
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,525
in the well within the well.

201
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:46,400
To Hondomachi.

202
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,025
[HONDOMACHI]
Amazing.

203
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:54,858
Mr. Narihisago
accomplished all this

204
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:57,942
despite forgetting
he was in a well.

205
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,400
Now I have to pick up
where he left off,

206
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:02,233
starting with examining
each killers'

207
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:04,358
preferred method of taking life.

208
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:05,983
Their calling card.

209
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:09,067
The Challenger pummels
his opponents to death.

210
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,275
As for the Face-lifter,
Tongue-tearer,

211
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:13,317
Thigh-severer, and Arm-twister,

212
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,983
their M.O.s are pretty
self-explanatory.

213
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,567
Whether John Walker assigned
these preferences

214
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:24,150
to these killers, or whether
they surfaced on their own,

215
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,567
I can't say right now.

216
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,108
That aside, if you
consider the various

217
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,275
serial killers
throughout history,

218
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,317
there's a clear tendency to use
a particular method of killing.

219
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,150
Which means, John
Walker's no different,

220
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:43,233
and he also operates
using a particular system.

221
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:46,150
Narihisago reached
the same conclusion.

222
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:53,192
[HONDOMACHI]
And I can see the answer.

223
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,150
You mean they don't
all die instantly?

224
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:59,983
No one I drill dies instantly.
All of us linger for a time.

225
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,817
[HONDOMACHI]
We linger.

226
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,733
Tamotsu Fukuda and all
the other serial killers

227
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,275
John Walker created,

228
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:10,567
their victims didn't
always die right away.

229
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,483
The Face-lifter.
Thigh-severer. Arm-twister.

230
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,400
They all had victims
that ended up surviving,

231
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:20,692
which ultimately led to
their capture or death.

232
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:23,733
Is John Walker's M.O.
creating killers

233
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:26,858
whose targets don't
necessarily die?

234
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:31,150
Well, it's a start, but I still
need to explore this further.

235
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:35,192
Let's see. What else might
they have in common?

236
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,608
In every case, the maximum
number of victims

237
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:38,900
is always seven.

238
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:42,150
Now, assuming John Walker
works at the Kura,

239
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,692
he either has a
victim found alive,

240
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,733
then police arrest the
murderer he created,

241
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,358
or he gets an officer
to kill them

242
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:53,942
before an eighth person dies.

243
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,442
Never more than seven deaths.

244
00:12:57,858 --> 00:12:59,900
Seven.

245
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:03,608
If the acceleration of
John Walker's plans

246
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:06,858
by having Director
Momoki arrested

247
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:10,525
is a precursor to him
ceasing his activity

248
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:13,358
or moving to new methods.

249
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:18,317
Then how does it relate
to the number seven?

250
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,858
I get it.

251
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:23,150
The timeline of the victims
only appears to be random

252
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,025
because it's based
on body discovery

253
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,317
and estimated time of death.

254
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,567
Those dates taken by
themselves are irregular,

255
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,650
without commonalities,
but by reordering each one

256
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:36,275
based on the killing
blow, they line up.

257
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,275
Thigh-severer on Mondays.

258
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,108
Tuesdays, the Face-lifter.

259
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,900
Wednesdays, Tongue-tearer.

260
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:43,650
Thursdays, the Gravedigger.

261
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,483
Arm-twister on Fridays.

262
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:47,525
Saturdays, the Perforator.

263
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:50,400
Yuji Oonuki was killed
on a Saturday,

264
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:53,983
on the exact same Saturday that
I ended up getting injured.

265
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,525
Also, the Challenger's killings
and Muku Narihisago's death

266
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,775
both occurred on Sunday.

267
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,525
That's his pattern. John Walker.

268
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,483
He's been manipulating
their drive to kill

269
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,817
on certain days of the week.

270
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Almost like it's his job.

271
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:14,900
Or as if he were God creating
the world in seven days.

272
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,900
[phone buzzing]

273
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,442
Hey, Hondomachi! Where are you?

274
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,650
You disappeared without
saying a word!

275
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:25,567
[HONDOMACHI] I-I'm sorry, but
I had to look into something.

276

[MATSUOKA]
Next time, tell me!

277
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,608
[HONDOMACHI] So what happened
to Tamotsu Fukuda?

278
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:32,358
What? He's gone!

279
00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:34,483
Posed as the victim
and flew the coop!

280

[HONDOMACHI]
Is that right?

281
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,650
Sorry, but I have to go.

282
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,858
Where the hell are you?

283
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,858
I better hurry.

284
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:49,942
Found it! And the
little lady, too.

285
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,817
[HONDOMACHI]
Tamotsu Fukuda. Don't move.

286
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,692
[FUKUDA]
How'd you find this place?

287
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,108
And who are you?

288
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:59,733
Forgive me, but I don't
have enough time to explain.

289
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,525
You're just gonna
have to believe me.

290
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:02,983
For reasons I won't get into,

291
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,067
I know about you and
where I'd find you.

292
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,108
Come on, what could you
possibly know about me?

293
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:10,275
[HONDOMACHI] I know that
what you really want to do

294
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:13,525
is take that drill and run
it though your head again.

295
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:17,067
Come on, admit it.
I'm right, aren't I?

296
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,150
I can tell you no longer
have any intention

297
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,942
of trying to hurt me.

298
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:25,775
Therefore, I don't have any
reason to hurt you either.

299
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,317
As for how I know all of this...

300
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,692
It's hard to believe,
but a while back,

301
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:33,025
I made the choice to put
a hole in my head

302
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:37,150
using that very same drill
you're holding now.

303
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,483
[chuckles]

304
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,817
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about,

305
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,525
but I can't deny that
you're right about me.

306
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:47,400
So I have to assume
you're telling the truth.

307
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:50,108
So tell me, did you like it?

308
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:52,775
[HONDOMACHI] Now it's gone,
I feel incomplete.

309
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:54,233
Then it suited you.

[HONDOMACHI]
Not really.

More like, it's a part
of who I am now.

312
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,067
Funny.

313
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,150
Who would've thought one
needs to lose something

314
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,233
in order to feel complete.

00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:06,483
[HONDOMACHI]
You said it.

[FUKUDA]
So? What brings you here?

317
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,442
[HONDOMACHI]
I wanna know about your dreams.

318
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:14,817
[gasps]

319
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,775
Look at this sketch.
Do you see him when you sleep?

320
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,067
[FUKUDA]
Sure.

321
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,400
It was August 15th,
three years ago.

322
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,483
And September,
the 7th and the 10th.

323
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,525
Uh. You can remember
the exact dates?

324
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:31,317
I used to be very
good with numbers.

325
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,733
However, not so much anymore.

326
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:35,733
Then how good are
you with times?

327
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:36,858
[FUKUDA]
On August 15th,

328
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:40,192
it would've been
two to three p.m.

329
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:43,733
September 7th would've been
from eleven p.m. to three a.m.

330
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:47,358
September 10th, the same
times mentioned for the 7th.

331
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:49,150
You wake up early.

332
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,525
Was the 15th a nap?

333
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:52,358
I wouldn't say that.

334
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,400
I drilled the hole
into my head then,

335
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,858
which made me lose
consciousness and collapse.

336
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:59,733
But instead of dying, I had
a vision of that old dude.

337
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:02,567
[HONDOMACHI] I see. And what
happened in the dream?

338
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,067
Not a lot. There was
a girl in a hospital room.

339
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,192
That man was there and invited
me to drill a hole in her head.

340
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,858
To which I said,
"Thanks, but no thanks."

341
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:15,192
He offered again the
two days in September

342
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,775
and I gave him the
exact same response.

343
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:20,150
I told him dream holes
don't interest me.

344
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,358
So he knew you,

345
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:24,608
but not the reason you
have the need to drill.

346
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:25,858
No luck.

347
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:27,192
I checked employee records

348
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:30,025
for the afternoon of August
15th, three years ago.

349
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:33,025
Everyone with access to the well
data was present that day.

350
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,942
Maybe, but who's to say

351
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:37,358
they didn't just fall asleep
while on the clock?

352
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:38,567
I doubt that.

353
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,900
All right.

354
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:41,983
How 'bout someone who
took their job seriously,

355
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,400
but was sleeping during
that afternoon?

356
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:45,817
[HONDOMACHI]
Hm?

357
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,233
You never said that they
had to be located in Japan.

358
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,525
[gasps]

359
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:51,608
A work trip overseas.

360
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,358
What are you, a cop?

361
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:55,650
[HONDOMACHI]
Yeah.

362
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,358
Will we get to meet again?

363
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:58,775
[HONDOMACHI]
I don't know.

364
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:01,233
But getting caught by the police
will open a new door,

365
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:03,233
I can tell you
that much for sure.

366
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:04,317
[FUKUDA]
Hm.

367
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,275
No reason to stop
believing you now.

368
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:12,858
[MATSUOKA] I'm here. In Momoki's
bedroom, as instructed.

369
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:13,942
I copy that.

370
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,775
Give me detailed
visual information

371
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:17,317
of everything in the room.

372
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,192
[MATSUOKA]
Roger.

373
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:21,650
[TOGO] Look for traces
of anything being moved,

374
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,192
or signs of something
being brought in

375
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:25,358
that doesn't belong there.

376
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:26,567
[MATSUOKA]
Huh?

377
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,483
I've known Momoki for years,

378
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,858
but I've never been
inside his room.

379
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,358
I'll look around
and try my best.

380
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:34,067
[gasps]

381
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,233
[MATSUOKA]
Hm?

382
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:36,650
[TOGO]
Straight ahead.

383
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:39,067
The picture on the left
side of the shelf.

384
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:41,692
[MATSUOKA]
This one?

385
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,400
[TOGO]
Run a scan on it.

386
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:53,650
[gasps]

387
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,858
Now return to the bedroom
and try running another scan.

388
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:58,275
[MATSUOKA]
All right.

389
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:03,067
[MATSUOKA]
You did it, Togo.

390
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,233
How'd you know? Tell me.

391
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:07,858
[TOGO] That picture wasn't
there the last time I visited.

392
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,900
[gasps]

393
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,733
Knew it.

394
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,567
Two pictures.

395
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,025
The second one is Narihisago's.

396
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,900
[MATSUOKA] When he drove
Fuyukawa to suicide,

397
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,900
it must've retained
cognition particles.

398
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,733
Find out who had access
to his cell's photos.

399
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,650
[ANAIDO]
Well, time to wake her up

400
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,525
so she can join the party.

401
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:36,275
On August 15th, three years ago,

402
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:38,525
a high-ranking officer
traveled to New York

403
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,025
to receive training.

404
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:41,150
[MAN]
Who is this?

405
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:44,067
Oh. John Walker,
glad I could catch you.

406
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,442
[gasps]

407
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,650
[HONDOMACHI]
Huh? Talk about perfect timing.

408
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,067
Goodbye! And thank you!

409
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,233
[sirens wailing]

410
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:03,400
[FUKUDA]
Don't mention it.

411
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,358
Hang on, what is this?

412
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,067
[ANAIDO] We're in "brilliant
detective" Sakaido's well.

413
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,733
A.K.A. Akihito Narihisago.

414
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:18,858
And you're Hondomachi.

415
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:20,275
[gasps]

416
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:24,692
Whoa! You are rocking that hole!

417
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,650
Well, it's just a
part of who I am.

418
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,733
This place, it changed.

419
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:33,608
After three years,
the lightning abated.

420
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:36,358
Isn't that good?

421
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:38,067
I guess.

422
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,733
Now, it's empty.

423
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:43,942
Oh. I nearly forgot. Thank you.

424
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,150
[ANAIDO]
What I'd do?

425
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:46,900
Well, not you you.

426
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:50,317
Mr. Narihisago, with your help,
I finished the investigation

427
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,900
and figured out the
identity of John Walker.

428
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:56,525
It's Chief Hayaseura.

429
00:20:56,608 --> 00:21:01,108
[SAKAIDO] That right?
Let's head back to Kaeru.

430
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,108
[ANAIDO] What makes you think
finding her will save us?

431
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:09,233
Because she's a murder victim,

432
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:11,942
and a victim of this world
more specifically,

433
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:14,108
and we're the
brilliant detectives.

434
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:15,775
If we end up
solving her mystery,

435
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,067
she won't harbor any
resentments against us,

436
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,442
even though she told us from
the start not to leave her side.

437
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:25,858
Hey, just who is Kaeru anyway?

438
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:28,442
And why does she need your help?

439
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:32,192
[SAKAIDO]
The more important question is,

440
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:36,900
who is Kiki Asukai and why
does she look like Kaeru?

441
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:39,983
[NARIHISAGO] Why was there a
serial killer in there with us

442
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,317
out to murder you?

443
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,525
They're the only kind
of people who appear.

444
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:46,317
[SAKAIDO]
What does is it mean?

445
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,150
Miss Asukai's telepathy.

446
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:51,067
The different serial killers'
entering her dreams.

Their drives to kill.

448
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,150
[MOMOKI]
Sorry for calling so late,

449
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:58,150
but Miss Asukai disappeared
from the hospital.

450
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,025
I thought I'd ask if she
said anything to you

451
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:02,150
that could help us
figure this out.

452
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,817
As a matter of fact, she did.

453
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,733
[SHIRATAKE]
Huh?

454
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:10,233
I found them! All three!

455
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:14,733
The only reason
we found the solution

456
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:18,400
was because they
couldn't watch us.

457
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:21,108
But now it's time to be seen.

458
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:22,192
Extract them!

00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:28,900
I'm feeling fine.

00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:31,233
Listen, we know his identity.

00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,900

it's Chief Hayaseura!
