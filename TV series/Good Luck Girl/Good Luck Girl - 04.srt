1
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,583
- ( train horn blowing )

2
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,000
- ( yawning )

3
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:34,916
- Girls: ONE, TWO. ONE, TWO.
ONE, TWO. ONE, TWO.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,958
ONE, TWO. ONE, TWO.
ONE, TWO. ONE, TWO.

5
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,500
- HUH?

6
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,000
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN THERE?

7
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,000
- MMM?

8
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,958
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP THERE?

9
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,083
APPARENTLY YOU HAVEN'T
LEFT TOWN YET.

10
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,208
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP
AND HELP HER OUT?

11
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,750
YOU HAVE MADE MY JOB HERE
VERY DIFFICULT.

12
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,166
- WELL, WE ALL GOT
JOBS TO DO, DON'T WE?

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,166
ON TOP OF MAKING LIFE
HARDER FOR YOU,

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,833
I CAN'T LEAVE THIS PLACE UNTIL
YOU'VE BEEN VANQUISHED.

15
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,750
- YOU WANNA VANQUISH ME?

16
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,791
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER EVER
TEACH YOU TO BE MORE GENTLEMANLY

17
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,000
AND KIND TO LADIES?

18
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,250
- YEAH, WELL. WHEN YOU
DON'T HAVE BREASTS,

19
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,875
I DON'T REALLY CONSIDER
YOU AN ACTUAL WOMAN.

20
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,416
- HEY, MASSIVE JERK ALERT.
BRING ME A SPEAR.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,416
IF WE DON'T HAVE ONE, BRING
ME SOMETHING SHARP AND POINTY.

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,250
GOTCHA.

23
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,625
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD EAT
RAW FISH OUT OF THIS RIVER.

24
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,708
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
I'M NOT FISHING FOR A FISH.

25
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,791
I'M USING POVERTY GOD
ITEM TO SUMMON A HELPER

26
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,208
FROM THE PLAIN OF HIGH HEAVEN.

27
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,583
- THAT'S COOL.
- BRING IT, DESTITUTE ONE.

28
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,166
( grunting )

29
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,791
IS THAT YOU? MOMO'O?

30
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:50,875
- LONG TIME NO SEE, MOMIJI.

31
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,625
- MOMO'O? IS IT REALLY YOU?

32
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,708
- IT IS ME, MOMIJI. IT IS,
IT IS. I'VE MISSED YOU SO HARD.

33
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,500
I WAITED AND WAITED,
BUT YOU NEVER CAME HOME,

34
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,041
SO I WAS WORRIED YOU HAD
BEEN TOSSED AROUND

35
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,125
BY THE ANGRY SEAS OF THE
HUMAN REALM, AND BROKENHEARTED.

36
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,916
YOU HAD FALLEN INTO A
LIFE OF DRUGS AND PROSTITUTION.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,583
- GEEZ, WHAT AM I, A WANNABE
POP STAR ALL OF THE SUDDEN?

38
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,291
UGH. I HAVE TO ADMIT THOUGH,

39
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,541
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME,
HASN'T IT?

40
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,750
- SHAKE.
- ( mimics barking )

41
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,125
- OTHER HAND.
- ( barking )

42
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,833
- NOW BONDAGE.
- ( barking )

43
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,791
- THAT'S A GOOD BOY.
HERE'S YOUR REWARD.

44
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,916
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED,
ISN'T IT?

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,458
- SPEAK.
- OH. HELL. YES.

46
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,083
- ( sighs )

47
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,583
- SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE LITTLE DUDE?

48
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,833
- HE'S A DOG DEITY.
MOMO'O INUGAMI.

49
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,833
- HEY, WAIT JUST A MINUTE.
YOU'RE A HUMAN, RIGHT?

50
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,166
TELL ME, WHERE DOES A
PATHETIC EARTH DWELLER LIKE YOU

51
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,083
GET OFF TALKING TO MOMIJI
ALL CASUAL LIKE THAT, HUH?

52
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,833
- THIS ONE LIKES IT ROUGH.

53
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,916
- YEAH, I KINDA PICKED UP ON
THAT EARLIER.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,333
- ( exclaiming )

55
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,458
- ( gasps )

56
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,125
- I'M A GENIUS. I JUST
THOUGHT OF THE BEST WAY

57
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,791
TO STEAL ICHIKO'S HAPPINESS
ENERGY.

58
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,166
AND SHE'LL NEVER SEE
IT COMING. THAT IS, OF COURSE,

59
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,333
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND HELPING
ME OUT WITH HER, MOMO'O.

60
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,708
- HECK NO, I DON'T. FOR YOU,

61
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,708
I'D GO THROUGH FIRE, WATER, OR A
MOUNTAIN OF NEEDLES.

62
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,291
YOU NAME IT,
AND I'LL BE ON IT, LADY.

63
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,416
- GOOD GRIEF, THIS GUY'S
A NEEDY LITTLE BITCH.

64
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,708
- OKAY, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

65
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,208
WE NEED SOME BOILING
WATER, PRONTO.

66
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,208
- ( gasps ) IT'S WHISTLING.

67
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,750
I WONDER WHAT
SHE'S GONNA DO WITH IT NOW.

68
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,208
- DRINK UP.

69
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,916
- ( exclaiming )

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,708
- UM, IS THAT SAFE,
'CAUSE THAT DON'T LOOK SAFE.

71
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,083
- ( grunting ) HERE IT COMES.

72
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,958
( screaming )

73
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,791
- WHOA. NICE.
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

74
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,416
- WHEN MOMO'O REACHES
A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PLEASURE,

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,875
HE CAN'T HELP BUT TRANSFORM
INTO HIS TRUE FORM

76
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,041
AS A DOGGIE DEITY.

77
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,541
- MAN, THAT IS MESSED UP.

78
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,041
- ( snarling )

79
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
- Momiji: WHILE DOG
DEITIES ARE REVERED

80
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,750
FOR FULFILLING THEIR
MASTERS' DESIRES,

81
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,708
THEY'RE ALSO WELL LOVED AS
BEARERS OF GOOD LUCK.

82
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,166
AND AS A RESULT OF
THEIR INTENSE LOYALTY,

83
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,583
THEY ARE FEARED
AS VENGEFUL GODS,

84
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,541
WHO MERCILESSLY BRING
ABOUT CALAMITY

85
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:45,375
TO THOSE WHO WOULD DO HARM
TO THEIR MASTERS.

86
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,166
- A VENGEFUL DEITY.
THAT'S GREAT.

87
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,625
WAIT, ARE WE SAFE? WHAT THE...

88
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,000
- ( yelping )

89
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,583
- I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

90
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,875
SO HE SHRANK.
WELL PLAYED. TRICKY.

91
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
- NOW, ARE YOU READY, MOMO'O?
- ( yelps )

92
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,833
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN
CARRY OUT THIS MISSION. OKAY?

93
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,250
- ( humming )

94
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,500
THINGS ARE GREAT, LATELY.

95
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,416
THE POVERTY GOD HASN'T BEEN
SHOWING UP, WHICH IS SO NICE.

96
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,083
MAYBE SHE'S FINALLY GIVEN
UP AND GONE HOME.

97
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,000
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

98
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,625
- THAT HAS TO BE HER.
COME TO ME, ICHIKO.

99
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,083
- WHILE YOU PRETEND
TO BE A REAL DOG,

100
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,875
I WANT YOU TO GET AS CLOSE
TO ICHIKO AS YOU CAN.

101
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,625
ONCE SHE STARTS TRUSTING YOU,

102
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,333
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
TAKE AWAY HER HAPPINESS ENERGY

103
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,875
WITH NO PROBLEM.

104
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,500
HEY. DON'T YOU BE JUDGING ME.

105
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,250
THIS JOB IS A PAIN AND
THAT GIRL IS CRAY CRAY.

106
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,291
AND, MOMO'O,
IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,

107
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,208
I PROMISE TO GIVE YOU
THE ABSOLUTE GREATEST,

108
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,166
MOST AMAZING REWARD
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

109
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,125
- ( gasps ) THE ABSOLUTE
GREATEST,

110
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,375
MOST AMAZING REWARD
I'VE EVER HAD?

111
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:16,791
THAT SEEMS MORE LIKE AN
EXECUTION, NOT JUST S AND M.

112
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,708
DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING,
MOMIJI.

113
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,500
IT'S MY JOB AS A DOG DEITY TO
FULFILL MY MASTERS' WISHES.

114
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,083
TAKE THIS SECRET TECHNIQUE.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,500
TEMPTATION!

116
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,041
- SHE'S WALKING AWAY.

117
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,500
WHAT KIND OF COLD
HEARTED CREATURE

118
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,750
CAN WITHSTAND THIS TEMPTATION?

119
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,750
- THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
DOG I DON'T TRUST.

120
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,333
- Man: EXCUSE ME, MISS SAKURA?

121
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,166
- SORRY, I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

122
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,583
- I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH YOU

123
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,208
KEEPING A LITTLE PET HERE,

124
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,583
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO INSIST
YOU KEEP HIM ON A LEASH

125
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,000
WHEN YOU TAKE HIM
FOR A WALK.

126
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,250
- WAIT, WHAT PET?

127
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,291
( gasps )

128
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,375
OH, BUT SIR, THIS IS NOT MY DOG.

129
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,000
- I DUNNO, IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE HE THINKS HE'S YOUR DOG.

130
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,000
- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

131
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,875
- I JUST WANT TO MAKE
SURE I DON'T GET SUED

132
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,291
IF HE BITES A KID OR SOMETHING.

133
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,208
LIKE I SAID, IT'S NO BIG DEAL,

134
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,000
JUST KEEP HIM ON A LEASH.

135
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,666
- ( whimpering )

136
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,708
- WHY SHOULD I HAVE
TO TAKE THE DOG?

137
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,291
OH, WHATEVER. I'LL JUST
FIND SOMEONE AT SCHOOL

138
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,458
WHO WANTS TO
RESCUE HIM, I GUESS.

139
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,833
DON'T GET ATTACHED, MUTT.
I'M ONLY TAKING CARE OF YOU

140
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,833
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CHOICE.

141
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,541
- YOU FOOL.

142
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,125
ONCE I'VE GOTTEN INSIDE,
IT'S ALL OVER.

143
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,375
I'LL STEAL YOUR GOOD LUCK,

144
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,708
AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HIT YOU.

145
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,500
- ( exclaims in disgust )
IT'S DISGUSTING.

146
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,250
- GAH, THIS PLACE GETS
MESSY SO FAST.

147
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,916
- I HAD IT CLEANED
THREE DAYS AGO,

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,708
AND IT'S ALREADY A
COMPLETE DISASTER.

149
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,750
- THREE DAYS AGO?
UGH, THIS CHICK IS NASTY.

150
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,083
- I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE 'EM
COME BACK, THEN.

151
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,083
- OF COURSE. HER BUTLER, SUWANO,

152
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,916
MUST'VE DONE EVERYTHING FOR
HER UP UNTIL NOW.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,166
SHE COULD AT LEAST
CLEAN UP AFTER HERSELF.

154
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,208
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN
A FILTHY HOME TO STOP ME.

155
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,958
IT'S TIME FOR MOMIJI'S
POVERTY GOD ITEM.

156
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,083
THE GABRIEL TWO
THOUSAND AND TWELVE!

157
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,625
- A FALSE TEETH TYPE ABSORBER,

158
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,666
WHICH CONSUMES A
PERSON'S HAPPINESS ENERGY

159
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,708
WHILE ALSO INFLICTING
INCREDIBLE PAIN!

160
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,833
- PUTTING IN PLACE.

161
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,625
- UGH. I WISH I COULD
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO KEEP

162
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,958
THESE DIRTY DISHES
FROM PILING UP.

163
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:29,000
OH, WELL. OKAY, LET'S SEE, WHERE
DID I PUT THOSE GOODIES AGAIN?

164
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,333
- LOCKING ON TARGET.

165
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:36,083
YOUR HAPPINESS ENERGY IS MINE.

166
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,166
- NO. DAMN IT.
- ( gasps )

167
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,583
- SO CLOSE. ALMOST HAD HER.

168
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,541
MY EYES. MY EYES.
( screams )

169
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,416
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF
HAPPINESS ENERGY DOES SHE HAVE?

170
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,041
- OH GREAT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

171
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,541
YOU MUST BE PRETTY
TIRED TO LIE DOWN RIGHT

172
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,250
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.

173
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,500
- IT'S OFFICIAL. I'M IN HELL.

174
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,541
- MOMO'O?
THAT'S A WEIRD NAME.

175
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,208
- ( laughing )

176
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,375
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
VULNERABLE, NOW.

177
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,416
HAPPINESS ENERGY WON'T
PROTECT YOU FROM ME

178
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,708
WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING.

179
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,791
YOU'RE THROUGH.

180
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,666
( screams )

181
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,416
IS THIS HER FREAKING GOOD
LUCK AT WORK, AGAIN?

182
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
OR IS SHE JUST A
REALLY DEEP SLEEPER.

183
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,916
OH, YES. THAT FEELS SO GOOD.

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,458
AH. THAT WAS AMAZING.

185
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,916
NO, IF I EXPERIENCE MUCH MORE
PLEASURE THAN THIS,

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,708
I'LL TURN BACK INTO
MY HUMAN FORM.

187
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,291
DAMN IT, I WILL NOT
LET YOU BEAT ME.

188
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,958
EMERGENCY, MOMIJI.
I NEED YOUR HELP!

189
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,958
- AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE DID AFTER THAT?

190
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,250
SHE HELD UP HER
GIANT RACK AND SAID,

191
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,666
"AND YOU HAVEN'T
CONFUSED BEING A GOD

192
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,666
OF FLAT BROKENESS WITH
FLAT CHESTEDNESS?"

193
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,500
THAT IS BOTH CRUEL AND RUDE.

194
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,333
- WELL, HAVE YOU TRIED
DRINKING MORE MILK?

195
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,541
- YES, I HAVE.

196
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,291
I'VE BEEN DRINKING MILK FOR
A HUNDRED YEARS.

197
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,791
( grunts ) I CAN'T STAND
THAT EVIL TITCHIKO.

198
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,208
I SWEAR, MOMO'O BETTER
TAKE HER OUT FOR ME!

199
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,791
- ( exclaiming )

200
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,833
( howling )

201
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,750
- Teacher: OKAY. HERE ARE
YOUR QUIZZES FROM YESTERDAY.

202
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,166
- SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT.
- WAY TO GO!

203
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,500
- THEY SHOULD CREATE A SPECIAL
ADVANCED CLASS JUST FOR YOU.

204
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,083
- OH. THAT'S NOT TRUE.

205
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,083
YOU'RE SWEET, BUT YOU BOYS
ARE EVERY BIT AS SMART AS ME.

206
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,250
- YOU'RE THE BEST.

207
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,750
- Boys: YOU ARE
SO AWESOME, ICHIKO!

208
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:48,458
- Momo'o: COLD SHOULDER
FROM GIRLS, POPULAR WITH BOYS.

209
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,125
EVERYTHING IS JUST LIKE
MOMIJI SAID IT WOULD BE.

210
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,291
AND NOW I KNOW FOR SURE
HER HAPPINESS ENERGY

211
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,458
IS GOING TO COMPLETELY
PROTECT HER.

212
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,958
IT'S HIGH TIME TO
REGROUP A LITTLE

213
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,208
AND LEARN MORE ABOUT MINE ENEMY.

214
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,583
ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO HOT MESS.

215
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,916
- WATER. MY HEAD IS
ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

216
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,000
- ICHIKO SAKURA
OBSERVATION RECORD.

217
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,916
EXCELLENT GRADES,
A NATURAL ATHLETE.

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,916
HER BRAINS AND BEAUTY
ARE WELL ABOVE AVERAGE.

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,916
MEN CONSTANTLY
FLIRT WITH HER.

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,666
AND HER PERSONALITY IS,
SHOCKINGLY VIOLENT AT TIMES.

221
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,375
EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY AS IT
HAS BEEN REPORTED.

222
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,208
SHE'S HOME.

223
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,666
( yelping )

224
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,791
- ( chuckles ) HEY, PUPPY DOG.

225
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,291
- WHAT'S THIS?
SHE'S IN A GOOD MOOD.

226
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,041
- ( chuckling )

227
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,625
- THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR
WASN'T IN MOMIJI'S REPORT.

228
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,833
- ( laughing )

229
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,708
- I'VE NEVER SEEN HER SMILE,
LIKE, ANYWHERE BEFORE.

230
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,125
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT IS SHE READING?

231
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,333
WHAT IS THIS?
OH, YEAH.

232
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,500
THEY MUST BE LETTERS
FROM THAT BUTLER.

233
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,833
I WISH IT WAS SOMETHING I COULD
ACTUALLY USE AGAINST HER.

234
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,666
- Suwano: I WAS GOING
THROUGH MY PHOTOS,

235
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,333
AND AN OLD ONE OF YOU CAME
UP, MISS ICHIKO.

236
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,291
AT THE TIME, IT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME

237
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,333
TO HAVE KNOWN HOW VOLUPTUOUS...

238
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:26,000
THAT IS TO SAY, HOW BEAUTIFUL,
YOU WOULD GROW UP TO BE.

239
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,416
- IS HE SEXUALLY HARASSING
HER THROUGH MAIL?

240
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,750
- AT MISS SUMIRE'S SUGGESTION,
I HAVE TAKEN UP TAI CHI.

241
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,500
I AM NOW IN THE PROCESS
OF TOUGHENING UP MY BODY,

242
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,500
SO THAT SOMEDAY I'LL BE ABLE TO
PROPERLY FIGHT ANY MAN

243
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,083
WHO ASKS YOU TO MARRY HIM.

244
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:44,000
AND THIS IS THE GUY WHO WAS
ABOUT TO DIE IN THE HOSPITAL?

245
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,541
HER SUBSTITUTE FATHER.

246
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,166
- THIS MAN IS SUWANO.

247
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,000
HE IS THE ONLY PERSON SHE'S
ALLOWED HERSELF TO CARE FOR.

248
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,791
THEIR BOND MAY BE
CONSIDERABLY DEEPER

249
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,125
THAN WHAT SHE HAS WITH
HER REAL PARENTS.

250
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,333
- IF ONLY YOU COULD DIRECT
EVEN A TENTH OF THE KINDNESS

251
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,541
YOU'VE GIVEN TO YOUR BUTLER
TOWARD OTHER PEOPLE.

252
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,083
LUCKILY, MOMIJI GAVE ME
ANOTHER POVERTY GOD ITEM.

253
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,458
THE CURSING STRAW EFFIGY MAN,
TYPE MINI.

254
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,416
- IT'S A UNIQUE ITEM, WHICH,
LIKE IT OR NOT,

255
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,208
BRINGS UNHAPPINESS TO EVERYONE
WITHIN A ONE METER RADIUS

256
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,875
WHEN YOU PULL THE NAIL
OUT OF ITS HEART.

257
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,375
- THERE'S SIMPLY NO ESCAPING
THE CURSE OF THIS GUY.

258
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,416
- ( moaning )

259
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,041
NO. SUWANO...

260
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,666
- AW. I WONDER WHAT
SHE'S CRYING FOR?

261
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,666
NO. OH, WAIT. I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE'S JUST DREAMING.

262
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,333
( screaming )
I PULLED HIS HEART NAIL OUT.

263
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,000
THIS IS BAD! I HAVE
TO GET AWAY NOW,

264
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,250
OR THE CURSE WILL GET ME, TOO!

265
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,458
AIR. AIR.

266
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,541
( gasping ) LET GO OF ME.

267
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,375
WHY ISN'T ANYTHING
HAPPENING TO HER?

268
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,791
IS THIS BECAUSE OF HER
STUPID GOOD LUCK AGAIN?

269
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,750
HER HAPPINESS ENERGY
PISSES ME OFF.

270
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,125
- Ichiko: CRAP. I OVERSLEPT.

271
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,500
WAIT, WHY IS MOMO'O
SLEEPING LIKE THAT?

272
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,416
WEIRDO. I GOTTA GO.

273
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,541
- ( door closes )

274
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,916
- ( knocking on door )

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,208
- Woman 1: HELLO? HOUSEKEEPING.

276
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,000
- Woman 2: WE CAN JUST WALK IN?

277
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,541
- YEAH, OF COURSE
WE CAN JUST WALK IN.

278
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,166
HOW ELSE ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET THE JOB DONE?

279
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,750
- OH. IT STINKS IN HERE.

280
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,916
- WE CAN START CLEANING UP
THIS ROOM FIRST.

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
APPARENTLY, WE CAN
THROW EVERYTHING AWAY,

282
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,625
EXCEPT FOR THE GIRL'S CLOTHES
AND THE DISHES.

283
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,958
OH, BUT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TOUCH ANYTHING

284
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,166
ON THE DESK IN HER ROOM.

285
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,000
- 'KAY. SO, UM...

286
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,625
THIS WAS IN HER BED.
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH IT?

287
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,958
- WE PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO
THROW THAT AWAY.

288
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,041
- NO. IT'S GONE. BUT HOW?
WHERE IS IT?

289
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,083
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR
NO ONE WAS TO TOUCH

290
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,458
ANYTHING ON THE DESK.

291
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,291
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
SHE HAS TO BE SO LOUD.

292
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,708
IF YOU DIDN'T TOUCH IT,
THEN WHY IS IT GONE?

293
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,333
YES, A BOX WITH A
FLORAL PATTERN.

294
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,958
- IS SHE TALKING ABOUT THAT BOX
WITH THE BUTLER'S LETTERS?

295
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,625
- WHAT? YOU MEAN YOU
THREW IT AWAY?

296
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,333
THEN, WHERE DID YOU DROP
OFF THE TRASH?

297
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,583
- I REALIZE YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT I REALLY CAN'T HELP YOU.

298
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,541
I MEAN, THE BEST I CAN DO IS
TELL YOU IF IT CAME IN TODAY,

299
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,958
IT'LL PROBABLY
BE OVER THERE.

300
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,958
- THAT'S FINE. I DON'T MIND
LOOKING FOR IT.

301
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,458
- NO, WAIT. HOLD ON.

302
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,666
- EVERYTHING'S FINE. I'M
SURE TO FIND IT. I HAVE TO.

303
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,083
AFTER ALL, I HAVE HAPPINESS
ENERGY ON MY SIDE, DON'T I?

304
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:32,000
LOSING IT... LOSING IT IS
ABSOLUTELY NOT AN OPTION.

305
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,250
- SO THIS IS WHAT
UNHAPPINESS IS TO HER?

306
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,416
I GUESS THE CURSE ENDED UP
WORKING AFTER ALL.

307
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,416
STILL, SHE'S LUCKY SHE DIDN'T
GET SOMETHING MORE PAINFUL.

308
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,708
FOR NOW.

309
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,208
I'LL WAIT. ONCE SHE
EXHAUSTS HERSELF,

310
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,916
IT'LL BE EASIER TO TAKE
HER ENERGY AWAY.

311
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,666
IS SHE STILL AT IT?

312
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,875
IF SHE'S LOOKED THIS HARD
AND HASN'T FOUND THE BOX,

313
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,250
COMMON SENSE SHOULD TELL HER
IT MAY NOT BE HERE

314
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,916
NO MATTER HOW MUCH HAPPINESS
ENERGY SHE'S BLESSED WITH.

315
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,250
OH. IS IT MORNING ALREADY?

316
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,041
I WONDER IF SHE FINALLY
WENT HOME.

317
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,791
- ( clattering )

318
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,708
- HEY, MISS.

319
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,791
HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKIN' OUT
HERE THE WHOLE NIGHT?

320
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,791
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GIVE IT A REST?

321
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,583
- NO, I'M FINE.
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

322
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,583
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? THEY'RE
JUST OLD LETTERS.

323
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,875
BESIDES, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE SENTIMENTAL

324
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,375
OR CARE ABOUT ANYTHING.

325
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,458
- ICHIKO SAKURA IS
A SELFISH BRAT

326
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,708
WHO DOESN'T GIVE
A SECOND THOUGHT

327
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,458
TO HOW HER ACTIONS AFFECT
ANYONE AROUND HER.

328
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,166
SHE DOESN'T CARE.
SHE'S AN OUTRAGEOUS GIRL,

329
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,791
WHO, CONTRARY TO HER
OUTWARD APPEARANCE,

330
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,375
HAS A TWISTED PERSONALITY,

331
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,291
AND IS NOT ONLY HAUGHTY
AND OVERBEARING.

332
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,708
SHE THINKS I'M FLAT CHESTED.

333
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:01,375
- COME ON.
I JUST HAVE TO FIND THAT BOX.

334
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,375
ANYTHING OTHER THAN FINDING
THOSE LETTERS IS NOT AN OPTION.

335
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,708
SUWANO GAVE THEM TO ME.

336
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:11,416
I CAN'T LOSE THE ONLY THING IN
THE WORLD I REALLY CARE ABOUT.

337
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,000
- ( crying )

338
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,875
- DAMN IT. ALLEY OOPA.

339
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,541
- HEY. WHAT'S THAT?

340
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,416
MOMO'O? HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN OUT HERE, PUPPY?

341
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,041
THIS PLACE IS
TOO DANGEROUS FOR...

342
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,250
WAIT, IS THAT IT? GOOD BOY.

343
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,416
- GIVE A DOG DEITY'S NOSE
ITS DUE.

344
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,583
- ( gasps ) IT'S HERE.

345
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:45,416
YOU FOUND IT FOR ME.
THANK YOU.

346
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,708
- AN OUTRAGEOUS, HAUGHTY,
OVERBEARING BRAT?

347
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,500
NOT HER. SHE'S JUST
A LONELY KID. RIGHT?

348
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,958
- MOMO'O.

349
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,750
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MOMO'O.
THANK YOU.

350
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,833
YOU'RE THE BEST DOG EVER.

351
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,958
- WHICH ONE IS IT?
WHO ARE YOU? I MEAN, REALLY?

352
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,208
- GROSS. I'M DIRTY
AND I SMELL BAD.

353
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,250
BOY, DO I NEED A BATH, HUH?

354
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,583
- ( door closes )

355
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,916
- ( sighs )

356
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,500
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED A
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.

357
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:26,000
I'M SORRY, MOMIJI,
BUT, I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

358
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,833
- SERIOUSLY? YOU LET YOUR
EMOTIONS GET IN THE WAY?

359
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,083
- I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN
FOR IT TO HAPPEN.

360
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,208
I WASN'T TRYING TO
IMPRESS HER.

361
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,416
I JUST FELT BAD.

362
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
SHE'S A LONELY GIRL.

363
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,916
I HONESTLY DON'T THINK ICHIKO
SAKURA IS THE AWFUL PERSON

364
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,958
YOU BELIEVE HER TO BE.

365
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,791
THERE'S MUCH MORE TO
HER THAN THAT.

366
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,708
- YES, I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

367
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,083
- HEY, MOMO'O.

368
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:58,291
- STILL. I HAVEN'T ACCEPTED
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

369
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,083
NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF
PERSON YOU MAY BE,

370
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,458
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT

371
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,583
THAT I WILL TAKE YOUR
HAPPINESS ENERGY AWAY.

372
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,208
( screaming )

373
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,083
WHAT'S SHE DOING? WHAT'S
HAPPENING? SHE'S A SADIST.

374
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,666
- I HAVE TO ADMIT, YOU SEEM TO
BE MY VERY OWN GOOD LUCK CHARM.

375
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,833
I BET MY HAPPINESS ENERGY
ATTRACTED YOU TO ME.

376
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,708
- THIS SUCKS SO HARD.

377
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,833
- ( exclaiming )

378
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,458
- DO YOU LIKE THAT? DOES IT
FEEL EXTRA GOOD RIGHT THERE?

379
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,000
- YOU HAVE TO STOP
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

380
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,458
( exclaiming )

381
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,208
- UH, MOMO'O?

382
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,291
- OH NO.

383
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,958
- WHEN MOMO'O RECEIVES PLEASURE,
EVEN IF IT'S NOT S AND M,

384
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,333
HE REVERTS BACK TO NORMAL.

385
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,666
- WHAT IS THIS?

386
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,625
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE WITH THAT
DAMN POVERTY GOD.

387
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,791
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

388
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,625
TAKE IT EASY AND
HEAR ME OUT, PLEASE.

389
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,083
- SO IF I TAKE IT EASY,

390
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,916
THE FACT THAT YOU'VE SEEN ME
NAKED WILL JUST DISAPPEAR,

391
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,458
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY?

392
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,416
- HOLD ON. I DON'T THINK
BATHTUBS ARE SUPPOSED

393
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,291
TO RIP OUT OF THE
CONCRETE LIKE THAT.

394
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,083
BWAM WHAM SLAM SMACK

395
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,916
YOU WERE PRETENDING TO BE
A DOG THAT WHOLE TIME...

396
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,583
- NO, I WASN'T PRETENDING
TO BE A DOG!

397
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,916
- I AM A DOG. BUT IT'S TRUE!
- YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

398
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,333
- OKAY, SO MOMIJI WAS RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

399
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,666
SHE'S CRAZY VIOLENT.
WAIT, VIOLENT?

400
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,541
YES, THIS VIOLENCE IS
STILL VIOLENCE.

401
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:18,500
MORE! HIT ME HARDER,
I BEG YOU.

402
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,250
- YOU'RE A SICKO PERVERT,
AREN'T YOU?

403
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,583
- I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU,
NAKED FOR SOME REASON.

404
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,250
- YOU JERK, YOU'RE NO
BETTER THAN HIM.

405
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,833
- WORSE.
- Momiji: WHAT'S GOING ON?

406
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,750
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE HAVING FUN IN THERE.

407
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,500
I WANNA TASTE OF THIS PARTY.

408
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,250
WHAT? MOMO'O'S BEEN BEATEN UP,
BUT I GUESS HE SEEMS HAPPY.

409
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,375
- YOU LUNATICS ARE JUST
A BUNCH OF JINXES.

410
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,875
- NO, DON'T DO IT. MOMO'O'S
LIFE FORCE IS ALMOST AT ZERO.

411
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,083
- SHUT UP AND GET OUT
OF MY HOUSE.

412
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,625
- MUST REALLY COME IN HANDY
TO LOVE PAIN.

413
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,375
- PLEASE LET ME IN.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

414
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,666
JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

415
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,625
- NO MEANS NO. GO AWAY!

416
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:31,125
- MOMO'O, WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT HER?

417
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,708
- BEAR CLAW,
BEAR CLAW OF PLEASURE.

418
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,250
- Students: THIS WEEKS...
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO!

419
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,083
AS FOR THIS EPISODE,
YOU COULD ONLY SEE ME HERE.

420
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,500
IF YOU WERE THINKING
YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEE

421
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,541
MORE OF ME EVERY EPISODE,

422
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,166
WELL, TOO BAD FOR YOU.

423
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,750
( laughing )

424
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:50,916
( crying )
