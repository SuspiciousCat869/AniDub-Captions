1
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,333
- Teacher: DON'T FORGET TO
STEER CLEAR OF THE OLD BUILDING

2
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,666
WHEN WALKING TO CLASS TODAY.

3
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,041
THEY'RE KNOCKING IT DOWN SOON,

4
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,208
AND YOU DON'T WANNA BE NEARBY
WHEN IT HAPPENS.

5
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,958
- Nezu: MISS RANMARU!
- SUP?

6
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,541
- DOING ANYTHING AFTER CLASS?

7
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,375
- WE WERE THINKING
OF GOING TO KARAOKE.

8
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,666
YOU SHOULD COME! IT'LL BE
LIKE A WELCOME-BACK PARTY!

9
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,666
OUR TREAT!

10
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,083
- YEAH, I'LL GO
ON ONE CONDITION.

11
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,000
- YOU GOTTA STOP CALLING ME
'MISS RANMARU.'

12
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,083
- Both: OH!

13
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,041
BUT WE THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED!

14
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,625
- YEAH, IT'S REALLY NOT.

15
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,500
LADY PANTS! WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH US?

16
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,708
- I DON'T THINK SO,
MISS RANMARU.

17
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,583
WHY'S EVERYONE
CALLING ME 'MISS?'

18
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,041
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
TALKING TO MY MOTHER!

19
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,625
CUT IT OUT AND COME WITH US!
IT'S GONNA BE FUN!

20
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,166
- AT LEAST TELL ME
WHO ELSE IS GONNA BE THERE?

21
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,125
- ME! I'M GONNA
BE THERE! LET'S GO!

22
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,375
ARE YOU READY TO HEAR
THE MOST FEROCIOUS BALLAD EVER?

23
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,416
- YEAH, MY SOUL SISTA!
LET'S ROCK THIS!

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,458
...LIKE A CELINE MACHINE!
THANKS FOR INVITING ME.

25
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,791
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,750
- IT'S OKAY IF THESE GUYS
COME WITH US, ISN'T IT?

27
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,166
- I THINK IT'S OKAY
IF MOMIJI COMES.

28
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,041
- YEAH, BUT, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ICHIKO.

29
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,125
- WHATEVER. YOU AREN'T
'THOSE GIRLS,' ARE YOU?

30
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,958
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T MIND.

31
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,041
THEY WANTED TO THROW YOU
A WELCOME BACK PARTY,

32
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,041
SO GO HAVE A GOOD TIME!

33
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,250
BESIDES, I'M NOT
THAT INTO KARAOKE

34
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,625
AND I'VE GOT LOADS OF OTHER
INVITES TONIGHT!

35
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,958
- AWESOME. YOU HEARD HER. LET'S
GO BEFORE THE ROOMS FILL UP.

36
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,333
- 'KAY. LATER.

37
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,291
- YOUR BAG IS BEGGING FOR
ME TO CARRY IT!

38
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,666
DID I JUST HEAR YOU SAY
YOU DON'T DO KARAOKE?

39
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,541
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

40
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,875
- WHICH SONG WERE YOU
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER?

41
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,625
- AN AWESOME ONE.
- ( Nezu grunting )

42
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,041
- HEY, LET'S GO TO
THE NEW COFFEE SHOP

43
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,625
BY THE TRAIN STATION.

44
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,916
- WE'LL BUY YOU SOME CHOCOLATE!
- DO YOU SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING?

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,333
WORKIN' HER TIT-CHIKOS.

46
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,666
- ♪ I SAID NO, I SAID NO, ♪

47
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,125
♪ I SAID NO MATTER HOW MUCH
I THINK OF YOU, OH... ♪

48
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,125
- IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SINGING
INTO MY SOUL.

49
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,791
- CAN I BE YOU WHEN I GROW UP?

50
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,791
- YOU'RE NEXT! DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SONG YOU'RE GONNA SING?

51
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,125
- UH... NO?

52
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,333
- HEY, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- YEAH, TOTALLY.

53
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,916
EXCEPT... I DUNNO.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,500
I'M WORRIED ABOUT MISS THANG.

55
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,166
I GOT THE FEELING SHE KINDA
WANTED TO COME WITH US TODAY.

56
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,916
- THEN YOU DON'T
KNOW HER VERY WELL.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,458
- WHEN WE LEFT, SHE WAS
RIGHT WHERE SHE WANTED TO BE.

58
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,583
SURROUNDED BY BOYS
BEGGING TO LICK HER SOCKS!

59
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,791
- I'VE TRIED TO HANG
OUT WITH HER,

60
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,375
BUT SHE ALWAYS SAYS
THE SAME THING.

61
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,333
"I DON'T REALLY CLICK
WITH OTHER GIRLS, SO..."

62
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,500
LIKE I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
AND WAS STUPID FOR ASKING!

63
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,000
- I DON'T KNOW.

64
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:01,875
EVEN WHEN SHE'S SURROUNDED
BY GUYS SHE SEEMS REALLY LONELY.

65
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,041
- Atsushi: ICHIKO?

66
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,958
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THE SAME GIRL?

67
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,375
- THAT WASN'T A
LOOK OF LONELINESS.

68
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,000
THAT WAS A LOOK OF 'OVER IT!'

69
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,666
- ARE YOU REALLY
THAT WORRIED ABOUT ICHIKO?

70
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,208
- I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD REASON.

71
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,291
- BUT, MAYBE I'M JUST AN IDIOT.
- ( Nakamura singing )

72
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,791
THAT'S WHAT MY MIND SAYS.
BUT MY INSTINCTS DISAGREE.

73
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,041
- THEN WHY DON'T WE GO
OVER THERE AND ASK HER DIRECTLY?

74
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,500
- SHE'S NOT GONNA BE THERE.

75
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,583
SHE SAID SHE HAD
TONS OF OTHER INVITATIONS.

76
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,958
- OH PLEASE.

77
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,583
SHE'S PROBABLY COUNTING
THE FIBERS IN HER THROW RUG.

78
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,666
- LIKE INDIVIDUALLY?

79
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,250
- TWELVE THOUSAND, 206,
12 THOUSAND, 207.

80
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,333
- TOTALLY CALLED IT.

81
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,875
- THIS IS WHAT YOU
DITCHED US TO DO?

82
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,541
- YOU CAN'T BARGE IN WITHOUT
A WARRANT! I COULD ARREST YOU!

83
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,916
- YOU CAN'T ARREST ANYONE!

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,791
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH ME, SAY SO!

85
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,833
DON'T BE A WUSS AND AVOID ME!

86
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:40,916
- I SHOULD TAKE THIS
TIME TO POINT OUT

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,958
HOW FIERCE MY CANS
LOOK IN THAT TOP!

88
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,958
- I COULDN'T GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT YOUR TOP!

89
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,000
- THAT WAS THE FREAK
WITH THE CHAINSAW, NOT ME!

90
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,916
- STOP! DON'T!
- Ranmaru: CLASSIC DIVA.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,666
- WASN'T THAT FUN? GOOD JOB.

92
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,375
- STOP THAT!

93
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,125
UGH! WHAT DO YOU WANT?

94
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,333
- Both: WE WANT FUN!

95
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,916
- SO WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,416
- 'CAUSE I WANTED TO HANG
WITH MY FRIEND.

97
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,291
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
SPECIFIC IN MIND.

98
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,291
- WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

99
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,083
- WE CAN WATCH THIS
IF YOU GUYS WANT.

100
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,250
IT'S 'SEVEN SAMURAI.'
I RENTED IT YESTERDAY!

101
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,916
- NO! LET'S WATCH
SOMETHING FUNNY!

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,750
- REALLY? DO YOU HAVE
SOMETHING AGAINST NINJAS?

103
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,833
- I JUST THINK NOW WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME TO LAUGH!

104
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,291
- TAKE THAT OUTSIDE!

105
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,375
- YOU HATE MOVIES.
- NO, I DO NOT.

106
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:19,250
- 'KAY, THEN HOW 'BOUT THIS.
WE, UH, SHOULD, UH...

107
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,125
- LET'S TRASH-TALK OUR EXES!

108
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,500
- I'M NOT TALKING TO
YOU ABOUT THAT!

109
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,916
- YAY, LOVE STORIES...
OR AS THEY SAY... LO-STO!

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,166
OUR FIRST STORYTELLER
WILL BE RANMARU.

111
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,125
- NO WAY! RIGHT NOW? OKAY.

112
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,708
SO THERE WAS...
UM, THIS GUY AND...

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,291
I CAN'T DO IT!
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A GOOBER!

114
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,166
I'M SO EMBARRASSED! I CAN'T
STOP LAUGHING! I'M SORRY!

115
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,375
- YOU'RE SO FREAKING LOUD!

116
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,208
THAT WHOLE SCENE
WAS UNCALLED FOR.

117
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,916
I DON'T REMEMBER EVER
BECOMING FRIENDS WITH YOU.

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,166
WHY ARE YOU LYING RIGHT NOW?

119
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,833
- WELL THEN YOUR MEMORY SUCKS.

120
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:52,708
DUDE, YOU TOTALLY GOT
ALL GHETTO ON MY DAD FOR ME!

121
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,041
- BECAUSE THE GUY WAS ASKING
FOR IT AND I HAD NO CHOICE.

122
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,291
TRUST ME, IT WASN'T
ABOUT YOU, OKAY?

123
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,708
IT COULD'VE BEEN
ABOUT ANIMAL RIGHTS

124
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,625
AND I'D STILL WANNA
PAY YOU BACK.

125
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,458
WHICH IS WHY, IF YOU NEED
MY HELP WITH ANYTHING,

126
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,000
JUST SAY THE WORD!

127
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,583
I'M NOT MESSING AROUND.

128
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,333
EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING I
DON'T AGREE WITH, YOU GOT IT!

129
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,291
- UH, OKAY.

130
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,916
THAT'S FINE. YOU WANNA
DO SOMETHING FOR ME. GREAT.

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,208
IF YOU INSIST ON BEING
DRAMATIC ABOUT IT.

132
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,125
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE BUT TO
BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU.

133
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,875
SEE, YOU'RE ANNOYING
THE CRAP OUT OF ME!

134
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,750
I CAN FEEL MY POPULARITY
MELTING OFF MY BONES

135
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,333
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.

136
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,875
FACE IT, WE'RE FROM
TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS

137
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,458
AND I DON'T WANT TO MIGRATE.

138
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,833
SO, STARTING TOMORROW...

139
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,083
I THINK I GOT IT... WHAT THE
HELL... WHY ISN'T IT COMING OFF?

140
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,750
- ARE YOU INSANE?
OR LIKE SOME RABID ZOMBIE FREAK?

141
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,125
- NOT AT ALL.

142
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,916
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU GET
THAT MASK OFF YOUR FACE.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,291
- THIS IS MY FACE!

144
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,291
- LITERALLY. BUT EVERYONE
KNOWS YOU'VE GOT TWO,

145
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,125
AND THE ONE YOU HAVE ON SUCKS.

146
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,416
I'D PREFER TO SEE
YOUR REAL FACE,

147
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,208
BUT THE MASK SEEMS
TO BE INFUSED.

148
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,250
WHICH IS REALLY KINDA SAD
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

149
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,291
- ( exhales angrily )

150
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,583
GO.

151
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,833
DON'T EVER COME NEAR ME AGAIN!

152
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,916
SOMEONE NEEDS TO LOCK YOU UP!

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,958
- DO YOU THINK
I TOOK IT TOO FAR?

154
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,541
- I THINK YOU GOT TOO CLOSE.

155
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,500
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- YOU HIT A NERVE.

156
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,333
- FOR REAL?

157
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,416
- I'M NOT SURE
YOU'RE EVEN HUMAN.

158
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,333
- SO THEN, YOU KNOW
WHAT HER ISSUE IS?

159
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,208
- NAH. THAT PART
DOESN'T INTEREST ME.

160
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,083
- OKAY.

161
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,000
- I CAN TELL IT'S BOTHERING YOU.

162
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,833
- YEAH, IT'S ALL
MAKING MY BRAIN HURT.

163
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,208
- YOU MUST GET THAT A LOT.

164
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,583
IN THAT CASE, I'M GONNA
LEAVE THESE WITH YOU.

165
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,291
I THINK THEY'LL BE HELPFUL.

166
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,625
POVERTY GOD ITEM,
TRAUMA STETHOSCOPE!

167
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,166
YOU CAN USE IT TO LISTEN TO
DEEP DARK SECRETS OF THE PAST

168
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,833
AND HEAR SUPPRESSED
FEELINGS WITHIN THE SOUL

169
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:35,958
THAT ARE REFUSING
TO BE DISCOVERED.

170
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,666
HUMANS ARE SO DARN COMPLICATED!

171
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,666
- THAT'S AWESOME. WAIT, DID YOU
SAY 'POVERTY GOD?' WHAT'S THAT?

172
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,541
- IT IS THE MAGICAL, RARE,
CELESTIAL CREATURE

173
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,875
STANDING BEFORE YOU.

174
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,000
- OH.

175
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,833
THIS IS GREAT.

176
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,125
AND THERE PROBABLY ISN'T
ANOTHER WAY TO EVER KNOW

177
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,666
WHO THE REAL ICHIKO IS.

178
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,875
- NO, NOT YET. I HAVEN'T
EVEN TRIED THAT HARD.

179
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,291
USING IT NOW WOULD
BE LIKE GIVING UP.

180
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,583
- Akane: I'M SO OVER TIT-CHIKO!

181
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,458
I CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT
OF TRYING TO GET THROUGH

182
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,708
ANOTHER YEAR WITH HER!

183
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,291
- DON'T MAKE ME PUKE.

184
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,083
- THAT'S IT! I'M READY TO SEE
HER SQUIRM. HOW 'BOUT YOU?

185
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,625
- ( chattering )

186
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,333
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
MUST'VE SLEPT IN.

187
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,416
- OH, MY GOD!
GO TO FREAKING CLASS!

188
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,708
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE BUDS

189
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,916
JUST 'CAUSE YOU WANNA BE
MY SECOND SKIN, STALKER!

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
DOES SHE REALLY NEED TO BE
AROUND ME ALL DAY?

191
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,750
I CAN'T EVEN BREATHE!

192
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,125
- HEY! THERE YOU ARE!
I BROUGHT YOU LUNCH...

193
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,083
- CAN YOU SHOW ME
HOW TO DO THIS AGAIN?

194
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,750
- SO YOU'RE GONNA MAKE HER WAIT?

195
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,208
I FEEL BAD
YOU HAVE TO AVOID RANMARU.

196
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,583
- AND WHO ARE YOU?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

197
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,291
I'M AKANE. YOU SHOULD KNOW
YOUR CLASSMATES' NAMES.

198
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,416
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

199
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,791
- I WANNA HELP YOU DITCH HER.

200
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,916
GIRLS ON OUR TIER
NEED TO STICK TOGETHER, RIGHT?

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,875
- Momiji: OH FOR CORN'S SAKE.

202
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,125
IS SHE SO DESPERATE
FOR POPULARITY

203
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,041
THAT SHE CAN'T SEE THAT TRASH
FOR WHAT IT IS?

204
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,875
- OH. OH, NO.

205
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,708
OH, NO-NO-NO.

206
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,958
CAPTAIN KUMAGAI, DO YOU
READ ME? COME IN.

207
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,416
REQUEST IMMEDIATE MOBILIZATION
OF THE CHAMPION OF JUSTICE.

208
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,916
- ALL SET, AKANE.

209
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,125
- YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THIS?

210
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,083
- I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
BEEN MORE SURE.

211
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,541
THAT GIRL IS TRASH.
TAKE HER OUT.

212
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,000
- SO YOU DON'T THINK
THIS MAY BE TAKING IT TOO FAR?

213
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,416
- ARE YOU KIDDING RIGHT NOW?

214
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,708
IF THAT HAG FINDS HER
WAY BACK FROM WHEREVE

215
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,041
SHE'LL BE SO AFRAID OF US,

216
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,750
SHE'LL FEEL OBLIGATED TO
SUCK UP AND I CAN'T WAIT!

217
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,916
- ALL RIGHT. I THINK I'LL
GIVE HER A GOOD SCARE

218
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,125
BEFORE WE LEAVE HER.

219
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,041
- ( groaning )
- HOLY CRAP! WHAT HAPPENED?

220
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,125
- HE GOT CLOCKED FROM OUTSIDE!

221
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,250
- NO WAY!
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

222
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,833
- FOLLOWING THE SHADOWY TRAILS

223
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,791
OF THE ONE WHO
EMBRACES LONELINESS.

224
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,208
HER FIGHT FOR FRIENDSHIP
GUIDES HER WAY.

225
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,416
HER HEART BECOMES
A WARRIOR FOR NOBILITY.

226
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,041
AND MOMENTARILY, SHE CONCEALS
THAT CHERRY BLOSSOM SMILE.

227
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,875
RANMARU HAS ARRIVED!

228
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,375
SO TAKE A SEAT, PUNKS!

229
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,625
- HOW DID YOU FIND US?

230
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,916
- YOU TAKE A SEAT!

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,958
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
TAKE ME ON, THEN LET'S GO!

232
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,833
- WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

233
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,625
- YOU SCREW WITH MY FRIENDS,
YOU SCREW WITH ME!

234
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,166
SHE GOT MY KNIFE!

235
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,041
- SMILE! I WAS TRYING
TO BE POLITE!

236
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,541
- ( groaning )
- YOU TWO WITH HIM?

237
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,875
GET OUTTA HERE AND TAKE
THAT PATHETIC WUSS WITH YOU!

238
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,500
- Both: SIR, YES, SIR!

239
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,458
- ( crying )
- ( footsteps retreating )

240
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,041
- LADY BUG, ARE YOU OKAY?

241
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,750
WHOA, SHE DISAPPEARED.
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

242
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,875
- ( door closing )

243
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,833
- ( whimpering )
- OH, I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

244
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,708
SENDING GOONS IN
TO DO YOUR DIRTY WORK

245
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,083
- IS KIND OF A PANSY-ASS MOVE.

246
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,958
- SHUT UP! THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU!

247
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,166
- OF COURSE IT DOES.
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME CLASS.

248
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,916
AND AS A WISE WOMAN ONCE SAID,

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,916
GIRLS ON OUR TIER SHOULD
STICK TOGETHER, RIGHT?

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,291
- ( crackling )
- HUH?

251
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,333
THE HECK IS THAT?

252
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,541
- THAT WAS STUPID.
WHAT IS HER DEAL?

253
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,125
I'M GLAD I CAME TO
BEFORE SHE FINISHED HER SPEECH.

254
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,708
WELL, AT LEAST SHE GOT
TO PLAY HERO.

255
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,208
NOW MAYBE SHE'LL GIVE ME
WHAT I REALLY WANT

256
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,916
AND QUIT BEING A STALKER.

257
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,833
YEAH. I CAN'T WAIT.

258
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,125
- ( glass shattering )

259
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,083
- ( explosion )

260
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,208
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

261
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,750
- DON'T FORGET TO STEER CLEAR
OF THE OLD BUILDING

262
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,541
WHEN WALKING TO CLASS TODAY.

263
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,500
- RANMARU!

264
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,041
- ( rumbling )

265
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,708
- ( gasping )

266
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,250
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

267
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,833
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SAVE
US NOW? YOU'LL GET HURT!

268
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,625
- I HONESTLY HAVE NO CLUE.

269
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,125
I'M GUESSING THIS THING
FELL ON ME AND I CAUGHT IT.

270
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,666
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

271
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,416
THAT PATH LEADS TO THE HALLWAY.
HURRY, BEFORE IT COLLAPSES!

272
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
- BUT HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE?

273
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,375
- LOOK. JUST GO. HURRY!

274
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,791
- ( panting )

275
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,500
- HEY, HOLD ON!

276
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,291
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MISS KARATE CHOP?

277
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,958
- LIKE I KNOW!
- YOU HAVE TO!

278
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,750
IS SHE STILL TRAPPED IN THERE?

279
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,250
- GET OFF ME!

280
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,291
- WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!
- JUST WAIT!

281
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,250
- I'M NOT MESSING AROUND.

282
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,791
EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING I DON'T
AGREE WITH, YOU GOT IT!

283
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,125
- YOU'RE SO STUPID.

284
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,041
HA! SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU DO THINGS FOR "FRIENDS".

285
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,375
YOU END UP STUCK IN
SITUATIONS LIKE THESE!

286
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,833
I GUESS YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!

287
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,125
I WAS NEVER DUMB ENOUGH
TO SAY WE'RE FRIENDS SO I'M OUT!

288
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,666
I DON'T CARE IF YOU OWE ME!

289
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,291
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT
ANYTHING FROM YOU

290
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,875
AND I MEANT IT!

291
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,625
IF YOU'D TAKEN THE HINT
AND LEFT ME ALONE

292
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,500
YOU WOULDN'T BE STUCK
IN THERE RIGHT NOW!

293
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,750
IDIOT!

294
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,041
- IT'S OBVS YOU WANNA
HELP HER. SO DO IT.

295
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,208
- OH COME ON.

296
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,125
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M
GONNA GO IN THERE?

297
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,541
- GEEZ, CAN YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

298
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,041
YOU'RE STANDING THERE
OBSESSING OVER IT

299
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,791
AND YELLING AT THE WALL
TO NO ONE.

300
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,875
IF YOU WEREN'T
WORRIED ABOUT HER,

301
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,500
YOU'D HAVE BEEN GONE ALREADY.

302
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,875
- YOU THINK YOU HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS DON'T YOU?

303
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,375
- NOT ALL, BUT RANMARU WILL DIE
IF SOMEONE DOESN'T HELP HER.

304
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,291
- MAYBE SO, BUT...

305
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,333
IF I HELP HER THEN,

306
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,541
SHE'LL PROBABLY WANT TO BE MY...

307
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,958
I JUST CAN'T.

308
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,041
- WOW. THIS IS A LOT HEAVIER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS.

309
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,166
LET ME GUESS.
IT'S NOT JUST A FRIEND THING.

310
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,250
YOU DON'T WANNA BE
CLOSE TO ANYONE.

311
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,791
- SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

312
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,833
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT!

313
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,375
- YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T.

314
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,041
- YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME!

315
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,583
- NOBODY DOES!
- NOPE. YOU WON'T LET 'EM.

316
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,541
- ( crying ) PLEASE, I CAN'T
HANDLE GOING THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

317
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,750
I WON'T SURVIVE IT AGAIN!

318
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,958
- Kurumi: IT'S ALMOST
VALENTINE'S DAY.

319
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,625
HAVE YOU DECIDED WHO YOU'RE
GOING TO GIVE CHOCOLATE TO YET?

320
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,958
- YEAH, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YUSUKE.

321
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,958
'CAUSE OUT OF ALL THE BOYS IN
SCHOOL, HE'S THE NICEST TO ME.

322
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,416
- HE IS REALLY NICE.

323
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,333
THAT'S WHY I WAS THINKING
ABOUT GIVING HIM CHOCOLATES

324
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,875
FOR VALENTINE'S DAY, TOO!

325
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,666
- YOU WERE?

326
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,500
- BUT THERE'S NO WAY HE'D
EVER LIKE ME MORE THAN YOU!

327
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,125
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

328
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

329
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,375
SHOULD WE BOTH GIVE HIM
DIFFERENT CHOCOLATE BOXES?

330
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,291
- I DON'T THINK IT WOULD
BE RIGHT FOR EITHER OF US

331
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,500
TO BE WITH HIM.

332
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,625
FRIENDS SHOULD NEVER DO THAT
TO EACH OTHER!

333
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,583
- YEAH, LET'S DO IT
AT THE SAME TIME THEN.

334
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,625
- UH, ICHIKO.

335
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,416
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!

336
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,208
- ( growling )

337
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,708
WHAT A PRETTY BROOCH!

338
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,208
- OH. THANKS!

339
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,375
- IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ONE
I'VE EVER SEEN!

340
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,041
IS THERE ANY WAY
I COULD HAVE IT?

341
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,875
- PRETTY PLEASE?
- ( gasping )

342
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,083
NO, YOU CAN HAVE SOMETHING ELSE.

343
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,875
( thinking ) THIS WAS
FROM YUSUKE.

344
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,625
- OKAY.

345
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,125
I GUESS THAT MEANS IT'S
MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU

346
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,125
THAN YOUR FRIENDS.

347
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,416
FINE THEN, STARTING TOMORROW

348
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,916
YOU AND I AREN'T
FRIENDS ANYMORE.

349
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,458
- HAVE FUN WITH YOUR STUPID PIN!
- NO! KURUMI. PLEASE WAIT!

350
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,458
OKAY, YOU CAN HAVE IT!

351
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,708
- ( giggling )

352
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,541
ADORABLE.

353
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,791
OH, AND GUESS WHAT?

354
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,208
I THINK I'M GONNA TELL
YUSUKE THAT I LIKE HIM,

355
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,250
- SO HE CAN BE MY BOYFRIEND!
- BUT...

356
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,750
- BUT YOU ALREADY SAID
THAT WE SHOULDN'T...

357
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,000
- I MADE UP MY MIND!

358
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,583
BUT ONE THING ISN'T RIGHT.

359
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,750
I WOULD LOVE YOUR BLESSING.
WILL YOU PLEASE PRAY

360
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,208
FOR EVERYTHING TO GO WELL
WITH ME AND HIM?

361
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:03,041
I'M SO GLAD WE'RE FRIENDS
AND THAT YOU'LL DO THIS FOR ME!

362
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,500
- AND EVEN IF IT MEANS LOSING
MY FRIEND AND BEING ALL ALONE.

363
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,916
PLEASE, GOD.

364
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,875
LET EVERYTHING GO WELL
FOR KURUMI AND YUSUKE TOMORROW.

365
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,666
- SORRY. BUT,
I THINK I LIKE ICHIKO.

366
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,458
- ( grunting )

367
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,833
- OH, YUSUKE,
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU!

368
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,083
AND YOU GAVE HER
SUCH A NICE GIFT!

369
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,416
YEAH. SHE SAID IT WAS
SOME CHEAP, LAME TOY

370
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,708
AND GAVE IT TO ME.
BUT I REALLY LOVE IT!

371
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,791
- OH. HI, YUSUKE!

372
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,875
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S BEEN
BRINGING YOU DOWN LATELY,

373
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,166
BUT SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

374
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,166
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT OR WHO IT'S ABOUT.

375
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,708
I DON'T REALLY CARE. I JUST
KNOW IT'S OLD AND I'M OVER IT.

376
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,791
IT'S NOT ANYTHING
I HAD EVER WANTED TO ADMIT,

377
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,125
BUT WHEN YOU'RE ALL MOPEY-FACE,
I CAN'T FUNCTION.

378
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,000
I'M ALLERGIC TO YOUR GLOOM.

379
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,458
- SO WHAT HAPPENS, THEN?

380
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,750
- I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.

381
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,625
YOU'RE GONNA STOP ACTING
LIKE A SELFISH WEINIE!

382
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,041
SNAP OUT OF IT AND CHEER UP!

383
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,125
YOU CARE ABOUT OTHERS
AND THAT IS OKAY.

384
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,583
YOU ONLY MAKE IT
HARDER ON YOURSELF

385
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,000
WHEN YOU PRETEND YOU DON'T.

386
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,916
IF YOU WON'T ACCEPT IT
AND LET GO OF YOUR PAST, THEN...

387
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,375
( groaning )

388
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,875
- QUIT TRYING TO TEACH ME
HOW TO LIVE!

389
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,291
I DON'T NEED LECTURES
FROM A POVERTY GOD!

390
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,625
- DON'T MISS! WHOOPSIE-DAISY!

391
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,166
GET BACK.... OW, THAT HURTS!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!

392
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,750
- ALL DONE.

393
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,041
- THAT WAS THE WORST PAIN I'VE
EVER FELT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!

394
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,500
- I'M FLATTERED, BUT IT'LL START
TO FEEL BETTER SOON.

395
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,916
- HUSH! NO IT WON'T!
- HEADS UP!

396
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,125
- REALLY?
- AND HERE'S YOUR MISSION.

397
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,791
JUST THIS ONCE, TRY TO BE HONEST

398
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,375
ABOUT WHAT IT IS YOU WANT AND
WHAT YOU THINK YOU SHOULD DO.

399
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,583
I WANT THE ANSWERS TO COME
FROM YOUR TRUE SELF.

400
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,666
NOT FROM THAT OBNOXIOUS WEIRDO
YOU LIKE TO PRETEND TO BE.

401
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,791
- STARTING TO GET HEAVY,
EVEN FOR ME.

402
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,875
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
MY LIFE IS GONNA END, THOUGH.

403
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,041
- ( crackling )
- HUH?

404
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:14,333
- WHAT'S THAT LITTLE GUY DOING
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

405
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,875
- OH, MY GOD! IT'S A SNAKE!
- NOT QUITE. WASSUP?

406
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,291
- LADY PANTS?

407
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,916
WHAT THE CRAP ARE YOU DOING
IN THE MOUTH OF A SNAKE?

408
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,041
I THOUGHT YOU ESCAPED.
WHY ARE YOU BACK?

409
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,916
IF WE DON'T GET YOU OUTTA HERE,
YOU'RE GONNA DIE!

410
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,833
THIS IS GOOD.
WHAT IS IT?

411
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,458
- HAPPINESS ENERGY.
ALL NATURAL FLAVORS.

412
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,083
WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU HAPPY?

413
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,250
- NO, IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
THAT FAST, GOOBER.

414
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,625
HEY, NEVER MIND.
MAYBE IT DOES HAPPEN THAT FAST!

415
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,875
- THEN LET'S START MAKING
OUR WAY OUT!

416
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,250
- THAT IS ONE CUTE MONKEY.

417
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,708
BUT HOW IS IT SUPPOSED
TO HELP US DOWN HERE?

418
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,083
- ( screaming )
- ( rumbling )

419
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,833
- HE'LL BLOW THE DEBRIS AWAY!

420
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,875
- WOW! THAT'S AMAZING!

421
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,750
- ( both yelling )

422
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,041
- ( explosion )

423
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,708
- THE GREAT
RANMARU RINDO RETURNS!

424
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,375
I GUESS I OWE YOU
TWO FAVORS NOW, HUH?

425
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,208
- LISTEN, IF YOU WANT
TO HELP ME.

426
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,291
THEN I NEED YOU TO STOP
FOLLOWING ME AROUND

427
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,500
ALL THE TIME.

428
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,166
- UM...

429
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,166
YEAH, SURE. IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT, YOU GOT IT.

430
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,458
I'M GONE.

431
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,583
BUT FIRST... I HAVE TO KNOW,

432
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,666
WHY YOU ALWAYS PUSH THE PEOPLE
WHO CARE FOR YOU AWAY.

433
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,208
SOMEONE YOU LOVED IN THE PAST
SCREWED YOU OVER HARD CORE?

434
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,333
- YEAH. HOW'D...
- MOMIJI...

435
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,375
I WAS WORRIED AND SHE TOLD ME
SHE'D ALWAYS HAD A HUNCH

436
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,083
ABOUT THAT BEING THE CASE.

437
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,166
- IT'S NOT A HUNCH.
SHE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH.

438
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,750
- THEN THERE'S THIS.

439
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:35,916
- WHAT IS IT?

440
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,708
- MOMIJI GAVE IT TO ME.

441
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,000
SHE SAID BY WEARING IT,

442
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,791
I'D BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO
WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART.

443
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,166
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO USE IT, I WON'T.

444
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,458
I KNOW YOUR PAST IS DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO FACE,

445
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,833
BUT I'M DIFFERENT.

446
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,125
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
AND I WANT TO HELP.

447
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,500
EVEN IF IT MEANS
GIVING YOU SOME TIME.

448
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,833
BUT I HOPE...

449
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,250
I HOPE SOMEDAY
I'LL BE ABLE TO EARN YOUR TRUST

450
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,291
AND YOU'LL OPEN UP TO ME.

451
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,458
OR, LET ME USE THAT.

452
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,083
REALLY? ARE YOU SURE?

453
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,666
- YEAH, BUT IF YOU
DON'T WANT TO...

454
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,291
- OH, NO WAY, I WANNA LISTEN!

455
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,916
I WANNA GET TO KNOW
THE REAL YOU EVEN BETTER.

456
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,250
- Girl: NO WAY, SO THAT WAS
YOUR PLAN THE WHOLE TIME?

457
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,708
- YEAH, IT'S SO MUCH MORE FUN
IF YOU KEEP HER CLOSE TO YOU.

458
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,250
BEING MEAN WILL
ONLY SCARE HER OFF

459
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,916
AND YOU WON'T EVER GET ANYTHING.

460
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,708
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
PRETEND YOU'RE HER FRIEND

461
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,666
AND SHE'LL GIVE YOU WHATEVER.

462
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,666
MORNING, ICHIKO.
YOU CAN HAVE THIS BACK.

463
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,041
I DON'T NEED IT.

464
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,708
YUSUKE SAID HE WAS GOING TO
BUY ME SOMETHING BETTER.

465
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,625
- BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR GIVING IT TO ME.

466
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,208
- I DON'T WANT IT.

467
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,041
- WHAT?

468
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,791
- I DON'T WANT ANY OF IT.

469
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,541
- WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

470
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,041
THAT UGLY BROOCH
IS WHAT'S WRONG!

471
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,250
GET THIS PIECE OF JUNK
OFF MY DESK!

472
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,916
DON'T GO FEELING SORRY FOR ME.

473
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,333
IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL FOR GIRLS
TO GET JEALOUS OF SOMEONE

474
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,916
WHO'S PRETTY AND POPULAR.

475
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,083
LUCKILY I'VE LEARNED
NOT TO LET IT AFFECT ME

476
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,125
AND I'M A LOT STRONGER
BECAUSE OF IT.

477
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,875
- TRYING TO AVOID MAKING FRIENDS
DOESN'T MAKE YOU STRONG.

478
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,333
- SCREW 'FRIENDS!'

479
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,666
THAT'S JUST A SUPERFICIAL TITLE.

480
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,041
IT'S A JOKE!

481
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,833
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE SAY SO
THEY CAN USE EACH OTHER!

482
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,166
NO ONE GIVES A CRAP WHO YOU ARE!

483
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,833
THEY JUST DON'T WANT
TO FEEL GUILTY!

484
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,500
IF SOMEONE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS,

485
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,000
THEY'RE ASKING PERMISSION TO
USE ME AND I AM SO OVER THAT!

486
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,000
I'M MY ONLY FRIEND NOW,
AND I'M FINE WITH IT!

487
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,166
EVERYONE'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

488
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,833
EVEN YOU. SOMEDAY YOU'LL FIND
A WAY TO USE ME, THEN LEAVE.

489
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,708
- NO, I WOULDN'T!
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM!

490
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,875
- I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK
YOU WOULD RIGHT NOW, BUT...

491
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,958
- WHY TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PAST
IF YOU CAN'T LET IT GO?

492
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,958
I GET IT. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
HURT LIKE THAT AGAIN. WHO DOES?

493
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,041
BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE
A CHANCE TO PROVE YOU WRONG!

494
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,125
I AM NOT KURUMI
AND I NEVER WILL BE.

495
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,166
- I KNOW.
- I PROMISE YOU.

496
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,875
NO. I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING HOLY,
I AM NEVER GOING TO BETRAY YOU.

497
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,833
- YEAH, RIGHT. YOU SO WILL.

498
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,416
- NO. I WON'T.

499
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,166
- YOU WILL.
- WON'T.

500
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,791
- YOU WILL!
- NO, I WON'T!

501
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,458
- I KNOW HOW THIS ENDS!
- THE HELL YOU DO!

502
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,708
- YOU WILL LEAVE!
- I WON'T!

503
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,208
- WHERE AM I GONNA GO? TRUST ME!
- WILL WILL WILL WILL WILL!

504
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,916
- ( breathing heavily )

505
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,458
- I'M SORRY. BUT I'VE SEEN IT
TOO MANY TIMES.

506
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,750
- NOT FROM ME.

507
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,875
AND I SWEAR YOU NEVER WILL.

508
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,875
I AM NOT THEM.

509
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,291
- YOU...

510
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,416
YOU PROMISE?

511
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:19,916
YOU WON'T GO?

512
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,708
- TOTALLY! CROSS MY HEART!

513
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,666
- ( sobbing )

514
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,291
- READY FOR SOME KARAOKE,
LADY PANTS?

515
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,041
- FAR FROM READY, I'M UNWILLING.

516
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,916
- YAY! IT'S GONNA BE FUN!

517
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,666
IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE DAY,
MISS RANMARU.

518
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,375
I'M NOT READY FOR KARAOKE.

519
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:20,208
- AGAIN WITH THE 'MISS RANMARU!'
HOW DO YOU EXPECT OUR FRIENDSHIP

520
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,000
TO GROW WHEN YOU TREAT ME
LIKE A MATH TEACHER?

521
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,916
CALL ME BY MY NAME!

522
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,125
- LET'S GO! UNLESS YOU'D RATHER
COUNT THE FIBERS IN YOUR RUG?

523
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,708
- Ichiko: SHUT UP!

524
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,541
UM, RANMARU?

525
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,041
SEE, I'M TRYING.
CAN I ASK A FAVOR?

526
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,083
YOU ALWAYS CALL ME LADY PANTS.

527
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,875
WILL YOU PLEASE USE MY NAME?

528
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,041
- ( laughing )

529
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,041
I THINK I CAN DO THAT, ICHIKO!

530
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,833
- Momiji: WELL, I THINK YOU BOTH
SUCK. I WAS PROMISED KARAOKE.

531
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,916
- Ichiko: UGH! SHUT YOUR
FAT TRAP, POVERTY PUTZ!

532
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,666
- Students: THIS WEEK'S.
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO.

533
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,708
- ( talking very fast )
