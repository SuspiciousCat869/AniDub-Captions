1
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,750
- GOODBYE...
SWEET ICHIKO...

2
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,958
- PLEASE TRY TO BE NICE TO
THE OTHER MOMIJI FOR ME, OKAY?

3
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:09,125
- NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

4
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,333
TAKE THAT.

5
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,166
- ICHIKO. BUT WHY?

6
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,916
- DON'T GET THIS TWISTED.

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,041
IT'S JUST THAT THE
WAY YOU ARE NOW.

8
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,833
WELL, IT'S NOT QUITE AS BAD AS
THE OTHER VERSION OF YOU.

9
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,250
AND IT WOULD BE A REAL SHAME TO
LET THE HALF WAY DECENT SIDE

10
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,583
OF YOU GO TO WASTE.

11
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,583
BUT DON'T THINK THAT IN
ANY WAY MEANS THIS GIRL

12
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,125
WANTS TO BE FRIENDS WITH
A POVERTY GOD.

13
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:38,750
'CAUSE I DON'T. BUT EITHER WAY,
I WON'T LET YOU CHANGE BACK.

14
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,291
- NO, ICHIKO, WAIT.

15
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,750
- SO, I HAVE A QUESTION.
- WHAT IS IT?

16
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,291
- YOU STILL CAN'T GET TO YOUR
SOMIN SHORAI, RIGHT?

17
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,250
- ( screams ) OH CRAP!

18
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,958
- WHAT'S UP?
- RANMARU?

19
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,875
- YOU'RE LUCKY I WAS RIGHT HERE.
YOU ALMOST DIED.

20
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,833
- YEAH, BUT WHY
ARE YOU RIGHT HERE?

21
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,333
- I WAS BORED, SO
I DECIDED TO COME OVER

22
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,916
TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS WERE UP TO.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,875
THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, YOU GUYS
JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW.

24
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,750
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

25
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,250
- WE DIDN'T EXPECT YOU, EITHER.

26
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,083
- OUT OF CURIOSITY, HOW FAR DID
YOU JUST JUMP?

27
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,500
- ( glass shattering )

28
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,750
- Momo'o: YOU WON'T
GET AWAY FROM US, MOMIJI. I...

29
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,083
- WHOA, GARBAGE BOMBS?
WHAT IN THE HELL IS GOING ON?

30
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,583
- LATER. FIRST, CAN WE FOCUS ON
GETTING AWAY FROM THOSE TWO?

31
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,416
- YOU WANT ME TO
TURN MY BACK TO THE ENEMY?

32
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,666
- YES, PLEASE.
- JUST GO ALREADY.

33
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,541
- OH, FINE. WHAT'S THE POINT.

34
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,083
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
WHAT'S GOIN' ON.

35
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,500
HOLD TIGHT, GIRLS.
WE'RE OUTTA HERE.

36
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,458
- NORMALLY, THAT WOULD BE
AN ACCURATE STATEMENT, YES...

37
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,708
UGH, BUT RIGHT NOW,

38
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,583
ALL THIS SMELLY GARBAGE HAS MADE
MY NOSE GO NUMB.

39
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,291
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT A BIT.

40
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,625
WITH ANY LUCK IT WILL
START WORKING

41
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,583
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

42
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,916
- SO, IF YOU GET DIRTY, YOU'LL
GO BACK TO THE OLD MOMIJI?

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
THAT'S KINDA RANDOM.

44
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,458
- IT SEEMS TOO SIMPLE, I KNOW
BUT THAT'S HOW KUMAGAI CHANGED.

45
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,625
I'M STILL NOT
ENTIRELY CONVINCED.

46
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,208
BUT SHE DID ONLY
START ACTING THIS WAY

47
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,583
AFTER WE GAVE HER THAT BATH.

48
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,000
- SO IF WE DO THE OPPOSITE,
SHE'LL TURN BACK?

49
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,791
STILL, THEIR BEHAVIOR
IS INEXCUSABLE.

50
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,375
THE REASON DOESN'T MATTER.

51
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,500
THROWING GARBAGE AT A WOMAN IS
NOT SOMETHING A MAN SHOULD DO.

52
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,958
- CAN WE PLEASE CONCENTRATE
ON WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

53
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,166
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN
JUST KEEP RUNNING AWAY FROM THEM

54
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,083
LIKE THIS FOREVER, RIGHT?

55
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,500
- WE WON'T HAVE TO.

56
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,666
I THINK WE'LL BE FINE.

57
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,833
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T CATCH US
BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN.

58
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,166
I'M SURE THEY'LL GIVE UP
AFTER IT GETS DARK.

59
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,666
- WHY IS THAT?

60
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,708
- YEAH, IS THE DOG'S NOSE GONNA
STOP WORKING OR SOMETHING?

61
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,291
- WELL...

62
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,458
- ( honking )

63
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,250
- JIVE ASS TURKEYS. YOU GOT
A DEATH WISH OR SOMETHING?

64
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,000
I AM DRIVING HERE.

65
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,083
OF COURSE THE GIRLS THAT JUMP IN
FRONT OF ME'D BE YOU THREE.

66
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,416
- WHAT IS A MONK DOING
DRIVING A TRUCK?

67
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,291
- I GOT A JOB LAST WEEK MAKING
DELIVERIES FOR A LIQUOR STORE,

68
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,041
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOIN'.

69
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,291
- BOBBY, THIS IS PERFECT,

70
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,000
WE NEED YOU TO GIVE US
A RIDE AWAY FROM HERE,

71
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,583
LIKE OUT OF TOWN AWAY.

72
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY.

73
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,708
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS KEEP HIDDEN

74
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,500
UNTIL NIGHT FALL, AND WE WIN.

75
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,583
- THEN LEAVING TOWN
IS A BRILLIANT PLAN.

76
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,791
- HOLD ON. DID I NOT JUST TELL
YOU I WAS WORKING HERE?

77
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,958
- WHATEVER, IT'S JUST GONNA BE
LIKE AN HOUR.

78
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,791
NO MEANS NO. I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DEAL WITH LITTLE GIRLS

79
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,333
GETTING ALL SELFISH ON ME.

80
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,500
- FINE. IF YOU AGREE
TO HELP US OUT,

81
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,125
I'LL LET YOU TOUCH MY BOOBS.

82
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,250
YOU CAN FONDLE THE HELL OUT OF
'EM FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO.

83
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,083
- NOW JUST WHO
DO YOU THINK I AM?

84
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:41,458
THAT YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE. GIRL?

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,833
- COME ON, MONK, GIVE IT ALL YOU
GOT. PEDAL TO THE METAL.

86
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,791
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

87
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,166
- ABOUT WHAT?

88
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,625
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME.

89
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,166
YOU'D LET SOMEONE
WHO EMBODIES LUST

90
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,666
DEPRIVE YOU OF YOUR CHASTITY?

91
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,208
- NO ONE SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

92
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,000
- NIPPLES IN THE CENTER,
AND TWEAK!

93
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,000
- BESIDES, LIKE I SAID EARLIER,

94
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,625
LETTING YOU GET AWAY IS
FOR MY SAKE, NOT YOURS.

95
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,708
REMEMBER, I'M THE GIRL
WHO CAN ONLY EVER THINK

96
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,250
ABOUT HER OWN HAPPINESS.

97
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,000
- ( gasps )

98
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,083
- WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S OKAY, THEN.

99
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,166
I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT WANTING
YOU TO USE YOUR

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,875
HAPPINESS ENERGY FOR THE SAKE OF
OTHER PEOPLE, BUT, IN THE END,

101
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,666
YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT.

102
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,291
PEOPLE WHO THINK
ONLY OF OTHERS

103
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,208
WILL EVENTUALLY RUIN
THEMSELVES IN THE PROCESS.

104
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,541
LIKE THAT KURUMI GIRL.

105
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,875
ALL YOU EVER WANTED BACK THEN
WAS FOR HER TO BE HAPPY, RIGHT?

106
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,625
AND LOOK WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU.

107
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,416
- HOLD ON, HOW DID YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

108
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,166
- LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?

109
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:45,125
IF YOU GENUINELY NEED ME HERE,
THEN I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

110
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR HAPPINESS

111
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,000
ALL BY YOURSELF ANYMORE.

112
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,625
- YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG.

113
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,375
WHATEVER IT IS YOU THINK I WANT,
YOU'RE WRONG.

114
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,625
- AFTER ALL THE CONSTANT
FIGHTING AND DEATH THREATS,

115
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,666
I NEVER GAVE UP HOPE
THAT THIS DAY WOULD COME.

116
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,958
- HEY, SORRY TO
INTERRUPT YOUR OVARY FEST

117
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,750
OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU DOING,
BUT WE GOT COMPANY.

118
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,125
- ( yelling )

119
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,458
- OH, CRAP. LOOKS LIKE THE
GARBAGE BOMBER FOUND US!

120
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,125
- BOBBY, DODGE THEM.

121
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,916
- ( tires screeching )

122
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,250
THIS IS PROBABLY VERY ANNOYING
TO OTHER DRIVERS.

123
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,500
- KUMAGAI. LAUNCH ME AT THEM.

124
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,541
INCOMING.

125
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,750
- INCOMING YOUR FACE.

126
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,666
- ( Momo'o screaming )

127
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,958
- SOMEONE'S ON THE CAR.

128
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,750
OKAY, LET'S TRY
THAT ONE MORE TIME!

129
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,541
- I KNOW!

130
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,125
- WHAT IS IT? WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

131
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,625
- IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

132
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,708
MOMIJI IS THE ONE WHO HAS TO
GET AWAY FROM THEM, NOT US.

133
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,666
SO THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME TO
TRY TO ESCAPE WITH HER, RIGHT?

134
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,041
- NO, I GUESS THERE'S NOT.

135
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,166
- AWESOME. I'LL BE ABLE TO
TAKE CARE OF THIS NOW.

136
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,208
- BE CAREFUL.

137
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,000
- 'TIS THE VICIOUS
ACT OF A VILLAIN

138
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,083
TO ATTEMPT TO COME BETWEEN
AND PULL APART

139
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,083
THE WEAVE OF FEMALE BONDS.

140
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,250
FOR THE LOVE THAT BINDS
TRUE FRIENDS TOGETHER,

141
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,125
I ACCEPT AND SHOULDER THE
DESTINY OF FOILING THE ENEMY.

142
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,041
SO BRING IT, PUPPY POWER.

143
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,583
FROM THIS MOMENT ON, YOU'LL
HAVE TO GO UP AGAINST ME.

144
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,125
- PATHETIC HUMAN.

145
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,625
IF YOU THINK I'LL HOLD BACK
SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'RE A GIRL,

146
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,625
YOU ARE GREATLY MISTAKEN.

147
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,875
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S A RELIEF.

148
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,500
MOPPING THE FLOOR WITH
YOU WHILE YOU'RE TRYING

149
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,708
WILL BE SO MUCH MORE REWARDING.

150
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,916
- WRONG.

151
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,708
- HE'S STRONG.

152
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,541
- ( both grunting )

153
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:46,875
- ( yelling )

154
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,000
- GO ON WITHOUT ME, KUMAGAI.

155
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,083
I'LL CATCH UP AS SOON AS I
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

156
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,750
- GUESS AGAIN.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

157
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,875
- RANMARU, NO.

158
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,916
- ( screaming )

159
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,541
- DO YA LIKE THAT?

160
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,458
- ( laughs ) NOT BAD.
HOW WAS IT FOR YOU?

161
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,916
HOLY DOG. THAT MUST'VE HURT
MORE THAN I THOUGHT.

162
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,250
- WHAT? WAIT. HEY.

163
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,083
THAT IS SO NOT FAIR!
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL

164
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,916
I COULD BEAT A FREAKIN'
PUPPY TO NEAR DEATH!

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,958
TURN BACK INTO YOUR
ORIGINAL FORM AND DO IT NOW!

166
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,125
- HIT ME FIRST.

167
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,333
- WHAT?

168
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,916
- IF YOU HIT ME, I'LL TURN BACK.
JUST HIT ME.

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,166
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU,
YOU REPULSIVE SON OF A BITCH?

170
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,083
- YOU CAN PUNCH ME OR
SLAP ME OR KICK ME.

171
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,250
COME ON, KICK ME.
IT'LL BE AWESOME.

172
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,083
- I DON'T WANT RABIES,
GET AWAY FROM ME.

173
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,125
- WAIT, YOU CAN'T
USE YOUR SOMIN SHORAI,

174
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,750
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?

175
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,125
- MM-HM. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER
AWESOME GEAR ON YOU?

176
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,666
KUMAGAI SEEMS LIKE HE'S PRETTY
DETERMINED BACK THERE.

177
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,666
- WELL, WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?

178
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,625
HERE, SPECIAL DEAL,
JUST FOR YOU.

179
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,375
- WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS?

180
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,125
- THEY'RE A GIFT INFUSED WITH
MY VERY OWN SUPERNATURAL POWERS,

181
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,416
WHICH I LIKE TO CALL,
"PRAYER BEADS, THE HYPER".

182
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,458
PUT 'EM ON YOUR FEET
TO INCREASE LEG STRENGTH.

183
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,208
PUT 'EM OVER YOUR EYES,
AND THEY BOOST YOUR VISION.

184
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,125
- WOW, THAT'S NOT CREEPY AT ALL.

185
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,250
- WE'RE NOT TOUCHING THOSE
UNTIL YOU CAN PROMISE US

186
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,291
THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN USED

187
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,458
ON ANY OTHER BODY PARTS.

188
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,166
- WHATEVER, I'LL TAKE THEM.

189
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,958
WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS. KUMAGAI.

190
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,916
OH, HEY, TAMA. ARE YOU GONNA
HELP US OUT NOW?

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,041
- ( squealing )

192
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,625
- BOBBY. KEEP HER
SAFE FOR ME, OKAY?

193
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,291
- LONG AS THEM TITTIES
ARE STILL ON THE TABLE.

194
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:35,166
- ICHIKO. PLEASE DON'T DO
ANYTHING CRAZY.

195
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,083
- I TOLD YOU. I'M NOT DOING THIS
FOR YOU. I'M DOING THIS FOR ME.

196
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,333
THAT'S AWESOME.
I'M LIKE RANMARU.

197
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,625
- ( meowing angrily )

198
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,333
- ( lightning crashing )

199
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,666
- ( waves crashing )

200
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,208
- NO, TAMA, NO. BAD KITTY.

201
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,458
STOP. I'M NOT GONNA LET
YOU GET PAST ME.

202
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,083
- WHAT? "DON'T GET IN OUR WAY,
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING."

203
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,000
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED MEAN?

204
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,375
HUH? IF A POVERTY GOD IS WASHED
AND REMAINS WITHOUT THEIR POWERS

205
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,291
FOR SEVEN DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS,
THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS.

206
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,000
THEY WILL THEN
TURN INTO A HUMAN.

207
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,791
AND WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT THAT?

208
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,791
A DOLL?

209
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,083
IN ORDER FOR DEITIES TO
COMMUNICATE WITH HUMANS,

210
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,916
THEY MUST FIRST TAKE POSSESSION
OF DOLLS KNOWN AS "HUMA FORMS".

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,208
IF THEY DON'T, HUMANS WON'T
BE ABLE TO SEE THEM,

212
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,500
MUCH LESS HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH THEM.

213
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,958
FURTHERMORE, IF THEY GO LONGER
THAN THE TIME I MENTIONED

214
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,500
WITHOUT THEIR GODLY
POWERS RETURNING,

215
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,416
THEY WILL BE UNABLE TO
LEAVE THEIR HUMAN FORMS?

216
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,041
IF THAT HAPPENS, THEIR
PERSONALITIES WILL NEVER RETURN.

217
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,208
IN OTHER WORDS, FOR MOMIJI,
IT CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,291
SHE'S GONNA DIE?

219
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,791
DEATH.

220
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,833
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

221
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,166
WAIT. KUMAGAI, WHERE...

222
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,041
( groans )

223
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:30,875
NO. PLEASE WAIT. KUMAGAI.

224
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,916
BUT WHY? WHY DIDN'T
SHE SAY ANYTHING?

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,166
I MEAN, THAT'S KIND OF AN
IMPORTANT DETAIL TO MENTION.

226
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,125
SHE WON'T BE AROUND ANYMORE.

227
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,958
IN HALF AN HOUR, SHE WON'T BE
ANYWHERE ANYMORE.

228
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,375
IF SHE KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
THIS WHOLE TIME, THEN...

229
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,166
HUH?

230
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,125
IF SHE KNEW...

231
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,125
SHE HAD TO KNOW, SO WHY?

232
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,708
- OH. YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

233
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,750
- HUH?

234
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,666
( screams ) TSUWABUKI.

235
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,666
- HOLY JEEZ THAT HURT. YOU
SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

236
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

237
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,166
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
ABOUT TO SAY.

238
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,875
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

239
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,458
- I WAS, UM, JUST, UH,
TAKING A NAP.

240
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,375
- NAP? THAT'S PRETTY BOLD.
MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND ALL.

241
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,041
- OKAY, YOUR TURN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

242
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,416
- I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF WORK.

243
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,416
- I HELPED GET BOBBY,
THAT MONK FRIEND OF YOURS,

244
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,875
A JOB DOING DELIVERIES FOR THE
LIQUOR STORE WHERE I HELP OUT.

245
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,708
BUT HE HASN'T COME
BACK SINCE HE LEFT,

246
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,666
SO NOW I'M CLEANING
UP THAT MESS.

247
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,208
- UH...
- OKAY. WHAT'S THAT FACE FOR?

248
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,166
- NOTHING. FACE?
WHAT? NOTHING AT ALL.

249
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,291
NEVER MIND THAT ANYWAY, I HAVE
SOMEWHERE TO GO. BYE.

250
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,458
- 'KAY.
- SEE YA LATER.

251
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:48,750
SOMEWHERE TO GO. AND AFTER I
CATCH UP, WHAT DO I DO THEN?

252
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,541
DO I TRY TO STOP KUMAGAI?
WHAT IF HE CAN SAVE HER?

253
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,000
HEY. TSUWABUKI, HOLD ON A SEC.

254
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,583
I NEED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

255
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,458
IT'S JUST LIKE A WHAT IF THING.

256
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,083
BUT, WELL, HERE GOES.

257
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,958
LET'S SAY THERE'S THIS PERSON
WHO REALLY GETS ON MY NERVES.

258
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:14,083
LIKE I HATE THEM,
A LOT, LIKE, YEAH.

259
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,875
BUT THEN, I FIND OUT
THEY COULD BE GONE FOREVER

260
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,416
AND, UM, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

261
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,750
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD BE BEST.

262
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,375
AND NOW, ON TOP OF THAT,
THERE'S THIS...

263
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,791
THERE'S THIS WEIRD TIGHTNESS
IN MY CHEST, I GUESS.

264
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,000
SO, KNOWING ALL THAT,

265
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,875
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD
DO IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES?

266
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,375
- AND THIS PERSON IS
GONNA BE GONE FOREVER.

267
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,458
ARE THEY MOVING AWAY?

268
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,250
- YEAH, SORT OF.

269
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,958
- AND YOU'LL NEVER
SEE THEM AGAIN?

270
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,250
- PROBABLY NOT. NO.

271
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,875
- AND THE WHOLE
SITUATION DEPENDS

272
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,291
ON WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO.

273
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,458
- IN THIS
HYPOTHETICAL STORY, YES.

274
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,791
- WELL, YOU ALREADY HAVE
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

275
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,791
- ( gasps )

276
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,916
- IF YOU SERIOUSLY
WANTED THEM GONE,

277
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,125
I WOULDN'T THINK YOU'D
BE SO UPSET ABOUT IT.

278
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:05,083
- I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT.
DO I SEEM UPSET?

279
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,875
- A LITTLE, YEAH.

280
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,083
- WELL, COLOR ME BAD.

281
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,125
I DIDN'T REALIZE SOCIOPATHS
COULD BE UPSET.

282
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,833
- ( grunting angrily )

283
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,458
NO WAY. THERE'S NO FRICKIN'
WAY. I DON'T KNOW HOW,

284
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,541
BUT SHE'S ANNOYING ME WHEN SHE'S
NOT EVEN HERE. YOU'RE RIGHT.

285
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,000
I AM UPSET. BUT WHY THE HELL
AM I GETTING SO WORKED UP

286
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,583
OVER SOMEONE I CAN'T STAND?

287
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,000
- ( laughing )

288
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,291
AND SUDDENLY
SHE'S BACK TO NORMAL.

289
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,583
YOU'VE SEEMED KIND OF DOWN
LATELY. WELL, AT LEAST TO ME.

290
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,708
MAYBE NOT DOWN, EXACTLY,
BUT DEFINITELY MORE CALM.

291
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,791
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

292
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,291
AND NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

293
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,541
YOU TOTALLY SAW ME NAKED
THE OTHER DAY, DIDN'T YOU?

294
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,875
- WHY ARE YOU SO LOUD?

295
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,625
- DUDE...
STOP YELLING FOR REAL.

296
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,333
- STILL. YOU DID
ANSWER MY QUESTION,

297
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,541
SO I GUESS WE CAN JUST
CALL IT EVEN.

298
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,958
YOU DID AN
AWESOME JOB, TSUWABUKI.

299
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,208
- SHE'S SO WEIRD.

300
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,750
- BYE, THEN. I'M OFF NOW.

301
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,083
- YEAH. GREAT.

302
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,916
OKAY. THAT WAS COOL.

303
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,083
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW? HE'S RIGHT.

304
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,625
CAN YOU BELIEVE ME?
I'M JUST NOW REALIZING IT.

305
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,416
- ( screaming )

306
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,166
- GRACIOUS. WHAT IN
HEAVEN'S NAME WAS THAT?

307
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,875
- ( whimpers )

308
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,916
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET DOWN?

309
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,958
ICHIKO.

310
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:51,250
- I'M SORRY. BUT ICHIKO.
SHE'S CHANGING DRAMATICALLY.

311
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,791
SHE'S SO MUCH NICER TO
THE PEOPLE AROUND HER

312
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,916
THAN SHE WAS WHEN WE FIRST MET.

313
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,208
AND I REALIZE IF I TAKE HER
HAPPINESS ENERGY AWAY BY FORCE,

314
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,708
IT WILL RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.

315
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,958
BUT IN THE PROCESS, IT WILL
BRING UNHAPPINESS TO ICHIKO.

316
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,500
WHAT IF SHE WINDS UP
CHOOSING A PATH

317
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,583
THAT BRINGS HAPPINESS TO
OTHERS ON HER OWN?

318
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,666
WOULDN'T THAT BE BETTER?
WOULDN'T EVERYONE BE HAPPIER?

319
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,375
I THOUGHT I CAN STAY BY HER SIDE

320
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,083
AND HELP HER USE HER HAPPINESS
ENERGY FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

321
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,208
DEEP DOWN I KNOW
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

322
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,333
- COME ON... THERE ARE MORE
THAN ENOUGH POVERTY GODS.

323
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,041
BUT GUIDING THAT GIRL...

324
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,375
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
JUST ANYONE CAN DO.

325
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,625
OH, KUMAGAI.

326
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,500
NO.

327
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,541
( sniffles )

328
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,625
I GUESS THIS IS THE END.

329
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:46,875
FORGIVE ME, KUMAGAI
AND ICHIKO. I'M SORRY.

330
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,791
- ( yelling )

331
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,375
OH, HELL NO.

332
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,125
- YOU SAVED ME.

333
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,833
- WHAT WAS IT YOU SAID?

334
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,416
PEOPLE WHO ONLY
THINK ABOUT OTHERS

335
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,958
WILL EVENTUALLY RUIN THEMSELVES?

336
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,708
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'RE
DOING NOW?

337
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,583
UNLESS YOU THINK THAT
ELIMINATING YOURSELF,

338
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,875
AS A POVERTY GOD IS ACTUALLY
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO BE HAPPY.

339
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,083
- BUT...
- YEAH, BUT WHAT?

340
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,666
- IT'S JUST...

341
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,166
IT'S JUST THAT'S HONESTLY WHAT I
THOUGHT WOULD BE BEST FOR YOU.

342
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,875
- SURE ENOUGH,
ORIGINAL OR MIRROR,

343
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,625
YOU DO WHATEVER THE
HELL YOU WANT.

344
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,791
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME IS SOMETHING
I CAN DECIDE FOR MYSELF.

345
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,666
BESIDES, I FINALLY
REALIZED SOMETHING.

346
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,125
THE THING IS, WHEN YOU'RE
ALL MOPEY FACE,

347
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,625
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT
I CAN'T FUNCTION.

348
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,875
GOODBYE, MOMIJI.

349
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,166
- ( all screaming )

350
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,708
- ICHIKO, YOU FINALLY DID IT.

351
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,208
YOU FINALLY CALLED ME
BY MY NAME.

352
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,791
- AWESOME. A BOAT.
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

353
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,083
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

354
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,500
IF YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
THAT BRIDGE IS REALLY HIGH.

355
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,625
- YEAH, I DO KNOW FOR SURE.
CHECK OUT WHAT THE BOAT IS.

356
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,791
- WHAT?
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

357
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,125
THE ONLY THING SHE'S DONE

358
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,041
SINCE SHE GOT HERE IS TURN MY
LIFE UPSIDE DOWN.

359
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,041
IF SHE WEREN'T HERE,
THE GAME WOULD BE OFF

360
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,458
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD
MAKE ME VERY HAPPY.

361
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,875
I'M GONNA KICK HER OUT OF THE
HUMAN REALM ALL ON MY OWN.

362
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,208
I'M NOT ABOUT TO
LET HER HELP ME DO IT.

363
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,291
- LONG TIME NO SEE.
HOW YA FEELIN', PUN'KIN?

364
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,125
- I FEEL LIKE HAMMERED FECES.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

365
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,583
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

366
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,958
YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T CURSE
YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

367
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,000
- LIKEWISE, I'M SURE.

368
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY
WORRIED ABOUT YOU

369
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,333
FOR THE FULL MINUTE THAT I DID.

370
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:14,041
BUT NOW I CAN GO BACK TO
LOATHING YOUR ENTIRE EXISTENCE.

371
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,541
- HA. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?

372
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,666
YOU'RE SO WEAK.

373
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,875
YOU PASSED UP TWO PERFECT
CHANCES TO DRIVE ME AWAY.

374
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,375
FIRST, WHEN YOU
HELPED TSUWABUKI,

375
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,000
AND NOW WITH THIS
LITTLE DISPLAY.

376
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,250
OMG, DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT
YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME?

377
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,625
PLEASE, LIKE YOUR SOUL
IS CAPABLE OF THAT.

378
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,791
I'M GONNA PEE MYSELF.

379
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,583
- I'LL KILL YOU.
I'M GONNA WASH YOU AGAIN

380
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,791
IF YOU DON'T WATCH YOUR DIRTY
MOUTH. YA FEEL ME?

381
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,041
- OOH. THAT'S PRETTY
SCARY COMING FROM A GIRL

382
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,625
I'M ON A FIRST NAME BASIS WITH.

383
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,916
I WAS TALKING TO THE MIRROR YOU,
NOT THE AWFUL YOU. HER, I LIKED.

384
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,291
- ACTUALLY, THIS WHOLE SHE BANG
WAS A CLEVER PLAN TO GET YOU TO

385
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,250
REMOVE THE WALL AROUND
YOUR HEART, AND I WON.

386
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,500
- YOU WIN NOTHING.

387
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,833
- WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

388
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,541
I GUESS ICHIKO COULDN'T
KEEP HER SAFE AFTER ALL.

389
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,000
ALTHOUGH...

390
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,500
( laughs )

391
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,708
IF THAT'S SUCH A BAD THING,

392
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,625
WHY DOES SHE LOOK SO
HAPPY? WELL, FOR HER.

393
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,916
- I MEAN, WHO CAN TRUST
A CHICK WITH SUCH A FLAT CHEST,

394
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,958
AM I RIGHT?

395
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,291
- YOU SHUT UP.
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

396
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,750
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED THEM
PITTY TITTIES, SORRY.

397
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,875
I KILL YOU. TAKE THAT,
MISS POTATO SACKS.

398
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,250
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
NOTHING YOU SAY IS LOGICAL.

399
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,500
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

400
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:19,916
- JEALOUS OF WHAT?
EVENTUAL KNEE BOOBS?

401
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,916
BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS DROOPY
TITTERS IS A SEXY LOOK.

402
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,291
- ( both groaning )

403
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:30,416
- DAMN, YOU. STUPID POVERTY GOD.

404
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,250
- ( theme song playing )

405
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

406
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,125
- ♪ ONE WAY, TWO WAY,
THREE WAY, FOUR WAY ♪

407
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,750
♪ GO WAY, GO WAY ♪

412
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,291
- HUH. IT FEELS LIKE I'M
FORGETTING SOMETHING.

413
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,833
- ARRESTED YESTERDAY FOR
VIOLATION OF TRAFFIC LAWS,

414
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,041
LICENSE FORGERY,
AND DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY,

415
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,375
WAS A MAN IDENTIFYING
HIMSELF AS BOBBY.

416
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,125
- I HEARD THE VOICE
OF A BREAST GOD...

417
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,000
SHE OFFERED ME THE CHANCE
TO FONDLE, SO I HAD NO CHOICE!

418
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,958
- HE'S CURRENTLY IN
CUSTODY BEING HELD

419
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,958
FOR PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION.

420
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,333
- Nadeshiko: ENEMY AFTER ENEMY

421
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,083
THERE TO TAKE THEM ON IS ME.

00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,291
NADESHIKO ADENOKOJI.
