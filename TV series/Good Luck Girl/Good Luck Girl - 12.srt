1
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,208
- HEY, GOOD MORNING.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,333
( giggling )

3
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,333
- AND YOU ARE?

4
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,541
- WHO AM I?
IT'S MOMIJI, SILLY GIRL.

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,250
( giggling )

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,958
YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD
POVERTY GOD.

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,250
- ( Ichiko screaming )

8
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,166
- Girl 1: HEY,
DID YOU SEE THAT GIRL?

9
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,000
- Girl 2: YEAH,
IT'S MOMIJI, RIGHT?

10
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,083
- Boy 1: IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

11
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,833
ANYTHING'S REALLY
CHANGED ABOUT HER.

12
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,291
- Boy 2: STILL, IT'S LIKE
SHE'S A DIFFERENT PERSON.

13
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,458
- HEADS UP.

14
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,583
( grunts )

15
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,583
( laughing )

16
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,625
- THERE'S NO WAY. I DON'T
BUY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

17
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,208
- WHAT DO I DO?

18
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,041
- UNLESS IT'S BECAUSE
I FORCED HER TO TAKE A BATH

19
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,250
IN THE LAST EPISODE.

20
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,375
YEAH, I BET SHE'S
TRYING TO CONVINCE ME

21
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,708
SHE'S CLEANED UP HER ACT.

22
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,625
( gasps ) KUMAGAI?

23
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,416
- Aw...
- HE'S SO CUTE. I WANT ONE!

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,583
- HE'S MOVING.
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE.

25
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,333
- THAT LITTLE STUFFED
PUNK IS FAKING

26
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,333
THAT HE'S NOT AN ASS, TOO.

27
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,291
- I THOUGHT OF THE FISHERMEN...

28
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,125
THE BLACKBERRY PATCHES AND
THE BLUEBERRY HILLS.

29
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,833
- Kuramochi: MAN,
SHE IS SO COOL.

30
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,833
- Girl: SHE'S GOT
SUCH A PRETTY VOICE.

31
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,291
- ( Ichiko growling )

32
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,125
- DON'T LISTEN TO IT.

33
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,291
- CROWS ARE ALL LIARS.
- LOOK AT HER.

34
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,708
I NEVER REALIZED HOW
CUTE SHE WAS.

35
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,833
- I THINK I'M GOING TO START
TREATING HER DIFFERENTLY,

36
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,750
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

37
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:33,958
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

38
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,000
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FORGET
ABOUT ICHIKO?

39
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,458
- YOU'RE A CHEATING
TRAITOR, DUDE!

40
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,708
- I DIDN'T SAY
I WAS GONNA SWITCH,

41
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,916
I JUST SAID I'LL BE NICER!

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,375
- WOULD YOU GUYS
TRY TO KEEP IT DOWN, PLEASE?

43
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,000
- WE'RE SORT OF IN
THE MIDDLE OF CLASS.

44
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,833
- NO ONE ASKED YOU,
SO SHUT THE HELL UP.

45
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,750
- HEY, CALM DOWN, PLEASE...

46
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,791
- DO YOU GIVE ANYONE WHO'S
NOT IN A BOY BAND A CHANCE?

47
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,000
- YEAH, WELL, WE WOULD
IF YOU GUYS EVER TALKED

48
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,416
ABOUT ANYONE BUT ICHIKO.

49
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,041
- BESIDES, RANMARU IS MORE MANLY

50
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,458
THAN ALL YOU LOSERS
PUT TOGETHER.

51
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,500
- WAIT, I'M WHAT?

52
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,958
- ENOUGH ALREADY.
KNOCK IT OFF.

53
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,416
- EVERYBODY STOP FIGHTING NOW!

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,625
COME ON, YOU GUYS.
BE RESPECTFUL OF THE TEACHER.

55
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,541
WE'RE IN HIGH-SCHOOL,
NOT KINDERGARTEN.

56
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,000
WE KINDA NEED TO START ACTING
LIKE ADULTS AT SOME POINT.

57
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,750
- OH, SORRY, MOMIJI.

58
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,833
- YEAH, WE DIDN'T MEAN
TO MAKE YOU ANGRY WITH US.

59
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,708
- WHO IS SHE TO TELL THEM
TO GROW UP?

60
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,958
- WE APOLOGIZE. PLEASE,
CONTINUE THE LESSON.

61
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,791
- I'VE WAITED ALL SEASON

62
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,500
AND NOBODY HAS EVER CARED
ABOUT HOW I FEEL UNTIL NOW.

63
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,500
( crying ) LOOK AWAY!

64
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,541
- DUDE, OUR TEACHER
TOTALLY JUST BAILED.

65
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,583
- GEE, I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHY HE WOULD DO THAT.

66
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,375
- IT'S BECAUSE
WE'RE TOO ROWDY.

67
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,416
- OR MAYBE IT'S JUST YOU.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,416
- FINE. I WOULD LIKE
TO TAKE THIS MOMENT

69
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,916
TO HAVE A WORD WITH
ALL OF YOU BOYS.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,416
- Boys: WHAT? US?

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,125
- I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL
THAT YOU'RE SO NICE TO ICHIKO

72
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,958
BUT YOU CAN'T ONLY EVER
BE NICE TO HER.

73
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,625
AS MEN, YOU SHOULD BE KIND
NOT JUST TO THOSE YOU LIKE.

74
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,458
INSTEAD, YOU HAVE TO
HAVE THE CAPACITY

75
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,833
TO SHARE YOUR KINDNESS
WITH EVERYBODY.

76
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,708
- Boys: WHOA! SHE'S SMART!

77
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,208
- SHE MAKES PEOPLE
UNHAPPY FOR A LIVING.

78
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,708
- IF YOU KEEP ACTING
THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN...

79
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,666
THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE
WILL THINK YOU'RE DATABLE.

80
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,291
- HECK, YEAH.
YOU TELL 'EM, MOMIJI.

81
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,916
- HOLD ON, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU GIRLS HAVE ROOM TO JUDGE.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,333
- Girls: HUH?

83
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,541
- EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU
TREATS RANMARU LIKE A BOY.

84
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,708
IN WHAT WORLD DO YOU THINK
A GIRL WANTS TO BE CALLED

85
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,708
BUTCH ALL THE TIME?

86
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,458
- Oh.
- WE, UH...

87
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,291
- MEH, I DON'T REALLY
MIND ALL THAT MUCH.

88
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,041
- BEHOLD, THE REAL RANMARU.

89
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,750
SEE, THIS IS THE KIND OF GIRL
SHE REALLY IS.

90
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,250
- HEY, WHAT IN GIRLY HELL
DID YOU DO TO ME?

91
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,625
- ( all gasping )

92
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,666
- THE POVERTY GOD ITEM,
"CHANGING RING," IS A DEVICE

93
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,708
THAT FACILITATES
COSPLAY IN AN INSTANT!

94
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,250
- HOWEVER, IT'S
LIMITED TO CLOTHING

95
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,500
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN WORN!

96
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,500
- OH, YOU LOOK SO CUTE.
- NO WAY! RANMARU?

97
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,125
- OH, UH, IT'S NO BIGGIE.
THANKS, THOUGH.

98
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,833
- SEE, TSUWABUKI?
SHE LOOKS CUTE, RIGHT?

99
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,291
- HUH?

100
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,708
YEAH. YEAH, SURE. WHY NOT?

101
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,916
I THINK YOU LOOK REALLY CUTE.

102
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,458
- ( exclaiming )

103
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,250
THIS IS TOO MUCH. IT'S TOO
MUCH. IT'S WAY TOO MUCH.

104
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,125
- NO, COME BACK, RANMARU.

105
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,208
- WHAT IS LIFE?

106
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,500
WHAT IS HAPPINESS?

107
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:15,125
- OH, NO. I THINK I MIGHT
HAVE GONE TOO FAR WITH HER.

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,208
- GEEZ, YOU THINK SO?

109
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,291
STUPID POVERTY GOD.

110
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,583
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH HER NOW?
ANY IDEAS?

111
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,250
- ( mewing )
- ( giggling )

112
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,791
DID YOU HEAR?
HE SAID I WAS CUTE.

113
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,333
- GIRL, YOU HAVE GOT
TO SNAP OUT OF IT.

114
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,125
- I COULD DIE NOW. I COULD
DIE AND TOTALLY BE HAPPY.

115
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,208
- KNOWING THE POVERTY GOD,

116
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,083
THERE'S NO DOUBT SHE'S
UP TO SOMETHING.

117
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,125
MAYBE SHE'S TRYING TO GET THE
WHOLE CLASS TO LIKE HER

118
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,166
MORE THAN ME? BUT WHY?

119
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,541
- I'M HOME.

120
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,125
OH. RANMARU, I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU'D BE HERE.

121
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,791
OKAY, CHECK THIS OUT.

122
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,833
THEY WERE HAVING AN EVENT, SO
I GOT THE MEAT FOR HALF OFF.

123
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,125
AND NOW THAT RANMARU IS HERE,

124
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,791
I'LL MAKE SOMETHING EXTRA
SPECIAL FOR US.

125
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,166
- YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE.

126
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,958
HOW DARE YOU THINK YOU CAN
JUST WALTZ INTO MY HOUSE

127
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,000
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

128
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,333
AND ARE YOU WEARING
MY UNIFORM, TOO?

129
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,583
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS
GOOD GIRL ACT IS ALL ABOUT,

130
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:01,791
BUT I WISH YOU'D KNOCK IT OFF

131
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,500
BECAUSE IT'S STARTING
TO ANNOY ME.

132
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,625
- GOOD GIRL ACT?

133
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,875
- YOU HEARD ME.
- ( gasps )

134
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,833
- I'M SO SORRY. I COMPLETELY
FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

135
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,000
- HUH?

136
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,541
- CRAZY THINGS CAN
HAPPEN TO POVERTY GODS

137
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,000
AND THEIR FAMILIARS,
LIKE KUMAGAI.

138
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,916
FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE'RE WASHED
WHILE IN THE HUMAN REALM,

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,875
WE RANDOMLY LOSE ALL OF OUR
POVERTY GOD POWERS,

140
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,000
WHICH IS WEIRD, YEAH?

141
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,500
- YEAH.

142
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,083
- AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS
OUR PERSONALITIES CHANGE, TOO.

143
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,333
- THEY WHAT?
- THIS IS THE RESULT.

144
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,125
SO LET'S TRY TO GET ALONG
FROM NOW ON, OKAY?

145
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,083
- AW, SHE'S SWEET.
- ( growling )

146
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,083
- ( humming )

147
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,041
- HER PERSONALITY CHANGES IF SHE
LOSES HER POVERTY GOD POWERS?

148
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,541
FOR REAL?

149
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,333
BECAUSE THIS SOUNDS A LOT
LIKE ANOTHER ONE OF HER SCHEMES.

150
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,375
OF COURSE, THAT'S IT! I TOTALLY
KNOW WHAT SHE'S UP TO THIS TIME!

151
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,666
SHE HAS TO BE
TRYING TO CONVINCE ME

152
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,000
THAT SHE'S SOME
SUPER NICE GIRL NOW,

153
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,916
SO THAT I'LL DROP MY
GUARD AROUND HER.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,708
THEN, SHE'LL WAIT
UNTIL THE RIGHT TIME

155
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,833
TO CATCH ME BY SURPRISE AND
TAKE MY HAPPINESS ENERGY AWAY.

156
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,208
- Momiji: ICHIKO.

157
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,208
- DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA TAKE
YOUR HAPPINESS ENERGY AWAY?

158
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,583
BE HONEST, PLEASE... IS THAT
THE KIND OF PERSON I LOOK LIKE?

159
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,083
- YES IT IS.
FOR SURE.

160
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,916
YOU'RE PLANNING TO
SHOW YOUR TRUE COLORS

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,291
RIGHT WHEN I LEAST EXPECT
IT, AREN'T YOU?

162
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,125
THE WHOLE THING IS
JUST FOR SHOW...

163
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,666
I KNOW THAT LOOK YOU GET
WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE WON.

164
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,125
SUWANO...

165
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:25,958
- ICHIKO!

166
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,875
- I KNEW IT.

167
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,958
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU,
POVERTY GOD...

168
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,583
HE WHO ATTACKS FIRST
ALWAYS WINS.

169
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,833
- Ranmaru: HEY, ICHIKO!
- Ichiko: I KNEW IT!

170
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,125
NO WAY SHE'S NOT
TRYING TO TRICK ME.

171
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,750
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
I CAN DO.

172
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,125
- HUH?

173
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,333
- AND AS MUCH AS I'D
RATHER SHOOT MYSELF IN THE FACE,

174
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,041
I'M CALLING IN THE BOYS.

175
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,541
- OH, HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU GUYS WERE COMING, TOO.

176
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:00,333
BUT THAT'S OKAY, I MADE TOO MUCH
SO THERE'S ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE.

177
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,291
WHO'S HUNGRY?

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,291
- THAT IS NOT HER. THAT
PERSON IS NOT MY MOMIJI.

179
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,833
IT'S NOT, IT'S NOT HER.

180
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,000
- WAIT A MINUTE, YOU DIDN'T
KNOW SHE WAS ACTING LIKE THIS?

181
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,166
- IF YOU ASK ME,
SHE LOOKS CUTER THIS WAY.

182
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,500
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO
ABOUT HER BEING SO NICE?

183
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,958
- I DON'T KNOW.

184
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,000
RIGHT NOW SHE'S SAYING SHE
LOST HER POVERTY GOD POWERS

185
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,041
ON TOP OF HER LITTLE
BIPOLAR SWITCHEROO.

186
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,500
BUT I THINK THIS
IS JUST AN ACT

187
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,791
SO SHE CAN STEAL MY
HAPPINESS ENERGY AGAIN.

188
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,083
AND THAT IS WHY I WANT YOU
TO USE YOUR PERVERSION POWER,

189
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,416
GRAB THAT MASK SHE'S PUT ON
AND SHRED IT FROM HER FACE.

190
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,916
- Both: OH!

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,791
- I CAN GET BEHIND THAT.

192
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,958
- AND I WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO GET MY MOMIJI TO TURN BACK

193
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,583
INTO HER NORMAL SELF.

194
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,583
- ALL RIGHT, ALLOW ME TO
START BY GIVING HER

195
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,750
WHAT WE IN PROFESSIONAL CIRCLES
LIKE TO CALL, THE SHOCK THERAPY.

196
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,750
- WHAT'S THE SHOCK THERAPY?

197
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,083
- ( gasps )
- Bobby: TITTIES.

198
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,916
- WHY, YOU FILTHY MONK,
YOU'RE NOT ONLY TRYING

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,916
TO SINK YOUR DISGUSTING
FANGS INTO ICHIKO,

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,125
NOW YOU'RE GONNA GO
AFTER MOMIJI, TOO.

201
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,666
- I'LL ALLOW IT.
GO FOR IT, MY PERVERTED WARRIOR.

202
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,208
- GUESS WHO.

203
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:03,333
- OH, WELL, LET ME THINK
ABOUT IT. IT'S BOBBY, RIGHT?

204
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,916
( giggling ) YOU'RE SILLY.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,916
- OH, YEAH, I GUESS
I GAVE MYSELF AWAY.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,958
- TELL ME WHAT THE HELL
WAS SO SHOCKING ABOUT THAT?

207
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,833
- I'M SORRY, BABY. THERE WAS
NOWHERE FOR MY HANDS TO LAND!

208
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,541
- AND BESIDES,
HER AURA IS WAY TOO PURE.

209
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,875
I COULD NEVER INTENTIONALLY
GROPE A LADY LIKE THAT.

210
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,791
- WAIT, DON'T TELL ME
HE FEELS GUILTY.

211
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,666
- HEY! WHAT ABOUT ME, YOU JERK?

212
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,250
YOU TRY TO GROPE
ME ALL THE TIME.

213
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,291
- IF I'M NOT PURE, WHAT AM I?
- A BITCH.

214
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,083
- GUYS, ENOUGH WHINING,
IT'S TIME TO ACT. I'LL GO NEXT.

215
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,541
THE GOAL IS TO GET MOMIJI TO
TURN BACK INTO HER NORMAL SELF,

216
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,958
RIGHT?

217
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,458
- CORRECT. PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE A WAY TO DO THAT.

218
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,291
- TRUST HER. IF YOU
KEEP BELIEVING IN HER

219
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,750
AND PRAYING DEEP
DOWN IN YOUR HEART

220
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,166
THAT MOMIJI WILL RETURN
TO HER NORMAL SELF, SOMEDAY,

221
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,375
I KNOW IT WILL COME TRUE.

222
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,000
- WHY I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE

223
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,458
A LOGICAL ANSWER IS BEYOND ME.

224
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,750
- JOIN THE CIRCLE.
- ( groans )

225
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,375
- ALL RIGHT, AS MOMIJI'S
NUMBER ONE SERVANT,

226
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,250
I'M UP FOR WHATEVER
MIGHT FIX HER.

227
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,458
- MOMO'O.
- HUH?

228
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,000
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KEEP
DOING THIS TO YOURSELF.

229
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,375
YOU POOR BABY,
YOU'RE ALL BRUISED.

230
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,083
WHEN YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH YOU HAVE
TO SAY THAT YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

231
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,458
- UH, I DO WHAT?

232
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,166
- ( blowing air )

233
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,458
OWIE, OWIE GO AWAY. DON'T COME
BACK SOME OTHER DAY.

234
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,416
- YOUR WARMTH IS TERRIFYING.

235
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,083
- ( scoffs )

236
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,708
- THE MASOCHIST IS UNABLE TO
TOLERATE WARMTH AND KINDNESS.

237
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,333
- WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO
AND BREAK A WINDOW?

238
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,208
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF FOOD,
SO EAT UP!

239
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,166
- AWESOME! IT LOOKS SO GOOD!
- THAT IS TIGHT.

240
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,833
- Momiji: WHAT DO WE SAY
BEFORE A MEAL?

241
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,375
- THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD.
- THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD.

242
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,958
- Ranmaru: AREN'T YOU
TWO GONNA EAT?

243
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,250
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA EAT. THANK
YOU, THOUGH, YOU BIG TRAITOR.

244
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,541
- OH, COME ON, SHE WENT THROUGH
ALL THE TROUBLE TO MAKE IT.

245
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,625
CAN'T WE TURN HER BACK
AFTER WE PIG OUT?

246
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,833
- PLUS, WOULDN'T IT MAKE
MORE SENSE NOT TO CHANGE HER

247
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,833
SO GOOD MOMIJI CAN STICK AROUND?

248
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,583
- I DON'T KNOW.

249
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,750
- NOT YOU TOO, TAMA!

250
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,666
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO JOIN US,

251
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,458
I'LL BRING THIS OVER HERE
SINCE I MADE IT JUST FOR YOU.

252
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,583
- NO, I'M FINE. WILL YOU
ANSWER A QUESTION, THOUGH?

253
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,708
IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR SPECIAL
POVERTY GOD POWERS,

254
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,333
AND YOU'RE NOT A POVERTY
GOD ANYMORE,

255
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,958
THEN YOU REALLY HAVE NO REASON
TO HANG AROUND ME, DO YOU?

256
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,458
- NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
I MAY NOT HAVE POWERS,

257
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,166
BUT I STILL HAVE MY
POVERTY GOD MISSION.

258
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,333
- WHAT'S THE MISSION NOW?

259
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,250
I DON'T ABSORB OTHER
PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS.

260
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,375
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? I'VE GOT
THIS FANCY KEYSTONE FOR THAT.

261
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,625
- YOU DID PUT IT ON YOURSELF,
WHICH IS GREAT,

262
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,041
BUT I AM STILL SUPPOSED
TO TAKE BACK

263
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,083
YOUR EXTRA HAPPINESS ENERGY.

264
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,833
THE TIME HAS COME TO PAY ALL
THAT GOOD FORTUNE FORWARD

265
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,125
AND HELP OTHER PEOPLE,
THAT IS YOUR GIFT.

266
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,833
- CAN I GET A RECEIPT,
I'D LIKE TO RETURN IT?

267
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,208
- JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE HOW
WONDERFUL YOU FEEL.

268
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,458
- NO WAY.

269
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,750
- I PROMISE YOUR HEART
WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.

270
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,708
I THINK WE CAN DO
THIS THING TOGETHER.

271
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,916
- WHY WOULD I WANNA DO
ANYTHING WITH YOU?

272
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,583
- OKAY, SO MAYBE WE'LL
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK FOR NOW.

273
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,583
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THIS
AND SEE IF YOU LIKE IT?

274
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,500
DO YOU EVER LISTEN?
I SAID I DON'T WANT ANY!

275
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,750
- All: HMM?

276
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,458
- UH.

277
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,791
- ( sobbing )

278
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,833
- MOMIJI, WAIT.

279
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:00,166
- Bobby: DAMN, GIRL,
TALK ABOUT COLD-BLOODED.

280
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,791
- Momo'o: THAT WAS UNCALLED FOR.

281
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,625
- WHAT, SO NOW
SHE'S ALL SENSITIVE?

282
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:07,458
- ICHIKO. GO AFTER HER!
GET YOUR BUTT MOVING!

283
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,416
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

284
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,958
WHY IS RANMARU
SO MAD AT ME ALL OF A SUDDEN?

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,291
WHY?

286
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,916
AND WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE
TO CHASE DOWN THE POVERTY GOD?

287
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,583
HEY, POVERTY GOD.

288
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,416
- ICHIKO.

289
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,416
- UH... DO... UM...

290
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,541
YOU WANNA GO HOME?

291
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,166
- ARE YOU SURE?

292
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,750
- DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA.

293
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,208
I MEAN I'M ONLY HERE
BECAUSE RANMARU YELLED AT ME.

294
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,000
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M DYING TO BE
BESTIES WITH YOU OR ANYTHING.

295
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,375
- YES, I UNDERSTAND.

296
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,125
- TELL ME THE TRUTH. WHAT
EXACTLY IS THE DEAL WITH YOU?

297
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,708
YOU SHOW UP OUT OF NOWHERE,
TOTALLY SCREW UP MY LIFE

298
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,625
WHEN AND WHEREVER YOU CAN,

299
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,208
AND NOW, FOR SOME UNKNOWN
REASON, YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS.

300
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,291
HOW MUCH ARE YOU PLANNING
TO JERK ME AROUND?

301
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,041
- I'M SO SORRY.
- NO, DON'T APOLOGIZE.

302
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,916
THAT JUST PISSES ME OFF
EVEN MORE.

303
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,791
- I JUST... I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

304
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,416
MY OTHER SELF, NOT ME RIGHT NOW,

305
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,750
BUT THE MOMIJI YOU'RE
USED TO SEEING,

306
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,333
WELL, BOTH OF US, I GUESS,

307
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,166
WE DON'T WANT ANY UNHAPPINESS
TO COME TO YOU. IT'S THE TRUTH.

308
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,375
- NO, IT'S NOT. YOU'RE
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT

309
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,125
TAKING AWAY MY
HAPPINESS ENERGY.

310
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,250
DOING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WILL
MAKE UNHAPPINESS COME TO ME.

311
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,833
- FORCIBLY STEALING THE ENERGY

312
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,791
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO
REDUCE YOUR LEVEL.

313
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,875
- I ASSUME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE PATTERN WE SET UP

314
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,083
WHERE I GIVE IT AWAY.

315
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,583
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
WON'T GIVE UP ON THAT.

316
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,750
I NEVER SAID I WAS
PLANNING ON BECOMING A SAINT.

317
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,333
SO, ONE MORE TIME, SUWANO
AND RANMARU NOW I GUESS,

318
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,750
ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE
I CARE ABOUT.

319
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,958
EVERYONE ELSE CAN SUCK IT.

320
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,541
- WHEN WE FIRST MET,
IT WAS JUST MR SUWANO.

321
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,166
SEE? THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

322
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,208
YOU SHARE GOOD FORTUNE, BUT YOU
DON'T LOSE ANYTHING.

323
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,833
OF COURSE, I'M NOT SAYING
YOU HAVE TO SUDDENLY

324
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,208
MAKE A HUNDRED FRIENDS.

325
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,166
LITTLE BY LITTLE IS FINE.
LITTLE BY LITTLE.

326
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,166
THE MORE PEOPLE YOU ALLOW
YOURSELF TO CARE ABOUT,

327
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,375
THE MORE HAPPINESS WILL
BE WAITING OUT THERE

328
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,375
FOR YOU TO FIND.

329
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,458
- WAIT, CALM DOWN.

330
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,375
- REMEMBER. YOU ONLY GET
BACK AS MUCH HAPPINESS

331
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,458
AS YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO GIVE.

332
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:43,208
- YEAH, FINE. I GET THE POINT.
YOU CAN LAY OFF NOW.

333
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,458
IT'S POURING, SO IT
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER ANYWAY.

334
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,041
LOOK, CAN WE JUST GO?

335
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,791
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN RANMARU
GETS ALL MAD AT ME.

336
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,500
- HEY, WELCOME BACK.
- GOOD, WE MADE IT.

337
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,750
- I HAD A FEELING
YOU GUYS WOULD BE SOAKED.

338
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,375
I GOT A BATH READY FOR YOU.

339
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,666
SORRY I DIDN'T ASK
YOU IF I COULD

340
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,500
MESS WITH YOUR
STUFF BEFORE I DID.

341
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,416
- OH, NO. IT'S FINE.
THANKS FOR THINKING AHEAD.

342
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,291
WAIT. UH, BATH TIME IS ME TIME.

343
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,208
- WHAT? SO MOMIJI'S JUST
SUPPOSED TO CATCH A COLD

344
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,750
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO SELFISH
TO SHARE YOUR BATH WITH HER?

345
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,416
- WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE
AT THE SAME TIME?

346
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,916
- COME ON, WE CAN WASH
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

347
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,125
- NO WAY!

348
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,125
IF YOU DECIDE TO ATTACK ME NOW,
I WILL KILL YOU.

349
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,125
- NO, I WON'T. I PROMISE.

350
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,916
SO LISTEN, ICHIKO, TO PICK BACK
UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF EARLIER...

351
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,083
- OH, YOU MEAN LIKE
THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT?

352
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,916
I THOUGHT WE WERE
DONE WITH THAT.

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,041
- NO, NOT QUITE YET.

354
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,583
ONCE YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE
YOU CARE FOR,

355
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,166
AND EVERYONE'S
SURROUNDING YOU, RIGHT?

356
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,291
IF I'M STANDING THERE NEXT TO
YOU, BY CHANCE, DO YOU,

357
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,458
ONE DAY, ANY DAY
WOULD BE FINE...

358
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,250
SORRY, THIS IS
EMBARRASSING, BUT...

359
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,458
I JUST HOPE SOMETIME
YOU'LL CALL ME BY MY NAME, TOO.

360
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,333
- I, UH...

361
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,791
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN,
POVERTY GOD!

362
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,833
- ICHIKO'S YELLING AT ME AGAIN!

363
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,041
- KNOCK IT OFF!

364
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,916
- AFTER THAT THE POVERTY GOD
NEVER SHOWED ANY SIGNS

365
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,916
SHE'D TURN BACK TO
HER OTHER SELF.

366
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,208
LUCKY FOR ME, I STOPPED GETTING
ATTACKED ALL THE TIME, TOO.

367
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,458
MY DAILY LIFE SLOWLY WENT
BACK TO WHAT IT WAS

368
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,541
BEFORE SHE SHOWED UP.

369
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,166
I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING SEEMED
KIND OF OFF, THOUGH.

370
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,500
A NORMAL ROUTINE IS NICE,

371
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,541
BUT I GUESS THERE WAS JUST
SOMETHING MISSING.

372
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,958
IT LEFT ME WITH
A WEIRD FEELING.

373
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,416
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON,
I CAN'T SHAKE IT.

374
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,791
- I WONDER IF IT
BOTHERS ICHIKO, TOO.

375
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,833
I HOPE IT'S NOT GOING TO
BE LIKE THIS FOREVER.

376
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,000
I WANT THE REAL MOMIJI BACK.

377
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,333
- ( mewing )

378
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,791
- YOU'RE KICKING IT TOO HARD!
- SORRY, RYU!

379
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,458
- OH, NO. I SURE HOPE
IT DIDN'T HIT ANYTHING.

380
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,958
- ( mewing )

381
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,333
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

382
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,791
- MAN, THIS KITTEN
ISN'T TOO SMART

383
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,541
IF HE KEEPS TRYING TO JUMP
INTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.

384
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,458
- OH, I BET THE THING'S JUST
HUNGRY AND WANTS A SNACK.

385
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,458
- ( rattling )

386
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,000
- ( gasps )

387
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,291
( screaming )

388
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,291
NO! GARBAGE MONSTER!

389
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,875
- HUH?

390
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,416
- ( snarling )

391
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,166
- HUH?

392
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,916
( gasps ) KUMAGAI, YOU'RE BACK.

393
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,583
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.
HOW DID YOU SWING THE CHANGE?

394
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,041
THAT'S IT? YOU MEAN...

395
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,541
HECK YEAH, WE CAN!

396
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,541
- HEY, ICHIKO.

397
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,416
- ARE YOU READY TO GO HOME, NOW?

398
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,583
- DO YOU GUYS MIND
IF I COME OVER AND HANG OUT?

399
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,833
- NOT AT ALL. IN FACT, I THINK
I SHOULD MAKE A CAKE FOR US.

400
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,333
- THOSE THREE HAVE GOTTEN
PRETTY CLOSE, HUH?

401
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,750
- I WONDER HOW CLOSE IS CLOSE.

402
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:19,916
- ( yawning )

403
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,041
- Ranmaru: DAMN, ICHIKO.
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT.

404
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,333
- Momiji: OKAY, I FINISHED
WASHING THE DISHES.

405
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,875
NEXT UP ARE THE BATHTUB
AND THEN THE TOILET.

406
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,958
( humming )

407
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,125
- ( mewing )

408
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,541
- WHAT'S WRONG, TAMA?

409
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,291
- CRASHING THROUGH
THE WINDOW TIME. TA-DA.

410
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,916
- ( screams )

411
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,083
- PLEASE FORGIVE MY RUDENESS
BUT I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

412
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,000
- LET HER GO.
HEY! KNOCK IT OFF.

413
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,333
( grunting )

414
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,041
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

415
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,625
KUMAGAI? WAIT, HOW'D HE
GET BACK TO NORMAL?

416
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,625
MOMO'O, A LITTLE EXPLANATION
WOULD BE GREAT.

417
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,375
- I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T WANNA
BE SO ROUGH, FOR ONCE.

418
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,000
BUT I NEEDED TO
FIND MOMIJI FAST

419
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,416
SO I CAN TURN HER BACK INTO
A POVERTY GOD.

420
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,916
- WAIT, SERIOUSLY?
OKAY, BUT HOW?

421
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,291
( screaming )

422
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:32,583
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT HERE?
SHE JUST CLEANED UP, TOO!

423
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,083
- NO, MY SOMIN SHORAI!

424
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,083
- WAIT, MOMO'O.

425
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,791
PLEASE. I WON'T RUN AWAY,
JUST PUT ME DOWN.

426
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,958
I WANT... I'D REALLY LIKE
TO SAY GOODBYE TO ICHIKO.

427
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,625
- OKAY, SURE.

428
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,166
- SO THIS IS MORE THAN LIKELY
THE LAST TIME I'LL EVER BE ABLE

429
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,583
TO TAKE ON MY MIRROR FORM.

430
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,750
UNFORTUNATELY, I'M
AFRAID THE OTHER MOMIJI

431
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,250
DOESN'T THINK TOO HIGHLY OF ME.

432
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,958
I KNOW IT HASN'T LASTED LONG
BUT I HAVE ENJOYED IT.

433
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,291
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW

434
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,750
I REALLY DID WANT TO BE
FRIENDS WITH YOU.

435
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,833
GOODBYE, SWEET ICHIKO.

436
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,500
BE NICE TO THE OTHER
MOMIJI FOR ME.

437
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,083
- WAIT.

438
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,625
POVERTY GOD.

439
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,916
- EXCUSE ME BOSS.

440
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,416
THERE'S A REAL LIVE MONK
HERE WHO'S SAYING

441
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,166
HE COULD USE SOME
PART TIME WORK.

442
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,041
- HUH? LET'S SEE.

443
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,750
WELL, DOES HE HAVE A LICENSE?

444
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,291
IF HE CAN DRIVE A CAR, I GUESS

445
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,333
IT'LL MAKE DOING THE
DRINK DELIVERIES

446
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,500
A LITTLE EASIER ON YOU.

447
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,166
I CAN'T IMAGINE IT'S
TOO MUCH FUN FOR YOU

448
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,833
TO DO ON YOUR BIKE
ALL NIGHT LONG.

449
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,208
- DO YOU HAVE A LICENSE?

450
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,875
- SURE, I'VE GOT ONE.
BOBBY MCLOVIN, THAT'S ME.

451
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,625
- OKAY, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

452
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,666
- WHOA, HOLD ON.
LET'S ROLL OUT.

453
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,333
- Students: THIS WEEK'S...
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO!

454
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,333
- WHAT? THE NEXT EPISODE
IS THE LAST ONE?

455
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,250
OH, WOW. OKAY SHINOBU,

456
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,291
THERE'LL BE NO MORE DAWDLING
AROUND, YOU HEAR ME?

457
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,291
IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE ME
ANY EXTRA APPEARANCES,

458
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,333
THEN I'M JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO STEAL THEM.

459
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,875
NEXT WEEK I'LL SHOW THEM WHAT
THEY'VE BEEN MISSING OUT ON!
