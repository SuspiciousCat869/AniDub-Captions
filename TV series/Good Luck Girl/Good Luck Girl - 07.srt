1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,916
- ( humming )

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,125
- THESE CREPES ARE HARD TO GET.
THEY ONLY MAKE TEN A DAY.

3
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,791
AND THIS ONE IS ALL MINE.

4
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,250
- Girl: GET OUT OF MY WAY.

5
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,333
- THAT HURT.
- OW.

6
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,291
- HEY, COME ON, WE GOT TO GO.
- DON'T MOVE.

7
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,375
- ( gasps )

8
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,625
- CATCH YOU LATER, ALLIGATOR.
- HEY, COME BACK HERE.

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,916
- OH, NO, WHERE'S MY CREPE?

10
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,291
HAPPINESS ENERGY
IS STILL WORKING.

11
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,083
- YEAH, WHAT?
- DROP THE ATTITUDE, MISS.

12
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,791
- SHOPLIFTER.
- SHOPLIFTER?

13
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,458
- I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE YOU DOWNTOWN.

14
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,250
- HUH? YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

15
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,083
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN MY
HAPPY MOMENT RIGHT NOW,

16
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,791
AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING.

17
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,375
- CALM DOWN OR I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BOOK YOU FOR RESISTING ARREST.

18
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,416
- YOU STUPID JERK.
- Ranmaru: HOLD ON.

19
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,000
- BEFORE YOU GO AROUND
PREACHING ABOUT HAPPINESS,

20
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,791
IT MIGHT DO YOU SOME GOOD
TO TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

21
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,208
GIRLS SHOULD NEVER RAISE
THEIR FISTS IN ANGER.

22
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,083
ESPECIALLY IF HAPPINESS
IS WHAT THEY'RE AFTER.

23
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:29,708
WHERE ANGER THRIVES,
HAPPINESS IS ABSENT,

24
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,125
I GUESS NOBODY
EVER TOOK THE TIME

25
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,250
TO TEACH YOU THAT, LITTLE GIRL.

26
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,375
- WHAT?

27
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,291
- WHO'S THAT?
- SHE ISN'T YOUR FRIEND?

28
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,666
- NO, I DON'T KNOW
THAT GIRL, I SWEAR...

29
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:20,375
IT WAS ME, OFFICERS, I CONFESS.
IT'S TRUE, I SHOPLIFTED.

30
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,916
- BUT NOT BECAUSE I WANTED TO,

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,416
I TOLD HER NO BUT SHE
WOULDN'T LISTEN.

32
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,583
SHE SAID SHE'D HURT ME IF I
DIDN'T DO WHAT SHE ORDERED.

33
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,666
- HMM.
- DID YOU PUT HER UP TO THIS?

34
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,291
- THAT'S LOW.
- WAIT, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

35
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:36,125
- ARREST HER RIGHT NOW.
- ( screams )

36
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,583
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, MISS.

37
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,625
HEY, WHERE'D SHE GO?

38
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:45,666
- DAMN, I'LL MAKE HER PAY.
I'LL TEACH HER TO MESS WITH ME.

39
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,333
- DELISH.

40
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,625
- I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT GIRL I GOT INTO IT WITH.

41
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,333
I BET SHE WAS SUPER PISSED,

42
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,833
OH, WELL. IT'S NOT LIKE
I'LL EVER SEE HER AGAIN.

43
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,958
- ALL RIGHT. THERE'S A
NEW TRANSFER STUDENT

44
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,958
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO TODAY.

45
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,541
- EXCUSE ME, WHY IS IT WE ALWAYS
HAVE NEW TRANSFER STUDENTS?

46
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,125
- GOOD QUESTION,

47
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,750
IT'S BECAUSE THE MAIN CHARACTER
OF OUR ANIME IS IN THIS CLASS.

48
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,416
- THAT MAKES SENSE.
- ALL RIGHT, SON. COME ON IN.

49
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,375
- ( exclaims )

50
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,625
- MISTER RINDO, YOU PREFER TO BE
CALLED RANMARU, IS THAT RIGHT?

51
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:30,125
- UH, IT'S MISS RINDO, BUT YEAH,
I PREFER TO BE CALLED RANMARU.

52
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,375
I LOVE KARATE, MY
DREAM IS TO BRING BACK

53
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,958
MY FATHER'S MARTIAL ARTS DOJO,

54
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,041
THAT CLOSED DOWN
AFTER HE WENT BANKRUPT.

55
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:40,583
- I SEE, IS THIS A SO CALLED
BOY RAISED AS A GIRL PATTERN?

56
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,791
- STOP CALLING ME A
BOY, DOUCHE- BAG,

57
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,166
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR
FACE BASHED IN.

58
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,625
- SORRY.

59
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,458
- OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

60
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,666
THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY THIS
GIRL DOESN'T REMEMBER ME,

61
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,250
IS THERE?

62
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,708
WAIT, I'VE GOT IT. I KNOW A WAY
OUT OF THIS, I NEED A DISGUISE.

63
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,458
SHE'LL NEVER RECOGNIZE ME NOW.

64
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,541
- ( chuckles ) IF THIS IS A
COSPLAY CONTEST, YOU'RE TOAST.

65
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,375
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU, POVERTY GOD.

66
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,166
YOU'RE JUST DRAWING
ATTENTION TO US.

67
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,083
- SWEET. I WANT IN ON THIS.

68
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,250
- COME ON, NOT YOU TOO.

69
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,708
- TAKE A SEAT IN THE BACK ROW
NEXT TO THE HALLWAY, PLEASE.

70
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:16,791
- KAY- O.

71
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,791
- SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT
OVER HERE. HMM?

72
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,666
HEY, YOU'RE THE GIRL
FROM YESTERDAY.

73
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,458
- THIS SUCKS. SHE TOOK
ONE LOOK AND FIGURED IT OUT.

74
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,000
- WE NEED TO TALK.

75
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,208
- SHE'S GONNA MURDER ME.
- HUH?

76
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,125
- MISS ICHIKO,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

77
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,916
- THE TRANSFER STUDENT GOT
VIOLENT WITH ME OUT OF NOWHERE.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,041
- HUH?

79
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,500
- WHY WOULD YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

80
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,666
- WE WON'T STAND FOR
THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR, NEWB.

81
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,250
- YEAH, NOT COOL.
- YOU GOT THE WRONG IDEA HERE.

82
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,791
- ( smirks )

83
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,166
- ( grunts ) DAMN YOU.

84
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,583
- I'LL MAKE HER PAY.

85
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,666
BUT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN
GET TO HER AT SCHOOL,

86
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,750
NOT WITH HER IDIOT
BRIGADE AROUND.

87
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,375
- HMM?
- ( chuckles )

88
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,208
- ( door bell rings )

89
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,333
- Ichiko: COMING!

90
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,875
THIS SO ISN'T HAPPENING.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

91
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,625
- ( screams )
- I KNOW YOU SAW ME, YOU JERK.

92
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,625
- AND YOU FOUND OUT
WHERE I LIVED, HOW?

93
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,083
- WILL AND DETERMINATION.

94
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,000
- AND A LITTLE BIT OF HELP,
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

95
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,125
I HELD UP MY END OF THE
BARGAIN, NOW GO AHEAD,

96
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,166
AND BASH IN HER STUPID,
HAPPY FACE.

97
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,500
- DAMN YOU, POVERTY GOD,

98
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,583
I'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR
SELLING ME OUT LIKE THIS.

99
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,166
- HEY, DON'T BLAME THIS
ON HER! IT'S YOUR FAULT,

100
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,250
I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE WHO
DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

101
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,625
FOR THEIR OWN
ACTIONS AND FESS UP

102
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,083
TO THE AWFUL THINGS
THEY'VE DONE.

103
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,791
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A BIG COWARD.

104
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,125
- WELL, AT LEAST I
DON'T GO AROUND

105
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,750
BREAKING DOWN PEOPLE'S DOORS.

106
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,833
- YOU FULL BLOWN NUT- JOB.
- A NUT- JOB?

107
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,625
- COME ON, DON'T LET HER
BEAT YOU, SAY SOMETHING.

108
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,208
- WELL, YOUR BOOBS ARE HUGE.

109
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,791
- YOU COULD'VE BEEN A LITTLE
MEANER, BUT GOOD EFFORT.

110
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,250
- ( chuckles )

111
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,291
THAT'S SWEET OF YOU, BUT WAS
THAT REALLY YOUR COMEBACK?

112
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,250
YOU, MAN- FACED TOM- BOY.

113
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,458
- ( screaming )

114
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,500
- SCREW YOU, GAZONGA GIRL.
- UH- OH.

115
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,666
- ( screams )

116
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,666
- MORON, DID SHE ACTUALLY
THINK SHE COULD WIN THE DAY

117
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,333
AGAINST MY HAPPINESS ENERGY?

118
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,208
- 'E', IT'S FOR EFFORT.

119
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,250
- ( exclaims )

120
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:14,166
- LISTEN UP, LADY PANTS. YOU'LL
PAY FOR THIS, I PROMISE YOU.

121
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,041
IT IS ON LIKE DONKEY KONG.
YOU VERSUS ME, ONE ON ONE.

122
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,416
- WELL, YOU GONNA FIGHT HER?

123
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,916
- SHE FELL THIRTEEN STORIES,
HOW IS SHE STILL ALIVE?

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,333
- Male Student: ICHIKO'S GONNA
BATTLE THE NEW TRANSFER STUDENT.

125
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,666
- CAT FIGHT!
- CAT FIGHT!

126
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,208
- NOWHERE TO RUN THIS TIME,
IS THERE, COWARD?

127
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,250
- IF ANYBODY SHOULD
BE RUNNING AWAY, IT'S YOU.

128
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,583
- TWO HUNDRED ON ICHIKO.
- RINDO ALL THE WAY.

129
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,708
- COLAS, CANDY, POPCORN,
ICE- COLD BEER!

130
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,458
- DUDE, WE'RE AT SCHOOL,
YOU CAN'T SELL BEER HERE.

131
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,541
- NAH, IT'S COOL, I SAW
OUR TEACHER BUY SOME EARLIER.

132
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,541
- OKAY, THE LOSER OF
THIS MATCH HAS TO DO

133
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,291
WHATEVER THE WINNER
TELLS THEM TO DO.

134
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,041
- THAT'S OKAY BY ME,
JUST BE AWARE, IF I WIN,

135
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,833
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
LEAVE THIS SCHOOL.

136
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,833
- OH IS THAT SO?
THEN MAY THE BEST GIRL WIN.

137
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,125
I'VE WORKED MY BUTT OFF
TO GET AS STRONG AS I AM.

138
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,625
NO WAY IN HELL, I'LL LET YOU
TAKE THAT AWAY.

139
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,291
I HOPE YOU'RE READY
FOR A BEAT DOWN, LADY PANTS.

140
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,250
'CAUSE GUESS WHAT?
YOU'RE GETTING ONE.

141
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,916
- HMM.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,791
- IT'S THE END OF THE LINE
FOR YOU, GIVE UP RIGHT NOW,

143
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,333
OR FACE MY TERRIBLE WRATH.

144
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,125
LAST CHANCE.

145
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,875
- KILL HER!

146
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,333
- AKANE, YOUR HAIR IS LOOKING
KINDA THROWED.

147
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,583
- SHUT UP!

148
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,750
- ( screams )

149
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,833
- MY EYES.

150
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,083
- DAMN, I'M STUCK.

151
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,916
- OW, OW, YOU WIN.
YOU GOT ME. I GIVE UP, OKAY?

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,333
- ( people cheering )
- WOW, I TOTALLY DID IT.

153
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,916
- OH, YEAH, AWESOME. WOO.
- WE LOVE YOU, ICHIKO.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,875
- IT'S OVER ALREADY?
THAT'S SO LAME.

155
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,291
- IT WOULD'VE BEEN WAY COOLER
IF THEY FOUGHT TO THE DEATH.

156
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,750
- OR IF THEY WERE NAKED.

157
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,666
- SO, HOW'D WE DO?
- OVER NINE THOUSAND.

158
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,791
- OUTSTANDING.

159
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,916
- WE'RE GONNA BE FILTHY
STINKING RICH. ( laughs )

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,500
- OH, HECK YEAH.
WE ARE EATING OUT TONIGHT.

161
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:12,000
- THIS SUCKS, HOW COULD
I LOSE TO THAT LITTLE BRAT?

162
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,041
- YO.

163
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,416
- GREAT FIGHT, REAL GOOD STUFF,

164
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,666
YOU GAVE US AN AWESOME
SHOW OUT THERE.

165
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,875
IF YOU EVER DO IT AGAIN, I SURE
HOPE YOU'LL GIVE ME A CALL.

166
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,666
- I'LL BE RICH.
- OH, SURE.

167
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,625
- THANKS SO MUCH, WAIT,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?

168
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,666
- I'M KEITA TSUWABUKI.
- AND MY NAME'S MOMIJI.

169
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,791
- NOT YOU.

170
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,125
- SO COOL.
- I HATE TO INTERRUPT.

171
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,708
- ( gasps )
- BUT YOU DO REMEMBER,

172
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,083
WHAT I SAID ABOUT WHAT YOU'D
HAVE TO DO IF YOU LOST, RIGHT?

173
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,416
- YES, I REMEMBER.

174
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,833
A PROMISE IS A PROMISE,
I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

175
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,208
- AND SO, THE TOM- BOY,
KARATE- LOVING,

176
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:01,333
FREAK- SHOW PSYCHOPATH
VANISHED FROM MY SIGHT FOREVER.

177
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,791
- Teacher: WE HAVE A
NEW TRANSFER STUDENT

178
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,625
THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
TO YOU TODAY.

179
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,375
- Ichiko: BUT THEN.
SHE CAME BACK!

180
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,416
- THIS IS MISS RINDO,
SHE TRANSFERRED IN,

181
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,166
THEN SHE LEFT,
AND NOW SHE'S BACK.

182
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,333
- I ONLY HAVE ONE PURPOSE HERE.
THAT'S TO DESTROY ICHIKO SAKURA.

183
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,250
- I GUESS I SHOULD'VE BEEN A
LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC

184
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,750
WITH MY REQUEST.

185
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,416
- I'M NOT SURE WHY, BUT I HAVE
A FEELING ME AND THIS GIRL

186
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,416
ARE GONNA GET ALONG JUST FINE.

187
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,083
- Man: HIDEBU.
- Man 2: UWARABA.

188
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,625
- Man 3: ABESHI.

189
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,916
- ARE YOU TWO ALL RIGHT?

190
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,875
- WE'RE FINE, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR SAVING US.

191
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,125
- DAMN, THESE PUNKS
ARE NO CHALLENGE AT ALL.

192
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,375
- ICHIKO, I'LL GET YOU
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO.

193
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,458
- ( chuckles )

194
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,666
- HERE'S THE DEAL, I WANT
YOU TO FIGHT ME AGAIN.

195
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,416
- WHAT? NO.

196
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,333
- THIS ISN'T AN OPTION, LADY.

197
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,333
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
DO THIS THING.

198
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,833
- WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?

199
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,291
WHAT IS IT ABOUT ME THAT YOU
DON'T LIKE SO MUCH, ANYWAY?

200
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,208
- JUST STOP RIGHT THERE.

201
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,291
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN TO QUIT,
DO YOU MISS RINDO?

202
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,791
- WE WON'T LET YOU LAY
ANOTHER HAND ON HER.

203
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:19,958
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,

204
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,750
WHY ARE YOU SO FREAKING
OBSESSED WITH HER?

205
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,291
- COME ON RANMARU,
TAKE THEM ALL ON AT ONCE.

206
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,666
- HEY, SHUT UP. EVERYBODY
BACK OFF ME RIGHT NOW.

207
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,708
- ALL RIGHT. YOU KIDS
JUST CALM DOWN...

208
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,291
- STOP THIS NONSENSE AT ONCE.

209
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,041
ANY FURTHER CONFRONTATION
WOULD BE POINTLESS.

210
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,791
- BUT, DON'T YOU WORRY,
A REMATCH IS COMING SOON.

211
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,125
- ( students cheering )

212
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,375
- AW, COME ON.
- OH, HELL YEAH.

213
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,416
- YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE
FOR BOTH OF US.

214
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,416
- GET YOUR TICKETS RIGHT HERE.

215
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,416
- OKAY, THAT'S IT. I'VE HAD IT.

216
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,375
- I'M TRYING TO SLEEP. SHUT UP.

217
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,458
- ( gasps )

218
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,291
- I'M SORRY.
- ( gasps )

219
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,625
- HE'S RIGHT THOUGH,

220
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,458
WE CAN'T MAKE ALL THIS RACKET IF
HE'S GONNA SLEEP.

221
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,750
- THOSE KIDS NEVER LISTEN
TO WHAT I SAY.

222
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,458
- THIS IS DRIVING ME NUTS.

223
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,291
- ( chuckles )

224
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,500
- I LOVE YOU.
- Nah, I LOVE YOU.

225
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,625
- ( screams )

226
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,708
- MAN, I SHOULDN'T BE
THINKING ABOUT THAT.

227
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,083
I SHOULD BE THINKING
ABOUT

228
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,583
CLOBBERING THE EVER- LOVING
CRAP OUT OF LADY PANTS.

229
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,458
BESIDES,

230
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,375
WHAT WOULD SOMEONE LIKE HIM
SEE IN A TOMBOY LIKE ME?

231
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,958
- WELL, HELLO. HI, THERE.

232
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,583
- ( screams ) NOT COOL, MAN.
NOT COOL.

233
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,125
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- OH, YEAH.

234
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,833
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU TWO
TALKING ABOUT?

235
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,750
- NOW LISTEN UP, I KNOW
YOU THINK YOU'RE A BOY.

236
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,666
BUT YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE A GIRL.

237
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,250
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO,

238
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,541
BUT FORGET ABOUT IT.

239
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,041
- Momiji: SOMETIMES,
I DRESS UP ALL SEXY- LIKE,

240
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,583
AND THEN I LIKE TO MAKE OUT
WITH A HANDSOME LOOKING BOY.

241
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,750
- STOP READING MY MIND. I MEAN,
SHUT UP, I'D NEVER SAY THAT.

242
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,166
- IF YOU'LL JUST LET ME,
I CAN HELP YOU OUT.

243
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,500
- WAIT, WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

244
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,041
- OH, DON'T YOU KNOW?

245
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,291
WE HAVE MET ON THE FIELD OF
BATTLE AND FOUGHT TO THE END,

246
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:06,000
OUR BOND'S THICKER THAN BLOOD,
IT CAN NEVER BE BROKEN.

247
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,416
- WE'RE CONNECTED FOREVER.
- HUH?

248
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,291
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME, I SWEAR,
I WON'T STEER YOU WRONG.

249
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,291
- UH, YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

250
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,416
- GULLIBLE IDIOTS ARE
SO EASY TO MANIPULATE.

251
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
NOW, THAT I'VE EARNED HER
TRUST, I CAN GET CLOSE ENOUGH

252
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,708
TO STAB HER IN THE BACK,

253
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,000
AND MAKE THAT TOMBOY
PAY FOR WHAT SHE'S DONE.

254
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,125
- ICHIKO THINKS SHE'S CLEVER,
BUT I SEE THROUGH HER SCHEME.

255
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,375
- RANMARU AND I WILL TEAM UP

256
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,833
AND TAKE HER HAPPINESS ENERGY
AWAY FOREVER.

257
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,000
OH, YES, ICHIKO, YOUR DAY
IS COMING VERY SOON.

258
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,000
- ( people chattering )

259
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,500
- THERE. ALL DONE.

260
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,625
- YOU'RE GORGEOUS, HONESTLY,

261
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,333
IT'S LIKE I'M LOOKING AT A
DIFFERENT PERSON.

262
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,166
- WHOA, IS THAT ME?

263
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,250
- YEP, SO, HOW DOES IT
FEEL TO BE REBORN?

264
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,833
- Both: NO MATTER WHAT, SHE'LL
NEVER LOOK AS GOOD AS I DO.

265
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,791
- WELL, IT'S WEIRD.
- STOP CHEWING ON LEAVES.

266
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,416
- IT'S SO AIRY DOWN THERE.
- STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR SKIRT.

267
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,166
- YEAH, THESE SHOES
ARE KINDA HARD TO WALK IN.

268
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,333
- GET UP, RIGHT NOW.

269
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,250
- AW, MAN, THIS SUCKS.

270
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,333
- WHOA, DUDE,
SHE IS REALLY CUTE.

271
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,000
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

272
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,916
- ( crying )

273
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,750
- THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
ANYONE'S EVER CALLED ME CUTE.

274
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,458
- NOW, IF YOU CAN JUST LAND A
BOYFRIEND, YOU'LL BE GOOD TO GO.

275
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,916
- A BOYFRIEND?
- WHOA.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,583
- NO WAY, I DON'T THINK
I'M READY FOR THAT.

277
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,958
DRESSING UP LIKE THIS IS ABOUT
ALL I CAN HANDLE AT THE MOMENT.

278
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,458
THANK YOU, BOTH OF YOU.

279
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,291
I WILL NEVER FORGET
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME TODAY.

280
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,958
- IT MEANS SO MUCH.
- HMM.

281
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,333
- BUT, I GOTTA GO CHANGE.
- HMM?

282
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,166
- IF MY OLD MAN SAW THIS,

283
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,416
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT HE WOULD DO.

284
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,208
- YOUR OLD MAN, HUH?

285
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,833
- HE ALWAYS WANTED A SON TO TAKE
OVER THE DOJO AFTER HE WAS GONE,

286
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,458
BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED.

287
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,750
UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM, THE ONLY
CHILD HE EVER HAD WAS ME.

288
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,208
SO, HE MADE IT HIS
MISSION TO MAKE ME

289
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,708
THE BEST FEMALE KARATEKA EVER.

290
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,750
- YOU THINK I'M A HOTHEAD,
WAIT TILL YOU MEET HIM.

291
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,708
- SO, IT'S YOUR FATHER'S FAULT
THAT YOU'RE ALL MASCULINE

292
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,083
AND BUTCH LIKE THAT?

293
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,625
- HEY, YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, OKAY?

294
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,083
I MEAN SURE, HE'S STRICT
WHEN IT COMES TO KARATE,

295
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,666
BUT I RESPECT HIM FOR
BRINGING ME UP ALL ON HIS OWN,

296
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,791
THAT COULDN'T'VE BEEN
AN EASY THING TO DO.

297
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,458
- ( screams )

298
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,791
- WELL, I'LL NEVER GET THAT,

299
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,375
YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE
TO RESPECT YOUR PARENTS.

300
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,625
- WONDER WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
- WHAT?

301
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,208
- I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY TIME
FOR ME TO CHANGE CLOTHES.

302
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,666
- NAH, NOT YET.

303
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,500
I THINK I'LL ENJOY IT
A LITTLE BIT LONGER

304
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,041
BEFORE I HAVE TO GET HOME.

305
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,500
- RANMARU.
- HUH?

306
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,041
- GOOD MORNING, ICHIKO.
- GOOD MORNING, YOU GUYS.

307
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,791
- ( students murmuring )

308
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,916
- WHOA.
- CHECK HER OUT.

309
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,250
- ( gasps )

310
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,458
- HEY, WHERE ARE THE CLOTHES
FROM YESTERDAY?

311
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,250
HOW DID YOU CUT YOUR FACE?

312
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,375
RANMARU, DID YOUR DAD
DO THAT TO YOU?

313
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,458
- MEH, IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS,

314
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,291
SO WHY DON'T YOU STAY THE
HELL OUT OF IT?

315
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,541
MATTER OF FACT,

316
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,375
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE
ME ALONE ALL TOGETHER.

317
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,166
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY
GOING TO HER HOUSE, ARE YOU?

318
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,083
SHE ASKED YOU TO LEAVE
HER ALONE, YOU KNOW?

319
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,083
YOU SHOULDN'T STICK YOUR NOSE
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS,

320
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,458
ESPECIALLY NOT WHEN
IT COMES TO FAMILY.

321
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,500
- HEY, WHO ARE YOU TO TALK,
POVERTY GOD!

322
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,458
- ( grunts )

323
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:51,333
- GET BACK UP.
YOU'VE DISAPPOINTED ME.

324
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,583
WHEN DID KARATE GET REPLACED
BY NONSENSE LIKE THIS?

325
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,750
I DIDN'T RAISE YOU TO CARE
ABOUT SUPERFICIAL GARBAGE!

326
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,083
- NO, FATHER. PLEASE, I...

327
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,625
- ( gasps )

328
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,833
- HOW CAN YOU EVER HOPE
TO BE A TRUE POWER

329
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,250
IN THE WORLD OF KARATE,

330
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,916
WHEN YOU ALLOW YOUR MIND
TO BE DELUDED BY COMMON TRIFLES?

331
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,250
- HUH?

332
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:22,125
- IT'S HER.
- IS IT?

333
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,416
- SO, YOU'RE THE YOUNG LADY WHO
DEFEATED MY DAUGHTER, ARE YOU?

334
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,875
- THAT'S RIGHT, AND I'M ALSO
THE ONE WHO DRESSED HER UP

335
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,708
TO MAKE HER LOOK LIKE A GIRL,
IF YOU WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH.

336
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:31,875
- WHAT?

337
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,458
- I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME,

338
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,458
OF ALL THE STUFF THERE IS
TO LOATHE IN THIS WORLD,

339
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,166
I HATE TWO THINGS THE MOST.

340
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,250
- THE FIRST ONE IS
THE POVERTY GOD.

341
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,500
- HEY.

342
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,583
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THE SECOND ONE IS?

343
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,416
PARENTS WHO FORCE KIDS
TO BE SOMETHING THEY'RE NOT,

344
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,375
SELFISH FATHERS WHO
PUT THEIR OWN NEEDS

345
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,208
BEFORE THEIR CHILDREN.

346
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,500
FIGHT ME RIGHT NOW.
IF I BEAT YOU,

347
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,458
YOU HAVE TO LET HER DO AND
WEAR WHATEVER SHE WANTS,

348
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,541
UNDERSTAND?

349
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,666
- OH, WOW.

350
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,833
- HE'S CLEARLY MUCH STRONGER.
QUESTION IS,

351
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:05,000
IS THIS AN OPPONENT SHE CAN BEAT
WITH JUST HER HAPPINESS ENERGY?

352
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,583
- THIS IS QUITE A BRAZEN ACT
FOR A YOUNG LADY,

353
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,875
BUT FIGHTING WOMEN AND CHILDREN

354
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,083
GOES AGAINST THE
PRINCIPLES OF MY DOJO.

355
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,375
- CONVENIENT.

356
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,375
- BUT, SEEING AS HOW
YOU'RE A LITTLE BRAT.

357
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,750
- IT'S MY JOB AS AN ADULT
TO PUNISH YOU,

358
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,208
IF I DON'T TEACH YOU
A LESSON, WHO WILL?

359
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,208
I ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE,
DEFEND YOURSELF!

360
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,875
- DON'T DO THIS, FATHER,
LEAVE HER ALONE.

361
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,166
- ( screams )

362
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,625
- DRAGON STRICT KICK, C'YA!

363
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,208
- ( screams ) MY EYES.

364
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,000
- DEJA VU.

365
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,541
- (grunts ) I'M STUCK.

366
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,250
- HUH?
( screams )

367
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,958
- YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A LITTLE GIRL.

368
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,000
DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK.

369
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:03,000
- DON'T YOU SEE?
THAT OUTFIT MADE HER SMILE,

370
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,083
SURE, SHE WAS DRESSED UP LIKE A
GIRL, BUT IT MADE HER FEEL GOOD.

371
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,833
YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS SO HAPPY.

372
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,583
WHO ARE YOU
TO TAKE THAT AWAY?

373
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,708
WHO ARE YOU TO DENY
HER HAPPINESS?

374
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:20,833
- ( screams ) THERE'S NOTHING I
HATE MORE THAN PARENTS LIKE YOU.

375
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,083
HUH? RANMARU? WHY?

376
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,750
- DON'T DO THIS.
- ( gasps )

377
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,541
- IT'S NOT YOUR PLACE,
THE TRUTH IS,

378
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,458
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.

379
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,791
HE MAY BE THE KIND OF PERSON
YOU HATE AND WANT TO PUNISH.

380
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,541
BUT TO ME, HE'S MY DAD,
AND I LOVE HIM.

381
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:50,000
SO, PLEASE, PLEASE.

382
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:55,000
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE US BE.
DON'T HURT HIM, I'M BEGGING YOU.

383
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,833
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO STICK YOUR
NOSE WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG.

384
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,458
- SHUT UP.

385
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,958
- IF YOU'RE JUST GONNA
LIE THERE AND MOPE,

386
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,708
YOU'LL GET NO PITY FROM ME.

387
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,750
IF MISTER SUWANO WERE HERE,

388
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,291
I BET HE'D CONSOLE YOU
BY TELLING YOU,

389
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,375
YOU WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

390
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,791
BUT SINCE HE'S NOT HERE,
I GUESS YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK.

391
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,250
AS IT IS, YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

392
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,000
- HUH. FATHER?

393
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:45,833
- I GOTTA GO.
- HER NAME IS ICHIKO, RIGHT?

394
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,750
- THERE AREN'T VERY MANY
PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD

395
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,708
WHO WOULD STICK THEIR NECK OUT
FOR SOMEONE LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,666
I THINK YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF
A FINE FRIEND THERE.

397
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,208
- OH. ACCEPT,
SHE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

398
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,583
- HE MADE YOU PUT ON
THAT NASTY OUTFIT, HUH?

399
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,750
- NO. IN FACT,

400
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,666
THE OLD MAN TOLD ME
I COULD WEAR WHATEVER I WANT.

401
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,291
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I THINK I LIKE THIS BETTER.

402
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,125
SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY,
AND I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HELP,

403
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,041
BUT I'VE REALIZED I'M HAPPY
JUST THE WAY I AM.

404
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,416
THANK YOU, THOUGH,

405
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,916
AND MY FATHER TOLD ME TO
TELL YOU THANK YOU AS WELL.

406
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,791
- IT'S WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

407
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,541
AND HEY, DON'T WORRY, I TOTALLY
WASN'T TRYING TO SCREW YOU OVER.

408
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,041
- WHAT'S UP WITH HER?

409
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,041
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL
YOU, THAT'S JUST HOW SHE IS.

410
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,625
- Ichiko: 'CAUSE GUESS WHAT?
IT'S ICHIKO FESTIVAL TIME.

411
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,958
♪ FOR SHE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW,
FOR SHE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪

412
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,916
♪ FOR SHE'S
A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪

413
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,666
- Students: THIS WEEK'S.
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO.

414
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,750
- I'M SO SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.

415
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,125
DID YOU SEE ME AGAIN THIS WEEK?

416
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,333
NOT EVERYTHING IN THIS CRAZY
WORLD LASTS FOREVER,

417
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,041
BUT MY EXPLOITS CONTINUE
EVER ON IN GLORY.

418
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,625
HERE'S WHAT I WAS UP TO
THIS WEEK, FOLKS.

419
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,250
AND THEN I WENT OVER HERE,
AS WELL, BUT JUST FOR THIS WEEK,

420
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,708
THERE'S A SPECIAL EXTRA!

421
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,333
- Students: EPISODE 1'S.
- Nadeshiko: OH, SUKENO.

422
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,791
- AT THE REQUEST
OF SOME OF YOU, FANS,

423
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,875
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY BACK
THE SCENE IN EPISODE ONE

424
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,666
WHERE THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR
APPEARED IN THE SHOW.

425
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,583
SO, HERE IT IS.

426
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,666
- WHAT THE...

427
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,708
- NOW WASN'T THAT
SOMETHING, PEOPLE?

428
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,083
LET'S PLAY IT AGAIN,
JUST FOR FUN.

429
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,416
- WHAT THE...

430
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,416
- ONE LAST TIME, WITH THE
AUTHOR'S SELF PORTRAIT.

431
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,375
- WHAT THE...

432
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,583
- ( laughs )
