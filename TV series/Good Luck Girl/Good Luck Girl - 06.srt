1
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,875
- ( sighs )

2
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,208
- Kakashi: WELL, IF IT ISN'T
MY FRIEND URASHIMAKO.

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,000
WHY THE LONG SIGH, AND IN
SUCH A DRAMATIC FASHION?

4
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,958
- OH, HEY, SORRY,
IT'S JUST MOMIJI AGAIN.

5
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:34,291
- MOMIJI, HUH? YOU MEAN THAT
POVERTY GOD WHO GETS HER KICKS

6
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,541
FROM WORKING YOU
LIKE A SLAVE, RIGHT?

7
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,916
- THAT'S HER. SHE WAS TRYING TO
STEAL THE HAPPINESS ENERGY

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,583
FROM A HUMAN NAMED ICHIKO SAKURA

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,000
USING THE PRINCESS'S
TREASURE BOX

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,916
TO TURN HER INTO AN OLD WOMAN,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,291
BUT BECAUSE I MESSED UP, SHE GOT
TURNED INTO A CHILD INSTEAD.

12
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,833
ICHIKO GOT AWAY AND
HID OUT IN THE HOUSE

13
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,708
OF ONE OF HER CLASSMATES,
TSUWABUKI,

14
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:50,875
AND WHILE MOMIJI LOOKED FOR HER,

15
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,916
SHE TOLD ME TO GET MORE
TREASURE BOXES SO,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,375
SHE COULD TURN THE GIRL INTO
AN OLD WOMAN LIKE SHE'D PLANNED.

17
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,541
THEN MOMIJI WENT ON A PICNIC

18
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,708
AND SEEMS TO HAVE CAUGHT
ICHIKO, BUT NOW,

19
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,000
SHE'S WAITING ON ME TO GET HER
THOSE TREASURE BOXES.

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,625
EVERYONE'S BEEN WORKING ME
REALLY HARD, AND I'M EXHAUSTED.

21
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,166
HENCE THE SIGHING IN
A DRAMATIC FASHION.

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,791
EVEN NOW, THEY'RE
MAKING ME SUBTLY RECAP

23
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,583
THE LAST EPISODE'S PLOT.

24
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,333
- YEAH, THAT WAS
NOT AT ALL SUBTLE.

25
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,666
- HEY, MICHIKO.

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,708
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. TELL
ME SHE DIDN'T FALL DOWN THERE.

27
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,875
OH NO.

28
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,000
( screaming )

29
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,125
- ( giggling )

30
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,250
- ( leaves rustling )

31
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,666
- Ichiko: I CAN'T BELIEVE
I GOT AWAY.

32
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,208
- MICHIKO.

33
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,208
- RIKA, HEY. HOW'S IT GOIN'?

34
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,916
- THANK GOODNESS. YOU SEEM OKAY.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,333
GOOD. UM, WHERE'S KEITA?
IS HE NOT WITH YOU?

36
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,625
- HUH?

37
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,375
- IF NOT, THEN WHERE IS HE?

38
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,208
- Tsuwabuki: OH MAN, THAT HURTS.

39
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,250
NOW THAT'S WHAT I
WOULD CALL A CRAZY FALL.

40
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,416
IT'S A MIRACLE I EVEN SURVIVED
TO HURT THIS BADLY.

41
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,708
AW, NOT GOOD. I NEED TO
HURRY UP, FIND MICHIKO,

42
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,708
AND GET BACK TO EVERYONE
ELSE, BUT HOW?

43
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,416
I CAN'T MISS WORK TOMORROW.
NOT AGAIN.

44
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,083
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

45
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,958
THERE AREN'T ANY MORE BUSES
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING.

46
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,125
- I'M SURE. WE'LL WAIT HERE
UNTIL MY BROTHER COMES BACK.

47
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,250
- Mika: THINK HE'S OKAY?

48
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,125
- OF COURSE, HE'S
PERFECTLY FINE.

49
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,208
HE'LL BE BACK SOON AND
WE'LL BE FINE TOO.

50
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,041
WE JUST CAN'T LEAVE HIM OUT HERE
BY HIMSELF OR HE'D GET LONELY.

51
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,833
- I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

52
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:20,166
- GEEZ, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
TSUWABUKI? COME ON.

53
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,333
YOU'VE GOTTA GET BACK HERE
BEFORE THEY ALL LOSE IT.

54
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:29,541
- NO. SOMETHING'S WRONG.
I CAN JUST FEEL IT.

55
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,916
- NO. MIKA.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,750
- IT'S TRUE. HE'S GONE.

57
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,583
HE'S GONE, AND HE'S GONNA
BE GONE FOREVER.

58
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,375
MOM AND DAD NEVER CAME BACK.

59
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,916
AND KEITA'S NEVER COMING
BACK, EITHER.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,250
- SHUT UP, DON'T SAY STUFF
LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT TRUE.

61
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,166
HE'D NEVER LEAVE
US LIKE THEY DID.

62
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,916
HE'S COMING BACK.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,041
STOP. YOU'RE MAKING SORATA CRY.

64
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,708
- RYU, THAT'S ENOUGH.

65
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,000
- PLEASE STOP CRYING. STOP.

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,333
- YOU CAN'T TELL THEM TO STOP
CRYING IF YOU'RE GONNA CRY, TOO.

67
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,916
PLEASE, THERE'S NOTHING
TO CRY ABOUT AT ALL.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,750
- ( all crying )

69
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,458
- PLEASE, COME BACK. COME HOME.

70
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,125
- MICHIKO, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

71
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,666
- I'M GONNA GO BACK OUT THERE
AND FIND YOUR BROTHER.

72
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,000
- YOU CAN'T.

73
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,041
WE WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO
WIND UP GETTING LOST, TOO.

74
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,208
- I'LL BE FINE.

75
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,708
- ( gasps )

76
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,625
- IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU AND
THE KIDS JUST WAIT HERE.

77
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,000
DON'T WORRY,
I'LL BE ABLE TO FIND HIM.

78
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,416
TRUST ME.

79
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,833
I'LL GO FIND YOUR BROTHER
AND BRING HIM BACK TO YOU.

80
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,958
- MICHIKO, WAIT. OH.

81
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,625
GREAT. WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?
I HOPE SHE'S RIGHT.

82
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,458
- COME ON, WHERE
THE HECK DID HE GO?

83
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,125
- WE ARE ON IT, NOW. TAKE THIS.

84
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,583
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, FEEL
FREE TO CALL ME.

85
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,333
- OKAY. WORTH A SHOT.

86
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,791
- ( howling )

87
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,250
- YOU SUMMON, AND I APPEAR.

88
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,666
YOU CALLED ME?
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

89
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,875
- I NEED TO USE YOUR NOSE.

90
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,041
I'M TRYING TO FIND THE
OWNER OF THIS HANKY,

91
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,583
HE'S LOST SOMEWHERE
ON THE MOUNTAIN.

92
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,041
- BUT, UH...
THIS SMELLS LIKE A DUDE.

93
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,416
- CAN YOU DO THIS FOR ME OR NOT?

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,166
- HECK YEAH. PIECE OF CAKE.

95
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,000
- I GET IT. I KNOW WHY I FEEL
SO AWKWARD AROUND THEM.

96
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,500
I HATE TO ADMIT IT.

97
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:26,083
BUT GOOD FOOD, MONEY, AND A BIG
HOUSE DON'T REALLY MATTER.

98
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,500
THERE ARE TONS OF
THINGS THAT I HAVE

99
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,125
AND CAN HAVE THAT
THEY NEVER WILL.

100
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:36,625
BUT... BUT EVERYTHING THAT I
DON'T HAVE, THEY DO!

101
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,125
IT ALL MAKES PERFECT
SENSE TO ME NOW.

102
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,625
PLEASE, MOMO'O, YOU
HAVE TO FIND HIM.

103
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,041
- ( chirping )

104
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,791
- ( barking )

105
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:51,583
- WELL? DID YOU
FIND HIM YET? TSUWABUKI!

106
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,166
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE?

107
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,833
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?
YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE

108
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,416
AND YOU'RE JUST LAYING
AROUND LIKE A MORON.

109
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,291
GAH! COME ON, WAKE UP.
I SAID WAKE UP.

110
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,333
YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS
ARE WAITING FOR YOU.

111
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,500
THEY'RE CRYING
LIKE CRAZY PEOPLE,

112
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,333
AND IT'S REALLY ANNOYING.

113
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,666
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO
THOSE KIDS IF YOU DON'T GO BACK?

114
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,375
I HOPE YOU'VE TAUGHT THEM WELL,

115
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,708
BECAUSE I'M NOT ABOUT TO TAKE
CARE OF THEM FOR YOU.

116
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:18,500
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
OPEN YOUR EYES. YOU HAVE TO.

117
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:23,000
OPEN YOUR EYES, RIGHT NOW!

118
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,083
( screaming )

119
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,625
- GIRL, YOU NEED TO
GET IT TOGETHER.

120
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:34,166
YOU LEFT YOURSELF WIDE OPEN.
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?

121
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,791
- IS THAT SERIOUSLY ALL
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT?

122
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,666
- THANKS TO YOU,

123
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,875
I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY AND
COULD ONLY AFFORD TO BUY

124
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,250
THE SMALLEST SIZE
CAPSULE AVAILABLE.

125
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,791
BUT STILL, THERE SHOULD BE
ENOUGH IN THERE TO SAVE AT LEAST

126
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,541
ONE PERSON ON
THE VERGE OF DEATH.

127
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,083
- BUT POVERTY GOD.

128
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,958
- YES. I AM A POVERTY GOD,
NOT A GRIM REAPER,

129
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,708
SO IF SOMEONE INNOCENT WERE TO

130
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,000
DIE WHILE I WAS IN THE PROCESS
OF TAKING YOUR HAPPINESS ENERGY

131
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,708
THEY'D DO MORE
THAN JUST FIRE ME.

132
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,791
- BUT AREN'T YOU'RE
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT

133
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,500
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME?

134
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,083
- WELL, YEAH, BUT Y'KNOW,

135
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,875
FROM THE GREATEST HATE SPRINGS
FORTH THE GREATEST YADA - YADA.

136
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,291
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER, THOUGH.

137
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,041
IF YOU DECIDE TO ALLOW
TSUWABUKI TO DIE,

138
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,958
IT WILL GUARANTEE I'LL
BE SENT AWAY,

139
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,875
OUT OF THE HUMAN REALM TO
SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES

140
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,166
FOR HIS UNTIMELY DEATH.

141
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,666
- ( glass shattering )

142
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,041
- GOOD CHOICE. AW, HOW SWEET.

143
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,708
TO THINK THIS COULD HAVE BEEN
YOUR ONE AND ONLY CHANCE

144
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,291
TO GET RID OF ME.

145
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,666
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, YOU DON'T
REALLY SCARE ME THAT MUCH.

146
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,166
IT'S JUST, IF HE
WERE TO DIE NOW,

147
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,125
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
SLEEP AT NIGHT.

148
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,500
- ( chuckles )

149
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,916
- I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
HUMANITY'S A "B," HUH?

150
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,291
- WHOA, WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW IS IT ALREADY MORNING?

151
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,583
MICHIKO. I GUESS SHE MUST'VE
ENDED UP COMING TO LOOK FOR ME.

152
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,708
HOLD ON, IT'S NOT BROKEN.

153
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,708
AND MY HEAD ISN'T CUT ANYMORE.
DID I DREAM THE WHOLE THING UP?

154
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,625
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME
TO GO HOME NOW.

155
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,375
ALTHOUGH, I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET THERE.

156
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,458
HM. I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

157
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,208
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN OVERNIGHT?

158
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,958
WELL, TIME TO FOLLOW
THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, I GUESS.

159
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,166
AWESOME, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
WAS REALLY THE RIGHT WAY.

160
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,541
- ( exclaiming )

161
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,791
- I'M BACK. SORRY
I'M SO LATE, YOU GUYS.

162
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,833
- KEITA.
- YOU'RE BACK.

163
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,750
- ( all crying )

164
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,291
- AW, MAN. WE HAVEN'T FOUND
A SINGLE THING YET, HAVE WE?

165
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,333
THAT NOSE OF YOURS AIN'T AS
RELIABLE AS YOU SAID IT WAS.

166
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,791
IT DIDN'T HELP THAT YOU
DISAPPEARED YESTERDAY

167
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,416
AND RUINED THE SEARCH, EITHER.

168
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,083
- I TOLD YOU ALREADY, ICHIKO
SUMMONED ME AND NEEDED HELP,

169
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,666
NOT THAT WE WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN ANYWHERE

170
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,625
WITH YOUR INCESSANT FLIRTING
WITH EVERY GIRL THAT YOU SEE.

171
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,208
ALTHOUGH, I AM DETECTING
A NEWER ODOR I DIDN'T SMELL

172
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,250
BEFORE THIS MORNING.

173
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,208
BASED ON THE SCENT,
AN URASHIMA TARO DEITY

174
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,625
HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE
NEARBY RIGHT NOW.

175
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,958
- ( man crying )

176
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,208
- WHAT'S WITH THIS IDIOT,
HE LOOKS RIDICULOUS.

177
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,416
- WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP ABOUT
TURTLES AND GODS AND STUFF

178
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,000
AND GET YOUR ASS UP.

179
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,291
- I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET UP IF
YOU KEEP ROLLING ME ON MY BACK.

180
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,458
- ( together ) WE FINALLY
FOUND HIM!

181
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,125
GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE
I GIVE YOU SOMETHING

182
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,291
TO FLIP A TURTLE ABOUT!

183
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,833
- OH, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, KIND SIRS.

184
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,958
I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN
EVER REPAY YOU.

185
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,916
- I DO. HOW ABOUT YOU HAND OVER
THE TREASURE BOX, NOW.

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,541
- WAH. THINGS HAVE GONE
FROM BAD TO WORSE.

187
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,958
- HELLO THERE, LOVELY LADIES...

188
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,333
- HEY, ICHIKO. OVER HERE.

189
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,416
- MOMO'O. WHAT IS IT?

190
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,125
- GOOD NEWS. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO STAY A KID ANYMORE,

191
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,041
WE FOUND THE TREASURE BOX.

192
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,375
- YOU DID?

193
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,666
- HEY, MICHIKO, WE'RE LEAVING.
ARE YOU READY?

194
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,500
- YEAH, LET'S GO. OKAY,
I CAN'T DO THIS NOW,

195
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,708
SO I'LL HAVE TO FIND
YOU A LITTLE LATER.

196
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,166
- HEY, MICHIKO, HOW LONG DO YOU
THINK YOU'LL STAY WITH US?

197
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,166
- ( chuckles ) SO, THEY WANT ME
OUT OF THEIR HOUSE, HUH?

198
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,583
NEVER FEAR, I'LL BE OUT OF THERE
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

199
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,791
- WE LOVE HAVING YOU,

200
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,958
SO FEEL FREE TO STAY
AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO.

201
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,500
- HUH?

202
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,958
- AFTER ALL, YOU DID BRING
OUR BROTHER BACK TO US SAFELY.

203
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,125
I HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT YOU.

204
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,666
YOU MIGHT JUST BE
OUR VERY OWN ANGEL,

205
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,666
SENT FROM HEAVEN TO BLESS US.

206
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,000
- HUH?

207
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,458
THE CRAP ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

208
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,625
- OH, WOW. EVERYTHING I DON'T
HAVE IS HERE IN THIS HOME.

209
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,791
I CAN SEE THAT.

210
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,083
BUT SO WHAT.
IS THAT WHAT I WANT?

211
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,833
( laughs ) OF COURSE IT'S NOT.

212
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,625
WHY WOULD I, THE
ABNORMALLY LUCKY GIRL,

213
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,958
BE JEALOUS OF ANYONE ELSE? I
MEAN, SUPPOSE...

214
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,208
SUPPOSING, THIS...

215
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,500
AND THAT'S ALL I'M DOING HERE,
IS SUPPOSING.

216
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,708
BUT IF THIS WAS
SOMETHING I WANTED

217
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,958
AND IF I HAD TO KEEP LIVING
THIS WAY TO GET IT...

218
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,125
WOULD I?

219
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:21,458
IN REALITY, I'M STILL
ICHIKO SAKURA. I'M SORRY.

220
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,791
THERE IS NO MICHIKO.
SHE ISN'T REAL.

221
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,750
- HEY, WHY ARE YOU STILL UP?
SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN BED?

222
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,375
- OH. NO. I'M ACTUALLY LEAVING.

223
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,000
- ISN'T IT KIND OF
LATE FOR THAT?

224
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,375
- I HAVE SOMEONE
COMING OVER TO GET ME.

225
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,583
- WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
COMING TO GET YOU?

226
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:42,000
- I, UM... I JUST...

227
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,875
FUNNY STORY, THE TRUTH IS I'VE
ALWAYS HAD A CRUSH ON RYUTA,

228
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,458
LIKE BEFORE THIS STARTED,

229
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,708
BUT I WASN'T BRAVE
ENOUGH TO EVEN TALK TO HIM,

230
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:47,791
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

231
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,125
I FOUND OUT I WAS
MOVING TO AMERICA,

232
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,375
AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SOME
MEMORIES WITH HIM

233
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,708
BEFORE I LEFT BECAUSE I'M
A GIRL LIKE THAT,

234
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,458
AND YOU KNOW HOW WE ARE.
SO THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN...

235
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,000
- AND YOU LOST ME.

236
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,166
- I'M SORRY, BUT
AS IT TURNS OUT,

237
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,833
I WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY YOU BACK.

238
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:03,250
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. MICHIKO,
YOU SAVED MY LIFE, REMEMBER?

239
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,458
- ( gasping )

240
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,208
- HONESTLY, THERE'S A
LOT ABOUT THAT NIGHT

241
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,666
THAT I HAVE NO MEMORY OF.
IT'S SO BIZARRE.

242
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,833
BUT IF YOU HADN'T
BEEN THERE WITH ME,

243
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,166
I DOUBT I WOULD'VE BEEN LUCKY
ENOUGH TO SURVIVE ON MY OWN.

244
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,625
LOOK. AT LEAST SAY GOODBYE
TO MY LITTLE SISTER.

245
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,916
- I DON'T THINK I CAN, IT'S JUST
TOO HARD TO SAY GOODBYE.

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,375
- OH, IS IT NOW?

247
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:32,125
- IT IS. SO PLEASE, TELL HER.
TELL HER THAT...

248
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,166
I'LL, I'LL SEE HER AGAIN.

249
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,625
IT'S OKAY NOW, GUYS.
YOU CAN COME ON OUT.

250
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,541
- AS YOU WISH.

251
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,750
- HERE. WE HAVE FOUND
THE ITEM YOU REQUESTED.

252
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,375
BACK OFF. UNLESS YOU WANT TO
TURN INTO AN OLD PERVY MONK.

253
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,625
- ( hissing )

254
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,000
- PERFECT. NOW THEN, WE'RE
MORE THAN READY FOR THAT

255
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,958
SPECIAL REWARD YOU
PROMISED TO GIVE US.

256
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,375
- ( both exclaiming )

257
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,583
- ICHIKO. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

258
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
- HUH? WHAT'S WRONG?

259
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,500
- UM, WHAT ABOUT OUR REWARD?

260
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,833
- ANOTHER TIME, OKAY?

261
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,625
- MAN. I GOT NEEDS.

262
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,625
- ANOTHER TIME, LIKE WHEN?

263
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,416
- Momiji: POOR LITTLE ICHIKO.

264
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,041
SHE HAD THE POWER TO
GET WHAT SHE WANTED.

265
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,875
IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

266
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,875
BUT IT WASN'T
UNTIL THIS MOMENT

267
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,708
THAT SHE REALIZED WHAT IT WAS
SHE REALLY WANTED.

268
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,958
AND IT'S TOO LATE FOR HER, NOW.

269
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,750
THIS EPISODE IS KIND OF
BUMMING ME OUT.

270
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,166
I KNOW. I CAN GO AHEAD AND TURN
THIS GOOD FOR NOTHING TURTLE

271
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,166
INTO SOUP TO TAKE
MY MIND OFF THE WHOLE THING.

272
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,833
- THIS ISN'T VERY GODLY
BEHAVIOR, IF YOU ASK ME.

273
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,125
- MOTHERF...

274
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,291
- YOU SEE,
DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?

275
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,833
YET ANOTHER INNOCENT
PERSON SOMEWHERE

276
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,416
HAS PAINFULLY JAMMED THEIR
PINKY TOE INTO A DRESSER.

277
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,708
WHILE WE'RE SITTING
AROUND WASTING TIME

278
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,166
BECAUSE OF ICHIKO SAKURA,

279
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,750
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE
RUNNING OUT OF GOOD FORTUNE.

280
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,833
- ♪ THERE SHE IS, SWEETLY
BATTING HER EYELASHES, ♪

281
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:23,875
♪ FLIRTING WITH MY MAN LIKE
SHE DOESN'T KNOW I'M THERE... ♪

282
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,000
- ARE YOU
EVEN LISTENING, MOMIJI?

283
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,625
- ♪ YOU'RE A LOSER ♪

284
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,375
- I HEAR YOU FINE. BUT IT ISN'T
LIKE I'M SLACKING OFF OVER HERE.

285
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,375
JUST SO YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO
GET READY FOR ANOTHER BATTLE

286
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,250
WITH HER BY SUMMONING
MORE OF MY COURAGE.

287
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,708
- OH. IS THAT SO?

288
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,583
- WHO'S UP NEXT, GUYS?

289
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,708
- Bobby: OH MAN, THIS IS MY JAM.

290
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,541
- DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN
MOVEMENTS. THE OGRE IS HOME.

291
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,791
- OKAY? ( exhales ) SHE'S SCARY.

292
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,375
- NORMALLY, YEAH.
BUT FOR ICHIKO SAKURA,

293
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,958
THAT THERE WAS PRETTY TAME.

294
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,750
- TRUE STORY. EVER SINCE SHE
WAS TURNED INTO A CHILD,

295
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,916
SHE'S BEEN THERE IN BODY.
BUT NOT IN MIND.

296
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,916
- YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S
NOT JUST HER MIND,

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,083
IT'S HER WHOLE
SPIRIT THAT'S GONE.

298
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,416
- AND SHE'S LIKE THIS ALL
THE TIME. SHE'S SO DEJECTED.

299
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,541
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO ABOUT IT.

300
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,791
WHENEVER I THINK I'VE FOUND
MY CHAdNCE AND ATTACK,

301
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,708
HER HAPPINESS ENERGY IS
STILL AS HIGH AS NORMAL.

302
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,291
I HADN'T NOTICED THIS.

303
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,833
THE SLIPPERS I'M USED TO SEEING
HER IN HAVE BEEN SWITCHED WITH

304
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,958
IRON WEIGHT TRAINERS
FOR SOME REASON.

305
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,208
- THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS CASE.

306
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,666
ALL, RIGHT, IT'S HIGH
TIME TO ADMINISTER

307
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,291
A LITTLE SHOCK THERAPY TO
SNAP HER OUT OF IT.

308
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,875
READY, SET, TITTIES.

309
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,750
VEGETA!

310
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,916
- WELL, THAT DIDN'T SEEM
TO DO ANYTHING, DID IT?

311
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,083
- MONK. I WANT YOU TO KNOW I
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR COURAGE.

312
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,250
ALL RIGHT. IF ANYONE IS GONNA
SAVE THAT GIRL, IT'S ME.

313
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,791
- Female Voice: WOW!

314
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,208
- THAT WAS
WISHFUL THINKING, MONK.

315
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,333
SEXUAL HARASSMENT ISN'T
ENOUGH TO BRING ICHIKO BACK

316
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,833
TO HER OLD SELF.

317
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,833
- TAKE THIS AND LOVE IT,
YOU FILTHY MUTT.

318
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,750
- THIS IS WHAT SHE REALLY NEEDS.

319
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,666
ICHIKO SAKURA PUTS
THE "S" in S AND M.

320
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,416
- UM...

321
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,250
HEY, HOW YOU
FEELIN' THERE, ICHIKO?

322
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:35,833
NO. THIS ISN'T ICHIKO.
SHE'S AN IMPOSTER!

323
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,541
- ( screaming )

324
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:41,083
- MOMO'O, NO!

325
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,875
MY WARRIORS ARE DROPPING
LIKE FLIES. NO MORE.

326
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,958
APPARENTLY, I'LL HAVE TO
DEAL WITH THIS MYSELF.

327
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,375
FIVE MINUTES LEFT. IF
YOU'RE ALREADY FINISHED

328
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,000
KEEP CHECKING YOUR TEST

329
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,958
TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVEN'T
MADE ANY MISTAKES.

330
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,333
ALL RIGHT,
PUT YOUR PENCILS DOWN.

331
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,666
- ( students chattering )

332
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,166
HEY!
WHY WON'T YOU REACT?

333
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,291
DAMN, I HAD YAMABUKI
COME ALL THE WAY HERE, TOO.

334
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,333
WELL, AT LEAST THE CLASS
HASN'T NOTICED ANYTHING IS UP.

335
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,583
I BET THEY JUST FIGURE
I'M DOING SOMETHING WEIRD AGAIN,

336
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,541
BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY
WHAT I'M DOING.

337
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,250
- THAT MOMIJI'S DOING
SOMETHING WEIRD AGAIN.

338
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,583
- ( sighs and gasps )

339
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,375
- IT'S SO HARD TO
SLEEP THROUGH A TEST.

340
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:32,000
- HEY, UH... SO...
UM... TSUWA...

341
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,833
( sighs )

342
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,583
- ( exclaims )

343
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,666
I SEE, SO THAT MUST BE WHAT
THIS WHOLE THING'S ABOUT.

344
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,625
OH MY, DID SPRINGTIME
JUST COME FOR ICHIKO?

345
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,500
YOU LITTLE DEVIL, YOU.
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

346
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,875
WHY, IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

347
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,083
BEFORE WE'RE BLOWING UP
BIRDS WITH RICE.

348
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,541
GO ON, GIRL, GET HIM.
GET YOUR MAN.

349
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,666
- ( sighs )

350
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,291
- WHAT? UGH!
I WAS TALKING TO YOU.

351
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,250
SHOCK POSITIVELY IGNORED.

352
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,958
( screaming angrily )

353
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,125
ICHIKO, YOU IDIOT!

354
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,250
- WELL, LET'S HAVE IT. I'M READY
TO HEAR YOUR REGULAR REPORT.

355
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,125
I HOPE YOU'VE GOT GOOD NEWS.

356
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,875
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

357
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:13,708
- HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO WORK LIKE THIS?

358
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,500
YOU'RE BEING DRAMATIC.

359
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:20,208
- ALL RIGHT, MOMIJI. LET ME BE
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

360
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,333
IT MAY SURPRISE YOU, BUT
EVEN I HAVE LIMITS.

361
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,375
IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP ON
FOREVER LIKE THIS,

362
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,916
I CAN EASILY HAVE ANOTHER
POVERTY GOD SWITCH WITH YOU.

363
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,416
- YEAH. THAT MAY NOT BE
A BAD IDEA.

364
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,583
WHEN I THINK OF ALL THE CRAP
I'VE HAD TO PUT UP WITH

365
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,708
FROM THAT MORON.

366
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,791
IT ISN'T JUST THAT I THINK
THIS IS ANNOYING.

367
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,666
IT'S THAT IT'S ALL SO
UTTERLY FRUITLESS.

368
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,125
- ( sighs )

369
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,708
- ( grunts )

370
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,750
WHY? I HATE IT! WHAT
THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH ME?

371
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,375
WHY SHOULD I HAVE
TO BE SO MIXED-UP

372
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,583
OVER SOMETHING SO STUPID?

373
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,125
IT'S JUST A HANDKERCHIEF.

374
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,500
I FORGOT I HAD IT, AND NOW
I CAN'T GET RID OF IT.

375
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,625
WHY CAN'T I JUST GO AHEAD AND
GIVE THE DAMN THING BACK.

376
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,250
IT'S SO FREAKIN' SIMPLE,
AND I CAN'T DO IT.

377
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,208
HERE, YOU MUST HAVE
DROPPED THIS OR SOMETHING.

378
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,458
- OH...
THANK YOU.

379
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,125
- WHY IS YOUR
ADDRESS WRITTEN ON IT?

380
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,125
LIKE, WHAT, ARE YOU STILL
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

381
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,708
BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED

382
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,416
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK TSUWABUKI
IN THE FACE ANYMORE!

383
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,166
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO ABOUT THAT?

384
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,083
OH, I KNOW. I CAN JUST
DROP IT OFF AT HIS HOUSE

385
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,125
AND NOT SAY ANYTHING.

386
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,291
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

387
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,500
- UH, I, UH...
( imitating chicken clucking )

388
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,875
- WHAT ARE YOU A CHICKEN?

389
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,833
HEY HOLD ON, THIS IS MINE.

390
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,583
YOU CAME HERE JUST TO
GIVE THIS TO ME?

391
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,791
- UM - HMM. UM - HMM. UM - HMM.

392
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,625
- ( thinking ) WHAT'S
WRONG WITH HER?

393
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,833
I WONDER IF MICHIKO
DROPPED IT WHEN SHE LEFT.

394
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,125
- WHY ARE YOU REMEMBERING THAT?

395
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,208
- GUESS YOU'RE
GETTING IN THE HABIT

396
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,583
OF BRINGING STUFF BACK TO ME.

397
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,291
THANKS A LOT. AND I'M SORRY IF
IT WAS ANY TROUBLE.

398
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,916
- YOU'RE APOLOGIZING TO ME?

399
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,583
YEAH. YEAH. THAT'S GOOD.

400
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,750
- HUH?

401
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,541
- WELL, YOU SHOULD
BE GRATEFUL. SEE YA.

402
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,041
- WAIT, WHAT?

403
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,500
SOMETHING'S SERIOUSLY
WRONG WITH HER.

404
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,250
- I REALLY DID IT.

405
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:21,625
I GAVE IT BACK. I GAVE IT
BACK! I GAVE IT BACK!

406
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,083
THE WEIGHT HAS
FINALLY BEEN LIFTED.

407
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,750
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.
THIS IS TOTALLY AWESOME.

408
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,416
IT FEELS REFRESHING,

409
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,958
LIKE RIGHT AFTER PUTTING ON A
NEW PAIR OF UNDERWEAR

410
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,875
ON NEW YEAR'S DAY MORNING.

411
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,208
THE FOG THAT WAS BLOCKING MY
VIEW HAS FINALLY CLEARED AND...

412
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,250
WHAT?

413
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:44,583
WHAT IN THE HELL
HAVE YOU DONE?

414
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,750
I SEE YOU GUYS
HELPED YOURSELVES.

415
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,958
WHAT KIND OF A JERK GOD,
TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HOSPITALITY?

416
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,666
- THAT PRESENCE. YES. IT'S HER.

417
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,916
THE OLD ICHIKO IS BACK!

418
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,666
OH, YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

419
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,541
- REPLACE ME? HOW DARE YOU.

420
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,083
- WAIT. WHAT ABOUT BEFORE?

421
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,333
- I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA BE
THE ONE TO TAKE HER DOWN.

422
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,083
DON'T GET ALL SENILE.

423
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,416
- GIRL, WHAT IS
YOUR DAMN PROBLEM?

424
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,583
DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS,

425
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:49,750
VIEWERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO FIND THIS WEEK'S NADESHIKO

426
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,875
ON THEIR OWN.

427
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:55,416
- WAIT, NO, THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING... NO...

428
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,541
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING... NO,
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING, NO...
