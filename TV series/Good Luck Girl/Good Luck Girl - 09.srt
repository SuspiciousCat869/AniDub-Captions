1
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:24,500
- SOUND OFF. FIGHT, FIGHT.
- FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.

2
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:29,375
- SOUND OFF. FIGHT, FIGHT.
- FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.

3
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:34,875
- SOUND OFF. FIGHT, FIGHT,
FIGHT. FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.

4
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:40,750
- SOUND OFF. FIGHT, FIGHT.
- FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.

5
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:45,291
- SOUND OFF. FIGHT, FIGHT.
- FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.

6
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,833
- ( police siren wailing )

7
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,666
- SOUND OFF. FIGHT, FIGHT.
- FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.

8
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,541
- HOPE YOU'RE READY,
POVERTY GOD.

9
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,875
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU OUT
WITH EVERYTHING I'VE GOT.

10
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,458
I REFUSE TO PUT UP
WITH ANYMORE CRAP.

11
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,416
YOU MUST NOT BE A
VERY OMNIPOTENT GOD

12
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
TO THINK YOU COULD
WIN AGAINST ME.

13
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:37,291
- ( scoffs ) REALLY?
YOU JUST SAID THAT?

14
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,083
HMM. GIRL, YOU CRACK ME UP.

15
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,583
COME ON, LET'S GO.

16
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,708
- OKAY. AS I'M SURE
YOU CAN TELL,

17
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,041
THE TEACHER WHO'S NORMALLY
IN CHARGE OF GIRLS' PHYS ED

18
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,375
IS OUT SICK TODAY.

19
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,458
SO, INSTEAD OF SEPARATING
THE BOYS AND THE GIRLS,

20
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,500
WE'RE GONNA TRY A JOINT CLASS,

21
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,458
AND SEE IF YOU GUYS
CAN HANDLE IT.

22
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,666
WE'LL BE PLAYING
MIXED PAIRS TENNIS.

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,625
- HUH?
- DOUBLES, HUH?

24
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,500
I GUESS THAT MEANS I NEED
TO PICK OUT WHAT BOY

25
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,166
I WANT TO BE PAIRED WITH.

26
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,000
- COME ON, AT LEAST TALK TO HIM.

27
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,458
HEY, THERE, HOW'S IT GOING,
BIG FELLA?

28
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,583
- ( sighs ) HEY, WHAT'S UP?

29
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,791
- UH, WOULD YOU LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW,

30
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,416
UM, WOULD YOU MAYBE
WANT TO PAIR UP WITH ME, ER...

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,291
- YEAH, SURE.

32
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,541
- ( gasps )

33
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,458
- THAT'S IT, LET HER RIP.

34
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,875
- ( laughs ) OH, BUT I CAN'T.

35
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,583
- HERE, PUT YOUR HIPS INTO IT.

36
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,958
- HOLY CRAP,

37
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,916
FROM THESE DOUBLES WILL SPRING A
LIFETIME OF DOUBLES.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,916
- ( church bell ringing )

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,458
- OR AT LEAST THAT MAY HAPPEN.

40
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,416
I MEAN, ONE CAN DREAM,
CAN'T THEY? ONE CAN DREAM!

41
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,583
- SO, ANYONE GOT ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT?

42
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,791
- MISS SAKURA?
- ( screaming )

43
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,000
- WOULD YOU MIND
PAIRING UP WITH ME?

44
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,625
- NO, CHOOSE ME.

45
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:58,291
- HE'S A LOSER, CHOOSE ME.
- JUST A MOMENT, BOYS.

46
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,833
- COMMONERS SUCH AS YOURSELVES

47
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,666
ARE UNFIT TO PAIR WITH THE
LOVELY AND NOBLE ICHIKO SAKURA.

48
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,500
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU, BRO?

49
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,791
- I'M THE PRINCE
OF THE TENNIS CLUB.

50
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,375
ADENOKOJI. SHION ADENOKOJI.

51
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,666
- YOU'RE NOT A REAL PRINCE.

52
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,541
- YEAH, TENNIS CLUB IS NOT
ROYALTY, DUDE.

53
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,708
- SHE NEEDS SOMEONE
SIMILARLY NOBLE.

54
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,458
SOMEONE SIMILAR
LIKE ME, SPECIFICALLY.

55
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,541
- SO, WOULD YOU CARE
TO PAIR UP WITH MOI?

56
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,375
- All: MOI?

57
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,833
- YEAH, SURE. ANYONE'S FINE.

58
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,375
I'M NOT REALLY ALL
THAT PARTICULAR.

59
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,875
- DID YOU JUST
WIPE YOUR HAND OFF?

60
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,583
- GROSS.

61
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,625
- DO THEY KNOW HOW
RIDICULOUS THEY LOOK?

62
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,291
- YEAH, I DOUBT IT.
THEY'RE BEING RUDE, TOO.

63
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,583
LIKE, WHAT ABOUT US?

64
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,541
- Momiji: QUIT COMPLAINING.
- HUH?

65
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,708
- THE MORE SENSITIVE YOU ARE
TO HOW THEY'RE ACTING,

66
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,083
THE RUDER, THEY'LL BE.

67
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,583
- ( all exclaiming )

68
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,541
- IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
WHY DON'T YOU FOLLOW MY LEAD,

69
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,375
BUCK UP, AND DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

70
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,166
- All: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

71
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,833
- SERIOUSLY? YOU BROUGHT
A GORILLA WITH YOU?

72
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,416
- MEET MR. GORIHARA.
HE'S IN TENNIS CLUB WITH ME.

73
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
WE'VE BEEN RIVALS EVER SINCE
WE WERE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

74
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,750
I'M KNOWN AS THE TECHNICIAN.
AND HE'S THE CRUSHER.

75
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,333
WE'RE PRETTY FAMOUS. I'M SHOCKED
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF US.

76
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,541
WE'VE ALREADY HAD
SEVERAL MAJOR...

77
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,708
- WELL, NONE OF THAT
MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE.

78
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,291
- WHAT? YES IT DOES.

79
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,750
- BEAT THAT GIRL AND I'LL GIVE
YOU A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF BANANAS.

80
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,958
- ( roaring )

81
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,541
- LET'S DO THIS!

82
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,583
IF I'M GOING UP AGAINST YOU,
I'M NOT GONNA HOLD BACK.

83
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,583
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU OUT WITH
EVERY SINGLE THING I'VE GOT.

84
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,916
NO MORE OF YOUR CRAP.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,666
YOU MUST NOT BE A
VERY OMNIPOTENT GOD

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,083
TO THINK YOU COULD
WIN AGAINST ME.

87
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,333
- REALLY? YOU JUST SAID THAT?
GIRL, YOU CRACK ME UP.

88
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,125
NOW, COME ON. LET'S GO.

89
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,083
- LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE BOTH READY
FOR A FIGHT. GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

90
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,791
- COME TO THINK OF IT, A
REGULAR GAME WOULD BE SO BORING.

91
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,625
SO, INSTEAD, CARE TO
MAKE A LITTLE WAGER?

92
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,416
THAT OUGHTA GET US
REAL FIRED UP.

93
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,125
- THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

94
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,500
WHEN I WIN, WILL YOU FINALLY
DISAPPEAR FROM MY LIFE FOR GOOD?

95
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,083
NOTICE I SAID 'WHEN' NOT 'IF'!

96
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,541
- OKAY, WHATEVER, PRINCESS.
AND IN RETURN, WHEN YOU LOSE,

97
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,375
YOU'LL GIVE ME ALL OF YOUR
HAPPINESS ENERGY, BITCH FREE.

98
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,500
- ( both growling )

99
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,166
- Momiji: YOU LOSERS
WANNA MAKE A BET, TOO?

100
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,208
- SURE, SOUNDS FUN. I'LL WAGER.
- HE'S WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.

101
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,958
IF WE LOSE, HE'LL SHAVE
HALF HIS HAIR OFF,

102
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,916
AND RENAME HIMSELF
THE BALDING PRINCE.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,416
- WHAT?

104
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,958
NUMBER ONE, YOU CAME UP WITH
THAT NIGHTMARE WAY TOO FAST,

105
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,416
AND TWO, YOU COULD
HAVE ASKED ME.

106
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,416
- DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
THE DETERMINATION OF ROYALTY.

107
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,875
- SAYS THE GIRL WHO
UNDERESTIMATES

108
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,541
THE DETERMINATION OF A GORILLA.

109
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,416
- IF WE LOSE, GORIHARA
WILL PUT ON A SHOW

110
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,916
TITLED "SHE-GORILLA IN HEAT".

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,708
HE'LL WRITE A BOOK ABOUT
HIS WEEK IN A CAGE

112
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,375
WITH HER AND TITLE IT,
HOW I LOST MY VIRGINITY.

113
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,000
- ( grunts )

114
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,125
- THEREIN LIES A FIGHT
WE CANNOT LOSE.

115
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,625
- ( whistles )

116
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,083
- I HAVEN'T PLAYED TENNIS A TON,

117
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,625
BUT THERE'S STILL NO WAY THE
POVERTY GOD CAN BEAT ME.

118
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,666
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE
I DON'T RETURN THE BALL

119
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,625
TO SASQUATCH OVER THERE.

120
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,291
- ( all exclaiming )

121
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,708
- THAT GORILLA KNOWS
HOW TO PLAY FOR REAL.

122
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,208
- BAD APE! LEAVE HER ALONE!

123
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,750
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO HER?
- YOU'RE A MONSTER.

124
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,666
- KNOCK IT OFF. THIS IS TENNIS.
TRY TO BE MORE CIVILIZED.

125
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,125
IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY,

126
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,416
THEN REMOVE YOURSELVES
FROM THIS COURT AT ONCE.

127
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,625
AND BESIDES,

128
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,125
YOU SHOULD BE FAR MORE
CONCERNED ABOUT ICHIKO,

129
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,375
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING USELESS
ANGER AT A HUMAN APE HYBRID.

130
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,708
- PRINCE, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

131
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,666
ANY HUMILIATION I SUFFER
ON THE COURT,

132
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,666
DESERVES TO BE PAID BACK
ON THE COURT.

133
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,583
- YOU UNDERSTOOD?
AND I WAS BEING SO VAGUE, TOO.

134
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,250
- OKAY, HERE COMES
THE NEXT ONE. SERVICE.

135
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,583
- ( yelling )

136
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,625
- OH, NO. ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT, GORIHARA?

137
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,833
- ( groaning )

138
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,208
- HEY.
- HUH?

139
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,208
- IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE
FROM HERE, BELIEVE YOU ME.

140
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,333
- NICE. NOT BAD AT ALL, ICHIKO.

141
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,416
- THAT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING.

142
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,250
IT'S MY TURN.
I HOPE YOU'RE READY.

143
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,250
- I MAY NOT HAVE
GORIHARA'S POWER,

144
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,625
BUT MY SERVE
HAS A TENDENCY TO CHANGE.

145
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,416
YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP UP,
THOUGH I HIGHLY DOUBT YOU CAN.

146
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,458
- ( yells )

147
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,583
- OH, WOW. WAY TO AIM
FOR THE ACE, BRO.

148
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,333
- HUH?

149
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,166
- GUM-GUM STRETCHY ARM.
KING OF THE PIRATES!

150
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,333
- HEY, ISN'T SOMETHING
LIKE STRETCHING YOUR ARMS

151
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,625
AGAINST THE RULES?

152
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,250
- AFTER ALL THIS, ALL YOU
CARE ABOUT IS RULES?

153
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,500
WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THESE TWO?

154
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:16,041
- FROM THAT POINT ON, WITH
GORIHARA COWERING AROUND ICHIKO,

155
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,375
AND THE PRINCE BEING BAFFLED
BY MOMIJI'S IMPOSSIBLE MOVES,

156
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,125
THIS MATCH HAS TAKEN,
WHAT I WOULD CALL,

157
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,750
SOME UNEXPECTED TURNS.

158
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,583
AND NOW, WE'RE IN THE FINAL SET.

159
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,666
- ( Shion chuckles ) MOMIJI.

160
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,625
TO BE HONEST, YOUR TRICKY MOVES
THREW ME OFF AT FIRST,

161
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,375
BUT NOW I'M STARTING TO ADAPT
TO HOW ABSURDLY CRAZY THEY ARE.

162
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,208
- SO, YOU THINK YOU HAVE ALL MY
MOVES FIGURED OUT, DO YOU?

163
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,583
WELL, ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE
WHAT TRICKY REALLY LOOKS LIKE.

164
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,666
- ( all exclaiming )

165
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,000
- WHAT KIND OF MOVE IS THAT?

166
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,250
IT'S LIKE THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE MOMIJI OUT THERE!

167
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,125
- ( grunts )

168
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,875
- BY MOVING FAST ENOUGH, SHE'S
MAKING AFTER IMAGES OF HERSELF.

169
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,791
WHAT KIND OF A GIRL IS SHE?

170
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,541
WAIT, CALM DOWN
AND FOCUS, SHION.

171
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,208
DON'T PANIC. THERE'S
ONLY ONE OF HER,

172
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,083
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE BALL.

173
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,833
AND I KNOW WHICH ONE IS REAL.

174
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,250
- ( screaming )

175
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,333
- I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.
- HECK, YEAH.

176
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,750
- THAT WAS AWESOME.
SHE'S NOT HALF BAD.

177
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,958
- THOSE AREN'T AFTER IMAGES,

178
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,875
THEY'RE NOTHING BUT
CLONES, CHEATING.

179
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,250
OH, PRINCE, TELL ME YOU'RE OKAY!

180
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,708
- I'VE HAD IT, I CAN'T GO ON.

181
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,458
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
ANYTHING IS ANYMORE.

182
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,875
- YOU HAVE GOT TO GET
A HOLD OF YOURSELF, PRINCE!

183
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,333
- GO, ICHIKO. IT'S ALL
UP TO YOU, NOW.

184
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,458
SERIOUSLY, DON'T LET...

185
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,583
THEM SHAVE MY HEAD.

186
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,416
- PRINCE, NO!

187
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,000
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!

188
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,666
TIME OUT A SECOND.
I'VE GOT TO GET MY RACKET.

189
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,583
- THANK YOU FOR WAITING.
- ( yawning )

190
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:51,791
- HMM? WAIT, THAT'S NOT JUST ANY
OLD RACKET. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

191
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,250
IT'S TOTALLY YOUR SOMIN SHORAI.

192
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,041
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
- YEAH, HERE WHAT GOES?

193
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,500
- HEY, MORON, WHAT DO
YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN

194
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,041
IF YOU USE THAT IN
FRONT OF EVERYONE?

195
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,833
- ( wind whooshing )

196
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,375
- THAT WIND CAME OUTTA NOWHERE.

197
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,958
- THERE'S SAND IN MY
EYES. I CAN'T SEE.

198
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,583
- MAN, HER DAMN HAPPINESS ENERGY
COMES IN HANDY.

199
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,416
BUT YOU GO TOO FAR.

200
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,375
- Ranmaru: ICHIKO! MOMIJI!

201
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,458
- THIS IS A BATTLE
TO AVENGE THE PRINCE.

202
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,541
- BUT I'M NOT DEAD.

203
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,375
- TAKE THIS, POVERTY GOD!

204
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,083
- LADY LUCK DOESN'T GIVE UP,
DOES SHE? THAT'S FINE BY ME.

205
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,875
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN PLAY THAT GAME.

206
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,958
- Teacher: WHOA!
WHO'S STILL IN THERE?

207
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,250
- Akane: BOOBS, FLAT-CHEST,
THE PRINCE, AND THE GORILLA!

208
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,541
- THANK YOU FOR
MAKING THAT CLEAR.

209
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,000
AT ANY RATE, THE REST
OF YOU TAKE SHELTER.

210
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,208
- ( gasps )

211
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,125
- ( Momiji howling )

212
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,916
- All: I CAN SEE
SOMETHING IN THERE!

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,833
- JEEZ. WHAT IN THE HOLY CRAP?

214
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,583
SOMETHING STRANGE IS
GOING ON INSIDE THAT STORM!

215
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,500
- ( both yelling )

216
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,625
- THIS IS NOT HOW
YOU PLAY TENNIS.

217
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,125
- ( both screaming )

218
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,791
- ( yawning )

219
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,791
- PLEASE, CLASS BE OVER ALREADY.

220
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,291
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?

221
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,000
- WELP. SINCE WE CAN'T EXACTLY
USE THE COURTS ANYMORE,

222
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,333
TENNIS IS CANCELLED.

223
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,541
- YEAH, BUT A TIE HERE
IS NOT GONNA CUT IT!

224
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,875
- I DON'T THINK THIS
GAME WILL END

225
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,416
WITHOUT SOMEONE LOSING AN EYE OR
MORE LIKELY DYING.

226
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,416
- MAN, YOU GIRLS ARE
ON FIRE TODAY.

227
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,416
AND SO, WITH THE MATCH BEING
CALLED, THE GAME ENDS IN A TIE.

228
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,250
AND THE PRINCE AND GORILLA
GET OUT OF THEIR PENALTY GAME.

229
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,833
- WE'VE GOT YOUR FAVORITE, SON.
SAKURA-MOCHI!

230
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,458
- WE GOT SOME MOMIJI MANJU
FROM HIROSHIMA FOR YOU.

231
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,708
- I'M SCARED OF MOMIJI.

232
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,958
- Ranmaru: THEY EACH DEVELOPED
A CASE OF GYNOPHOBIA,

233
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,333
WHICH IS A FEAR OF CHICKS,
NOT LADY-DOCTORS.

234
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,875
AND ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.

235
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,125
- ( together ) NOTHING'S WELL!

236
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,958
- Students: THIS WEEK'S.
- Nadeshiko: OH, NADESHIKO.

237
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,666
- GUESS WHO'S FINALLY
A CHARACTER, PEOPLE?

238
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,083
I MADE IT, I MADE IT, I REALLY
MADE IT. ( screams )

239
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,291
- YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF CLEAR.

240
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,666
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GO THAT
FAR, I WILL ALLOW IT.

241
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,500
AT THIS JUNCTURE THEN,

242
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,000
I CHOOSE TO LEAVE EVERYTHING
UP TO YOUR DISCRETION.

243
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,250
FEEL FREE TO OBSERVE
THE SITUATION IN PERSON

244
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,500
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

245
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,250
IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL,
YOU WILL MOST CERTAINLY

246
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,250
BE REWARDED FOR YOUR EFFORTS.

247
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,708
- ALL RIGHT, I'VE PUT THIS OFF
FOR LONG ENOUGH.

248
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,041
TODAY IS THE DAY.

249
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,916
I'M GONNA COOK FOR MYSELF
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,041
YAY, ME.

251
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,500
SUWANO SAID,

252
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,541
- OKAY, I JUST NEED TO RELAX.
IF I SET MY MIND TO IT,

253
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,541
I CAN HANDLE COOKING,
NO PROBLEM.

254
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,541
SURE, I'M A BEGINNER AND CAN'T
NECESSARILY MAKE FOOD

255
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,083
THE WAY YOU DO
RIGHT OFF THE BAT, SUWANO.

256
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,500
BUT I DO KNOW THAT IF I CAN
MAKE EVERYONE ELSE THINK

257
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,833
WHAT I COOK IS TASTY,

258
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,666
THAT'S ALL I NEED TO FEEL
LIKE I DID A GOOD JOB.

259
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,416
GAH, WHY DOES TSUWABUKI
ALWAYS SHOW UP IN MY HEAD?

260
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,500
- WHATEVER. I'M FOCUSED
AND I'M GONNA DO THIS.

261
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,916
OKAY, NOW. LOOKS LIKE I NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF THE RICE FIRST.

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,291
- IT'S STEAMY IN HERE,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

263
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,625
- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

264
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,916
- IF I'D WON THAT TENNIS MATCH,

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,291
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT HER
UGLY FACE AGAIN.

266
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,916
MY BIGGEST MISTAKE
WASN'T LOSING,

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,958
IT WAS GETTING CAUGHT UP
IN ALL HER STUPID DRAMA.

268
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,958
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

269
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,041
TIME TO SNAP OUT OF IT
AND FOCUS ON CREATING FLAVOR.

270
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,750
I'M GONNA OWN COOKING.

271
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,625
- HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO MINUTES.

272
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,458
THANKFULLY, THE POVERTY GOD
ISN'T HERE TO LAUGH AT ME.

273
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,708
- YOUR HAND'S COVERED
IN BANDAGES, HOW STUPID!

274
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,375
- ALL RIGHT.
GUESS I GIVE UP.

275
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,125
- ( doorbell ringing )

276
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:13,208
- SAMURAI PIZZA CATS. GOT YOUR
PIZZA HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

277
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,791
- NO, THANK YOU.

278
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:16,958
I'LL START COOKING
TOMORROW INSTEAD.

279
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,250
IN THE MEANTIME, IT'S
PIZZA-PIZZA TIME.

280
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,458
PIZZA.
( gasps )

281
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,375
- ( screaming )
- THIS IS SO YUMMY.

282
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,791
WHO EATS SOMEONE ELSE'S PIZZA
WITHOUT ASKING FIRST?

283
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,208
- HEY, IT WAS JUST ONE PIECE.

284
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,083
AND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU WERE
GONNA EAT THE WHOLE THING.

285
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,500
I HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING
SINCE YESTERDAY.

286
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:34,791
- BESIDES, I MEAN, AFTER
SUCH TERRIBLE TREATMENT...

287
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,041
- HUH?

288
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,000
- YOU BUTCHERED A KITCHEN,
BUT WON'T FEED ME.

289
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,250
- SHUT UP. LIKE YOU HAVE
ANY ROOM TO TALK, WHACK JOB.

290
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,125
NOW, LET GO
OF MY FREAKING PIZZA.

291
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,208
- OH NO! THERE'S FRESHLY-BAKED
GOOEY CHEESE

292
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,041
PLUS TOPPINGS ALL OVER MY FACE!

293
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,708
- OH, CRAP. HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

294
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,041
- ( moaning )

295
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,583
- WELL, STILL VERY YUMMY.
- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

296
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,125
- ( sighs ) ALL I WANTED
WAS SOME OF SUWANO'S COOKING.

297
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,125
- HA, I'D ONLY HEARD
STORIES MYSELF.

298
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,583
- BUT YOU REALLY ARE LOCKED
IN A KNOCK-DOWN-DRAG-OUT,

299
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,416
AREN'T YOU?

300
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,541
LONG TIME, NO SEE, MOMIJI.

301
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:25,666
- WHAT THE... KUROYURI?
HI, I GUESS.

302
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,458
WHY ARE YOU IN THE HUMAN REALM?

303
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,750
- WHY, TO HELP YOU OUT WITH
YOUR SITUATION, OF COURSE.

304
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,958
- DO, HUH?

305
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,583
- YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL
FOR OUR FRIENDSHIP.

306
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,791
I RECOMMENDED MYSELF
TO YAMABUKI JUST FOR YOU, HONEY.

307
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,833
I SAID TO HER, I SAID,

308
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,791
"YAMABUKI, I CAN'T LEAVE
ONE OF MY VERY BEST FRIENDS

309
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,041
HANGING ON HER MISSION."

310
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,083
THEN I TOLD HER I WAS THE
ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD

311
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,500
WHO COULD RESCUE YOU RIGHT NOW.

312
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,041
LUCKILY, SHE DECIDED
IT WOULD BE BEST,

313
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,875
IF I GOT DOWN HERE IN A HURRY
SO WE COULD JOIN FORCES.

314
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,250
WITH THAT BEING SAID,

315
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,666
I SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH YOU, HONEY BUNNY.

316
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,500
HMM, ALTHOUGH, I DON'T
HAVE THE LEAST BIT OF INTEREST

317
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,041
IN HELPING YOU OUT.

318
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,541
AS SOON AS I CAN MANAGE,

319
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,875
I'M GOING TO STEAL THIS LITTLE
ICHIKO'S HAPPINESS ENERGY

320
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,375
AND GET MYSELF
ALL THE CREDIT FOR IT.

321
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,458
ONCE I DO, YAMABUKI IS MOST
CERTAINLY GOING TO SAY,

322
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:13,083
- THAT WAS FANTASTIC, KUROYURI.
- GIRL, YOU KNOW HOW I DO.

323
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,916
- BOOGER! YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A BOOGER WOMAN.

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,083
- ( laughing ) KUROYURI,
YOU'RE THE SAME AS EVER.

325
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,916
- ( panting )

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,791
- YOUR STRENGTH IS STARTING
TO DECLINE, ISN'T IT, HONEY?

327
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,291
- DON'T CALL ME "HONEY,"
I WILL KILL YOU.

328
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,333
DANG IT, SHE'S MAKING
A FOOL OUT OF ME.

329
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,666
HOW CAN SOMEBODY
THAT LAZY BE THAT CLEVER?

330
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,416
UGH, I CAN'T FOR THE
LIFE OF ME FIGURE OUT

331
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,250
WHY SHE'S ONE OF
YAMABUKI'S FAVORITES,

332
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,416
BUT I'M GONNA DRAG THIS GIRL
DOWN AND TAKE HER OUT.

333
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,291
- I SEE YOU'RE STILL
FOSTERING THAT RIVALRY

334
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,708
FOR NO REASON, AS USUAL.

335
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,750
WHAT A PAIN IN THE BUTT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

336
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,833
IT'S KINDA FUNNY.
I HAD NO IDEA

337
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,416
YOU WERE SO TERRIBLY
CONCERNED ABOUT ME.

338
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,166
I'M THANKFUL FOR YOUR HELP.

339
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,583
- ( chuckles )
NO PROBLEM.

340
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,250
WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

341
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,166
- MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

342
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,125
- I CAN DO ANYTHING
I SET MY MIND TO.

343
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,708
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE NEVER
SEEING THE POVERTY GOD AGAIN.

344
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,875
- UH, OH, IT'S THE POVERTY GOD.

345
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,708
- JINX, YOU BETTER
GET OUT OF MY KITCHEN!

346
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,791
- I'M A GOD NOT A JINX.

347
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,333
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?
OH MY GOODNESS,

348
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,750
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER
POVERTY GOD IS MAKING A VISIT.

349
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,833
- ( gasps )

350
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,375
- SO THIS IS ICHIKO SAKURA.

351
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,916
WELL, IF APPEARANCES
AREN'T DECEIVING,

352
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,291
SHE HASN'T HAD ANY
DIFFICULTY WITH YOU.

353
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,208
- AWESOME, WHO IS THIS JOKER?

354
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,833
WAIT, DON'T TELL ME
YOU HAVE FRIENDS.

355
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,083
- I DON'T KNOW.

356
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,166
I GUESS YOU CAN CALL HER
A FRIEND IF YOU WANT TO.

357
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,416
- HOWEVER...

358
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,166
- THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD
CALL AN ALLIANCE.

359
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,958
- Both: IT'S TIME TO SAY
YOUR PRAYERS.

360
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,625
- ( screams )

361
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,666
- ( screaming )

362
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,666
- THE HELL. YOU BROKE IT,
KUROYURI.

363
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,458
- ARGH! DAMN, MOMIJI.

364
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,416
- OOPSIE. I SORTA FORGOT THAT
THE TRIAL CAKE I WAS MAKING

365
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,916
WAS STILL IN THE OVEN.

366
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,541
- TO MAKE A CAKE EXPLODE,
YOU MUST BE INCREDIBLY TALENTED.

367
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,583
- AW, HELL, NO. GODA.

368
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,791
SO, THE TWO OF YOU ARE TRYING
TO MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME,

369
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,375
IS THAT RIGHT?

370
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,333
IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT IT, THEN
WHO CARES ABOUT ANYONE ELSE?

371
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,583
I'M TURNING YOU
TWISTED SISTERS TO ASH.

372
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,791
WOOT. INTRODUCING POVERTY GOD
ITEM, THE "LEMME GO, GRANDPA!"

373
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,416
ACTIVATED BY CALLING
HIM "POCHI,"

374
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,333
WHICH MAKES HIM MAD, CAUSING
HIM TO REDUCE EVERYTHING

375
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,958
IN THE AREA TO ASHES.

376
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,000
PEE-YEW, WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

377
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,916
- ARGH!

378
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,125
WAY TO GO. YOU DISTRACTED ME
AND MADE ME BURN THE STEW.

379
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,541
- THAT'S WAY
BEYOND BURNT, HONEY.

380
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,625
AND DON'T BE SO QUICK
TO THROW IT OUT,

381
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,208
IT MIGHT STILL BE SALVAGEABLE.

382
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,708
- DISAGREE.

383
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,583
- I THINK PEOPLE STARVING
IN HELL WOULD TURN THIS DOWN.

384
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S NOT
LIKE YOU CAN COOK EITHER.

385
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,583
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU CAN.

386
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,875
- DEFENSIVE ABOUT COOKING, MUCH?
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

387
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,000
WAIT, I KNOW. WHY DON'T
WE HAVE A COOK-OFF?

388
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,625
COME ON, IT'LL BE LIKE A REMATCH

389
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,916
FOR THAT UNFORTUNATE
TENNIS GAME.

390
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,916
YOUR HAPPINESS ENERGY WILL STILL
BE ON THE LINE, NATURALLY.

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,500
- YEAH, OKAY, FINE BY ME.

392
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,541
AND IF I WIN, YOU'LL HAVE
TO LEAVE THE HUMAN REALM

393
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,833
FOR REAL AND FOREVER
THIS TIME, NO CHEATING.

394
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,833
- ( laughs )
- HEY, YOU GUYS?

395
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,083
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

396
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,958
I WAS HALF-JOKING BECAUSE
OF YOUR SKILL SET.

397
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,041
I'M JUST CONFUSED WHERE
ALL YOUR RANDOM CONFIDENCE

398
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,416
IS COMING FROM.

399
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,708
- I GOT WHAT IT TAKES
WHEN IT'S GAME TIME, TRICK!

400
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,500
- DON'T IGNORE ME.
- GAME TIME, HOW CUTE.

401
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,375
THAT ONLY WORKS WHEN YOU
KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME,

402
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,750
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO COOK!

403
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,625
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP. SHUT UP!
HEY YOU, GREEN DRESS!

404
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,000
- WHAT?

405
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,541
- YOU GET TO BE THE JUDGE.
- WHAT? WHY ME? WHAT?

406
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,125
- BUT FIRST, TELL US WHAT
TYPE OF FOOD IS YOUR FAVORITE.

407
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,875
THAT WAY WE CAN MAKE A DISH
TO SUIT WHAT YOU'D LIKE BEST.

408
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,625
SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO EAT?

409
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,875
- UM, LET ME THINK.

410
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,625
MEAT AND TATERS?

411
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,458
- UGH, WHY ME?

412
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,583
- YOUR HATRED OF LOSING
IS WORKING AGAINST YOU, ICHIKO!

413
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,791
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH
HAPPINESS ENERGY YOU HAVE,

414
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,875
IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE YOU
A SKILLED COOK OVERNIGHT.

415
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,875
BUT COOKING IS MY SPECIALTY!

416
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,333
THIS CONTEST IS MINE.

417
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,333
THERE, I'M ALL DONE! AND
LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU!

418
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,291
- SO, UH, WHAT WAS YOURS? STEW?
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

419
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,416
- NO, I WOULD SAY NO.

420
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,625
- IT'S MEAT AND POTATO
STEW, HELLO.

421
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,416
- UM, I THINK YOU MEAN
BLACK CHARCOAL STEW, HELLO.

422
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,958
YOU KNOW, AT THE RIGHT ANGLE,

423
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,375
IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE A
SCREAMING FACE.

424
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,541
- QUIT YOUR YAPPING,
AND JUDGE IT.

425
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,958
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "JUDGE IT?"
IT'S NOT EVEN MEAT AND POTATOES!

426
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,791
I'M NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED WHAT
I'M LOOKING AT IS EVEN FOOD.

427
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,750
- OH, COME ON. WHETHER
YOU'RE JUDGING FOOD OR PEOPLE,

428
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,250
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SEE
THAT MATTERS, IT'S THE INSIDE.

429
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,500
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

430
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,666
YOU'RE BASICALLY A
FAILURE AS A HUMAN BEING?

431
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,750
- UGH, THIS IS GROSS.

432
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,583
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?
I'LL JUDGE IT.

433
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,166
AND THEN I CAN
JUST SAY SHE'S LOST.

434
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,458
- ( screaming )

435
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,791
HELP ME.
( screaming )

436
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,583
- ( screaming )

437
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,083
- ( machine gun firing )

438
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,375
- ( screaming loudly )

439
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,208
- IT TASTED SO BAD
SHE WENT BACK TO HEAVEN.

440
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,083
- WELL, THAT WAS RUDE OF HER.

441
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,250
- HOW DO WE KNOW WHO WON THE
CONTEST NOW? WHAT DO WE DO?

442
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,916
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
FINISH IT OFF.

443
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,458
- NO THANKS.
I'M NOT READY TO DIE, YET.

444
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,333
- HMM. I TRIED.

445
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,750
- WELCOME BACK.

446
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,000
I'D LIKE TO GET THAT DETAILED
REPORT YOU PROMISED ME.

447
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,666
WHAT IS YOUR ANALYSIS
OF MOMIJI'S CURRENT SITUATION?

448
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,458
IS THE HUMAN REALM
TOO MUCH FOR HER?

449
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,625
- TAKING OUT ICHIKO SAKURA
IS WAY MORE THAN I CAN HANDLE.

450
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,916
I THINK MOMIJI IS DOING
AN INCREDIBLE JOB!

451
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,416
- HOW CAN ONE GIRL
CAUSE SO MUCH DRAMA?

452
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,750
- I'LL TRY COOKING
AGAIN TOMORROW.

453
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,916
- WHY? I DON'T THINK THERE'S
