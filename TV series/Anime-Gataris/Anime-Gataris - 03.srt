1
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,416
[MINOA]
Why?

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,416
And we were so close, too!

3
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,041
What are you trying to pull?

4
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,000
You haven't even officially
registered your club with us.

5
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,416
If you want to hang out,
you can do it somewhere else.

6
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,458
[ERICA]
We have the members.

7
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,833
Make it official.

8
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,416
We have received
your application

9
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,666
and are evaluating its merits.

10
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,541
<i>If</i> we decide that the anime
club is a worthwhile addition

11
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,583
to our school, then you will
be informed accordingly.

12
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,083
You're a grownup, Mister Gomon,

13
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,000
what do you mean
you can't fix this?

14
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,625
Well, sorry!

15
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,333
The principal already okayed it,

16
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,875
and they're a more
important adult than me.

17
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,083
I should have known.

18
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,958
We can't count on you at all.

19
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,000
I told you I wasn't
gonna do anything.

20
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,250
[AURORA]
Doesn't sound good.

21
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,083
I think we're done for.

22
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,083
Although technically,
we never even got started.

23
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,041
I guess it's back to watching
anime at home alone again.

24
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,875
Hey. You're leaving?

25
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,625
Why don't we all go to Akiba?

26
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,875
Akiba?

27
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,208
Whoa! This is cool!

28
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,791
Hey! It's that movie
Alice lent me!

29
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, and look!

30
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,083
It's Miko's book
with a weird name!

31
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,333
Light novels!

32
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,416
Try to save some
excitement for the actual store.

33
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,833
I know it's your first time
here, but let's pace ourselves.

34
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,208
[ERICA]
Here's an idea.

35
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,583
We'll come back to
the big book store later.

36
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,875
You need a real lesson first!

37
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,250
[MINOA]
Ohh...! Ah...!

38
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,583
Cool.

39
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,541
I take it you've never
seen one of these before.

40
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,583
This is a cosplay shop
if you couldn't guess.

41
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,375
Wow.

42
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,500
It's like anime is real!

43
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,458
Or like, in 3D, I mean.

44
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,916
Although I would agree that you
can't find a store like this

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,166
anywhere but Akiba,

46
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,666
I'm still not sure
it's the first place

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,708
I would take someone.

48
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,750
Wait, where's Erica?

49
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,916
Oh, cute, I've seen
that outfit before!

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,708
But from where?

51
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,666
[ALICE]
Oh my gosh!

52
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,000
Nacchan from <i>Dub Tone</i> !

53
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,166
You're like an
angel in the flesh!

54
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,750
Sorry I kept you
waiting so long,

55
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,583
but I just had to
try this one out.

56
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,625
Wait, that's Erica?

57
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,083
Is it, really?

58
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,666
Uh-huh!

59
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,208
It was like you
completely transformed.

60
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,333
[MINOA]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

61
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,875
I have the opposite issue.

62
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,791
I don't recognize cosplayers
when I see them out of costume.

63
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,791
[KAI]
Cosplay problems, huh?

64
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,250
That part comes
with the territory.

65
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,333
The real cosplay problem is
when you want to coordinate

66
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,583
with your friends but
you're all into different series

67
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,416
or you all like
the same characters.

68
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,666
That's a pain.

69
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,041
Coordinate?

70
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,541
Doing a group of characters
from a particular show.

71
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,250
I've tried on so many
costumes, working that out.

72
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,333
Yeah. Like which ones?

73
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,291
It's more like which
one's didn't I try on?

74
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,250
We went through
that whole wall there.

75
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,416
That sounds fun!

76
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,958
[ERICA]
We practice poses, too.

77
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,875
That's as important
as the costume.

78
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,375
But watch the anime first,
so you're not a poser.

79
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,250
I wonder if I could
pull off cosplay too.

80
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,625
I got a big kick out of
your bunny girl cosplay,

81
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,333
so that's a good start at least.

82
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,083
[MINOA groans]

83
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,958
You know, we almost have enough
people for a <i>Toumabu</i> group.

84
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,208
You wanna try it?

85
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,166
Minocchi?

86
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,125
I don't think I--

87
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,125
Maybe <i>Nakimushi Saddle</i>
would be better.

88
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,416
I have a riding jersey
you could wear.

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,625
I'm not sure.

90
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,041
It's fine!

91
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,416
You just need to look cute.

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,416
I'll handle the wigs, poses,
makeup, and accessories.

93
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,833
As long as you don't expect
too much, I could try it.

94
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,875
[KAI] She's been sucked into
the swirling vortex known as:

95
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,000
Aoyama's Cosplay Universe.

96
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,708
Now you just need
to watch <i>Saddle</i> !

97
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:41,916
It's good!

98
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,416
[KAI] And now,
our next stop, Anime Soul!

99
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,791
This place truly is
a tower of dreams.

100
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,125
I prefer to think of it
as a Tower of Babel

101
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,250
where lust and vices flourish.

102
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,583
[chuckles]

103
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:58,083
Asagaya, are you prepared
to set foot into a new--

104
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:58,958
Anime magazines.

105
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,375
A whole gigantic pile of them!

106
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,166
Why are you guys
just standing out there?

107
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,750
[ALICE]
As you can see,

108
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,291
the first floor is magazines
and the second is new books.

109
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,208
The third floor
is for older titles.

110
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,875
Most light novels
are there, too.

111
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,250
[MINOA]
Doesn't sound too different

112
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,208
from a normal bookstore so far.

113
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,708
[ERICA]
Right. "So far."

114
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,750
But starting
at the fourth floor.

115
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,375
This place is anime merch only!

116
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,875
Oh, wow!

117
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,708
There's so much stuff!

118
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,541
Where do you even start?

119
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,625
These <i>Odopuri</i> badges
are simply to die for!

120
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,125
What's a "badge?"

121
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,666
These little buddies.

122
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,583
[MINOA]
Oh, like buttons.

123
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,500
Minocchi!

124
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,041
These <i>Micross Gamma</i>
keychains are cute!

125
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,958
Ahhh!

126
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,375
So you can put your favorite
character on your school bag?

127
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,583
[ERICA]
They call that a chibi.

128
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,208
It means they're small and cute.

129
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,333
And that you have
to buy them all.

130
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,708
[ERICA]
Well, of course!

131
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,291
How can you say no to
those poochy little cheeks?

132
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,541
[AURORA]
Cuteness... is justice!

133
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,916
[ALICE]
Agreed!

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,250
Oh, hey.

135
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,583
Where did Miko run off to?

136
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,625
[AURORA]
No Kaikai, either.

137
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,208
Guess they went up.

138
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,375
[MINOA] I'm headed up
anyway, I'll go see.

139
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,416
[MINOA]
Hey there, Kaikai?

140
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,708
So... having fun?

141
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,208
[shrieks]

142
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,291
[KAI] Wh-Wha-What
sorcery has allowed you

143
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,041
to approach me undetected?

144
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,958
You must be one of "them"!

145
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,166
Sorry.

146
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,291
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

147
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,875
What are you up to Kaikai?

148
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,458
Musashisakai Kai! Got it?

149
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,125
What are these dealies
you're looking at here?

150
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,708
She's cute.

151
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,333
It's Margedo Lee from
<i>Arina, the Scarlet Eye</i> !

152
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,041
Wielder of the infamous
book of evil, Grimoire!

153
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,208
Huh?

154
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,458
Oh neat. So that's
the book you had, right?

155
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,666
Ahh...

156
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,375
[sighs]

157
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,875
Ah!

158
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,625
But if she's just got a book
how's she s'posed to fight?

159
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,250
An excellent question
coming from a rookie!

160
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,083
This is one of the finest
features of battle anime!

161
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,125
[MINOA]
I'm listening.

162
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,916
Objects that aren't
normally weapons

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and skills that aren't
normally meant for combat

164
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,333
are utilized in creative
and destructive ways

165
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,625
in battle anime!

166
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,666
[MINOA]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

167
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,000
Other than books,
you might see...

168
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,333
Paper!

169
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,541
A coin.

170
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,958
Electricity.

171
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,541
Or cards!

172
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,666
Some characters even fight with
abstract concepts like words!

173
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,333
That doesn't make a lot of
sense, but it sure is unique.

174
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,041
You lack imagination,
filthy rookie!

175
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:35,791
Very well...

176
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,958
I shall enlighten you

177
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,541
on the virtues of
battle anime and, uh...

178
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,125
You're smiling at me.

179
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:42,958
You're not bored?

180
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,875
Huh?

181
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,291
I keep talking.

182
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,333
I feel like I'm
forcing this on you.

183
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,000
No, I love learning about it.

184
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,916
It's great!

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,625
You're a real
weirdo, aren't you?

186
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,625
[MIKO]
If I may...

187
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,750
[shrieks]

188
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,250
Where'd you come from?

189
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,875
Are you aware that Margedo Lee
has an extensive backstory

190
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,375
in the light novels that was
excluded from the anime?

191
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,750
She does?

192
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,083
It was so good, I nearly
stained my book with tears.

193
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,875
You have gazed upon secrets
that I've only dreamed of.

194
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,791
You have truly taken
a step into the other side.

195
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,458
Of course,

196
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,833
I'm a huge fan of <i>Arina</i>
<i>the Scarlet Eye</i> , after all.

197
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,666
The light novel at least.

198
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,375
[KAI]
Hmph. I must say,

199
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,041
you freshmen certainly
are fascinating creatures.

200
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:27,458
[chuckles]

201
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,208
[ERICA]
What did I miss?

202
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,375
I'm so happy those
two are hitting it off!

203
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,708
That's the magic
of Akiba, I guess!

204
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,250
[ERICA] Yeah, let's
just leave it at that.

205
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,041
[MINOA] Thanks for the tour,
that was really fun!

206
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,458
I know, right?

207
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,291
Whenever I'm bummed out,
this place cheers me right up.

208
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,333
Uh-huh.

209
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,625
Hey. We don't
need to get approval

210
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,375
from the school
to have an anime club.

211
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,541
That's a waste of time.

212
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,125
We'll hang out on our own.

213
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,916
[MINOA]
Uh, yeah, but...

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,125
Objection!

215
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,166
[gasps]

216
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,000
That's a double
dose of discontent!

217
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,500
Whoa, did I hit a nerve somehow?

218
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,250
Of course!

219
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,458
Have you forgotten <i>Elegant</i>
<i>Fish Cat's Club Room Life</i> ?

220
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,791
Well, they had a
club room, didn't they?

221
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,875
I'm still trying to
figure out that title.

222
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,916
It's a slice-of-life
show that focuses

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,625
on conversations in a club room.

224
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,041
I saw people online
cutting it after ep. three,

225
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,916
saying it put them to sleep.

226
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,916
A three ep. cut is too cruel!

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,500
What's wrong with having a chill
show every once in a while?

228
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,583
[KAI] Fine! Don't tell me,
tell the internet!

229
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,708
Three-cut-what?

230
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,125
They're talking about
dropping an anime

231
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,583
after the third episode.

232
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,041
A lot of people do that when
they're bored with a show.

233
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,291
Is there something
special about ep. three?

234
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,916
Sometimes the
budget drops a bit,

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,708
but a lot of anime
feature a twist

236
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,750
or a turning point
in the third ep.

237
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,708
You start off thinking it's
just a normal magical girl show,

238
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,958
and then suddenly,
a head gets torn off.

239
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,375
They practice their songs,

240
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,958
work on their costumes and
make their big idol debut.

241
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,458
Only no one bothers
to come see the show.

242
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,000
Huh?!

243
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,750
It's a technique
to shock the audience

244
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,916
and keep them watching
until the end of the series.

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,125
Wondering what crazy nonsense
might sneak up on them next!

246
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,666
[ERICA]
Anyway,

247
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,458
if the audience can make it
over the three episode hurdle,

248
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,166
there's a good chance they'll
stick with the entire series.

249
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,791
But unfortunately,
a lot of viewers will say,

250
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,500
"it's not my thing," and
give up early in the season.

251
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,833
But that's not fair!

252
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,208
Episode three is when
the cast and the backstory

253
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,458
have all been introduced,

254
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,625
so the series can really
start to move forward!

255
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,750
The characters build more
interesting relationships

256
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,458
and the dialogue between
them plays out in fun ways!

257
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,625
It's foolish to give up

258
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,541
and put three episodes
of setup to waste!

259
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,500
Right?

260
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,875
You're quite the pair.

261
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,458
Huh?

262
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,875
At this rate, our club is
going to get the three ep. cut

263
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,416
from the student council.

264
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,125
With the state we're in, it's
a zero ep. cut. Technically.

265
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,750
Back to what
I was saying earlier,

266
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,250
one of the best parts of battle
anime is when the characters

267
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,250
unleash their hidden powers.

268
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,750
[MINOA]
Uh-huh?

269
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,708
For example, removing
a bracelet from their wrist,

270
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,958
taking off an eyepatch--

271
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,708
unsealing the
forbidden magic within.

272
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,041
The catharsis is
pure bliss, indeed!

273
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:00,875
Ohh...!

274
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,541
As for my own hidden power.

275
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,458
You have hidden
powers too, Kaikai?

276
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,625
Call me Kai!

277
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,541
When I remove
this Witlim Opticum,

278
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,375
handed down to me from
sages of generations past,

279
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,125
the power of my evil eye will
be released and the flames

280
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,000
of retribution shall
rain down from the sky!

281
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,416
[laughs]

282
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,916
[sighs]

283
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,875
Hey, we're here!

284
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,333
Tell me more about
anime stuff sometime, okay?

285
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,916
Bye!

286
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,500
[MINOA]
I hate to split up like this.

287
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:51,333
If we had a club room, we could
sit around and talk for hours.

288
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,875
[ALICE] Now the student council
is pushing to abolish the club!

289
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,583
What is their deal?

290
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:24,000
Can't you tell them anime
isn't hurting anybody, please?

291
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,333
Actually, I'm the one who
suggested this whole meeting.

292
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,166
This forces the
student body to vote on

293
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,250
if the club is
worth anything or not.

294
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,458
If you win, then the council has
no choice but to back off.

295
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,916
Of course, you'll get
your club room back, too.

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,250
And if we don't win the vote?

297
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,375
Shut it down!

298
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,833
[moans]

299
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,208
That's all the student council
was willing to agree to,

300
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,125
so take it or leave it.

301
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,375
You asked me to do something,

302
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,750
and this was the best
I could come up with.

303
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,000
[MINOA]
This sucks!

304
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,541
[sighs]

305
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,291
At this rate, we won't get our
anime club this year either.

306
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,375
[KAI] And what do you
plan to do about it?

307
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,125
Nothing. But if the freshman
still want to keep at it,

308
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,333
I'll have their backs.

309
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,500
[KAI] Don't have
any fight in you, huh?

310
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,875
Come on.

311
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,333
What's wrong with doing
the club outside of school?

312
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,708
You didn't say it,

313
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,916
but I bet you were thinking
the exact same thing.

314
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,916
[ALICE] Erica already said
she's not making the speech.

315
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,541
[MIKO sighs]
No surprise,

316
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,666
since she's content with getting
together outside of school.

317
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,125
I know.

318
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,708
But I don't want to give up.

319
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:35,833
We should have a club room where
we can talk forever and ever.

320
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,541
I know we can live without it,

321
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,458
but I still want a place we
can call our own, you know?

322
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,041
Minoa.

323
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,666
[MINOA] You'll fight with me to
get our club room back, right?

324
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,833
We can do this! No problem!

325
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,125
Yes. I'll write you
the perfect speech.

326
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,166
I'm certain you
can handle the rest.

327
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,291
[MINOA]
Mm-hmm.

328
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,166
Huh?

329
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,625
We're here for you.

330
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,250
There's no need to be nervous.

331
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,750
The future of
our club is shaky,

332
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,416
but I'm confident leaving
it in your capable hands.

333
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,916
Oh. Uh.

334
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,291
We'll be here cheering
for you every inch of the way!

335
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,583
Watch this anime tonight.
It has my favorite speech in it.

336
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,875
You'll be inspired, I'm sure.

337
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,250
'Kay.

338
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,708
Huh?! Don't leave me!

339
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,833
[ALICE]
I'll write the best speech

340
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,500
the world has ever witnessed!

341
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,375
[MIKO]
We will surely be victorious.

342
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,833
Why are you so confident?

343
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:23,666
[MISTER KITTY]
You look rough.

344
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,416
Huh?

345
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,916
Mister Kitty, help!

346
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,833
Everyone has too
much faith in me!

347
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,250
[MISTER KITTY]
Here.

348
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,541
Huh?

349
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,458
[MISTER KITTY]
A good luck charm.

350
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,083
Take it.

351
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,083
A sardine?

352
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,083
Good luck, samurai girl.

353
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,791
[MISTER KITTY]
I always wanted to say that.

354
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,750
[TSUBAKI] The purpose
of any extracurricular activity

355
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,916
at this academy is
to enrich school life,

356
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,250
to improve relationships
between students,

357
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,458
and ultimately to create
something meaningful

358
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,708
to the world.

359
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,291
But the anime club?

360
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,416
They only want
to watch cartoons!

361
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,708
Was she just looking for
an excuse to trash-talk anime?

362
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,916
[ERICA] It's not like
she's wrong, exactly.

363
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,291
From the school's perspective,

364
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,750
an anime club wouldn't
contribute that much.

365
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,375
You agree with her?

366
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,541
Not quite. I can't say
what anime is really worth,

367
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,666
but that chick has
no right to, either.

368
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,833
[TSUBAKI]
...no place here.

369
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,958
It becomes a hindrance
to our education.

370
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:30,041
Abolishment of the anime club
is the obvious course of action.

371
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,250
[ANNOUNCER] Now, Minoa
Asagaya from the anime club

372
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,916
will make her speech.

373
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,833
Uh, right!

374
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,291
Are you guys sure
she'll be okay up there?

375
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,791
The speech is perfect.

376
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,166
There is no way
this could go wrong.

377
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,583
We've lost a club room
to our noble glorious cause,

378
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,875
but does this
foreshadow our defeat?

379
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,541
No, it is but a new beginning!

380
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,541
Huh?

381
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,125
Alice said this would
get big cheers!

382
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,375
Did I mess it up?

383
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,041
You really thought
this would work?

384
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,041
There's something
wrong with our generation

385
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,166
if they don't respond
to this work of genius!

386
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,416
It is a classic!

387
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,625
You're a lost cause.

388
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,875
Uh... Moving on.

389
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,125
We of the anime club
seek to research anime

390
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,000
from an enlightened perspective.

391
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,500
Well not so much
researching as just watching.

392
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,916
And then we like,
talk about it...

393
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,208
[MALE STUDENT]
Huh? This is a joke, right?

394
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,708
[FEMALE STUDENT]
They just want to hang out.

395
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,208
[MALE STUDENT]
They don't need a club.

396
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,208
[MINOA] I, um, I actually
don't know anything about anime.

397
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:36,041
So for me, the club is a
way to, uh, no, never mind.

398
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,083
I mean, anime is,
um... It's a...

399
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,750
[gasps]

400
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,625
[KAI] When I remove this Witlim
Opticum, handed down to me

401
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,583
from sages of generations past,

402
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,125
the power of my evil eye will
be released and the flames

403
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,875
of retribution shall
rain down from the sky!

404
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:12,125
I love when an anime
has crazy fight scenes!

405
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,583
It's the best!

406
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,500
Why, you ask?

407
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,083
I could give you many answers.

408
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,416
In battle anime, even
characters who seem weak,

409
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,083
with abilities
ill-suited for combat,

410
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,250
turn their talents
into deadly weapons!

411
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,083
Engaging in struggles
impossible in reality,

412
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,708
they raze entire
buildings in their wake!

413
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,833
It is magnificent!

414
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,625
We're done!

415
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,208
He's wasting our time.

416
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,583
Let's vote.

417
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,666
No, let's abolish the anime
club without a vote...

418
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,666
You will let me
finish my speech!

419
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,833
But the real best part
of any battle anime.

420
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,875
Well...

421
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,583
[MINOA]
That's what he said before.

422
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,625
He never finished!

423
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:54,250
The heroes, always side
with the weakest of us,

424
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,166
and overturn the tyranny
of the strong and wicked.

425
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,166
They hear the
voices of the voiceless.

426
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,458
They become power
for the powerless.

427
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,458
And that is the true
essence of battle anime!

428
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,875
It's all make-believe?
It's childish?

429
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,291
Laugh if you must but
anime has meaning to me.

430
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,125
It has taught me
the value of justice,

431
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,708
of perseverance and friendship!

432
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,500
What gives the
student council the right

433
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,708
to declare something
like that "worthless"?

434
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,416
They have no psychic powers.

435
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,458
They can't command magic.

436
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,708
They're just bullies.

437
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,375
Just, episode villains!

438
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,125
So, you can side
with them if you want to

439
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,958
and end the anime club
out of ignorance

440
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,958
or whatever excuse you make.

441
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,458
But those are the actions of
a bit character, not a hero!

442
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,625
You should strive to make
decisions for yourself,

443
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,916
so you can at least be the
main character in your own life!

444
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,208
That's what I do!

445
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,583
Because it's right and because
that's what anime taught me.

446
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,833
Now, I'm done!

447
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:12,791
[applause]

448
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,291
Huh?

449
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,375
You really can't see a thing
without your glasses on,

450
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,208
can you, Kaikai?

451
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,791
It's Kai.

452
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,666
And that's good, since
I couldn't see the crowd.

453
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,833
[MINOA] We won about
half of the male vote

454
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,291
but the female
vote really seemed

455
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,916
to swing things in our favor.

456
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,666
So now we have a club
and a club room.

457
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,750
[ERICA]
All right.

458
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,541
That's that.

459
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,583
It's happening. Again.

460
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,875
[ALICE]
It was hard fought,

461
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,916
but it really is nice to
have a place of our own!

462
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,375
[MIKO]
So relaxing.

463
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,791
[KAI] All opposition falters
before my god-like skills

464
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,791
when my power is unleashed!

465
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,750
Feel free to
worship me if you like!

466
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,333
[laughs]

467
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,666
[ERICA]
Hey, Mister Gomon.

468
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,666
Did you know things
would turn out this way?

469
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,375
[MASATO] It's more like,
the student council

470
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,791
would've shut you down sooner

471
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,833
or later if you
couldn't pull this off.

472
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,208
Apparently, there's a long
line of kids who have tried

473
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,708
to set up anime clubs

474
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,458
and the student council tears
them to pieces every time.

475
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,166
What does it matter to them?

476
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,833
Just a rumor. I don't know.

477
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,500
You like that one, too?

478
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:33,791
[MINOA]
Finally.

479
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,916
We're like a real club.

480
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,958
Your lecture on the
virtues of battle anime

481
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,333
has only just begun.

482
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,708
And you can dig even deeper
with the light novels.

483
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:42,958
Uh.

484
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,500
This is the beginning
of a long training arc!

485
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,708
Uh-oh.

486
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,041
In that case, I know
exactly what you need!

487
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,750
I can't watch all of these!

488
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't have the time!

489
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,750
That's not true at all, Minoa!

490
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,500
We have a room, right?

491
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,166
We can watch all these together,

492
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,833
then quiz you on them
when we're done!

493
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,125
[shrieks]

494
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,708
[ERICA] We're still
doing cosplay, right?

495
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,125
[MINOA]
Not you too!

496
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,041
Some folks drop a show
at the first happy ending

497
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,958
and miss out on
a crazy plot twist!

498
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,458
Our next episode is
club room explosion.

499
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,000
That sound foreboding
enough for you?
