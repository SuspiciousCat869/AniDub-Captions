00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,791
[MINOA]
No, why did I go back to sleep?

3
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,375
[TV HOST] Its popularity's
really been skyrocketing lately!

00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,666
They say it's been
great for their economy!

5
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,666
All of sudden, the town
is swimming with tourists.

6
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,625
Morning!

7
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,333
Good morning, Minoa.

8
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,041
[MINOA] Ugh, guys,
why didn't you wake me up?

9
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,916
[MAYA] I did wake you up,
and then you were like.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,958
"Sir! Roger that, sir!

11
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,291
Private Asagaya Minoa,

12
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,791
wide awake and reporting
for morning duty, sir!"

13
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,166
Uhh? Uh...

14
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,375
Well, okay then!

15
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,833
Just like yesterday,
and the day before, too!

16
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:12,041
I do that every time,
and you never wake me up twice?

17
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,291
Shouldn't you have
already gone to school Maya?

18
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,958
Nah, I don't
have practice today.

19
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,041
Mii, isn't it about time
you join a club, too?

20
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,583
Not trying to pick on you, Mom,

21
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,375
but just 'cause
I have a sporty big sister

22
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,500
doesn't mean it
runs in the family.

23
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,250
Well, what about an
arts club or a hobby club?

24
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,750
Guess nothing really
jumped out at me.

25
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,458
[MAYA]
There's an idea.

26
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,125
I mean, even when
you were growing up,

27
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,625
you liked playing inside
instead of outside, right?

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,291
[MINOA]
That reminds me.

29
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,583
Was there some anime
I was into when I was little?

30
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,375
There were a few you liked.

31
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,083
Y'know, <i>Haritaro</i> and <i>Dezumon</i> .

32
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,250
And we used to watch <i>PreFae</i>
together a lot, didn't we?

33
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,750
Thank you for breakfast!

34
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,416
<i>PreFae</i> , huh?

35
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,166
That's not the one.

36
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,666
'Kay, I'm off!

Minoa, let's walk together!

38
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,583
I'm gonna be late, Sorry!

00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,791

Good morning!

40
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,125
Let me ride on back!

41
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,458
[ERICA]
No way. Double riding's illegal.

42
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,708
Let's go, Sakaneko!

43
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,291
Morning, you guys!

44
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,333
Good morning!

45
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,875
What's up, Minocchi?

46
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,125
[MINOA]
Hi Koenji.

47
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,958
Hello to you too.

48
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,708
What book is that?

49
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,041
Oh, jeez.

50
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,250
That is, uh, some name.

51
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,750
<i>A Report on</i>

<i>Depressing Chronicles of Me</i>

53
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,416
<i>and a Certain Eccentric</i>
<i>Childhood Friend</i> , you mean?

54
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,916
Wow, that sounds complicated.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,666
Oh, no, not in the least.

56
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,750
It's mostly about wasting time.

57
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,750
The protagonist is
pathologically tardy for one.

58
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,416
Well, you have fun with that!

59
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,791

Good day to you.

61
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,250
She is so cute.

62
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,833
I like how she's snobby,
but not too snobby.

63
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,500
Good morning, Kamiigusa.

64
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,416
[ALICE]
That it is.

65
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,375
Good morning, Minoa!

66
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,166
[MINOA]
Hey there.

67
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,166
Uh... Huh?

68
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,958
Why are you staring
at Kamiigusa?

69
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,416
Ah! Oops.

70
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,750
I was just thinking I'd
like to talk to her more,

71
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,666
but she's a little intimidating.

72
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,625
[YUI]
Hmm...

73
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,750
I agree.

74
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,375
Also, from what I hear.

75
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,375
[ALICE]
Sebasu--!

76
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,250
Excellent work.

77
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,125
The girl's super wealthy.

78
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,250
Like stupid wealthy.

79
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,333
[MINOA]
Mhmm.

80
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,416
I'm kind of getting
that impression.

81
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,416
Oh! I saw you practicing today!

82
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,625
[chuckles]

83
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,625
I can't improve my time.

84
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,916
By the way, what made
you join the track club

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,416
in the first place?

86
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,541
I was watching
the Olympics on TV

87
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,125
back when I was in grade school,

88
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,416
and I thought all the women
competing were super cool.

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,041
I doubt I'll ever be that fast,
but it's worth a try, right?

90
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,250
Huh...

91
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,916
It made an impression
when you were a kid?

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,083
[YUI] Is there something
like that for you?

93
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,291
[MINOA] Uh... Well, do you
watch any anime, Yui?

94
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,208
[YUI]
Anime?

95
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,333
No, not really. Why?

96
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,791
Bummer.

97
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,583
Was there a show that like,
totally changed your life?

98
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,458
I don't know about that.

99
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,291
But there's one
I'm curious about.

100
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,166
[YUI]
Hmm...

101
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,500
Yeah? What's it called?

102
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,333
[MINOA]
That's the problem.

103
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,291
I can't remember the name.

104
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,250
Okay dokey, that's the bell.

105
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,000
Good morning, everyone!

106
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,791
[CLASS]
Good morning.

107
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,916
So... the semester
started almost a month ago.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,250
How is school?

109
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,125
Tell me you love it!

110
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,375
Oh no!

111
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,333
You're going to make me cry!

112
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,208
You like your homeroom
teacher at least, don't you?

113
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,250
Mister Roppongi
sure is, uh, unique.

114
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,041
He's like that at practice, too.

115
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,875
I've gotten used to it.

116
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,000
[yawns]

117
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,416
[ANNOUNCER] Mister Gomon,
you have a phone call.

118
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Please come to the staff office.

119
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,791
You brought a lunchbox,

120
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,958
and you're still buying more
food on top of all that?

121
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,750
Running track burns
a lot of calories, obviously!

122
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,083
Now that you mention it,

123
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,541
my sister also eats a lot
when she's in training

124
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,208
[ALICE]
Asagaya?

125
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,166
Uh. Uh-huh?

126
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,000
H-Hi Kamiigusa.

127
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,250
Does she always
sparkle like that or what?

128
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,208
May I have a word?

129
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,416
With me?

130
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,125
[ALICE]
Yes.

131
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,750
But not immediately.

132
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,541
If you please,
can we meet after school?

133
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,375
I guess that's ok.

134
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,416
I'll await your arrival
in the art room show hall.

135
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,416
I request that
you come there alone.

136
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,250
Yes, of course,
but what are we...?

137
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,458
Just be there.

138
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,833
Can you give me a hint at least?

139
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,625
You'll find out.

140
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,958
Are they gonna fight?

141
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,750
That girl is so gonna get it.

142
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,833
Oh boy.

143
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,208
I must've ticked
her off somehow.

144
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,000
Good luck!

145
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,583
There's a
70% chance this will be

146
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:02,083
on the test, depending
on my mood that day.

147
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,750
[TORU]
That's it for today!

148
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,958
Oh, class rep?
Could you help me real fast?

149
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,333
You sure you don't need me?

150
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,375
It's fine.

151
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,166
You have track
practice after all.

152
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,375
[YUI]
Yeah, but--

153
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,500
Besides, she did ask
me to meet her alone.

154
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,458
[gasps]

155
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,375
Careful, you dropped your book.

lest the grimoire curse thee!

157

I'm sorry, but what?

158
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,750
Abracadabra, pasta la vista.

159
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,083
There, I've summoned a barrier.

160
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,833
It's safe to touch.

[MINOA]
Uhm, cool?

Ah, Danke Mädchen

Too quiet.

165
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,791
I could die,
and no one would know.

166
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,333
[ALICE] That's precisely
why I chose this location.

167
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,291
For privacy.

168
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,541
[MINOA]
We're just gonna talk, right?

169
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,000
[ALICE]
Answer my questions honestly,

170
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,375
and we'll see what happens.

171
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,583
Understand?

172
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,875
[ALICE]
Minoa Asagaya.

173
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,708
Uhm, that's me.

174
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,375
Do you like anime?

175
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,250
What? Huh?

176
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,125
[ALICE]
Well? Do you?

177
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,875
[MINOA]
Uhh... Anime?

178
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,166
In class, you were asking Obata
if she watches anime, right?

179
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,041
Oh, uh, yeah?

180
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,833
[ALICE] What are you
following this season?

181
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,333
This season?

182
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,458
[ALICE] I like <i>Hero School</i>
and <i>Ru: Zero</i> .

183
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,708
Oh, and the protagonist
in <i>Shikabari</i> is a real dear!

184
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,250
The <i>Time Travel</i>
<i>Shounen O.P.</i> is so cool!

185
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,708
Like when Jun does
that classy fence jump.

186
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,666
A real deer huh?

187
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,708
You must watch
different genres than me.

188
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,250
Slice of life, maybe?

189
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,958
That's not, quite my style.

190
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,375
[MINOA]
I'm so lost.

191
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,875
This season is nothing
but shonen fight stuff.

192
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:34,500
Except...

193
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,166
Oh, wait!

194
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,416
<i>Tamukeda</i> and <i>Toramiko</i>
are slice-of-life, aren't they?

195
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,750
Or <i>Bakusou</i> ?

196
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,375
No that's more about the
motorcycles than anything.

197
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,916
I do like some shows
about delinquents, though.

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,791
They're a bit old, but have
you seen <i>Kyou Kara Sessha Wa</i> ?

199
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,583
Or <i>Angel Monogatari</i> ?

200
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,708
Wait, those are OVAs.

201
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,625
They're doing tons of
remakes lately, though.

202
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,541
I wonder if they'll
make a <i>Bad Luck</i> TV series,

203
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,083
or <i>Dance-chimau Yatsu</i> ?

204
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,625
Huh?!

205
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,833
You don't like
slice-of-life, either?

206
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:01,625
Ah-ha!

207
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,833
Otome shows?

208
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,666
Or am I way off and
you're into mecha shows?

209
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,166
You do like anime,
or did I mishear what you said?

210
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,875
No, yeah, I definitely
watched anime as a kid.

211
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,625
<i>Gachiemon</i> , maybe?

212
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,250
<i>Gachiemon</i> !

213
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,291
<i>Nobue</i> ? <i>Karashi</i> ?
Which movie's your favorite?

214
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,458
I like <i>Chijipara Suikoden</i> .

215
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,791
A lot of people online
like the 70s version,

216
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,041
but I thought the character
designs were way cuter

217
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,291
in the 2000s remake.

218
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,416
I'm not a purist when
it comes to that stuff.

219
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,000
You lost me at " <i>Nobue</i> ."

220
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,875
[sighs]

221
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,958
Forget everything that
I said just now.

222
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,291
[MINOA] I think it's cool
that you like anime!

223
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,333
I just really didn't
think you were the type.

224
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,666
Are you trying
to tease me, or what?

225
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,625
No way! In fact, I'm jealous.

226
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,583
I wish I had a passion
for something like that!

227
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,291
And I'm happy, too.

228
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,500
I thought you were kinda
hard to approach, but now,

229
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,125
it's like, we could be friends,

230
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,500
even if we don't have anything
in common with each other.

231
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,041
We don't have anything, do we?

232
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,250
If I'd known you
were so friendly,

233
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,250
I would've talked
to you a long time ago!

234
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,166
What a pity, then.

235
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,333
[MINOA] Wait! There is one
anime I really wanna talk about.

236
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,666
One I haven't been able
to get out of my head!

237
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,875
I saw it, back when I was a kid,

238
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,958
but I can't remember the
name of the show or anything.

239
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,041
You seem to know a
whole bunch about anime.

240
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,416
Maybe you might know what it is?

241
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,916
[sighs]

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,166
Could you describe a scene?

243
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,000
A robot rises up.

244
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,500
A girl transforms and sings.

245
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,583
Then, there's little
angels in the sky!

246
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,166
[ALICE]
That's it?

247
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,416
All I got.

248
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,541
But, it's weird.

249
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,250
I can't stop dreaming about it.

250
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,958
I feel like it really
important to me!

251
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:55,958
Huh. Robot, singing,
little angels in the sky...

252
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,625
It might be the final ep.
of <i>Espoir no Shoujo Kaiji</i> .

253
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,083
Nuh-uh.

254
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,541
<i>A Dog of Decadence</i> ?

255
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,708
That had little
angels in the sky.

256
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,083
The ending was so sad!

257
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,500
I cried my little eyes out!

258
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,250
[MINOA]
That's not it.

259
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,625
[ALICE]
<i>Previous Genesis Everstrike</i> ?

260
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,416
Or <i>Cinnamon Roll Z</i> ?

261
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,666
Or <i>Autumn Wars</i> ?

262
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,916
Uh... Don't think that's it.

263
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And you're sure it was an anime?

264
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,875
Absolutely.

265
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,458
I don't have enough
details to work with here.

266
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,625
Surely you can muster up
something else from your memory.

267
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,916
Maybe it got mixed up
in my head somehow.

268
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,208
Forgive me.

269
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,500
I can't help you.

270
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,416
Don't say that.

271
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,458
This is my fault.

272
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,166
I don't know
anything about anime.

273
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,916
Sorry!

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,291
I'll survive.

275
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,625
I know what to do!
We just need to go to a place

276
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,458
where there's a
bunch of anime fans!

277
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,916
Huh?

278
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,500
Wait, where are you taking me?

279
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,166
We're checking
out the club rooms!

280
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,958
There's gotta be an anime club!

281
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,916
Let's see, fine arts, world
history, classic literature.

282
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,125
Provincial art?

283
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,208
Tea?

284
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,791
Listen, there's no point.

285
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,375
Give it up already. Hmm...

286
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,041
Don't you wanna talk to
other people about anime?

287
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,791
You seemed like you were
having a good time talking

288
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,125
to me about it!

289
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,166
Maybe, but...

290
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,458
There's the
classical music club.

291
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,250
Pop music club.

292
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,666
What is "NJ"? Oh!

293
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,666
I found it!

294
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,166
The anime club!

295
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,125
Asagaya, that's not--

296
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,083
[MINOA]
Come on! Don't be shy!

297
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,833
Hello everybody!

298
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,166
We don't have an anime club
at least not an active one.

299
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,250
[MINOA]
Huh?

300
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,500
I looked it up,
the first day of school.

301
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,875
I should've said.

302
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:48,958
I see.

303
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,583
Maybe they all graduated.

304
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,458
I wonder why there's
still a room, though.

305
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,833
Is something wrong?

306
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,291
[ALICE]
This is a treasure!

307
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,875
Look! It's issue 1
of <i>Anime Shangri-La</i> !

308
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,833
Is that one of those
anime magazines

309
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,375
[ALICE]
I can't believe it's real!

310
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,083
[MINOA]
Anime really is amazing.

311
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,083
[ALICE]
Huh?

312
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,083
I mean.

313
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,958
You're definitely geeking out!

314
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,583
Normally you're pretty quiet.

315
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,791
Are you trying to tease me?

316
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,625
If there was an anime club,
you could do this all the time!

317
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,875
Perhaps, but there isn't,
as you've surely noticed.

318
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,583
Then start one up yourself!

319
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,708
You could do it easy!

320
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,708
And how exactly?

321
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,333
By recruiting new
members, obviously!

322
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,458
We go to a pretty big school.

323
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,208
There's all kinds
of students here.

324
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,333
There's no way you're
the only anime fan!

325
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,250
You just need
to find the other ones!

326
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,083
I suppose that might be true.

327
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,791
You won't know until you try!

328
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,125
I'll be happy to help
you out, so don't worry!

329
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,250
I couldn't impose.

330
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,583
It's fine!

331
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,166
I like seeing your passion
for anime, It's so cute!

332
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,958
Are you teasing me again?

333
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,083
I'm saying you're awesome.

334
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,291
You got this!

335
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,333
Thank you.

336
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,041
I just hope
you're right about me.

337
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,750
Of course, I am!

338
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,958
Okay! I'll do it!

339
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,375
First, we have to recruit
at least six members!

340
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,708
Then we can make our submission
to the student committee.

341
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,208
Six people is nothing!

342
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,125
You'll find them no problem.

343
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,541
That I shall.

344
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,750
Why, I've found
one of them already.

345
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,750
Huh?

346
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,666
Counting me and you.

347
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,916
I only need four!

348
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,458
Well, not quite.

349
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,666
I'm more than happy
to help you find people,

350
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,875
but I don't know about--

351
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,541
We'll put up fliers
to recruit people

352
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,125
first thing tomorrow morning!

353
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,541
You would want me?

354
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,041
I've hardly watched any anime,

355
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,416
I'm not sure that I'd
fit in to an anime club?

356
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,416
[ALICE]
Never fear.

357
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,416
I shall lend you a small
selection of beginners titles

358
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,625
from my humble library.

359
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,125
"Small," huh?

360
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,583
Start with the movies,
since they won't take as long.

361
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,375
<i>The Girl Who Slept Through Time</i>
and <i>Replica</i> are good ones.

362
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,958
[MINOA] This is getting
way too complicated.

363
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,041
Before that,
we should clean this dump.

364
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,375
That door must lead
to a storage room.

365
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,750
Wait here, I'll go to the office
and see if they have the key.

366
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,083
[MINOA]
Huh? Mm.

367
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,416
[gasps]
What?

368
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,541
[gasps]
Hang on. Dangit!

369
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,750
There we go!

370
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,791
What's up with this cat?

371
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,500
A red beret?

372
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,541
I asked the student council,

373
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,125
but they said they
don't have a key.

374
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,875
Wait, how did you open it?

375
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,291
[MINOA]
It opened on its own.

376
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,458
Huh. Maybe it was just jammed

377
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,791
and I didn't
push it hard enough.

378
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,291
A cat?

379
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,125
It was in the closet somehow.

380
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,666
Wonder if it was trapped.

381
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,458
It likely crawled
in through an air duct

382
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,541
and couldn't make
it back outside.

383
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,041
Guess so.

384
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,041
Here, kitty kitty,
come here you!

385
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,458
I know how to tame
the savage beast!

386
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,541
The room is presentable.

387
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,833
Why don't we call it a day?

388
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,625
You have anime
homework to attend to.

389
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,708
[chuckles]

390
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,666
Let's go.

391
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,791
Bye, hungry kitty!

392
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,000
All right.

393
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,916
The real battle starts tomorrow.

394
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,583
We'll start handing out
fliers at eight AM sharp.

395
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,916
Don't be late!

396
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,500
Okay, but just so we're
totally clear on this.

397
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,333
Once we're done--

398
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,166
[ALICE]
You're joining.

399
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,250
I figured.

400
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,625
Huh? What the?

401
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,416
That super gigantic car
is just for you?

402
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,750
But, it's so big!

403
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,666
See you bright and early!

404
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,958
Uh. Early.

405
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,791
Yeah, of course!

406
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,666
[ALICE]
Asagaya.

407
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,833
Huh?

408
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,833
Let's be friends.

409
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,791
And thank you.

410
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,875
My pleasure.

411
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,750
Now, good day.

412
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,875
Just wait!

413
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,750
We'll find tons of anime fans!

414
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,250
I'm certain we will.

415
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,375
Those of the same mind as us
will surely heed our call.

416
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,791
Ciao.

417
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,791
[MINOA] So, we're "of the
same mind" already, are we?

418
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,750
Okay, whatever.

419
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,625
I wonder what kind
of people we'll meet.

420
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,916
They didn't sell out.
It was totally worth the trip!

421
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,291
[FEMALE STUDENT D]
Hey, Nakano!

422
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,958
[GIRLS]
Bye!

423
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,416
Bye-bye.

424
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,916
That's some breeze!

425
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,208
Oh, jeez it's gone!

426
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,416
No!

427
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,875
I'm so dumb!

428
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,416
I must've left it
back in the club room.

429
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,875
Not here, either.

430
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,625
Where'd I put that stupid phone?

431
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,958
Ow!

432
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,041
[MISTER KITTY] So, you're
the "clumsy girl" type.

433
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,000
Huh?! Who's there?

434
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,166
This what you're
lookin' for, kiddo?

435
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,458
It can talk.

436
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,208
A talking kitty

437
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,958
Remakes, huh?

438
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,541
Why don't you come up
with something new instead?

439
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:45,166
Anyway, next time, we'll
see who called on the phone.

440
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,666
So, stick around, punk!
