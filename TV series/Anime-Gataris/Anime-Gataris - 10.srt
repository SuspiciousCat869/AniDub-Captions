1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,833
At any rate,
the club is now defunct.

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,458
[MINOA]
Nakano, why?

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:14,791
What is this?

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,041
What the hell, Aurora?

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,666
You're our friend!

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,083
Do me a favor.

7
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,708
Don't call me
that name ever again.

8
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,041
I gave the club room keys
back to the student council.

9
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,833
Then it's over.

10
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:10,666
Sorry.

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,083
This mess is my fault.

12
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,958
After all, I was the president,
I should've stopped him.

13
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:15,958
No way.

14
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,666
We couldn't have
anticipated this.

15
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,500
Damn it!

16
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:19,666
Aurora!

17
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,000
I should have seen
the wickedness hidden

18
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,791
behind your handsome face!

19
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,291
I failed!

20
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,916
And it's all gone,
just like that.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,333
Everything was going so well
after the school festival, too.

22
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,041
You know, even if we lost this
house, we'd still be a family.

23
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,833
Wait, are we losing the house?

24
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,500
[gasps]
Don't tell me.

25
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,166
You lost your job again?

26
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,708
Huh? Again?

27
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,125
[SHUGO]
It's an analogy!

28
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:48,958
[sighs]

29
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,625
Okay, so what's your point?

30
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,666
It isn't our home
that makes us a family,

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,833
but the bonds that we share.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,791
The same with my friends, right?

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,250
[SHUGO]
Mm-hmm.

34
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,083
[STUDENT A]
Hurry!

35
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:07,875
[STUDENT B]
Yeah!

36
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,458
Huh? What's wrong?

37
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,708
Get out here and face us!

38
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,583
The anime club has got to stay!

39
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,250
Huh? Well, this is crazy!

40
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:17,958
[ALICE]
Minoa!

41
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:18,541
Huh?

42
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,000
Over here!

43
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,250
Please tell me you guys
know what's going on.

44
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,000
It was like this
when I showed up.

45
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,500
This school can't live
without the anime club!

46
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,500
I'm pleased that they finally
recognize our greatness.

47
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,708
[ALICE] I'd be flattered,
but I'm mostly concerned.

48
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,833
[OGIKUBO] I have an
announcement, students.

49
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,208
It's the principal!

50
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,041
[OGIKUBO] I would sooner
shut the entire school down

51
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,458
than reinstate the anime club.

52
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,000
And if you don't behave
yourselves out there,

53
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,458
I will do just that.

54
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,791
[CROWD]
Huh?!

55
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,000
Is that good enough for you?

56
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:54,875
Of course.

57
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,750
No matter how big a fish gets,

58
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,000
it's harmless once you
take it out of the water

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,791
[STUDENT C]
Get out here, Ogikubo!

60
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,000
Explain yourself!

61
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,250
I'm sorry!

62
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,041
We've been ordered
not to let anyone through!

63
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,291
[moans] Don't touch me,
you naughty children!

64
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,666
I'll defend this door,
no matter the cost!

65
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,166
If you want to pass.

66
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,291
Well, I'm afraid you'll
have to get rough with me!

67
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,833
They're really angry,
aren't they?

68
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,208
How did it come to this?

69
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,333
Make way!

70
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,750
Gah! That's a bit
too much for me!

71
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,041
Aw, crap!

72
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,083
[beeping]

73
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,625
What the?

74
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,541
You dope!

75
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,208
Now the office is on lockdown!

76
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,458
You're all coming with me!

77
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,416
To the staff room, right now!

78
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,000
[MISTER KITTY]
This is my secret feeding spot.

79
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,333
Uh, hey.

80
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,875
Are you gonna be all right?

81
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,791
Stop gawkin'
and help me already!

82
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,041
[MINOA]
Ahh!

83
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,708
Huh?

84
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,541
Whoa, the office!

85
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,916
Ahh! Uhm, excuse me, sir.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,208
My name's Minoa.

87
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,458
I'm a member of the anime club.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,166
Listen, it's Minoa's voice!

89
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,125
It's me! Open up!

90
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know if they can
hear us in there.

91
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,041
Why do you hate the
anime club so much, sir?

92
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,708
What in the hell was that?

93
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,791
[MINOA]
Huh?

94
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,500
The short you made
for the festival.

95
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,916
The art was a mess, and
you broke the 180 degree rule.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,166
It was a barrage of poor jokes,
read by talentless voice actors.

97
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,833
And the writing was amateur!

98
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,875
You wanna go little man?

99
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,583
I poured my heart and soul into
that mess, I'll have you know!

100
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,833
Hate to admit it, but all
those criticisms are spot-on.

101
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,875
I pretty much agree with
him on all those things.

102
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,625
[laughs]

103
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,916
What's more, you didn't
even finish the end credits!

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,916
And that title sucks!

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,083
[MINOA]
I, uh...

106
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,875
Don't even try to deny it!

107
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,083
You paid such close
attention to our anime!

108
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,750
Oh, thank you so much!

109
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,000
[ALICE]
That was some killer trash talk.

110
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,416
The title stinks, does it?

111
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,833
Well, what do you know?

112
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,250
Does this mean the
principal's a fan of anime?

113
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,750
If that's the case,

114
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,583
then why has he unleashed
his wrath so thoroughly on us?

115
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,541
Okay, I agree.

116
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,166
Some parts were a little iffy.

117
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,416
But still...

118
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,375
It has everything I love,
all in one place!

119
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,416
It's a tribute to
my favorite show!

120
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,125
And what show is that?

121
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,708
Some anime I saw
when I was a kid

122
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,750
that stuck with
me all these years!

123
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,875
Robots, bam!

124
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,875
Some old guy, pchoo!

125
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,208
A magical girl defeating
bad guys with a song!

126
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,166
Fishies go flop flop!

127
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,291
And then the angels come!

128
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,458
I still dream
about it to this day!

129
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,125
Sounds like <i>Burn Down</i> ,

130
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,833
and <i>Stretch Dawn Mermaid</i>
<i>Melody Pichi Pichi Pacchi</i> ,

131
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,458
and <i>Andromeda Angel</i> .

132
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,666
All masterpieces, but
scarcely reflected in your work.

133
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,500
Oh, wow!

134
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,958
You're like an anime expert!

135
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,958
But none of those you mentioned
are the anime I'm talking about.

136
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,000
[OGIKUBO]
Then what is?

137
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,083
I don't remember!

138
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,625
[OGIKUBO]
You're in the anime club!

139
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,583
How can you not remember the
title of your favorite program?

140
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,958
Is the girl from
<i>Secretive Blue Midia</i> ?

141
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,958
Is the giant mech <i>GahXephon</i> ?

142
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,625
The singing part sounds like
<i>Super Dimension Bonsai Micross</i> ?

143
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,416
Are the angels from
<i>A Dog of Decadence</i> ?

144
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,458
[MINOA]
Hmmm...

145
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,041
Don't think so.

146
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,541
If he's going to be so bossy, he
should run his own anime club.

147
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,333
Maybe he's just jealous.

148
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,291
[ALICE] Come to think of it,
those sketches we found

149
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,333
in the club room were a lot
like <i>Midia</i> and <i>GahXephon</i> .

150
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,833
[gasps]

151
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,000
You think he ran the club
before he became the principal?

152
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,500
Let's find out.

153
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,458
Have you seen <i>Micross</i> ?

154
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,166
There's a famous scene,
with a girl named May Minling.

155
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,291
She's riding with the
protagonist in a mech.

156
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,791
He asks if her life or
her hair is more important

157
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,541
and she says, "hair."

158
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,291
And <i>Pretty</i>
<i>Fighter Sailor Bunny</i> !

159
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,333
That was the big thing for young
girls before <i>PreFae</i> came out,

160
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,541
but I remember how men
and women of all ages

161
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,583
were moved by
the phenomenal finale!

162
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,833
And do you know,
Hum from <i>Nurusei Yakara</i> ,

163
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,958
who always zapped
her cheating hubby?

164
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,375
She could zap me any time,
I'll tell you that!

165
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:19,500
<i>Hiatari Sokosoko</i> and <i>Kimamani</i>
<i>Orange Road</i> had cute girls, too.

166
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,000
You should see
them if you haven't.

167
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,416
They're pioneers in
the slice of life genre.

168
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
[ALICE, MIKO]
Holy crap, it's him!

169
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,625
What did anime do to hurt him?

170
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,500
I wonder why he changed?

171
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,416
Maybe he was an aspiring
writer who came to hate anime

172
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,833
after he was forced

173
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,166
to rewrite the school festival
script over and over.

174
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,125
[STUDENT C]
Don't give up on the anime club!

175
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,625
Don't give up on the school!

176
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,125
Little pests.

177
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,625
We didn't have the internet,

178
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,916
so we got all our news
from <i>Animeta</i> magazine.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Ooh! I'll study that!

180
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,958
[OGIKUBO]
It's too late now.

181
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,583
That school festival
garbage you made

182
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,833
will haunt you for
the rest of your life.

183
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,250
Don't be rude!

184
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,250
Anime's hard to make and
we gave it our best, you know!

185
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,250
It's a battle of
passion and personality,

186
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,083
with looming deadlines
and dwindling stamina!

187
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,666
But with the magic
of a good director,

188
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,958
everyone can come
together as one!

189
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,208
In this case, that's me!

190
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,916
You don't understand
directing at all!

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,541
A director is a
high-minded figure,

192
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,416
with wisdom far exceeding
anyone else on the staff!

193
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,625
He suffers in solitude
and bears the burden

194
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,958
of the entire production
on his back!

195
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,416
He deserves admiration!

196
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,833
Loyalty! Worship!

197
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,541
Oh, yeah, absolutely,
I totally get it.

198
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,583
She totally doesn't get it.

199
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,333
But jeez, is the principal
stuck up, or what?

200
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,375
[gasps]

201
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,625
With the way
he's talking, though,

202
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,375
it seems like he used
to be an anime director!

203
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,666
[AURORA]
It's possible.

204
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,916
[KAI]
Aurora!

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,458
You've got some nerve!

206
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,625
Forgive me!

207
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,916
Huh?

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,250
[AURORA] There's a reason
why I betrayed you.

209
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,583
Get out of here I don't
wanna see your face!

210
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,041
It's too late to
apologize; we're done!

211
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,875
I have five siblings,
so life is tough at home.

212
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:04,833
Six Auroras?

213
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,541
Oh my gosh!

214
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,500
[AURORA] My older brothers
are all good for nothing, so...

215
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,833
Wait, never mind that.

216
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,875
The point is, I had
to work long hours

217
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,333
at a coffee shop
just to stay alive.

218
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,083
It turns out the principal
was a regular there.

219
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,250
Taking pity on me
for my poverty,

220
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,500
he offered to let me attend
this school free of charge.

221
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,000
So even if it makes me sick,

222
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,166
I have to do what the
principal says, or I'm ruined.

223
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,375
I had no clue.

224
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,708
I'm so sorry you
went through that!

225
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,041
You always kept
a smile on your face.

226
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,833
Oh, Aurora, I never
should've doubted you!

227
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
We forgive you, Auroracchi.

228
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:42,916
Right then.

229
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,125
Welcome back.

230
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,416
[AURORA]
Uhh...

231
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,333
Everyone, thank you.

232
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,916
But uh, please stop
calling me Aurora.

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,875
Seriously.

234
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,166
The director's the
heart of the entire show!

235
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, you're right! Uh-huh!

236
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,291
After talking to you, I can't
wait to work on my next project!

237
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,208
[OGIKUBO]
Wait, what?

238
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,125
I'll do much better this time!

239
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,916
[OGIKUBO]
You're not quitting?

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,208
I love anime!

241
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,166
Why would I ever give up?

242
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,291
Even without the anime club,
we're all still friends.

243
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,000
And as long as we're together,
we can make another one!

244
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,791
[OGIKUBO]
There are no second chances.

245
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,666
Huh?

246
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,791
[OGIKUBO] Once you screw up
the first episode,

247
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,208
then your dream is dead.

248
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,500
You can pour your heart and soul

249
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,625
into two seasons
of material, to no avail.

250
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:33,666
If your show gets canceled,
there's nothing you can do!

251
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,583
[gasps]

252
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,916
Whoa. This is crazy!

253
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,583
It's not my fault,
not my fault, it isn't!

254
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,416
Those stupid fans were wrong!

255
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,833
Every stinking night,
they crawl out of their holes.

256
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,250
Posting garbage on the internet,

257
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,375
picking apart every
frame of every show.

258
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,000
Who the hell is "anon" anyway?

259
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:51,916
Screw you!

260
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,416
[gasps]

261
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,375
Wait a sec, are you saying
you directed an anime before,

262
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,041
just like me?

263
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,458
So he was a director, then!

264
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,500
But his show got
canned right away.

265
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,000
He got dissed on the
internet and couldn't take it.

266
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,041
As a fellow creator,
I have nothing but sympathy.

267
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,541
[OGIKUBO]
What does it matter?

268
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,083
My work was banished
into oblivion!

269
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,333
Jeez. Whatta pain.

270
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,541
[MIKO]
It's the little kitty.

271
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,583
[MISTER KITTY]
That's Mister Kitty to you!

272
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,625
Gross!

273
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,166
Why is there a
cat door down here?

274
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,208
Even a hardass like him
can't resist the fluff.

275
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:23,916
Minoa.

276
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,125
Are you okay?

277
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,916
[shrieks]

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,791
What's that door?

279
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,791
Open up, quick!

280
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,416
[MINOA]
Uh.

281
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,708
There's an awful lot of buttons.

282
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,083
I don't know where to start.

283
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,083
Ogikubo!

284
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,166
What's the password?

285
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,708
The guys in his own world,
he can't hear a stinkin' word.

286
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,875
The lock to that door

287
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,833
is the lock to his heart,
you might say.

288
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,166
That's so poetic.

289
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,458
So he's trapped in
a cage of his own torment.

290
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,083
Unless we can reach out
to his stone-cold heart.

291
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,291
That's fantasy!

292
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,125
You're one to talk.

293
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,791
A password to open his heart.

294
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,125
I see.

295
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,125
If the principal broke down
because of anime,

296
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,958
then I say anime's the only
thing that can save him!

297
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,125
Indeed!

298
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,125
A ray of light at the
end of the tunnel!

299
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,166
And we'll find it, for sure!

300
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,208
Begin Project M!

301
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,958
Let's be ambitious, team!

302
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,250
Hey, we'll get you outta there,
Minoa, just hold on!

303
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,541
We'll find the
principal's anime!

304
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,041
[MINOA] The sooner the
better, if you don't mind!

305
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,958
[ERICA] First let's try to
gather some information.

306
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,416
I'll see if any of
the store clerks know!

307
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,708
Good luck!

308
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,750
Search engine's showing nothing.

309
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,208
Guess we'll just have
to crowdsource it, then.

310
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,375
Uh, hey, Saori.

311
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,291
There's something
I need to ask you about.

312
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,541
A live stream might be
a good option, too!

313
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,625
Good day to all
anime fans out there.

314
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,041
My name's Alice Kamiigusa.

315
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,125
I'm looking for the
name of an anime.

316
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,125
I call upon your endless
wealth of knowledge

317
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,750
to aid me in this
important mission.

318
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,833
It features an homage to
<i>Midia</i> and <i>Dog of Decadence</i> .

319
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,250
It uses imagery from
shows like <i>GahXephon</i>

320
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,333
and <i>Super Dimension</i>

All of a sudden, this old dude
goes flying into the sky!

Then this girl's

Then angels come for them.

[OGIKUBO sighs]

385

A tragedy's effectiveness is
dependent on its ability

00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,791
to invoke both fear and
sympathy in its audience,

447

thus purging them
of those emotions.
