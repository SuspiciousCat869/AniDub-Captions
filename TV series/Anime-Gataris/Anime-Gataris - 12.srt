1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,916
This just keeps getting worse!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,041
[NARRATOR]
The year is 2016.

3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,458
The world faces its end
and the only person who seems

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,208
to notice is homely high
school klutz, Minoa Asagaya,

5
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,916
seen here being
slapped in the face.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,625
Her friends are the
rich otaku, Alice Kamiigusa.

7
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:30,125
The glasses girl character,
Miko Koenji.

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,708
Club president and
cosplayer, Erica Aoyama.

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,500
And the guy who thinks
he has evil eye powers,

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,541
Kai Musashisakai.

11
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:41,916
Unfortunately, they've all
been swallowed up by anime.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,750
Minoa's friendship with Aurora
Nakano also came crashing down

13
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,500
when she discovered that
he was a cowardly traitor.

14
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,958
Aurora revealed one
shocking truth after another,

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,916
making the show very meta.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,250
For starters, reality and the
Anime World exist in parallel.

17
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,000
Also, apparently
the anime club room

18
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,500
was the site of
the first anime studio

19
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,000
and that's why it has
a magic door in it.

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,541
Aurora himself is from the Anime
World and is also super evil.

21
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,541
Minoa had to scream about it.

22
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,875
"You suck, Aurora"!

23
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,208
Is that what's happening?

24
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,583
Well, thanks a bunch.

25
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,708
What about me?

26
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,666
I'm a part of this
story, too, y'know!

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,500
Hey, don't call me Aurora,
whoever you are!

28
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,916
And c'mon!

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,375
Did you have to diss me
so hard in my character intro?

30
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,500
[NARRATOR]
Minoa complained pointlessly

31
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,458
about my highly
accurate assessment,

32
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:26,916
but her words fell on deaf ears.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,250
Ah?!

34
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,166
Okay, you jerk.

35
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,250
[NARRATOR] The mysterious
man with the magic beret

36
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,625
sought to rewrite reality

37
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,833
during his dramatic
appearance last episode.

38
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,916
Unfortunately, it turns out
that he was a talentless hack,

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,125
unfit to wield such
mighty hat power.

40
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,375
Rejected by both
anime and reality,

41
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:48,708
he was killed
unceremoniously offscreen.

42
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:49,958
[MISTER KITTY]
Death by narrator!

43
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,333
[AURORA]
No!

44
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,375
But, you promised me,
you bastard!

45
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,583
Did you make some
kind of deal with that guy?

46
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:02,666
Once he was the director, he
said he would change my name.

47
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,958
Maybe he did!

48
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,000
Before the universe
erased him from existence!

49
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:07,708
Yeah!

50
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,125
I bet it's just fine!

51
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,375
Tell me my name!

52
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,291
Aurora.

53
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:15,250
It's not fair!

54
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,833
Where's the beret?

55
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,833
I'll fix this!

56
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,250
[MINOA] I still don't
understand, Mister Kitty.

57
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,041
Anime's something
that people create, isn't it?

58
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,791
[AURORA] Oh, you'd like to
believe that, wouldn't you?

59
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,083
But the truth is,
we've always existed!

60
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,416
The anime you make
merely depicts us.

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,583
An ignorant portrayal of
a world beyond your grasp!

62
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,166
As anime has slowly
spread into this world,

63
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,125
I've seen it happen with myself.

64
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,333
I'm always the same character,

65
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,416
but the depiction of me
changes to match the times.

66
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,750
[AURORA]
Soon, you'll become anime, too.

67
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,333
[AURORA]
But none of that matters to me,

68
00:02:56,416 --> 00:03:00,500
I just want someone
to change my name!

69

Stop! Stop harmonizing it!

00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,750
You can't even sing!

72
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,833
I hate you!

[MINOA shrieks]

74
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,833
Huh?

[ALICE]
Minoa.

76
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,250
Is something wrong?

77
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,083
You're spacing out.

Did You watch <i>Ancient Bride</i> ?

80
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,291
Last night's episode
was simply lovely!

81
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,458
I was stunned!

The art is beautiful!

[ALICE] I love how the
eyes shimmer on closeups!

I wish mine did that!

[MIKO]
Those are nice,

86
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,375
but I'd rather have
their hair gradients!

00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,708
I'm so jealous!

[YUI]
No kidding, right?

89
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,166
That studio is great!

90
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,333
They really know
how to bring out

91
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,875
the best in characters,
don't they?

92
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,541
Seems normal enough!

93
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,541
I guess it was just a bad dream!

00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,708
[YUI]
Totally.

95
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,291
[MIKO] I have some
new script ideas, too.

I can't wait!

Taking charge again, I see.

Don't worry,
you're going to love it.

got to be kidding me.

Looks like the Robotics Club

106
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,625
botched their weapon test again.

107
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,041
That's the second
time this week.

What are you staring at?

00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,000
Perhaps the land of phantoms
is reaching out to her.

Hey, Alice.

00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,000
What for?

118
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,541
Just do it!

119
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,250
Take that mask off!

Mon peti coeur.

122
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,166
So that means
I wasn't dreaming after all.

I was sure we had you
for a second there.

your pick for this season

131
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,500
is the new <i>YoYoYo</i> series?

132
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,291
[MINOA]
Why are they home?

133
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,625
[SHUGO]
Absolutely.

134
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,333
If you count
returning series, too,

135
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,583
then my favorite is <i>August</i>
<i>Comes in Like a Reindeer</i> .

136
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,208
[SHUGO]
Uh, I'm looking for something

137
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,708
a little less depressing.

138
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,875
<i>Papipupepopip</i> seems promising.

139
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,625
[MAYA]
It got delayed.

140
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,583

Hey, Mom.

144
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,666
Does Dad have the day off?

145
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,083
He's back early.

146
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,875
[AI] I keep forgetting
you don't have club practice.

147
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,125
There were no afternoon
classes today, either.

148
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,833
I walked straight out
of the office!

149
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,625
What's your favorite show
this season, Mom?

150
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,958
[AI] Oh, probably <i>A Little</i>
<i>Sister's the Last Thing I Need</i> .

151
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,541

some friends over.

Can they sleep in
the empty room upstairs?

stay in your room?

Well, it's three people.

touch my figures, okay?

[gsaps]

165
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,583
Let anime consume you.

166
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,458
It'll be fun!

167
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,250
Your friends are doing it!

168
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,125
[MINOA]
Am I really the last one?

169
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,125
What's the point
in fighting anymore?

170
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,458
The world has already
been swallowed up.

171
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,291
It's not like I'll become some
kind of zombie or anything.

172
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,583
You won't be lonely anymore.

173
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,333
[MINOA]
You think it's better that way?

174
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,125
[MINOA]
Then why do you look so sad?

175
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,916
[ALICE]
Hurry up, will you?

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,625
[ERICA]
Become one with her.

177
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:27,250
Open the door to our world
and leave it all behind.

178
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,500
[MIKO] Your friends know
what's best for you, Minoa.

179
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,541
It was fun, wasn't it?

180
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,875
Huh?

181
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,666
I thought Alice and Miko
would be hard to talk to,

182
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,791
but once we bonded over anime,
we were friends in no time.

183
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,166
We made even more friends
after we started the anime club.

184
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,250
Erica, Musashisakai,
even Aurora, and Mister Kitty.

185
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,541
Sharing anime with
them made me so happy.

186
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,708
I know.

187
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,541
I don't want to lose them.

188
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,958
Then we should
become anime, too.

189
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,875
It's not right.

190
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,916
That hurt!

Now you're getting it, Maya!

Ha! Told ya!

193
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,375
[SHUGO] Want to go to
the next event as a family?

194

[MAYA]
Ew, gross.

195
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,625
[SHUGO]
Is your dad not cool enough?

196
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,416
[MAYA]
Nope.

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,458

00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,416
Huh?! What the heck?

200
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,583
Oh, hey.

201
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,833
Got time for a little cat chat?

202
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,083
You bet I do!

00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,041
Meow-meow-meow.

204
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,583
Meow.

205
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,416
[MISTER KITTY] All right, if
you're ready, then let's run!

206
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,000
Meow-kay!

207
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,166
[MISTER KITTY]
You've rejected anime,

208
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,958
so anime is rejecting you.

209
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,458
So, what does that mean?

210
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,791
It means you're going to
be wiped out of existence.

211
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,916
Surely there's some way
to get things back to normal!

212
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,541
[MISTER KITTY] If we get
that beret, we're good.

213
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,791
And don't call me Shirley

214
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,125
What's the deal
with that anyway?

215
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,500
You never told me.

216
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,791
It links your world here
to the Anime World.

217
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,541
And right now, it can
reshape the both of 'em.

218
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,583
[AURORA]
I found it!

219
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,500
Finally!

220
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,375
Yes.

221
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,666
Ha! I can change my name!

222
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,833
We'll take the hat to
the border between worlds.

223
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,416
Then we'll toss it back to
the Anime World and we're done!

224
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
Or that's my guess at least.

225
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,708
So where is the border?

226
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,250
Are you dense or what?

227
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,208
The door in the club room!

228
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,541
I think I follow,

229
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,208
but how did all of this
happen in the first place?

230
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,833
[MISTER KITTY]
Pretty simple, really.

231
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,083
Like so.

232
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,875
Then all of this's
your fault, you big dummy!

233
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:47,708
Heh heh heh!

234
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,041
I can't believe you!

235
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,208
But it's your fault too.

236
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,875
I mean, even if I don't
technically belong

237
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,291
in the real world,
things were just dandy

238
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,833
until Aurora tricked
you into opening that door.

239
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,041
Oh my gosh, you are not going
to pin this whole thing on me!

240
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,458
[AURORA]
Hmph!

241
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,000
What the?

242
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,375
What's that ahead?

243
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,916
[MISTER KITTY]
The mid-episode eyecatch.

244
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,166
Oh no!

245
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,833
We survived it somehow.

246
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:29,625
Sorry.

00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,166
Forgot those were a thing.

Is that snow?

249
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,916
It's pieces of reality
the beret's throwing away.

250
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,666
It's making the world
a blank slate.

251
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,000
[MINOA]
What does that mean?

252
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,458
[MISTER KITTY]
It's erasing your world.

253

You didn't tell me
the world was gonna die!

Welp, that's it.

255
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,666
I'm finished.

256
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,666
It was such a short life.

What a pity.

Whoa. Whoa. Wait!
What is this, a recap ep?

C'mon, this is
the dramatic finale,

there's no time
for that nonsense!

You're the only person
that can protect this world

and its memories!

What d'you mean memories?

264
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,208
[MISTER KITTY]
If this world disappears,

265
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,833
then your friends and all
their memories will be caput!

gotta tell me, babe.

the world, didn't I?

there who can help us?

Where did the school go?

Why'd everything get so quiet?

Wasn't this supposed
to be the climax?

315

This is what happens
when you go against the world.

We're back to
the planning stage.

328
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,625
[MINOA] Why does everyone
have such stupid names?

329
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,083
I got the beret, but I still
can't change the world.

330
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,958
The hat doesn't work if
an anime character wears it.

331
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,208
[AURORA] Then you
put it on Mikene, please!

332
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,125
It's Minoa.

333
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,541
[AURORA] This hat can
rewrite the universe!

334
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,541
It's a symbol of absolute power!

335
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,291
Absolute authority!

336
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,833
[MINOA]
You're wrong.

337
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,208
The man who wore this beret
never wanted anything like that.

338
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,791
This is a symbol of dreams,
inspiration, and passion!

339
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,916
It's the bridge between
the Anime World and reality!

340
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,791
Okay, fine!

341
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,583
So use it to fix my name, okay?

342
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,458
Ugh... Has he got
tunnel vision or what?

343
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,333
I need to get to the door.

344
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,916
Open the way.

345
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,416
Huh?

346
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,041
[gasps]

347
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,500
Don't do this.

348
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,000
You're making a big mistake.

349
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,625
[MINOA] If I don't do something,
we're all gonna disappear!

350
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,916
You're just being
stubborn, Minoa.

351
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,708
[ERICA]
We don't need reality.

352
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,250
We have anime.

353
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,833
[KAI] Leave your flesh behind
and join us in glorious 2D.

354
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,541
Your war on anime is over.

355
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,208
I'm sorry, you've got it wrong.

356
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,708
I love anime!

357
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,375
I learned so much and had
so much fun talking to you guys

358
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,750
in the clubroom.

359
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,541
Anime made us all friends!

360
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,750
Alice, even though we
hardly knew each other,

361
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,250
you opened your heart to me.

362
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,041
You were so kind
and enthusiastic,

363
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,958
I never would've gotten
into anime without you.

364
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,166
Miko, you never gave up,
no matter how many times

365
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,291
we asked you to
rewrite your script.

366
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,916
I learned how much passion
it takes to make anime.

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Erica, you showed me how
anime brings people together.

368
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:43,250
How to enjoy it as a community
full of wonderful people.

369
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,083
And the club would've died
for sure without Kaikai.

370
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,083
I'll never forget the
speech you made.

371
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,458
It touched my heart.

372
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,625
[KAI]
It's Kai.

373
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,666
Y'get it?

374
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,000
I love you guys!

375
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,291
And I love anime, because
it brought us all together!

376
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,291
It's wonderful!

377
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,666
But not this.

378
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,291
Our world, and everything
in it is fading away.

379
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,625
This anime is garbage!

380
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,000
I hate it!

381
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,500
Minoa.

382
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,583
Huh? Hold on!

383
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,000
Alice, no!

384
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:21,916
[AURORA]
Oh!

385
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,208
The world is dead.

386
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,291
My name will disappear!

387
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,916
It's not over, Aurora.

388
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,250
Don't call me that, okay?

389
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,583
No matter what.

390
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,375
I'll always think of you
as one of my friends.

391
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,875
Even if you do bad things,

392
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,916
you're still the one who
taught me to keep fighting.

393
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,500
So, thank you for that.

394
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,083
I admired you.

395
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,583
And you were right.

396
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,666
I should never give up!

397
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,791
It's gone.

398
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,416
I'm too late.

399
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,250
[gasps]

400
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,375
Alice!

401
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,375
Just get up here!

402
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,208
[MINOA]
You came back for me?

403
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,791
Of course.

404
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,791
There's still anime we need to
watch and talk about together.

405
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,166
Oh, Alice.

406
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,833
[ALICE]
Nice speech, by the way.

407
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,541
I'm flattered you
think so highly of me.

408
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,291
For a mere mortal, you're
quite impressive, yourself.

409
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,916
We're all lucky to have you.

410
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,625
We're here.

411
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,875
We have our club.

412
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,291
The world ending isn't that bad.

413
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,708
Maybe!

414
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,500
But if I can get this
beret through that door,

415
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,375
I might be able to save it.

416
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,625
The question is "how"?

417
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,666
Oh, no way!

418
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,833
[ALL]
Robo Alice?

419
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,791
Haha! It sensed your distress

420
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,625
and came from a distant
dimension to aid us!

421
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,708
[MIKO] The artwork still
looks pretty shoddy, though.

422
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,083
[ERICA] Maybe, but I wouldn't
have it any other way!

423
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,041
Are you ready?

424
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,125
Let's go!

425
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,333
[ROBO ALICE]
Alpha!

426
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:17,500
Alpha! Alpha! Alpha! Alpha!

427
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,208
[ROBO ALICE]
I require more money.

428
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,208
Should've expected that.

429
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,708
Alice, stop!

430
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,125
You can't solve every little
problem with your checkbook!

431
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,541
We're sort of trapped in a void.

432
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,000
What else do we have?

433
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,166
Our burning hearts!

434
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,458
Let's set them free!

435
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,625
Every good robot
has a rocket punch!

436
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:45,083
Now it's time to let it, fly!

437
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,083
Let's get to that door
while it's still unlocked!

438
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,416
[MINOA]
Huh?

439
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,916
Mister Kitty.

440
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,541
[MISTER KITTY] You're goin'
back where you belong,

441
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,916
you hat bastard!

442
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,458
[MINOA]
You're leaving, Aurora?

443
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,708
I hate that name,
but I'm stuck with it.

444
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,500
Even though I became a villain,

445
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,416
you still said
I was your friend.

446
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,958
Maybe next time, my character
will turn out nicer.

447
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,250
We'll keep this naughty beret
where it belongs from now on.

448
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,166
See you in the funny papers!

449
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,041
Hold on!

450
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,375
You can't go!

451
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,083
Not like this!

452
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,500
Don't worry.

453
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,916
You'll do great, kid.

454
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,791
Who knows.

455
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,875
Maybe I'll pop in again someday.

456
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,416
Aurora, wait!

457
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,458
Auroracchi!

458
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,625
Aurora, no!

459
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,958
[AURORA sighs]

460
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,458
I told you not to
call me that, didn't I?

461
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,000
I almost forgot, Minoa!

462
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,458
Change my name, hurry!

463
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,583
Huh?! Oh, I dunno.

464
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,041
Uhh...

465
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,541
Uh, Grovelboy!

466
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,250
What the hell?

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,041
Kitty!

468
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,375
So have you picked out
a club this year, or what?

469
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,583
Uh... Not yet.

470
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,666
This season.

471
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,250
I'm totally into
<i>Hero School</i> and <i>Ru: Zero</i> .

472
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,875
Oh, and the protagonist
in <i>Shikabari</i> is a real dear!

473
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,500
Oh, and the <i>Time Travel</i>
<i>Shounen OP</i> is so cool!

474
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,833
Like when Jun does
that stylish fence jump!

475
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,708
I don't get any of that,
but I'm glad you're happy!

476
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:33,166
[MINOA] This season is nothing
but shounen fight stuff, though.

477
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,833
Do you like anime?

478
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,291
Yeah!

479
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,166
Like, crazy about it!

480
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,916
Oh my gosh, me too!

481
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,208
That's so cool!

482
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,166
Any show by Ogikubo is
my absolute favorite!

483
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,583
You've got good taste.
I approve.

484
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,583
[TSUBAKI]
What's all this squealing about?

485
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,750
[MINOA] Sorry, I got
a little carried away.

486
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,708
[TSUBAKI]
If you like anime so much,

487
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,541
why don't you join
the anime club?

488
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,458
Huh?

489
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,041
We have one?

490
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,625
Tell the president
that Tsubaki sent you.

491
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,000
They're a little odd, but I
think you'll get along fine.

492
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,333
Why do you always
walk off without me?

493
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,791
Best of luck.

494
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,250
[ALICE]
This is it.

495
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,250
Uhm.

496
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,000
Hello?

497
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,541
[MINOA]
Uh. I can't see.

498
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,625
Miko?

499
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,208
We've been waiting for you.

500
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,583
Why didn't you say something
to me, you big dork?

501
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,250
Ah-ha!

502
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,500
Some fresh blood!

503
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,583
Welcome to our
humble anime club!

504
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,958
Mikocchi, can you do this
part of the script over again?

505
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,583
But I've already re-written it!

506
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,875
You're gonna slay this,
Miko Baby!

507
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:36,916
Oh.

508
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,250
Is that a character
for the short?

509
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,500
Maybe.

510
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,000
He's a stylish,
dancing, idol otaku!

511
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,291
And he's from another world.

512
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,458
[MINOA]
Huh?

513
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,166
What's in there?

514
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,166
Well, see for yourself!

515
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,208
Awesome!

516
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,208
It's a mountain of treasure!

517
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,291
What?

518
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,833
We're seriously doing this?

519
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,708
We have a heartwarming
finale and instead of

520
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,666
ending on that note,
we're doing sexy Santa now?

521
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,000
Well, whatever.

522
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,166
So long and merry Christmas!

523
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,875
Also, have a happy new year

524
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,875
and whatever the hell
comes after that!

525
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,208
[ALL]
Meow.
