Morning, everybody!

Hello?

00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,166
Oh.

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,625
Guess nobody's here.

Hey, you mind
keepin' it down a bit?

Some of us're tryin' to sleep!

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,250
Sorry, Mister Kitty.

00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,125
I was excited and woke up early.

00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,333
I should've known everyone
else would be busy.

What's this?

getting started.

We've returned.

25
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,666
[AYAME]
As instructed, we researched

26
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,333
the club's expenditures
and dug up any information

27
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,791
we could find on the members,

28
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,750
including their
favorite anime titles.

29
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,958
I think you'll find

30
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,625
that our investigation
was quite thorough!

31
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,125
I see.

32
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,708
Search for any infraction
that you can find,

33
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,666
however small it may be.

34

[MATSURI AYAME]
Yes, ma'am!

35
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,041
Hot damn.

36
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,458
That was a close one, wasn't it?

37
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,916

these boxes are about?

[ALICE laughs]

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,833
We can't very well
have an anime club

51
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,708
without a proper
library of titles.

52
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,708
I made sure to
rectify that myself.

53
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,291
Oh! Hello there,

54
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,250
you expensive limited edition
of the <i>Dub Tone</i> movie.

55
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,500
I haven't watched
the extended version

56
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,791
of the big concert
scene in this yet.

57
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,958
[KAI]
I see you acquired

58
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,250
the <i>Chaos Mad Nova</i>
boxed set as well!

59
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:50,000
That includes the little sister
scenes too gory for TV!

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,333
This is the latest
volume of <i>Anosuba</i> !

61
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,791
Now I can make everyone watch

[ALICE chcukles]

64
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,916
You're about to get
hit by some flying discs.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,250
[MINOA]
UFOs?

66
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,833
No, you goofball!

67
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,625
DVDs, BDs, LEs,
physical media anime!

68
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,791
I see!

69
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,541
Late night anime,
like most of these here,

70
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,958
don't make money
from sponsors

71
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,083
like a regular
prime-time show would.

72
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,541
So disc sales
are very important.

73
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,583
They may seem
expensive at first glance,

74
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,541
but they often come
with tons of bonuses,

75
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,333
like concert raffle tickets
and event invitations

76
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,291
in addition to all the usual
interviews and artbooks.

77
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,291
Then you get soundtracks,
drama CDs or even figures.

78
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,625
Sometimes it's like the extras
are the most important part.

79
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,208
When shots from the
broadcast version look sloppy,

80
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,083
they'll often redraw them.

81
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,458
While the internet makes
fun of the off-model designs,

82
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,083
the animators work
tirelessly to fix them.

83
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,333
Thus, transforming them
into something beautiful

84
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,708
for the disc release.

85
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,791
Once you're a
true master like I am,

86
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,916
you'll have one copy for
storage, one for display,

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,208
one for watching, one for
backup, one for evangelism,

88
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,083
and however many more you need
to get all the preorder bonuses.

89
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,458
A true fan will purchase as many
copies as they deem necessary!

90
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,000
We get it.

91
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,583
[KAI] These discs are like
irresistible tiny black holes

92
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,458
sucking away all my money.

93
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,958
I'll tap into my
Swiss bank account.

94
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:08,875
There's no other choice.

95
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,166
So, the money anime makes,

96
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,791
only comes from the
sales of discs like these.

97
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,708
It's more complicated than that.

98
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,125
But like I was saying before,

99
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,500
the actual TV broadcast
doesn't earn them any profit.

100
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,541
You know, anime can be
pretty expensive to make.

101
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,083
Usually, a bunch
of different companies

102
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,166
will all invest
in a single title.

103
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,583
When they come together,

104
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,375
they form what's a called
a "production committee."

105
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,666
And then what?

106
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,000
[ALICE] Then they
come up with the budget

107
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,833
for the anime
and distribute revenue

108
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,416
from discs and merchandise
after it airs on television.

109
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,750
They also sell licenses

110
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,541
for online streaming
and overseas markets.

111
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,083
If the sales figures are good,

112
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,833
maybe they'll make
a second season!

113
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,500
Sometimes they'll follow
the manga or light novel.

114
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,541
And other times, for
whatever business reason,

115
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,291
they'll change the content.

116
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,583
If the anime is a giant robot
and the studio is its pilot,

117
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,916
then the production committee
is the secret organization,

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,375
pulling strings
from the shadows.

119
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,625
Oh, wow.

120
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,041
That's a big deal!

121
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,000
That may be why secret
committees are in so many anime.

School Student Council's

You think our student council

00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,625
is a secret organization
controlling us from the shadows?

126

Minoa, sounds like you've been
watching too much anime.

Although, it's still not wise to
mess with the student council.

128
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,791
So wait, did you buy
all these for the club

129
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,500
with your own money?

130
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,916
Well, what belongs to
the club belongs to me,

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,416
and if it belongs to me,
it belongs to me.

clear anything up.

We've got you now, anime club!

136

They're out of the shadows!

The receipt for club spending.

What are "anime media costs"?

148
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,916
Is it this garbage?

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,666
Personal indulgences purchased
with official club funding?

That's me, over here.

[gasps]

154
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,666
No fair!

155
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,416
You're not supposed
to admit it yourself!

156
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,000
This was my chance
to shine as the VP!

157
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,166
Sorry, but this is a
job for the treasurer.

158
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,125
A total cost of
over 340 thousand.

159
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,958
This is clearly meant
as personal property.

160
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,083
But the club's property
is my personal property.

161
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,041
My money, and my club.

162
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,833
Do I need permission
from the student council

163
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,333
to buy something for myself?

164
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,583
Yeah, okay,
we get it; you're rich!

165
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,041
Specifics aside.

166
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,583
A newly formed
club is not allowed

167
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,958
to spend so much money
with official funding,

168
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,750
regardless of
where it came from.

169
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,958
Then I'll return these

170
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,208
and have the orders
shipped to my estate.

171
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,125
Now, Sebasu.

172
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,250
Hey, hold on.

173
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,666
Let me talk.

174
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,875
As the club's president,

175
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,541
it's my fault for not
checking into this,

176
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,291
but it won't happen again.

177
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,375
Like you said, we're a new
club, so we're still trying

178
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,625
to work out our place
at the school and all that.

179
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,583
"Your place at the school"?

180
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,916
In that case,
why don't we have you

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,666
assist the other clubs
for the rest of this week?

182
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,500
When you're done,
I will evaluate your work

183
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,250
and decide if your
club deserves to stay.

184
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,125
[ERICA]
Oh, come on!

185
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,750
Why is that a problem?

186
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,375
Is it because you know that the
anime club isn't worth anything?

187
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,958
You have nothing to contribute.

188
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,666
Not to the other clubs
and not to this school.

189
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,375
You're just dead weight,
wasting our time.

190
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,041
If you don't appreciate
what I'm saying,

191
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,000
then feel free to
prove me wrong.

192
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,416
If you can.

193
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,000
[MATSURI]
Have fun.

194
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,833
[AYAME laughs]

195
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,166
[MINOA sighs]

196
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,791
Just let us have our club room.

197
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,500
Why do you hate us so much?

198
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,208
[AURORA]
Thirsty?

199
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,041
[gasps]

200
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,375
[MINOA]
Oh, uh, thanks.

201
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,458
I guess I was lost in thought.

202
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,375
Funny.

203
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,291
Never knew we took the same bus.

204
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,041
The student council threatening
to shut down a school club.

205
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,166
I thought that stuff
only happened on TV.

206
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,333
Yeah, I saw a drama about
that just a few months ago!

207
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,291
Well, I was thinking anime.

208
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,666
Right! 'Course you were.

209
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,583
So I know you like <i>Dub Tone</i> ,

210
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,750
is that the only reason
you joined the club?

211
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,333
Not really.

212
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,375
It's not about anime as much
as it's about finding a place

213
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,750
with like-minded people.

214
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,583
That moment where
everyone comes together

215
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,125
and shines like
the stars they are.

216
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,208
That can be a really beautiful
thing, don't you think?

217
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,625
'Cause then,

218
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,708
we're almost like the
Onotokisaka Academy Idol Club.

219
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,250
I don't know that school.

220
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,625
If it wasn't for the Idol Club,

221
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,541
the whole place
would've been shut down.

222
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,833
You see in order for
them to form their club,

223
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,583
they also had to fight
against the student council

224
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,958
And they started from
nothing, just like us?

225
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,708
That's awesome!

226
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,750
Let's do it!

227
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,708
Just like Ono-whosie whatsit!

228
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,166
[AURORA]
Should I tell her it's an anime?

229
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,083
[ERICA]
Anime club, here!

230
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,750
Ready to help you out,
free of charge!

231
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,500
Does your club need anything?

232
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,750
Just ask and we'll deliver!

233
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:07,500
[MINOA]
Huh?!

234
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,000
Is that Erica?

235
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,750
[ERICA]
Morning, Minoacchi.

236
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,333
Neat costume,
but what's going on?

237
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,333
[ERICA] It's my way of saying
the anime club means business.

238
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,708
I need to resize this, though.

239
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,958
[MINOA] Here, give me
some of those fliers!

240
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,791
Anime club!

241
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,833
Me too.

242
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,083
Let me help!

243
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,208
[ERICA]
Aw, thanks you guys.

244
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,291
It appears that I must unleash
my dark powers once again.

245
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,458
Well, we can't really
give up now, can we?

246
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:42,041
Whatever it takes,
I'm on board, cosplay kitten.

247
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,750
I will neither hide nor
run away, hear me?

248
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,666
All my pitches are
straight down the middle!

249
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,250
[REF]
And that's a game!

250
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:06,625
Uh, uh... Hello, everybody--

251
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,458
Were you bowing?

252
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,666
[KAI]
Behold!

253
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,000
The dough is transforming
inside its electron purgatory!

254
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,875
At my command,
this time-altering gadget

255
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,708
makes quick work
of any confectionary!

256
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,375
Miko, if you're still here,
then please,

257
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,708
show me your Hand of God!

258
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,208
[MINOA]
We suck!

259
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,291
I had no idea that we were
so terrible at everything.

260
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,500
Where is Mister Gomon
when we need him most?

261
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:46,125
On a foreign business trip,
evidently. In China, I think?

262
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,541
[ALICE] It's almost
like he's mocking us.

263
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,083
We only have two days
left to be useful.

264
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,541
Frankly, I fear that
our demise is inevitable.

265
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,875
I can't help
but blame you, Alice.

266
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,333
In that case, I'll simply
acquire this academy,

267
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,500
oust the student council
and institute new--

268
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,750
You're the devil.

269
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,250
Just with a checkbook
instead of a pitchfork.

270
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,458
I second that.

271
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,250
Hey. I'm trying to help!

272
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,208
[MINOA]
Guys, come on.

273
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,750
[ERICA]
Cut it out.

274
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,958
Instead of pointing fingers,

275
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,666
let's try searching
for a solution, 'kay?

276
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,166
Good news, kittens.

277
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,583
It's a request
from the drama club.

278
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,208
They're performing a big musical
the day after tomorrow

279
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,958
to welcome our new students.

280
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,958
The costumes they ordered
won't come in on time,

281
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,958
so they're in serious trouble.

282
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,166
[MIKO]
Costumes?

283
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,291
[MINOA]
Huh?

284
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,208
You could totally
help them with that!

285
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,000
[ERICA]
Huh?

286
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,916
Well, I don't know.

287
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,375
I could try.

288
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,166
Possibly.

289
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,708
[AYAME]
That's all I have to report.

290
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,958
The anime club is making
costumes for a musical?

291
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,791
Ha! What a waste of time.

292
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,250
Hate it.

293
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,166
This isn't going to work.

294
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,833
[MINOA]
What should we do?

295
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,166
Is it because you know that the
anime club isn't worth anything?

296
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,000
You have nothing to contribute.

297
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,125
My name's Erica.
I moved here from Japan.

298
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,083
And I guess, that's it?

299
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,291
[FEMALE STUDENT D] We're
ordering pizza tonight. You in?

300
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,750
Uh. Hello.

301
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,041
[FEMALE STUDENT D]
Yep!

302
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,083
They've got <i>PreFae</i> ?

303
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,666
I didn't know they
showed this over here!

304
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,916
[FEMALE STUDENT E]
Hey, Erica!

305
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,083
Whoa, cool <i>PreFae</i> buttons!

306
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,416
You watch it?

307
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah, 'course I do!

308
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,083
We're cosplaying the characters,
but we don't know

309
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,958
the transformation
lines in Japanese.

310
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,250
Can you help us?

311
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:32,958
Sure!

312
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,541
It's real easy!

313
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,291
Enemies of Mother Earth,
your time has run out!

314
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,250
Cease your wickedness.

315
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,541
Or face punishment!

316
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,083
Huh? Uh?

317
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,791
You came back!

318
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,333
Listen, I have a suggestion.

319
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,250
There's an idol anime I love

320
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,166
that has some costumes
you could use for inspiration.

321
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,041
[ERICA]
I guess that could work.

322
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,625
[AURORA] It was in
the pile that Alice bought.

323
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,875
She might've saved us.

324
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,291
Huh?

325
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,791
I wanna make the best
costume in the whole world!

326
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,500
We'll need to raise
some silkworms!

327
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,083
And plant mulberries for dye!

328
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,208
[GIRL A]
Ono toki!

329
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,250

00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,791
[GIRL C]
Ono toki!

00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:28,666
[GIRLS] Ono toki! Ono toki!
Ono toki! Ono toki! Ono toki!

332
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,916
We did it!

333
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,375
[AURORA]
See?

334
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,500
As the sparklies indicate,
these costumes are dazzling.

335
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,208
Idol anime isn't always
about a school club.

336
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,125
Sometimes it's about the
talent agency, or small town,

337
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,000
local idols,
the possibilities are limitless.

338
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,833
They might even break into
motion-captured CG animation

339
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,875
with realistic choreography!

340
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,500
But they're always cute!

341
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,541
Dancing on the stage of your TV.

342
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,875
You can almost smell the
sweat glistening on their brow,

343
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,500
or feel their hot breath.

344
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,125
And yet they're
too beautiful to be real!

345
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,666
And the costumes!

346
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,958
Of course, the costumes are
elegant, fabulous, excellent!

347
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,958
They're icing on the cake,
the jewel in the crown,

348
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,125
the piece de la resistance!

349
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,666
I'm going to explode.

350
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,083
But more than cute,
the costumes are inspirational.

351
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,750
Carried on wings of hope!

352
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,291
The point here, is that all idol
anime have one thing in common.

353
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,208
They're about coming together.

354
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,166
Being yourself and
conquering adversity as a team!

355
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,250
[FEMALE IDOL GROUP]
For beauty!

356

[ERICA]
You mean.

00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,125
[AURORA]
Just like us.

358
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,541
And this is it.

359
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,416
Our inspirational moment
to come together and succeed!

360
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
I'm inspired!

361
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,125
How 'bout you?

362
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,333
I know we can be a pain,

363
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,291
but you're the only
one who can save us!

364
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,041
We're lucky to have
a president like you,

365
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,333
so I hope you'll stick
around a long time!

366
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,916
Really think so?

367
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,416
We feel the same way.

368
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,416
All right then.

369
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,541
We don't have much time!

make the designs with me.

371
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,541
[AURORA]
Right.

372
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,291
Okay, Kaikai and Mikocchi.

373
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,666
You go buy the fabric.

374
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,125
As for Alicecchi and Minoacchi.

375
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,458
You can do the tacking.

376
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,916
[ALL]
Got it!

377
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,000
Huh?

378
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,583
It's fine.

379
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,791
After all, there's no point if
I can't accomplish this myself.

380
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,458
Wow, Mii.

00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,000
Really up late tonight.

00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,916
Uh. Yeah, I'm almost done.

383

Just a little more and
then it's sleepy time.

384
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,875

much time to finish.

[ALICE, MINOA]
Yes, ma'am!

388
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,416
They're useless!

389
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,250
They couldn't even
finish the costumes!

390
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,000
You think the drama club
will hold off the play

391
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,166
till they're done?

392
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,208
They can't.

393
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,416
I told them that
they weren't allowed

394
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,916
to go over their allotted
time in the gym.

395
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,500
This is gonna be
a massive trainwreck!

00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,583
It's showtime!

that sparkle on!

00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,375
No way.

401
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,625
That was close,
but who's counting?

402
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,458
We did it!

403
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,041
Shut us down now!

404
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,083
[TSUBAKI]
I intend to do exactly that.

405
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,375
You're sorely mistaken
if you think one little stunt

406
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,250
earns you a happy ending.

407
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,583
Your club is still a
meaningless waste of time.

408
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,208
[ERICA]
It's not meaningless at all!

409
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,750
When I was stuck in a foreign
country with no friends,

410
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,125
anime saved me!

411
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,208
So now.

412
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm not giving up
on the anime club,

413
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,666
because it's a place for people,
for my friends, to belong!

414
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,833
And you're wrong about anime
not contributing anything.

415
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,291
You've seen for yourself
the good it can do.

416
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,000
And I don't just mean cosplay.

417
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,833
I mean a bond
between two people.

Why are you so eager to
throw all that away, Tsubaki?

to the anime club's hard work.

We were in a tight spot,

We couldn't have put the

That's correct.

My attempt to shut down

[TSUBAKI] Your fight
isn't over yet, Erica.

465
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,333
In fact, I'm afraid
it's only just begun.

466
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,666
Back in the day,
anime girls could become idols

467
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,666
with just a few magic words and
a flashy transformation scene.

468
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,166
These days, the poor girls
gotta train and audition

469
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,083
and all that crap, 'cause
I guess a little optimism

470
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,250
would kill these
stinkin' script writers!

471
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,500
So anyway, next episode

472
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,125
the anime club
gets a spot along the wall.

00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,875
Now don't stay up all night!
