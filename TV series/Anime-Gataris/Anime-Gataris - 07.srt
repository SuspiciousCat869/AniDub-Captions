1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,083
I'm looking at the
anime club's plans

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:14,250
for the school festival,
and this is a load of crap.

3
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,708
An anime screening
is pretty weak.

4
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,041
After what
happened last time,

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,791
I don't know if the
president cares or not,

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,333
but they are really
getting on my nerves.

7
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,875
Anyway, this had been
bugging me forever.

8
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:37,750
Uh-huh?

9
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,250
[YUI]
So I finally asked,

10
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,416
and it turns out it's the word
for the back of your knee!

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
[MINOA]
What? Crazy!

12
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,458
Hello, everybody!

13
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,541
Uh-oh, it's the
production committee!

14
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,166
Try "student council."

15
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,083
Nobody laughed.
This must be serious.

16
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,625
Huh?

17
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,750
Alice spent way too much
money again, didn't she?

18
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,833
'Kay, that "again"
was not necessary.

19
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:29,916
Surprisingly, no!

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,458
"Surprisingly"?

21
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,666
We submitted our proposal for
the school festival, but...

22
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,916
Well, you explain.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,166
"An anime screening?
Come on, guys.

24
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,125
I refuse to accept that,"

25
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,000
says the council president.

26
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,583
That's not her voice.

27
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,833
Arts clubs are required to show
projects at the school festival

28
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,541
to demonstrate that
they've actually been

29
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,125
working on something.

30
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,666
So, unless you
can show something

31
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,208
you've actually created, I'm
afraid your proposal's rejected!

32
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,375
The whole purpose
of our club

33
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,250
is to watch and discuss anime.

34
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,666
Screening an anime is the
only thing that makes sense

35
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,125
for our club to do.

36
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,083
I'll talk to Tsubaki about this.

37
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,625
She's too busy to see you.

38
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,583
Either make something
awesome or pack your bags.

39
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,333
Huh?! I thought we were
done with this nightmare!

40
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,166
So we're dead, right?

41
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,833
We'll do something.

42
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,958
We've handled everything
else they threw at us.

43
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,125
There's no reason
for us to give up now.

44
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,333
[sighs]

45
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,166
We could make
a <i>doujinshi</i> , maybe.

46
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,958
We can do a concert
with cute costumes, of course.

47
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,500
I've got a whole notebook
full of battle anime ideas

48
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,833
that I can talk about
for hours and hours.

49
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,458
How about we invite
some voice actors

50
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,750
and hold a public recording?

51
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,583
Money, again?

52
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,500
I know!

53
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,000
Instead of talking about
anime, let's make one!

54
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,375
Uh...

55
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,875
Minoacchi, do have
any idea how much work

56
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,000
goes into anime?

57
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,291
Uh... Is it a whole bunch?

58
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,208
The writing, storyboards,
artwork, recording.

59
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,708
It takes a tremendous
number of people.

60
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,291
To be quite frank,

61
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,625
not even my Swiss bank account
could finance such a production.

62
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,166
Well, that's
because it's not real.

63
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,125
[MINOA]
Don't give up yet.

64
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,666
[gasps]

65
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,958
I want everyone to know how
much anime means to our club!

66
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,416
I want to make something
amazing with my friends!

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,125
And show the world!

68
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,583
In the face of
such enthusiasm,

69
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,583
how could I ever say no?

70
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:41,708
I see.

71
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,541
This is real money.

72
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,958
I knew you were rich,
but this is just sick.

73
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,625
I can't say no to that.

74
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,208
With this budget,
we can make an anime

75
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,500
that will bring the
world to its knees!

76
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Well, Miss President?

77
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,083
Yes, to the anime, but sorry,

78
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,208
I'm saying no to the money.

79
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,250
How can you do anything
without a budget, though?

80
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,250
Let's start by doing
some brainstorming,

81
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,166
then we'll see if the
other clubs can help.

82
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,291
We have three months
until the school festival.

83
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,416
Let's make an anime with
everything that we've got!

84
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,750
Okay.

85
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,041
Ah!

86
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,750
First, we need a good concept.

87
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,625
Anyone cooked up an idea yet?

88
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,958
I know what
you're all thinking,

89
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,916
but an idol anime
is the way to go.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,541
It'll take place right here.

91
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,791
They can have
the final dance-off

92
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,375
at our school festival!

93
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,666
A swirling cyclone of music
and passion and love!

94
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,166
If you want real passion,

95
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,791
then you'll find it in the
heat of battle, not in dance!

96
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,500
The protagonist in my tale
is the Mad King Kai!

97
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,833
I... I mean he,

98
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,041
commands the most
powerful magic in existence.

99
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:47,875
Its name?

100
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,166
Amethyst Extra Circulation!

101
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,000
If we're talking magic,
then how 'bout this?

102
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,625
These aren't just magical girls;
they're magic magical girls!

103
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,166
The new season of
<i>PreFae</i> is doing this,

104
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,833
so you know it's gold.

105
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,666
I came with one too!

106
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,625
It's based on that
anime I saw as a kid.

107
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,125
The main character's
separated from their family.

108
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,625
They use magic, they transform,
they pilot robots,

109
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,958
and at long last, they're
reunited with their mother.

110
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,541
Then, in the last episode,
they're welcomed into heaven.

111
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,375
There won't be a single dry eye
in the audience, I know it!

112
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,583
How many episodes
are you thinking here?

113
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh, like two seasons, I guess?

114
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,458
[KAI]
Keep dreaming.

115
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,583
[ALICE] None of these
are the least bit practical,

116
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,666
especially after you
so callously refused

117
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,166
to accept my funding.

118
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,625
Sebasu!

119
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,458
This is brought to you by the
Supreme Production Commander:

120
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,666
Me.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,458
[ALICE]
It is the galactic era.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,375
[ALICE]
A super robot saves the world

123
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,458
with love, passion and money.

124
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:57,083
[ALICE]
Super Warrior: Alice-borg!

125
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,833
Alpha!

126
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,000
[ALICE]
You will see the tears of money.

127
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,250
[ERICA] And you say
our ideas are impractical.

128
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,250
Right.

129
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,666
[MINOA]
That was so cool, though!

130
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,166
How did you make it?

131
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,041
[ALICE] Sebasu did
the script, storyboards,

132
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,541
key art, backgrounds,
photography,

133
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,041
and editing all by
himself just last night!

134
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,125
[KAI]
Who needs an anime club?

135
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,583
We'll just have
Sebasu do everything!

136
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,625
[sighs]

137
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,958
Now, I'm worried.

138
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,250
We got all pumped up,
but I wonder if we took on

139
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,208
a bit more than we can handle.

140
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,250
[MIKO] Then perhaps
I should remind you,

141
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,458
that you have a well-read
intellectual on your team,

142
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:36,333
who just so happens to have put
together the perfect pitch!

143
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,000
I propose an
alternate world story,

144
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,000
as they're the current trend.

145
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,583
Wait is it a whole season?

146
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,875
We can't do all that.

147
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:43,750
No.

148
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,125
It's three minutes long.

149
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,041
An anime short.

150
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,166
That makes sense!

151
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,541
Okay, that I think we can do!

152
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,041
It's just three minutes?

153
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,125
Since production schedules and
budgets are tight these days.

154
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,875
Every season, they make
a couple three minute

155
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,000
and five minute anime shows.

156
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,791
That's perfect for us!

157
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,958
The scriptwriter for
<i>Yasuda and Iwakura</i> had

158
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,000
to get really creative,
because the episodes

159
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,125
were only a minute and a
half long, but they used the

160
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,916
same thirty second shot
in the opening every time.

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,750
Some shorts, like <i>Immun-kun</i> ,
are based off of comic strips

162
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,833
and appeal to a wider audience
than most other anime.

163
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,458
In <i>Malcom Academy</i>
they brought together

164
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,625
a bunch of characters
from different RPGs

165
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,708
and kept all of their original
voice actors, making the

166
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,208
frankly insipid production
seem like a waste of talent.

167
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,791
<i>What's Up Girl Zoo</i>
or <i>Whagzoo</i> ,

168
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,833
was based off of an idol anime,
but for whatever reason,

169
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,250
they had a character die
in each episode of the shorts.

170
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,375
It's almost like a
race against time.

171
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,333
Stuffing as much
material as they can

172
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,958
into a little-bitty timeslot,
so the audience stays happy.

173
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,000
Also, they're really nice
to watch on your phone

174
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,000
when you have
five minutes to kill.

175
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,541
They're short enough
to marathon, too.

176
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,083
[KAI]
Mm. Mm.

177
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,416
That settles it.

178
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,583
Time to get rolling on
that screenplay, Mikocchi!

179
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,166
I've already worked
out the scenario,

180
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,916
so this should be
a piece of cake.

181
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,333
[ERICA]
Okay, script meeting number one!

182
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,708
Hope you enjoy my work.

183
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,875
The main character walks
through a shopping center door,

184
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,458
then he's in another world?

185
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,916
That's kind of mundane.

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,500
It sets up their need for
food in the alternate world.

187
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:18,166
We've got three minutes,
forget the food!

188
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,958
We've gotta end it
on a big tear-jerker.

189
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,750
After this, she'll transform!

190
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,208
My blood was
not boiling at all

191
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,791
when I read about these benign
special powers of theirs.

192
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,208
So I took the liberty
of rewriting the script.

193
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,916
There's no mid-story
climax to speak of.

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,833
We should add a concert.

195
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,708
[MINOA]
Where do the commercials go?

196
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,333
It's only three minutes long.

197
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,541
But wouldn't it be funny
if we added one?

198
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,541
Just bam!

199
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,333
Right in the
middle of the story!

200
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,666
Another lunchbreak
with no progress.

201
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,541
Feels like we're hitting a wall.

202
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,250
Turns out anime shorts
are quite formidable.

203
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,875
Trying to do a standalone story

204
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,458
with so little
time is difficult.

205
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,541
Hey, Mikocchi.

206
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,958
We still haven't
come up with anything,

207
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,666
even after all
these discussions,

208
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,625
so I really don't think
just tweaking the dialogue

209
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,833
or whatever is gonna cut it.

210
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,500
Let's scrap it.

211
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,916
Back to the
drawing board, I mean.

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,750
[MIKO]
All that was for nothing?

213
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,666
You can whip something
new up no prob, right?

214
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,333
Actually, I think you had
the right idea the first time.

215
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,125
Just rework it a bit.

216
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,416
Get it done
before school's over.

217
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,375
[MIKO] I'm sick of you
ordering me around!

218
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,958
And if my work was
good in the first place,

219
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,208
then why did you put me through
this, you bunch of jerks?

220
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm through with this!

221
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,583
Do it your damn self!

222
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,125
We kind of need her.

223
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,333
Production issues already.

224
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,250
[MIKO growls]
Don't stop me!

225
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,375
I'm going to sleep!

226
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,875
Right here and right now!

227
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,916
Ow!

228
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,833
Huh?

229
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,416
[ALICE] Those look like image
boards from some anime.

230
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,583
Huh?

231
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:41,583
Don't open that door?

232
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,375
I'm sorry!

233
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,833
I guess the old club
was making a short, too.

234
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,333
Wonder if they had any luck.

235
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,833
The concept looks like
a mess, so not likely.

236
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,416
You say that, but it has
everything we like in it.

237
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,333
No way!

238
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,333
It's like that anime
from my dream!

239
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,083
Okay, I know it looks
like a mess on paper

240
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,750
and maybe it was
a mess in motion too,

241
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,250
but it was also awesome!

242
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,166
It is like that one you
were talking about!

243
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,583
I think it'll be more fun

244
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,250
if we all make our own
characters and in our own style!

245
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,041
Let's try it!

246
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,458
That just might work!

247
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,666
Whatd'you say,
Mikocchi, you got this?

248
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,916
[MIKO]
Mmm... Nuh-uh.

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,125
Miko, baby, we need you!

250
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,708
You're a superstar, sweetheart.

251
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,875
You're the team MVP!

252
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,791
You're the only one here who can
bring this crazy thing together!

253
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,500
You're the one that polishes
that diamond and makes it shine!

254
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,541
[KAI]
We found our producer.

255
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,125
[ALICE]
She's perfect for it

256
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,708
I'll accept that
compliment and the job, too.

257
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,125
Now, let's figure out
everyone else's jobs.

258
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,583
I'll be the character
designer, naturally!

259
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,916
I'm good with computers,
so I'll do digital production!

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,958
You can leave
the audio work to me!

261
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,250
I guess Mr. Gomon will be
our production assistant then.

262
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,166
So, uh, what about me, then?

263
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,625
[ERICA] There's something
only you can do, Minoacchi.

264
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,666
Right.

265
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,750
Like taking out
the trash, you mean?

266
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,458
You're the director!

267
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,583
Wait, are you sure about this?

268
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,791
You're the one who
came up with the idea!

269
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,583
Work out the
details with Mikocchi

270
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,250
and once you have a script,
draw the storyboards.

271
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,375
Huuuh? Wait!

272
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,333
Help!

273
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,291
What's a storyboard?

274
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,041
[MIKO]
I leave my legacy to you.

275
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,083
[ERICA]
Nice work.

276
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,416
So now what am I supposed to do?

277
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,666
A storyboard?

278
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,041
Think of it as sort of
an "anime" blueprint.

279
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,916
You take the script and
then make rough sketches

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,708
that lay out the
action and direction

281
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,750
and alla that sorta stuff

282
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,208
Look at the scene composition
in other anime, first.

283
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,166
I'll try my best.

284
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,291
Maybe it'll make sense later.

285
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,458
[MAYA]
Mii, the bath is ready!

286
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,666
[MINOA] Uhh...
I think I'll take one in a bit.

287
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,833
Something going on?

288
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,833
[MINOA]
My club's making an anime.

289
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,750
So I'm trying to figure out
how storyboards work.

290
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh yeah?

291
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,125
Let me know if I can help, 'kay?

292
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,791
[MINOA] Actually,
we don't have a voice actress

293
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,000
for "Cute Girl A" yet!

294
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,333
You could do that, right?

295
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,458
Sure, I'm cute!

296
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,541
No problem!

297
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,541
[MINOA]
Now, I just need "Man A."

298
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,208
[coughs]

299
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,416
Are you sick or something?

300
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,291
Uh, no.

301
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,958
It's nothing.

302
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,375
[MIKO]
You took out the dialogue there.

303
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,875
Huh? Sorry!

304
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,041
It was kind of dragging on,

305
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,833
so I wanted to get
to the action sooner.

306
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,208
So as long as its flashy,

307
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,125
you can throw the
script writer to the dogs?

308
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,250
[MINOA] I'll see if
I can fit it back in later!

309
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,875
I promise! I promise!

310
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,125
The character designs
are coming along fine.

311
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,750
My character is super glamorous!

312
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,291
I can't wait to show you!

313
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,666
[laughs]

314
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,208
It's got too many details.

315
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,208
There's no way
we can animate that.

316
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,916
Try again.

317
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,291
[MINOA]
I leave my legacy to you.

318
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,208
[ERICA]
Nice work.

319
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,500
I'm not so sure.

320
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,583
You've changed so
many things from my draft.

321
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,041
Can we go over this again?

322
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,125
Everything's perfect, Miko Baby.

323
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,833
Minoacchi's just taking your
masterpiece and spicing it up.

324
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,541
Trust me, this'll look stellar
on your resume.

325
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,708
I guess that's true.

326
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,166
Are we cool?

327
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,250
Okay, now it's time to
kick this into high gear!

328
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,666
[MATSURI]
Miss President.

329
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,666
It seems that the
anime club's project

330
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,416
is progressing rather well.

331
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,875
[AYAME] It's gonna be
garbage, don't worry!

332
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,958
Is everybody ready in there?

333
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,500
Uh-huh!

334
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,666
[AURORA]
This is the moment

335
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,208
when the characters
really come to life.

336
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,500
So pour your hearts
into this, okay?

337
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,333
I'm some kinda magician?

338
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,750
Mm-hmm. Be yourself
and you'll do awesome!

339
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,625
Mister Kitty,
we just need you to meow!

340
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,208
I forgot to tell you, Nakano.

341
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,291
My sister has club practice,
so she couldn't make it today.

342
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,041
We can record
her separately later.

343
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,583
No big deal.

344
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,583
Okay, let's preview the video
so you get a sense

345
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,791
of how the timing will work.

346
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,166
Cool.

347
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,083
[YUI]
Black and white?

348
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,666
[AURORA]
Uh-huh.

349
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,083
The visuals aren't always done
by the time recording starts,

350
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,083
so we'll have to make do.

351
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,833
Actually, we're lucky to
have rough art to work with.

352
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,583
Sometimes, the actors don't
have anything but storyboards

353
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,791
or stand-in art to play off
of during dubbing.

354
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,708
Of course, you'd never guess
that just by watching the show,

355
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,375
because the voice actors give
it their all no matter what.

356
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,208
Summoning the character
forth, just like magic!

357
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,125
So yeah, that's what
you guys need to do.

358
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,541
Ready?! Okay, then!

359
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,750
Let's go!

360
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,083
Scha-winga!

361
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,041
[AURORA]
Stop, stop.

362
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,125
Alice, that's way
too much emotion.

363
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,708
Try to be more mech-like.

364
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,541
[ALICE] With all due respect,
I'm the main character.

365
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,333
I have to make an impression.

366
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,000
The robot's just the robot.

367
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:34,833
One more.

368
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,583
Are you sure?

369
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,291
Scha... Scha-wing.

370
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,666
Let's split the difference.

371
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,875
Come on.

372
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,916
I require more money.

373
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,041
Give me some more money.

374
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,333
Ha, ha, ha.

375
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,666
It's morphin' time!

376
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,250
[AURORA]
Stop, stop.

377
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,208
Erica, you're
breathing into the mic.

378
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,375
Watch those "H" sounds.

379
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,250
Also, Alice.

380
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,791
What this time?

381
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,250
Can you speak
the G-syllables

382
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,583
more through your nose, please?

383
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,833
A velar nasal.

384
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,416
Nasal what now?

385
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,625
It's something that
makes G-consonants sound

386
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,083
more pleasant to the ear.

387
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,333
[ALICE]
Sorry, I don't get it at all.

388
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,416
Your "g" there was too harsh.

389
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,791
Come forth!

390
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,000
Mighty Kaikai Blade!

391
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,500
I mean, Musashisakai--

392
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,250
[AURORA] Stop. We need
you to stick to the script.

393
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,625
[KAI]
The humiliation!

394
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,875
You may call me Yuirin!

395
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,458
And explosion magic
is the only magic for me!

396
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,500
You got it?

397
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,250
[AURORA]
Oh wow, you're good at this.

398
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,708
You really think so?

399
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,250
No, but I'll keep
that one to myself.

400
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,833
Meow.

401
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:42,250
[AURORA] Stop. More like
a cat and less like a man?

402
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,500
You're telling me to fly?

403
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,958
But that's impossible.

404
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,958
Together, anything
is possible for us.

405
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,458
Ohhh! Yes!

406
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,208
But you can do it
one more time if you like

407
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,708
or just do it all day
long while I watch!

408
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,250
After a valiant fight,
the Earth is safe once more.

409
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,458
[AURORA]
Okay, Minoa.

410
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,375
That's a wrap!

411
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,041
We did it!

412
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,416
What's this?

413
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,708
[AURORA]
For the wrap party, of course.

414
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,958
All of you did
a great job in there.

415
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,083
Now we need to match
the art to the dialogue

416
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,458
and add sound effects.

417
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,583
I can practically
see the finish line.

418
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,000
You think so?

419
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,333
We're that close, huh?

420
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,875
I mean, there's still
plenty of work left to do.

421
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,416
But thanks to everyone help,

422
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,541
we might actually pull this
off in time for the deadline!

423
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,791
Uh-huh!

424
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,541
Having the recordings
should speed things up!

425
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,791
You can't stop us!

426
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,041
[laughs]

427
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,500
Anime club, let's go!

428
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,083
[MASATO]
One more scene.

429
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,750
One more scene to go.

430
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,708
[ERICA] What do you mean the
ending theme isn't done yet?

431
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,458
We won't have it in time
for editing at this rate!

432
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,583
You're a failure as an artist
if you can't meet deadlines.

433
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,750
This is way off model,

434
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,541
it's nothing like
the design I drew.

435
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,541
You're saying you have
a problem with my art?

436
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,750
[ALICE]
Frankly, yes!

437
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,250
You want me to redraw all these?

438
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,625
If you could,
that'd be real nice!

439
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,750
[sighs]

440
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,041
So close.

441
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,125
[AYAME]
Miss President, I have bad news!

442
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,416
[MATSURI] The anime club's
project is actually shaping up,

443
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,875
I'm afraid.

444
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,041
I see.

445
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,208
Demand that all other clubs

446
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,041
cease their
cooperation with them.

447
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:34,125
Should they resist, their club
will be shut down immediately.

448
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:34,750
Uh...

449
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,833
That's a bit much.

450
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,125
[TSUBAKI]
Oh?

451
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,375
You're not questioning
my authority, are you?

452
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,083
Inform the clubs
before it's too late.

453
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,333
[AYAME, MATSURI]
Y-Yes, ma'am!

454
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,250
[TSUBAKI] Uhh...
One more thing you should know.

455
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,125
[chuckles]

456
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,500
[MINOA]
Ahh! It's perfect!

457
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,500
[KAI] Three more days
until the school festival!

458
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,291
I think we've got this!

459
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,500
[ALICE]
This is bad, you guys!

460
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,916
It's Mr. Gomon.

461
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,333
[MINOA]
What about him?

462
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,208
The production assistant
ran off alone?

463
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,083
I guess the pressure
was too much.

464
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,166
The concert band
says they aren't

465
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,250
doing the ending theme
for us anymore.

466
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,333
The broadcasting club
won't lend us the studio

467
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,833
to record the rest.

468
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,916
This is so sudden.

469
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,250
What happened?

470
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,791
[TSUBAKI] I have good news
for you, anime club.

471
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,208
We've prepared a special
venue for your big premier.

472
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,166
[TSUBAKI] The audience will
watch from the track field.

473
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,541
If you can't fill the seats,

474
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,416
your project will be
considered a failure.

475
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,375
Tsubaki, what is this?

476
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,458
[TSUBAKI]
Hmph!

477
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,083
Don't worry, I'm
sure your presentation

478
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,375
will be thoroughly entertaining.

479
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:52,541
[laughs]

480
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,041
There's no way.

481
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,333
We can't fill the whole track
with just one anime short.

482
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,333
I think we're dead this time.

483
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,875
For real.

484
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,375
I can do more than
meow this cat's got range.

485
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,458
What? You don't think
I was phoning it in, do ya?

486
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,375
How dare you!

487
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,750
I'm a professional!

488
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:39,833
Next time,

489
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,583
is the anime club
finally done for?

490
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,583
They better not be I still
need hear to my voice on TV!

491
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,875
And you'd better
watch it, too buddy!
