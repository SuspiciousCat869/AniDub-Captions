00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,958
[ERICA] And now, a toast,
to our smash hit anime premiere!

2
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,791
Cheers!

3
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,875
[ALL]
Cheers!

00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,500
[MINOA]
Great job, you guys!

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,750
Studios have one
afterparty for the recording

6
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,375
and another for the show?

7
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,791
[KAI] Yes, and they
can get quite lavish!

8
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,541
At least that's what I heard.

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,708
Can't really blame them, though.

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,916
You gotta feel like all
that pain was worth it.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,833
Supposedly, they hold
bingo competitions

12
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,083
and give out huge prizes.

13
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,791
I haven't heard
anything about bingo,

14
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,500
but I have seen pictures
on social media of cakes

15
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,333
with the characters
printed on them.

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,083
I imagine it's a good time to
make connections as well,

17
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,000
since the staff has
a rare opportunity

18
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,291
to leave their desks.

19
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,166
Ahhh. Hope I can go someday!

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,625
Since animators don't
go to fancy parties much,

21
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,250
I hear it's tough for them
to find something to wear.

22
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,708
And it can be a
challenge working

23
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,416
around everyone's schedules.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,833
The actors and staff might
have already started working

25
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,583
on new shows, after all.

26
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,708
[MASATO] It must be tough
being so popular, huh?

27
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,958
I bet the writers
feel out of place.

28
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,416
It's so awkward.

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,125
Why? I don't get it.

30
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,791
[MIKO]
A lot of time passes between

31
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:23,375
when the script is written and
when they hold the after-party.

32
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,625
Oh, I get it.

33
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,166
The rest of the staff
just finished the show,

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,041
so they're in a completely
different mood than the writers.

35
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,458
They'd be happier without us.

36
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,333
No one wants writers anymore.

37
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,416
Come on, that's not true at all!

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,708
Pro'bly.

39
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,416
So, you hear anything from
the student council president?

40
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,291
Apparently, she came
down with something.

41
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,375
I haven't even seen her
at school since the festival.

42
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,708
[MASATO] Well, that makes
it easier for us at least.

43
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,416
Maybe I got my hopes
up a bit too much.

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,083
I got so wrapped up
in our happy ending,

45
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,125
I thought we could
be friends again.

46
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,375
I didn't know what to expect,

47
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,958
but that anime of yours
sure got me fired up!

48
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,291
I'm glad you enjoyed it,

49
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,750
but I'd be a lot happier
if we'd actually finished.

50
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,083
The audience
didn't seem to mind,

51
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,208
so I'd still call it a win.

52
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,958
It seems like all of
our hard work paid off!

53
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,583
Sure wish it would work
out that way for me.

54
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,083
What d'you mean?

55
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,458
I gave it my best shot,

56
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,083
but it's never quite
good enough for the win.

57
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,333
[MIKO] Did something
happen at track practice?

58
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,375
[YUI]
No.

59
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,333
I just can't jump
like I want to.

60
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,000
[MINOA]
Like, the high jump?

61
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't seem to break my record.

62
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,375
Even though I practice
so hard every day.

63
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,583
That's a shame.

64
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,125
At times like these,
Musashisakai would say,

65
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,500
"Look to the saddle"!

66
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,166
Seems like sound advice.

67
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,375
Ah! Yeah!

68
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,541
<i>Nakimushi Saddle</i>
sure gets you pumped!

69
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,625
An anime?

70
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,125
It's a show about bike racing.

71
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,833
The characters are cute,
but it gets way intense!

72
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,416
Before you know it,
your heart starts racing

73
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,875
and you're cheering
at the TV like crazy!

74
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,375
It's not about track,

75
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,125
but I think you might find
it inspirational all the same.

76
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,291
[YUI]
Huh.

77
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,083
Sounds like it might be fun.

78
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,875
If you're interested...

That would be awesome!

82
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,291
Didn't know you
watched anime, Yui.

Mm-hmm. I do these days.

it's really fun.

But what's that song?

You don't know the
Hina song from <i>Saddle</i> ?

Y'know, it's the one

Glad you think so.

I'll see you in class, okay?

108

Bye!

109
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,125
Well, if it works for them,
I guess that's good.

110
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,458
A baseball anime?

111
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,083
The track club's kicking ass.

112
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,916
Our team needs to
step it up like them.

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,291
[PLAYERS]
We need anime!

114
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,750
I don't know.

115
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,125
You boys came
to the right club room.

Victory!

119
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,666
Sports anime does it all,
with a heaping helping of drama!

120
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,625
So, take your pick!

121
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,708
Indeed!

122
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,208
There are a
bevy of sports titles

123
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,250
that're considered
anime classics!

124
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,833
For baseball, there's
<i>Miracle Titans Mudou-kun</i> ,

125
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,083
or if you want something
more recent: <i>Ace of the Bench</i> !

126
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,541
Sports shows have
tons of characters,

127
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,000
so there's always
someone you can relate to!

128
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,250
Even the adversaries on rival
teams become fan favorites!

129
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,375
The uniforms are great,

130
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,416
and they're perfect
for cosplay, too!

131
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,916
It's even more fun

132
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,916
if you've got a whole team
of friends to do it with you!

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,375
Which, of course, you do.

134
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,375
The often-mocked
hyperbolic training scenes

135
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,333
and wildly impractical
techniques seem silly

136
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,666
from an outsider point of
view, but once you watch,

137
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,875
you'll want to try them too!

Makes sense to me.

00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,166
Thanks!

163
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,000
A robot competition, huh?

164
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,041
Then you need
<i>Tengen Bakuha Guden Daran</i> !

165
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,000
You'll be smashing through
both karma and fate!

166
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,708
Get ready to pierce the
heavens with your drill!

167
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,458
Yeah, big bro!

168
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,875
Your team doesn't
have a single win yet?

169
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,875
Simple enough!

170
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,958
Then <i>Slash Dunk</i> and <i>Tarako's</i>
<i>Basketball</i> are all you need!

171
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:12,000
If you give up,
the game's already over.

172
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,291
Anime club, I want
to play basketball!

173
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,666
Well, well, look at you, the
fancy-pants popular kids club!

174
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,375
I don't get it, either.

175
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,625
Hi-ya!

176
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,583
Prepare yourself!

177
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,791
It's time to unleash
the Frozen World!

178
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,750
I'll annihilate the
opposition basket and all!

179
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,166
Cower before my
Hammer of Destruction!

180
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,416
[ALICE] You want to
get better at mahjong?

181
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,750
Then just watch <i>Shake</i> !

182
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,916
Wow, mahjong sure
is fun, isn't it?

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,958
A band competition coming up?

184
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,708
Then <i>Timbre! French Horn</i>
is the anime for you!

185
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,583
Be sure to stand on a bridge and
yell, "I want to get better!"

186
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,583
I liked it better
when it was quiet in here.

187
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,708
[STUDENT A]
Hey, it's a kitty!

188
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,333
Are you part of the club, too?

189
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,375
He's just like Yabanyan, huh?

190
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,916
[STUDENT A]
So cute!

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,375
[MISTER KITTY]
Aw, cut it out.

192
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,125
Ok. See you later!

193
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,666
[MISTER KITTY]
Meow meow, ladies!

194
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,083
On second thought,

195
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,291
no harm in helping out
some cuties from time to time!

196
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,750
[AURORA]
I agree.

197
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,625
As long as
everyone's having fun,

198
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,291
why shouldn't we
share the joy of anime

199
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,000
with all the other clubs?

200
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,291
[MISTER KITTY]
Fair enough.

201
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,500
[MINOA]
Well, I guess so, but...

202
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,875
Wait! You were just chatting

203
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,541
with Mister Kitty
like it was normal!

204
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,875
You know he can talk?

205
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,125
[AURORA]
Mm-hmm.

206
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,833
By the way, do you know
what's my favorite part

207
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,666
of sports anime is?

208
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,250
Panning shots,
repeated in turbo!

209
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,375
Three in a row,
with big sound effects!

210
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,125
And old school
sketch filters, too.

211
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,000
[MISTER KITTY] Complete
with lights that go "shing!"

212
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,500
Not only are they friends,

213
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,916
they're in their own
little world without me.

214
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,666
[YUI]
Minoa!

215
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,666
Hey, what's up?

216
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,875
You tell me!

217
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,708
Sounds like the
anime club's hot stuff now!

218
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,666
You must be happy, huh?

219
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,541
Oh, these?

220
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,375
The robotics club
whipped them up for me.

221
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,500
Sweet, huh?

222
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,958
My speed is gonna
go through the roof!

223
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,375
[MINOA]
Huh?

224
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,500
[YUI] They said they got
the idea from some anime.

225
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,791
I mean, they look neat,
but isn't that cheating?

226
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,666
All I needed to break my record
was some robo foot wear!

227
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,541
'Kay, I'm heading
back to practice.

228
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,416
[MINOA]
Uhm...

229
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,291
Engage Dash Mode.

230
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,291
Yui, no!

231
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,000
Yikes! Are you okay?

232
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:32,833
You kidding?

233
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,166
That was awesome!

234
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,541
So cool.

235
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,750
[TORU] Obata, what have
I told you about Dash Mode?

236
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,833
Are you pumped for this
week's <i>Show Up Rockin'</i> ?

237
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,958
We could watch
it together, Minoa!

238
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,250
Dad is a fragile person,

239
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,458
you shouldn't break
his heart like that.

240
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,416
Hey, you're in the school
lacrosse club, right?

241
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,916
What do you guys do
at your practices?

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,416
Just the usual.

243
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,000
About what you'd expect.

244
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,708
There's a lot of
sprinting, I guess.

245
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,375
We practice our swinging.
That sorta thing.

246
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,875
Hypothetically, if you
could make a robo stick

247
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,416
that let you shoot super far,
then would you?

248
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,791
I don't need robo parts.

249
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,041
That'd be cheating.

250
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,333
That would only happen
in anime, obviously.

251
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,208
No kidding, huh?

252
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,791
[KAI] Ah, the martial arts club
is really working hard!

253
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,083
Their new training grounds
are coming along nicely!

254
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,666
Is all of that really necessary?

255
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,625
[ALICE] I heard they're going to
duel at the top of that pyramid.

256
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,750
[MINOA] Huh?!
That sounds super dangerous!

257
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:29,750
[ALICE]
Look, Minoa.

258
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,208
The volleyball go club!

259
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,916
[MINOA]
How does that work?

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,833
It's time.

261
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,500
Now, face your destiny!

262
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,958
This is the Hand of God!

263
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,208
Behold!

264
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,333
Our expert advice has
transformed their boring clubs

265
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,125
into something magnificent!

266
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,458
You're right!

267
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,833
It's like the whole school
is brimming with life!

268
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,250
Oh good, we found
you guys just in time.

269
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,500
The robotics club is
testing its prototype,

270
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,041
and you don't wanna miss it!

271
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,083
The fateful test launch begins!

272
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,291
[ALICE]
Let's go watch, Minoa!

273
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,166
Hold on.

274
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,416
A prototype of what now?

275
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,750
[SCIENCE BOY A]
King Sakaneko, test version one!

276
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,708
Legs-only prototype!

277
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,333
Activate!

278

[SCIENCE BOY A] Our scientific
prowess is unrivaled!

279
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,250
Bow before me!

280
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,791
Oh, that looks bad.

281
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,333
Real bad.

282
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,625
Well, hey, look at that.

283
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,291
You came prepared!

284
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,583
[KAI]
How strange.

285
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,291
It's usually the
mass-productions models

286
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,750
that are evil and go
roaring out of control.

287
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,041
Maybe they haven't
found the right pilot yet.

288
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,583
[ALICE]
Taking bets.

289
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,625
When do you think they'll get
that robot running properly?

290
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,625
Big news you guys!

291
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,916
Jeez, you're excited!

292
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,166
What's up?

293
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,375
[MASATO] A TV station
wants to interview us!

294
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,458
About what?

295
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,750
I'm clueless about TV.

296
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,750
It's just the
magic anime box to me!

297
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,333
[MASATO]
Well, that's fine,

298
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,375
'cause it turns out that this
has everything to do with anime!

299
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,208
They said they're doing
a special on our club,

300
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,333
'cause we revolutionized
the whole school

301
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,833
with the power of anime!

302
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,708
[MEMBERS gasp]

303
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,000
And we have you to thank!

304
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,500
Splendid work!

305
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,708
We'll be famous!

306
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,666
Amazing!

307
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,125
Uh-huh.

308
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,333
Look out, world!

309
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,000
Our era has arrived at last!

310
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,666
We're coming for you!

311
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,500
It's my big TV debut,
I can't believe it!

312
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,041
Why, yes, this beautiful,
young light novel author

313
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,083
would like a book deal.

314
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,708
I wonder what I should wear?

315
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,291
You think I should cosplay?

316
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,708
Oh! A shave!

317
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,375
I need a decent shave!

318
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,250
I can't let them know my secret.

319
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,291
I shall conceal the power of my
evil eye in front of the camera!

320
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,333
Ah...

321
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,416
Autographs!

322
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,875
I need to make a signature!

323
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,791
[MINOA]
Uh, see you guys tomorrow.

324
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,333
Everyone seems so happy.

325
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,833
I don't want to rain
on their parade.

326
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,833
The people in the other
clubs are having fun too.

327
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,541
But I dunno.

328
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,666
You feel like the
whole world's gone crazy,

329
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,041
and you're the
only one out there

330
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,125
who's got her head screwed
on straight anymore?

331
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,083
[MINOA]
Mm-hmm.

332
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,583
Well, don't worry,
you're not alone, kid.

333
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,833
You've always had someone
at your side you can count on.

334
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,250
[MINOA]
Huh?

335
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,791
[MINOA]
Like Alice?

336
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,708
[MISTER KITTY]
Oh, come on!

337
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,875
Ugh. I'm done here!

338
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,083
You need support,
get it from him.

339
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,625
[MINOA]
Wait, who?

340
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,750
You left by yourself all of a
sudden, so I was a bit worried.

341
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,625
There's something worthwhile

342
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,166
you got out of the
anime club, isn't there?

343
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,416
Something irreplaceable?

344
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,708
I guess there's a whole
bunch of things I got, really.

345
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,250
Alice and Miko.

346
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,333
You and Kaikai and Erica.

347
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:50,916
Something to love and
people to talk to about it.

348
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,333
And happy memories, too.

349
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,458
More than I can count!

350
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,833
That's right.

351
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,500
Because anime has the power
to bring people together

352
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,666
and to bring them happiness too.

353
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,500
That's exactly what's
happening at our school.

354
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,916
[MINOA]
Huh?

355
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,666
[AURORA] Just like anime
brought us together, it gave us

356
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,541
a connection to all
the other students.

357
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,916
It would be wrong of us not to
share our happiness with them.

358
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,500
It works out best
for everyone this way!

359
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,000
You haven't done anything wrong

360
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,000
and neither has anyone
else in the anime club.

361
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,375
Otherwise, they wouldn't
be putting us on TV.

362
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,750
[MINOA]
You're right.

363
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,791
I didn't think of it that way.

364
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,166
[MASATO]
The Sakaneko Anime Club.

365
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,500
Believes that all
activities can benefit

366
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,083
from anime-style training.

367
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,375
And we're seeing
the results already!

368
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,541
My idea, by the way.

369
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,041
I admit, it seems
a bit absurd at first,

370
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,000
but if you want to break
through your shell and exceed

371
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,458
your limits, a certain degree
of daring is necessary.

372
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,750
In other words,
to achieve the impossible,

373
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,541
you can't be held
back by reality!

374
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,791
That's my philosophy!

375
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,375
That's my passion!

376
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,666
Free ideas, unrestrained
by common sense.

377
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,666
I think that unique approach
is what draws people to anime.

378
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,375
In our imagination,
humanity knows no limits.

379
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,291
Creativity gives us the strength
to believe we can go anywhere.

380
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,083
And that's the power of anime.

381
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,083
She's right!

382
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:15,958
Of course!

383
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,500
'Cause that's what I taught her!

384
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,291
This guy!

385
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,500
Anime Master, right here!

386
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,291
[TORU]
It's a new record!

387
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,291
[MINOA] Oh my gosh,
Yui, that was so cool!

388
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:49,750
That was crazy!

389
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,083
Congratulations!

390
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,875
I have you to thank!

391
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,291
I never even dreamed I could
accomplish something like this,

392
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,708
till you got me into anime!

393
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,208
[AURORA]
You haven't done anything wrong

394
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:04,041
and neither has anyone
else in the anime club.

395
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,250
[MINOA]
I was wrong.

396
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,208
This is wonderful!

397
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,750
I know it isn't much,
but here's a little "thank you."

398
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,541
Here take it. It's money.

399
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,291
[MASATO]
Oh, no, I can't.

400
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,166
It's no big deal,
Mr. Gomon, just take it.

401
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,208
We'll add it to our club budget.

402
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,750
[MASATO]
Uh, I dunno.

403
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:27,041
[AURORA] Just imagine,
you could buy another VHD deck.

404
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,625
[MASATO]
Very kind of you.

405
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,708
Great work you guys.

406
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,541
Think it's 'bout time
to call it a day.

407
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,791
[STUDENTS]
Okay.

408
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,291
[ALICE] What shall I
watch when I get home?

409
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,333
[MINOA]
How 'bout <i>Dirlish Bumper</i> ?

410
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,791
[MIKO] I like the
lead girl in that one.

411
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,375
She's really silly.

412
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,708
What was her catchphrase again?

413
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,833
With the laugh?

414
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,416
[ALICE]
It's in the bag! Gahaha!

415
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,625
Tsubaki is texting me?

416
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,916
[ERICA]
"Be careful"?

417
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,458
What the heck?

418
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,583
[MATSURI]
We have an announcement to make!

419
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,000
[AYAME] By order of the school,
the anime club...

420
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,916
...is hereby shut down!

421
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,458
[MATSURI]
They ignored us!

422
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,458
[ERICA] Yeah yeah,
heard that one before.

423
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,375
You two are becoming
comedic relief villains.

424
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,541
Not a good look.

425
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,750
[AYAME growls]

426
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,458
Sorry, but your mockery
comes to an end now.

427
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,583
Why, you ask?

428
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,250
Because the person
shutting you down...

429
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,916
...is none other
than this man here!

430
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,083
[MASATO]
The principal!

431
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,541
Is that who it is?

432
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,041
Never seen him before.

433
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,708
Yeah, not ringing
any bells here.

434
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,166
Are you kidding me?

435
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,166
You see him at the
front gate every morning,

436
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,208
you absolute imbeciles!

437
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,583
I'm still not piecing
this together.

438
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,791
[ALICE, MINOA]
His artwork's off model!

439
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,125
[MASATO]
Girls, stop.

440
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,041
[OGIKUBO] I never
thought I would step foot

441
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,583
in this room again.

442
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,583
Let alone under
circumstances like these.

443
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,750
"A-Again"?

444
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,000
[AYAME] Anyway, it's an order
from the principal this time,

445
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,333
so you don't get
to save your club

446
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,125
with some absurd challenge.

447
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,500
Yeah! But this is tyranny!

448
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,291
Do you even have a
reason to shut us down?

449
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,458
Sakaneko Academy Codebook.

450
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,000
Article 13 Section 2:
A club shall not receive money

451
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,166
for its activities
outside of allocations

452
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,125
approved by the academy itself.

453
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,583
[MASATO]
Receiving money?

454
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,875
Who's receiving money?

455
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,916
What did you do?

456
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,291
Not a darn thing!

457
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,000
[AURORA]
Come on, Mister Gomon.

458
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,750
I saw you take the money myself,
you might as well come clean.

459
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,750
I'm being honest.

460
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,333
The TV crew wrote a check.

461
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,250
And before you ask,
there was no mistaking it.

462
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,041
They were perfectly clear.

463
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,083
Wha...? But why?

464
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:15,791
Hah. You already bought
a new deck, didn't you?

465
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,041
[ALICE]
Mr. Gomon!

466
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,833
Don't spend club funding
without asking us first!

467
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,708
[MIKO]
You are so out of touch here.

468
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:27,916
Ahem! At any rate, the club is
now defunct, and Mister Gomon,

469
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,791
you're suspended from your job.

470
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,750
No way!

471
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,666
You've done well.

472
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,375
Much appreciated.

473
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,000
Nakano, why?

474
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,791
What is this?

475
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,458
Aurora!

476
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,416
What the hell, Aurora?

477
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,125
You're our friend!

478
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,541
Do me a favor.

479
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't call me that
name ever again.

480
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:04,708
[AURORA laughs]

481
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,250
A traitor must

Next time, betrayal.
I know your name well!
