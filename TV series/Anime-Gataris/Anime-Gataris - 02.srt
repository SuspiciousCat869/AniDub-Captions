1
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,541
Rise, robot!

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,166
Huh?

3
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,875
This is the part
where you stand up!

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,833
You're a rather
stubborn one, aren't you?

5
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,416
Sebasu!

6
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,291
Better!

7
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,500
Much better!

8
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:40,166
[ALICE laughs]

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,708
Uh, uh?!

10
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,041
Now, up!

11
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,750
[MINOA]
Huh?!

12
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,666
[ALICE]
Well? Which anime is it?

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,958
Do you remember now?

14
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:05,166
Come on!
Pull it together, already!

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,125
[MINOA shrieks]

16
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,583
[tumbling sound]

17
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,625
[MINOA groans]

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,333
These anime dreams
are getting kinda weird.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,666
[MAYA]
Mii, is everything okay?

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,000
[MINOA]
Huh?

21
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,208
What on earth was with
all the screaming in here?

22
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,375
Did you fall out
of bed or something?

23
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,666
Yeah. I'm fine.

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,041
Just a bad dream.

25
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:27,916
Did you sleep?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,583
You look so tired

27
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,250
Where'd you get all
those DVDs? School?

28
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, I brought
them from school.

29
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,625
You could say they're
part of my homework.

30
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,041
[ALICE]
Never fear.

31
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,833
I shall lend you a small
selection of beginners titles

32
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,916
from my humble library.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,833
[sighs]

34
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,250
Mii, you're up awfully
early for a change!

35
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,041
[MINOA]
Yeah, I have club work.

36
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,208
Really?

37
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,041
You joined a club
without even telling me?

38
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:56,916
That's awesome!

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,250
What's the club?

40
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,875
It's the anime club.

41
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,458
[AI]
That's unexpected.

42
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,375
[MINOA]
Yeah.

43
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,416
But, wait.

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,375
You don't even
watch anime, do you?

45
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,958
Well, not much.

46
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,458
[YUI]
Minoa!

47
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,041
I called yesterday,
but you didn't answer.

48
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,291
You did? Ah!

49
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,666
This what you're
lookin' for kiddo?

50
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,750
Sorry, some crazy stuff was
going down and things got messy.

51
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,666
Long as you're okay!

52
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,041
No big deal!

53
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,416
Uh, lovely morning,
huh, Kamiigusa?

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,250
[ALICE]
That it is.

55
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,416
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Uh, hi!

56
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,708
[ALICE]
Good day to you.

57
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,791
Uh, morning, Kamiigusa.

58
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,833
Good morning.

59
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,500
[MALE STUDENT B]
She said, "Good morning"!

60
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,416
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
Like a poor person!

61
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,166
[MINOA]
You made these?

62
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,083
[ALICE] How else are we
supposed to find new recruits?

63
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,500
Right, new recruits.

64
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,291
One sec I'll--

65
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,958
Sebasu!

66
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:13,916
[MINOA]
Huh?

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,083
Ah?! What? What? What?

68
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,416
[ALICE] Come on, chop, chop!
Get those clothes off!

69
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,250
[MINOA]
What're you doing?

70
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,708
[ALICE]
Now, don't be shy!

71
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,583
I can assure you it's all in
the name of productivity!

72
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,000
[YUI]
What?!

73
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,625
[MINOA]
What is this for, exactly?

74
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,958
I did research on
recruitment strategies.

75
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,041
It turns out that bunny girls
are the way to go!

76
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,500
You could ask first!

77
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,125
[ALICE]
Less crying, more recruiting!

78
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,416
The school anime club
is back in action

79
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,166
and looking for new members!

80
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:45,958
C'mon.

81
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,833
You too!

82
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,166
Uh, the anime club...

83
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,583
[ALICE]
You'll have to be louder.

84
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,041
But, my clothes.

85
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,583
Minoa, are you okay?

86
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,833
Pardon me, but don't you have
track practice to attend to?

87
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,791
Uh! Yeah. I do.

88
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,208
Yui!

89
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,791
Good luck, pal.

90
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,250
[MINOA]
Don't leave me!

91
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,750
Now, shall we try again?

92
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,958
You like anime?

93
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,541
Come join our club!

94
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,791
[MINOA]
Well, I'm already here, I guess.

95
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,916
Hey! Anyone like anime?

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,375
[ALICE]
Come join our club!

97
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,166
[MINOA]
Here! Please! Take a flier!

98
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,833
You know any anime fans?

99
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,416
[MINOA]
Uh, join the anime club!

100
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,083
Pretty please?

101
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,250
[ALICE]
Like anime?

102
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,625
[MINOA]
Here, take a flier.

103
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,708
[MALE STUDENT C]
Weirdoes.

104
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,208
[ALICE]
Sign-ups start at lunch break.

105
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,416
Please stop by!

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,750
[MINOA] Anime club,
looking for recruits!

107
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,083
[ALICE]
Please take a flier!

108
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,000
[MINOA] Sign up today
at lunch or after school!

109
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,708
Do you like anime?

110
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,208
H-Hi, you like anime?

111
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,833
[ALICE]
Come check out our club!

112
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,250
Sign-ups start
today during lunch!

113
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,583
We'll need someone on
staff to supervise the club.

114
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,750
You mean like a teacher
who's really into anime?

115
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,041
No way.

116
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,291
I'd much rather have
someone who doesn't care,

117
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,041
so they'll stay out
of our business.

118
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,500
It's kind of late
in the semester.

119
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,916
I imagine everyone
is too busy by now.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,375
I suppose they would
have to be terribly bored.

121
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,666
[MASATO]
Man, I am bored.

122
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,250
Just crackin my arm.

123
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,291
Crackin my arm.
Cracky crack crack.

124
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,916
An anime club, huh?

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,833
You're our only hope.

126
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,166
You got a room?

127
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,041
[MINOA] Yes, at the
far end of the third floor.

128
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,958
[MASATO]
The far end, you say?

129
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,166
Okay.

130
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,083
You can go ahead and
put my name down then.

131
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,125
[MINOA, ALICE]
Thank you, sir.

132
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,375
I'm not gonna, like,
do anything, though.

133
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm a very busy man, you see.

134
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,458
Uh-huh.

135
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,416
I hope lots of people come!

136
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,583
I'd love to find more people

137
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,083
as passionate as
you are about anime

138
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,125
Hey, did you watch
<i>Thousand</i> last night?

139
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,166
Huh? It comes
on at like, midnight.

140
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,666
I'll catch it on stream later.

141
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,958
Unacceptable! No matter how
you may "tire, face" anime

142
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,583
in real time or not at all!

143
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,250
Huh? Tire face?

144
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,125
[ALICE]
Are you even listening to me?

145
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,083
Uhm, can you explain, please?

146
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,916
What if you ran into
spoilers on the internet

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,791
before you could
watch the episode?

148
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,541
Everything would be ruined!

149
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,916
For an anime club member,

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,458
that would be a shame
that could never be erased!

151
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,875
I... I didn't know!

152
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,875
Don't you dare miss
<i>Gaka Stray Dogs</i> tomorrow.

153
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,875
Is there something wrong?

154
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,333
Koenji?

155
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,625
Wait, what?

156
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,875
You're joining the club?

157
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,166
Cool!

158
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,458
Indeed.

159
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,791
But... I-I thought you
were more into literature,

160
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,250
since you're always
reading those books

161
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,541
with the long titles.

162
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,708
Sure you're not
too fancy for this?

163
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,666
These days,
light novels are infamous

164
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,791
for having excessively long,
complicated titles.

165
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,750
Light what?

166
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,083
They're short novels.

167
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,375
Often fantasies
or school dramas.

168
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,541
They're usually
targeted at teenagers,

169
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,458
but they have a broad audience.

170
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,125
They tend to have
cute artwork, as well

171
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,250
<i>Sold Out Online</i> was a big one.

172
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,625
<i>The Melancholy</i>
<i>of Happy Vuvuzela</i> .

173
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,416
They often become anime
and make a stir every season.

174
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,708
A stir, huh?

175
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,708
[ALICE] Is that
what you're into, Koenji?

176
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,750
[MIKO] Indeed, I try to
watch all the adaptations.

177
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,583
[ALICE] That includes
<i>Ru: Zero</i> , I presume?

178
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,166
Yes. It's quite good.

179
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,583
[MINOA]
Um...

180
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,458
Team Am? Or Emily?

181
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,666
I don't have a team.

182
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,416
I think they're all adorable.

183
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,333
Except "Peekle Juice," but of
course, he's still my favorite.

184
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,041
You have sophisticated tastes!

185
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,791
My brain is trembling!

186
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,541
It's nice. Am's voice
actress really fit my image.

187
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,375
All of this stuff
makes sense to them!

188
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,333
I always saw you
reading light novels,

189
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,583
but I never said anything.

190
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,166
I should've talked to
you about anime sooner.

191
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,041
[MINOA] You read those
complicated-title books, too?

192
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,416
If the anime is good enough,
I might be inspired

193
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
to take a look at the
original afterwards.

194
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,791
[MINOA] You don't ever
read the novels first?

195
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,208
[ALICE]
No, why?

196
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,000
Whenever a light novel I really
like gets an adaptation,

197
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,291
seeing all my favorite scenes
animated is the best part.

198
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,583
Seems like that would make
the anime boring, though.

199
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,833
The story would
already be spoiled.

200
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,750
If that's how you feel,
then does that mean

201
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,041
you never watch your favorite
shows a second time?

202
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:40,916
Of course, not.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,250
I watch them plenty of times.

204
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,333
You notice little plot
details you missed,

205
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,375
or you can focus on
the animation and music

206
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,583
and things like that.

207
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,500
You watch the same
show more than once?

208
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,916
And you don't?

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,833
I don't know. Okay. So, uh...

210
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,750
I should definitely try reading
the light novels first then?

211
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,458
Well, if there's an
anime adaptation,

212
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,375
you might as well
start out with that.

213
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,125
You don't understand at all.

214
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,208
[gasps]

215
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,375
[MINOA]
Whoa!

216
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,416
Let's calm down!

217
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,833
[ERICA]
'Sup guys.

218
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,375
I'm Erica Aoyama,
Class 3-B, here to join.

219
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,375
[MINOA]
A senior?

220
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,375
Nice!

221
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,916
We're all freshmen.

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,291
So, I was worried we wouldn't
have any upperclassmen join.

223
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,666
Let me just say,

224
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,583
your bunny girl outfits
this morning were on point.

225
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,875
That's very kind of you.

226
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,875
On the upside, I'm glad all
that embarrassment paid off!

227
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,541
I'm sorry I ever doubted you!

228
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,625
It's fine.

229
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,916
I'm so glad you
showed up too, Koenji!

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,458
Sure.

231
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,916
[MINOA] So why don't we have
Aoyama be the club president,

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,708
since she's the oldest?

233
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,958
[ALICE]
Is that fine with you, Aoyama?

234
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,208
Call me Erica.

235
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,416
Erica it is then.

236
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,916
You wanna be our club president?

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,875
No problem.

238
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,083
I can totally do "president."

239
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,166
"Fall before my
beautiful technique!"

240
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,625
Stuff like that?

241
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,791
"Don't let your guard down,
or I'll steal your heart."

242
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,458
Now, that's what
I'm talking about!

243
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah? That was really good?

244
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,541
I, uh...

245
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,083
Gonna pawn off all the hard work
on your upperclassmen, huh?

246
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,458
"I see right through you."

247
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,500
[ALICE laughs]
I love it!

248
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,916
Okay?

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,708
Whatever. Works for me.

250
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,166
Oh my gosh, thanks!

251
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,208
That's four.

252
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,666
Just two more.

253
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,583
I have someone in mind already.

254
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,541
You'll get it as soon
as you meet him.

255
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,083
Danger approaches.

256
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,208
Danger approaches. Hyah!

257
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,291
[ERICA]
Kaikai.

258
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,416
[KAI]
Hmm?

259
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,666
Huh? It's the weird book guy!

260
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,125
You got a sec to talk?

261
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,500
Certainly not!

262
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,625
Can you not sense the
arcane energy accosting us?

263
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,333
He's putting up a barrier.

264
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,666
For real?

265
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,958
That's Kaikai from Class 2-B.

266
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,833
[KAI]
My true name is...

267
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,125
...Musashisakai kai!

268
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,208
So, you done with the barrier?

269
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,208
You're gonna join
the anime club, right?

270
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,666
Anime club?

271
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,666
It takes tremendous power
to penetrate my barrier.

272
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,583
[chuckles]

273
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,875
A mighty wind is beckoning
me to be by your side!

274
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,791
So, on <i>Old Game</i> your
favorite character is Run?

275
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,625
And on <i>Gaka Stray Dogs</i> ,
you like Picasso and Dali?

276
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,666
[ALICE]
They're moe.

277
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,583
I see. You watch
for the characters.

278
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,916
Kaikai here's into
mech battle anime.

279
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,875
[ERICA]
Mikocchi's into light novels.

280
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,125
[MIKO] <i>Gekisen Garumu</i> was
a particular favorite of mine.

281
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,166
[ERICA]
Minoacchi.

282
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,291
Uh-huh?

283
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,250
Are you okay?

284
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,833
You keeping up with us?

285
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,791
Heh heh... Actually,
I hardly understand anything.

286
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,041
You guys are awesome, though!

287
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,791
Why did you enter our domain?

288
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,875
Just a burning curiosity?

289
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,208
I'm having a great time!

290
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,916
I mean, I'm confused,

291
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
but it feels like I'm stepping
into this amazing new world!

292
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,166
[KAI] The gate you've opened
does not easily close.

293
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,458
So, hey, what's with the cat?

294
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,916
[MINOA]
Good question.

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,041
I found him in the closet
and he keeps hanging around.

296
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,958
[KAI] Rather ugly
for a mascot character.

297
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,041
Well... Lunch is ending.

298
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,833
Let's meet again
after school, team.

299
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,083
[ALICE]
Very well then.

300
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,291
[MISTER KITTY]
Yo.

301
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,333
Hey, something up?

302
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,375
[MISTER KITTY]
You're a real fish out of water.

303
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,666
Am I?

304
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,791
You don't know jack
about anime, do you, kid?

305
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,458
Nuh-uh. Sorry.

306
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,666
[MISTER KITTY] Hmm...
I think we can work it out.

307
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,333
Huh?

308
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,833
Sit back and learn.

309
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,500
If they're talking about anime,
don't change the subject.

310
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,750
Just listen and
pick up what you can.

311
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,291
Okay! That sounds
like solid advice to me!

312
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,208
So, do you have
a name, little kitty?

313
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,666
That's a tough question.

314
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,916
I've gone by many.

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,791
In that case,
can I just call you Whiskers?

316
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,125
That's a little on the nose.

317
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,916
Well, how about Michael, then?

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,125
Cheese? Or Baron? Or Tom, maybe?

319
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,333
Oh, Dorae--

320
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,958
[MISTER KITTY]
Don't say it!

321
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,458
Fine. How 'bout Mister Kitty?

322
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,750
Works for me.

323
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,333
A little basic, but good!

324
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,583
Oh, by the way,

325
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,416
did you take something
out of that room?

326
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,083
The storage closet, I mean.

327
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,916
Huh?

328
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,166
Don't think so.

329
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,791
Not that I remember.

330
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:25,583
[MISTER KITTY]
I see.

331
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,291
Then close the door!

332
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,500
If you're staying here, you
need to make me two promises.

333
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,041
First don't tell your little
friends that I can talk.

334
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,875
Second, keep the door closed!

335
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,208
'Kay.

336
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,625
[ANNOUNCER] The choir
will be meeting at 4:00 today

337
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,833
to discuss the
upcoming competition.

338
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,166
So, Koenji,

339
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,333
have you always been
into light novels, or what?

340
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,375
I've liked reading
since I was little.

341
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,833
And anime?

342
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,208
[MIKO] I got hooked
on adaptations

343
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,875
of my favorite books.

344
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,250
Oh, I get it now!

345
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,458
That's so cool!

346
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,458
It's cool?

347
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,083
[MINOA]
Yeah! You have this, like,

348
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,583
love and devotion to something!

349
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,166
[MIKO] I like books because
I can enjoy them on my own.

350
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,375
Huh?

351
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,416
I don't do well in
most social situations.

352
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,458
Like you saw, when it
comes to something I love,

353
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,250
I tend to be a bit sensitive.

354
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,916
I can be a real pain.

355
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,833
I'm sorry.

356
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:20,916
No way!

357
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,791
You're just enthusiastic!

358
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,125
We'll have to take a club trip

359
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,125
and check out
the anime hot spots.

360
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,250
Our holy grounds?

361
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,916
Tama, Tachikawa,
and Hachioji for sure.

362
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,833
Kawagoe and
Kawasaki will be mandatory.

363
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,791
I insist on Oarai.

364
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,333
All of those are close.

365
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,250
Why don't we all go to Nagano
for a ski trip or something?

366
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,666
Never mind.

367
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,875
We'll have to go to all
of the big events together!

368
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,458
Next year's Anime Jipang is one!

369
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,666
Anihaku and Anisute for sure.

370
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,125
And Comiboot, please.

371
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,958
What if we did a tour
of local school festivals?

372
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,958
I guess not.

373
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,166
[MINOA]
Wow, I really don't fit in.

374
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,541
It's fine, Asagaya.

375
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,791
Just keep watching anime

376
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,625
and you'll catch up
to us soon enough!

377
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,166
There's kind of a lot to cover.

378
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,833
I can give it my best, though.

379
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,125
[chuckles]

380
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,208
What makes a "classic" anime?

381
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:18,958
Huh?

382
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,791
What defines a classic?

383
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,333
It has to be fun, right?

384
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,208
Good answer!

385
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,291
Yet "fun" is a nebulous concept.

386
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,333
It differs from viewer
to viewer and era to era.

387
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,000
Do you follow?

388
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,000
That makes sense.

389
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,750
But... there are
certain features

390
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,458
that automatically make
an anime a classic.

391
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,875
Like what?

392
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,750
[ALICE] An anime with running
during the end credits

393
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:39,875
is a classic.

394
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,291
Wait, it has to be
the ending, though?

395
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,875
If there's a badass older dude,
then it's a classic.

396
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,708
For real?

397
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,916
[KAI] If the supposed main
character dies in episode three,

398
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
it's a classic.

399
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,708
That's awfully
early in the series!

400
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,250
[ERICA] An anime with "God"
in the title is a classic.

401
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,750
[MINOA] Does it receive
some kind of blessing, then?

402
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,166
An anime with a
baseball game is a classic!

403
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,416
But other sports are no good?

404
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,708
An anime where the hero's mech
is mass-produced is a classic.

405
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,958
Now I just feel like
you're talking to me in code.

406
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,416
If anybody pukes,
then it's a classic.

407
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,541
Puke?

408
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,958
--[ERICA] Good one!
--[ALICE] Perfect!

409
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,791
This season's puke anime
is <i>Ru: Zero</i> . Classic.

410
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,208
Is that deep or just gross?

411
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,708
I'm frustrated, though.

412
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,291
This week's episode didn't
make a whole lot of sense to me.

413
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,833
[MINOA] Anime confuses
you sometimes too?

414
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,875
[MIKO] It's because you
haven't read the original.

415
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,541
That episode skipped over a
key scene from the light novel

416
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,041
and just moved on.

417
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,791
It would have taken
too long to depict

418
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,500
and it's not directly related
to the rest of the episode,

419
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,666
so maybe that's why it got cut?

420
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,041
It's a shame, though.

421
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,000
The audience is missing out
on the true meaning

422
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,583
of that plotline.

423
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,208
That's why it's always
better to read the novel.

424
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,416
The anime should
stand on its own merits.

425
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,333
[MIKO]
It's not even their story.

426
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,416
That is just rude.

427
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,708
What's wrong with
praising the original

428
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,333
when the anime is flawed?

429
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,791
Guys, don't get angry!

430
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,291
[ALICE] People who haven't
read the books are fans, too

431
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,041
Don't act like
you're better than us.

432
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,375
[MIKO]
I never implied that!

433
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,500
I'm not judging you for
how you enjoy the series,

434
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,583
but the anime still
made a mistake.

435
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,333
If they mismanaged
the source material,

436
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,916
that's worth
complaining about.

437
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,458
It's not fair to
the original creator.

438
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,083
As a fan, you should care.

439
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,166
"As a fan"?

440
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,125
It's okay! Stop fighting!

441
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,208
This is good!

442
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,625
You have people
to talk to about anime!

443
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,666
Have fun!

444
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,833
Ugh! How am
I supposed to have fun

445
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,458
if the only thing she wants
to talk about is the book?

446
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,166
Buzz off and read on your own!

447
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,333
Don't scare her away when we're
one member short of a club.

448
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,791
Better to have no club at all

449
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,666
than one that
can't even get along.

450
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,458
[MIKO]
I agree.

451
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,791
Koenji, no!

452
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,916
As you said, maybe
I should read on my own.

453
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,708
We won't even make
it to an episode three.

454
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,958
Why can't this work?

455
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,583
Good day to you.

456
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,166
[MINOA]
I hate this.

457
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,458
I'm sorry.

458
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,916
I think you're making a mistake.

459
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,875
I don't make mistakes.

460
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,791
And you, too.

461
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,500
You're both in the wrong.

462
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,833
I don't know much about anime
or light novels or whatever.

463
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,083
But still...

464
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,000
I can tell how important
your hobby is to you.

465
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,333
When I saw your eyes light up,
talking about anime,

466
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,625
I wanted to help
you find friends

467
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,166
you could share that with!

468
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,916
I know you're only mad 'cause
anime means so much to you,

469
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,333
and that's great.

470
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,250
Koenji's the same way.

471
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,625
You just like different stuff!

472
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,416
Or the same stuff actually,
just in different ways.

473
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,083
But the point is
you're both really passionate

474
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,166
about something
and that's wonderful!

475
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,208
I have an older sister I end up
fighting with all the time.

476
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,708
We're nothing like one another.

477
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,458
Sometimes I even wonder
if one of us was adopted.

478
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,791
Anyway, she's into lacrosse
like you guys are into anime,

479
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,208
and when she's playing,
I think she's super cool.

480
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,583
And ever since I was little,
whenever I found something

481
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,875
I was into, she'd cheer me on.

482
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,416
So, I think whatever it is,

483
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,250
it's really special to find
something you love!

484
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,208
And it's even more special to
find people to share it with!

485
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,708
If you love anime that much,
don't fight over it!

486
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,500
You'll make anime cry!

487
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,833
I'm sorry.

488
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,708
I don't even know
what I'm saying.

489
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,875
[AURORA]
I like your song.

490
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,458
It set my heart aflutter.

491
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,833
You certainly have passion.

492
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,166
I'm sure you can apply
it to anime someday.

493
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,666
What the heck?

494
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,000
You think I have passion?

495
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,833
I'm embarrassed,
but that's quite flattering.

496
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,791
So how many
members have you got?

497
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,625
[ERICA]
Five.

498
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:19,833
Just one more.

499
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,541
Well, you're looking
at number six right now!

500
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,500
Is that weird?

501
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,208
You mean you
don't know who he is?

502
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,208
Nakano's practically
a celebrity!

503
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,666
Even the senior girls
are totally into him.

504
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,416
He is hot.

505
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,625
I still don't remember
him at all, though.

506
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,250
You're so rude!

507
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,166
A handsome prince saves the day
and you can't even be impressed!

508
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,083
[laughs]

509
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,541
[KAI snickers]

510
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,958
She's never even heard of you.

511
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,708
Why that must be quite
the blow to your ego, Aurora.

512
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,291
Hey, Kaikai.

513
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,666
Musashisakai.

514
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,708
Kai!

515
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,375
[MINOA]
So, you like anime, Nakano?

516
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,208
Heh!

517
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,750
Is that a <i>Dub Tone</i> T-shirt?

518
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,625
This guy is hard core.

519
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,583
Trust me.

520
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,625
That's it.

521
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,791
We have enough members now.

522
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,166
That is, assuming
that you still want to stay.

523
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,125
[MIKO]
I'll stick around,

524
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,500
but only because Nakano
made the club official.

525
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,541
So sassy!

526
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,041
You sure showed me!

527
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,750
Kamiigusa, just shut up.

528
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,416
Nope. Now, just Alice.

529
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,541
Oh, Miko and Alice!

530
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,583
[ALICE, MIKO] That doesn't
mean you can say it.

531
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,500
Huh? I'm sorry!

532
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,708
[laughs]

533
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,875
You're such cute little kittens.

534
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,916
Kittens?

535
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,666
[AURORA]
Yep.

536
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,166
Sweet little kittens.

537
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,416
But why kittens?
Is this an anime thing?

538
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,000
You're just kittens.

539
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,958
Does it have to make sense?

540
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,625
Well, that nonsense aside...

541
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,291
The anime club
is prepared for action.

542
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,541
All right!

543
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:49,583
Hello.

544
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,958
New recruits?

545
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,291
[AYAME]
Effective immediately.

546
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,791
Your little anime club
is henceforth prohibited

547
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,875
from using this room.

548
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,791
How'd you know?

549
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,958
We haven't even
registered the club yet,

550
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,541
have we?

551
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,750
[MISTER KITTY] Any anime
with a cat is a classic, too.

552
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,541
Don't forget it.

553
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,916
Next time, the anime
club has just started,

554
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,458
but they've already hit a twist,

555
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,791
that is to say a snag,

556
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,625
that is to say a sort
of "hitch in the get up,"

557
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:46,916
that is to sa--
