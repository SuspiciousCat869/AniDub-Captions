1
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,833
The characters
in <i>Dub Tone</i> are so cute!

2
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,875
Oh, I can't even
pick a favorite!

3
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,125
Erica told me to check out
<i>Sweetness and Champion</i> ,

4
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,416
which was also like
super adorable!

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,333
Then Miko had
me watch <i>Ange Visual</i> ,

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,791
which had cute girls
and a cool story!

7
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,333
You're all about anime
these days, aren't you?

8
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,041
You gonna be marathoning these
shows over the break, too?

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,208
You better believe I am!

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,583
Not so fast.

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,458
We've got a big event coming
right around the corner.

12
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,625
Huh?

13
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,250
[MIKO] Not "a" big event.
The big event.

14
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,500
Yes, it won't be long.

15
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,375
You're scaring me, guys.

16
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,625
Huh?

17
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,208
[YUI groans]

18
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,500
Dang it.

19
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,500
Now, let's talk summer plans.

20
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,791
And by that, I mean our
pilgrimage to "you know where."

21
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,583
To attend "you know what."

22
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,791
The big "you know what"
by the sea.

23
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,125
The dark ritual.

24
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,375
The festival of desire
where greed runs wild!

25
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,208
Sorry.

26
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,458
I'm lost here.

27
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,708
Can someone explain this
to-- Whoa, what is this?

28
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,208
[MIKO]
A catalogue for the event.

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,208
All of your answers are here.

30
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,208
I'm not supposed to read this
whole ginormous thing, am I?

31
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,500
Examining it from cover-to-cover
is a rite of passage

32
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,000
for all anime fans.

33
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,791
Uh, that's not
even remotely true.

34
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,083
Just reading the bookmarked
sections should be adequate.

35
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,791
If you have any questions,
feel free to give me a call.

36
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,958
I'm an expert on the subject.

37
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,916
"Notes on entering the event.

38

Wait in the entry line
until the venue is open.

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,125
It is recommended that you take
the earliest train available,

40
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,625
as lines will form
in the morning."

41
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,750
[knock, knock]

42
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,625
Yeah?

43
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,500
Hey, Mii.

44
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,875
Thought you might be hungry.

45
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,916
Wait, you're not
studying, are you?

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,041
Uh... Kind of?

47
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,375
It's complicated.

48
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,541
Oh, while you're here,

49
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,875
do you know if we
have any folding chairs?

50
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,541
Like, you would use
at a picnic or something?

51
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,208
[MINOA]
Yeah.

52
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,833
Our club needs them.

53
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,583
Are you guys going
on a camping trip?

54
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,250
Uh.

55
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,291
The big "you know what"
by the sea.

56
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,000
[MINOA]
It's a seaside event.

57
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:46,875
Ah-ha!

58
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,250
So, like a fair on the beach?

59
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,625
Must be in Odaiba, then.

60
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,250
[MINOA]
Uh, something like that.

61
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,333
Anyway, there's gonna
be a ton of people there.

62
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,916
Huh!

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,875
I didn't think the anime club
would be into stuff like that!

64
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,250
[MINOA]
It's a pretty big event.

65
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,000
The lines are long,
so we might want to sit down.

66
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,541
Sounds like a good call.

67
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,916
I think we've got one chair
downstairs, let me go grab it.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,958
That sounds great!

69
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,750
Thank you!

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,541
What's that?

71
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,875
Going camping?

72
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,083
Actually,

73
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,125
Mii's going to some
festival thing in Odaiba

74
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,166
with her new anime buddies.

75
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,375
I see!

76
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,291
She's having so much fun
with her new friends!

77
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,208
Isn't that nice?

[yawns]

79

You're up awfully early.

80
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,916
I have to take the first train,
or I won't make it on time.

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,416
Oh, hey.

82
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,708
Did Dad go somewhere?

Yeah.

going on today too.

Huh... Well, whatever.

See ya!

You have a safe trip!

Nobody is awake yet.

It's weirding me out.

Don't freak me out like that!

Yep!

96
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,666
Then lemme give
you one piece of advice.

97
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Attention:

98
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:15,166
Train arriving for
Ikebukuro on track one.

99
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,916
When you're at war, if you let
your guard down, you're dead.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,083
Remember that.

101
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,416
It's an anime con,
not a war, Mister Kitty.

102
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,250
I surrender!

103
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,583
Excuse me.

104
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,708
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,041
Uhm.

Sorry, 'scuse me.

108
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,666
Sorry.

109
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,625
Right here, Minoa!

110
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,000
I thought I was gonna die!

111
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,208
I forgot to tell you
the train is a war zone!

112
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,708
Congratulations on
making it out here alive!

113
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,791
Don't let your guard down.

114
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,583
That was only the first round!

115
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,041
It's calling me!

116
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,416
The sweet siren song of
anime merch beckons me

117
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,875
to its inner lair!

118
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,750
Can you take it down
a notch or maybe ten?

119
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,291
We'd better get in line.

120
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,583
Did you bring a sports
drink like I told you to, Minoa?

121
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,666
Yeah.

122
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,666
No heatstroke for me.

123
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,416
It's right here.

124
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,625
I don't think that's
going to cut it.

125
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,875
[MINOA]
Huh?

126
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,958
The sun is a deadly adversary,
I hope you know!

127
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,333
[MINOA]
Huh?!

128
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,625
Maybe grab another drink
before we get stuck in line.

129
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,458
[MINOA] Lemme run to
the convenience store!

130
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,125
I'll hurry!

131
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm worried about her.
I should probably go.

132
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,000
I can't even reach the shelves.

133
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,875
What am I gonna do?

134
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,125
Just follow the line,
it'll work out.

135
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,541
Miko.

136
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,541
[ALICE] Prepare yourself,
convention center,

137
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,416
for I have arrived!

138
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,958
Really fired up, huh?

139
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,458
I can't blame you,

140
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,541
but don't wear yourself
out before it starts.

141
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,791
Of course not!

142
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,166
I'm just trying to get
everyone else excited!

143
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,083
Is it working?

144
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:08,875
[MINOA]
Mm-hmm.

145
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:09,708
[ERICA chuckles]

146
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,083
Okay, let's move.

147
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,041
[MINOA]
Huh?

148
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,583
But isn't the building that way?

149
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,041
[ERICA]
Don't get ahead of yourself.

150
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,333
We have to make it
through the line first.

151
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,041
[MINOA]
Huh?!

152
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,250
Minoa.

153
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,333
[MINOA]
Huh?

154
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,208
Did I doze off?

155
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,041
Didn't get much
sleep last night?

156
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,500
Usually, the only reason
to get up this early during

157
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,208
summer break is to watch
Sunday morning shows.

158
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,666
Like which ones?

159
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,291
He means the kid's anime
and <i>tokusatsu</i> block

160
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,500
that airs on Sunday.

161
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,750
Oh! That's when <i>PreFae</i> comes on!

162
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,083
Unlike late night anime,

163
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,500
the Sunday morning shows
have wide audience appeal.

164
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,333
They're for children,
families, and fans of all ages.

165
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,583
Speaking of appeal, the rider
and ranger <i>tokusatsu</i> shows

166
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:56,875
may be live action,
but they set my heart on fire!

167
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,000
Those shows were
created by a manga artist,

168
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,208
but they're still not anime.

169
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,291
You shouldn't expect
anything too mature.

170
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,583
But even if the shows
are mostly aimed at kids,

171
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,958
there's plenty of things anime
fans can enjoy about them!

172
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,125
Even if it's just a
story about friendship,

173
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,333
once you get
into the characters,

174
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,083
it can move you to tears!

175
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,916
Ooh, and I love when
they have handsome villains

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
you can feel sorry
for in the end!

177
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,000
I always tune in to
watch the dance sequences

178
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,583
they have during
the <i>PreFae</i> credits.

179
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,125
They use choreographers
from real idol groups for those!

180
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,166
Ahh, I knew <i>PreFae</i> was cool,

181
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,083
but maybe I should
get into it more!

182
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,041
It has great fight
scenes sometimes too.

183
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,625
[KAI]
Indeed! You know,

184
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,750
some famous animators got their
start working on that series.

185
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,416
You like anything with good
fight scenes, huh, Kaikai?

186
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,750
It's Kai!

187
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,250
[MALE STAFF]
Thank you all for coming today.

188
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,500
We'll start moving
the line soon.

189
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,875
Does anyone need
to go to the bathroom?

190
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,083
Not really. I'm fine for now.

191
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,583
You should go before
you really have to.

192
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,208
[ERICA] That's a rookie
mistake, Alicecchi.

193
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,208
I should try to set
a better example.

194
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,333
You're right.

195
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,750
Well, guess
I'd better go for safety.

196
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,083
I didn't notice the
bathrooms; where are they?

197
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,458
Over there.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,333
And that is the line.

199
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,333
Huh?! There's even a
line for the bathrooms?!

200
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,916
It's big business here.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,500
Are you kidding me?

202
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,333
I mean, that's obvious, right?

203
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,000
[chuckles]

204
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,291
Okay, it's potty time, Minoa!

205
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,208
Did I miss something?

206
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,250
Hey, I'm back!

207
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,708
Hope we didn't take too long.

208
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,666
We're lost, aren't we?

209
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,250
This is bad.

210
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,666
No, nothing to worry about.

211
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,166
Sebasu!

212
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,291
[MALE STAFF]
Hey buddy, no sliding!

213
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,708
Not happening.

214
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,875
Well, Alice, got a Plan B?

215
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,625
Nan dao nimi lule ma?

216
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,708
Huh?

217
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,416
[MINOA]
Who the heck is that?

218
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,333
You know her, Minoa?

219
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,125
Uh-uh.

220
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,708
[MINOA]
She sure is pretty, though.

221
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,583
Cute dress.

222
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,250
[MINOA]
Nevermind!

223
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,416
I need to say something!

224
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,583
But what language was that?

225
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,458
Not English or French,
I don't think.

226
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,333
Help!

227
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,458
Uhm, German? Guten Strudel!

228
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,958
You want strudel?

229
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,958
Sorry, I don't have any.

230
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,250
Oh, you can speak our language?

231
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,791
What a relief!

00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,708
Yes! Let's go!

00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,875
Huh? Wait a second!

00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,333
What is happening?

235
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,291
Where are you taking me?

236
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,791
I need to find my friends!

237
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,958
Hey! Am I being abducted?

Over here!

Hold me!

243
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,833
Is there some joke
that I'm missing here?

244
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,166
These two were very
sad looking for you guys.

245
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,000
[ERICA]
I see. They got lost.

246
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,875
Thanks for bringing back
our missing children.

Sorry, but who are you?

in line behind us.

I need to go to the bathroom,
could you please hold my spot?

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,666
[ERICA]
Mm-hmm. Of course.

251
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,291
[BABY] When I was coming back,
I ran into you,

252
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,666
and I think that's
the whole story.

253
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,750
It all makes sense.

254
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,666
I'm sorry if I was rude.

255
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,958
Not rude at all!

256
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,708
I just wanted to help,
but maybe I acted weird.

257
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,125
I don't get it.

258
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,833
Alicecchi,
you've been here before.

259
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,375
How did you get lost?

260
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,583
It's all my fault!

261
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,916
I lied.

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,583
I've actually never been
to the convention before.

263
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,708
I guess I just wanted
to look smart or something.

264
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,208
I'm a phony.

265
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,250
It's not that big
of a deal, really!

266
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,791
I agree.

267
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,833
In fact, I think you two would
have gotten lost either way.

268
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,708
That's just uncalled for.

269
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,625
[MIKO]
But it's my fault, too.

270
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,833
I should've gone with you.

It's true!

We had some trouble,
but we all overcame it together!

278
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,291
We should not let our first time
here be spoiled by a bad memory!

00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,500
Don't you think?

00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,750
Yeah, you're right.

281
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,541
It's an anime festival!

282
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,666
We should have fun
together, shouldn't we?

283
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,000
You said it.

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,833
Thanks for that.

Oh, it's my pleasure!

286
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,625
I'm surprised you
remembered Minoa's face,

287
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,375
since we didn't
even talk to you.

288
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:40,500
Not so much face, more
the button she has on her shirt.

00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,458
Oh, this?

I love <i>Ru: Zero</i> . It's popular
in Beijing like Japan!

That's amazing.

Whoa, hold up, <i>Ru: Zero</i> was
just on TV over here, though.

in Beijing so quickly?

Wow, that's really handy.

It used to be 6 months after the
DVD release for foreign markets.

Now it's at the same time.

00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:33,916
It's funny.

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,333
People get confused.

00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,375
[ERICA]
Confused?

314
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,750
[BABY]
When I say I like anime,

315
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,833
Japanese fans always
ask me about old shows.

316
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,166
Those are okay, I guess, but I
want to talk about the new ones!

317
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,583
They're trying to be nice,
but it's backfiring.

318
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,750
Where do you get news
about new anime?

319
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,333
Online, usually.

320
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,666
I guess that's how everyone
does it these days!

321
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,041
I always read what
Japanese fans say.

322
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,208
It turns out you like the
exact same shows as I do!

323
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,916
How can you read what they post?

324
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,791
Wait, you're talking
to us like normal.

325
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,166
That's a dumb question.

326

It's fine.

327
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,291
I know it seems strange.

328
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,500
Learning a language
just because of anime.

329
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,041
In America, I met fans
who did the same thing.

330
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,500
Just not as well.

331
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,708
Awesome, it's like
the power of anime

332
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,958
can bring everyone
in the world together!

333
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,291
Yep.

334
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,708
It may sound cheesy,
but the proof is right here.

335
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,125
Hey, Baby.

336
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,250
If you'd like, we could
check out the con together.

337
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,541
Yes, of course!

338
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,166
Thanks!

339
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm so happy!

340
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,208
Now we just have to
wait for the thing to start!

341
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,541
It's getting so hot.

342
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,291
We were spared
the sun's wrath before,

343
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,791
since we got here so early.

344
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,750
The humidity is awful too.

345
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,041
Baby, are you
hanging in there or--

346
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,125
[gasps]

347
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,583
Ooh, this is cold!

348
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,625
We don't have cooling pads
like this in Beijing,

349
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,041
so I had to try one!

350
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,041
[ALICE] It's funny that you're
more prepared than us.

351
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,125
Well, at least we don't have
to stand right in the sun.

352
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,500
Like him.

353
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
[MINOA]
Kaikai! Oh no!

354
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,916
We're just fine,
but he's cooking alive?

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,666
I refuse to submit!

356
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,291
Helios, I shall defy thee!

357
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,208
A line logistics issue.

[aaplause]

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,916
Okay.

360
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,750
Now we're getting
things started!

361
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,625
We did all that clapping,

362
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,916
but we've still been
waiting half an hour.

363
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,416
We've probably got
another hour to go.

364
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,250
[MINOA, ALICE]
Another hour?

365
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,416
I'm sick of the outdoors!

366
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,750
No offense,

367
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,250
but your body heat is not
what I need right now.

368
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,083
Just try to be patient, okay?

369
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,291
Nope.

370
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,083
Too late, I'm dead.

371
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,291
[MALE STAFF]
All right, people.

372
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,125
The light at the end
of the tunnel is near,

373
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,500
so don't you go
and die now,

374
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,958
or else you might
restart back at home!

375
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:20,833
What's up?

376
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,916
Is he a comedian or something?

377
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,833
Well, they do this every time.

378
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,416
Fans seem to love it.

379
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,333
[MALE STAFF] Be sure to stay
hydrated so you don't collapse!

380
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,458
Aquina isn't here to save
you with her water magic!

381
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,875
That goes for all you
Aquina cosplayers as well!

382
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,958
The staff are all
anime fans too.

The jokes are bad,
but I'm not hot anymore!

[ALICE]
The time has come, Minoa.

386
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,750
[MINOA] Mm-hmm.
It was a long journey.

387
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,875
[ALICE] But at the end
of our harrowing ordeal,

388
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,916
we have arrived at the
gates of paradise itself.

389

It's a whole
new world before us.

[MINOA]
Alice, what is this feeling?

391
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,583
My heart's pounding so fast!

392
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,208
[ALICE] Mine is too,
but don't be afraid.

393
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,291
We'll take the
first steps together!

394
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,875
Are you ready?

395
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,333
[MINOA]
Yes. Take my hand!

I know you're having

a special moment right now,
but please enter single file.

398
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,958
We finally made it in!

399
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,333
Exhausting, huh?

400
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,833
If it's cool with you guys,
let's split up for now.

401
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,625
Now to release the
chains of frugality

402
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,250
that bind my
immortal golden wallet!

403
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,041
With this legendary relic.

404
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,333
I shall hunt down all the

405
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,375
in these halls!

406

Ha ha ha ha ha!

407
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,583
Hmm.

[MINOA]
Look at all the people!

00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,708
Have you seen any

Fliers.

00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,541
Huh?

Check out our booth, you guys!

00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,166
Oh! Thank you!

414
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,833
I got bags. Here.

415
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,333
Oh, that's so cute!

416
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,500
I didn't know they
would give us free stuff!

417
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,000
Neither did I, but this
is the best thing ever!

418
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,125
It's a new show
starting this fall!

419
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,416
Some paper fans?

420
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
Take one, they're free!

421
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,333
Would anyone like a bag?

422
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,416
So, heavy!

423
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,291
I know!

424
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,791
My poor shoulders!

425
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,708
Everyone hands out stuff.
You can't possibly take it all.

426
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,791
A little late to say that now!

427
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,750
I got one!

428
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,708
I'm so glad they
didn't sell out of these!

429
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,708
It's just a keychain,
you shouldn't stress out.

00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,791
Oh yeah?

431
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,375
Then why did you
dive across the table,

432
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,708
shoving money in their face
like your life depended on it?

I'm glad we all
got what we wanted!

Wow, looking good!

I don't think I've met her.

Is she a friend
from college, or what?

Oh, no, not that.

449

She's one of my
old cosplay buddies.

A fresh, young high school girl!

I'm Mutsuki.

00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,208
Like the shirt says,

455
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,291
I'm from the Jouhoku
High School Anime Club.

456
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,833
I'm Erica.

457
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,000
I guess I'm the president of the
anime club at Sakaneko High.

458
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,791
Sakaneko High School?

459
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,125
Oh, I've heard of your club!

460
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,583
You guys are a big deal, huh?

461
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,291
Uh, sorry, is that wrong?

462
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,958
A graduate from Sakaneko
told me your club was amazing,

463
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,500
but maybe he was
playing a joke on me.

464
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,375
I dunno.

465
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,250
Uh-huh...

466
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,375
[MINOA] I need a break
from all those people!

467
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,458
Jeez!

468
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,583
[MIKO]
That's no surprise.

469
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,708
There's almost
200 thousand after all.

470
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,250
[ALICE]
It keeps getting bigger!

471
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,708
[MINOA]
That's crazy!

472
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,416
[BABY] Last time, it was 600
thousand over three days.

473
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,125
[MIKO]
See? Baby read the catalogue.

474
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,291
When you look at it that way,

475
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,416
we're lucky the lines
aren't even worse!

476
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,458
You line up to come inside,
only to wait in more lines.

477
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,291
You get up early just
to suffer all day long.

478
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,416
But it makes me happy!

479
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,958
The suffering?

480
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,208
It's not suffering if
you share it with friends!

481
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,791
I'm here with my
new friends in anime.

482
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,958
I'll wait in any line for that!

483
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,125
The hot sun and the long waiting
will become good memories!

484
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,333
Even your getting lost

485
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,875
helped you find a new
friendship, right?

486
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,666
I guess you're right.

487
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,666
I'm glad we got lost
and ran into you!

488
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,458
I'm glad too!

489
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,916
Good!

490
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,458
[ERICA] Sweet. Looks
like everybody's arrived.

491
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,791
You ready to take off?

492
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:38,708
What about the guys?

493
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,333
Don't tell me they left already?

494
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,500
Oh, I'll send a message on
Line and tell them we're going.

495
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,583
Baby, are you staying
or leaving?

496
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,625
I'll stay.

497
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,625
I enjoy watching
all the other fans.

498
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,958
It feels nice just to be here.

499
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,583
That's cool.

500
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,750
Bye Minoa, Alice, Miko, Erica.

501
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,625
Thank you for today!

502
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,041
No need to thank us,
I'm glad we met!

503
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,125
Bye, Baby!

504
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,083
Good day to you!

505
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,333
Ah! Should've gotten
her contact info!

506
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,333
I didn't think of that!

507
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,291
We really messed up.

508
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,291
I was so excited
to make a new friend.

509
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,333
It's not fair.

510
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,291
Anime brought you together.

511
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,625
And if it can do it once,

512
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,666
I'm sure it can do it again.

513
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,208
You're right.

514
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,750
[ERICA] We've got one
more important thing to do

515
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,000
on the way back.

516
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,125
[MIKO]
Oh yeah. That.

517
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,041
[ALICE, MINOA]
Wait, what?

518
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,625
This is cool!

519
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,041
[MINOA]
Baby was right.

520
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,541
Even the lines and the sun
feel like good memories now.

521
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,958
We oughta come back every
year now, don't'cha think?

522
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,833
Yeah! 'Course we do!

523
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,916
I didn't see
Musashisakai all day.

524
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,375
Do you know what he's doing?

525
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,250
Huh? Sorry Miko,
I can't hear you!

526
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,500
Meeting once on
the battlefield is chance.

527
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,166
Twice is destiny.

528
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:43,208
Next episode,
someone is shrouded in light.

529
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,375
If you wanna know who,

530
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,625
then watch the damn show,
why don't ya?
