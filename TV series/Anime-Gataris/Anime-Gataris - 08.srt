00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:08,625
[MINOA]
Previously on...

2
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,041
[ALL]
...Anime-Gataris!

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,458
[MINOA] The student council
made a complaint about

4
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,083
the anime club's presentation
for the school festival.

5
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,250
We all pulled together to
come up with something new

6
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,666
that would blow them away.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,375
I've already worked
out the scenario.

8
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,666
[MINOA] We were going to make
our very own three-minute anime!

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,000
You jerks!

10
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,541
[MINOA]
We pushed super hard,

11
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,250
and we could almost see the
finish line, when suddenly...

12
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,416
If you can't fill
the entire track field,

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
your project will be
considered a failure.

14
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,666
[MINOA]
We've pulled through before,

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,291
but this might
really be the end!

16
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,875
You may call me Yuirin!

17
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,500
And explosion magic
is the only magic for me!

18
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,250
You got it?

19
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,791
You may call me...

20
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,625
You may call...

21
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,958
Uhh...

22
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,583
I'm not really feeling it.

23
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,791
It sounds weird, like
it's just too cutesy for me.

24
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:56,833
Hey, wait!

25
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,083
What if I add a
yell in the middle?

26
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,125
You may call me...

27
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,166
Ahh! Yuirin!

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,958
That's it!

29
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,000
I nailed it!

30
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,250
Okay, let's do one more take,

31
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,583
and I'll say the
line just like that!

32
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,583
Tsubaki, hold on!

33
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,375
Shouldn't you be working?

34
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,041
Can't let your
audience down after all.

35
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,333
[AYAME]
So, I guess we're leaving?

36
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,125
That will be all.

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,791
[MINOA]
Something?

38
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,500
Anything?

39
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,250
There's no way we can fill
that entire venue on our own.

40
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,291
We haven't even
finished our anime yet.

41
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,916
Let's settle that part first.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,083
Yeah, and what about the ending?

43
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,666
That's supposed
to be a dance number.

44
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,333
We've barely started it.

45
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,333
What now?

46
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,833
[AURORA] No use in getting
stressed out, Minoa.

47
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,291
[MINOA]
Nakano.

48
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,250
We'll finish what we can,
and that's what we'll show.

49
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,958
It doesn't matter
if it's not perfect.

50
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,625
It's a testament
to our existence.

51
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,666
That's enough.

52
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,083
Huh?

53
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,125
Sounds pretty bad, doesn't it?

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,000
Like we're dying.

55
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,083
[MINOA]
I don't like it!

56
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,916
After all this,
we have to finish!

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,875
Somehow!

58
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,333
What can we do?

59
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,583
We lost our help.

60
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,375
And there's not much time left.

61
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,458
We'll be lucky if we
have anything to show.

62
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,333
We gave it our best,
but we can't win this.

63
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,416
[MINOA]
Everyone's worn out.

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,166
Of course they are,
but I'm the director.

65
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,625
I can't give up!

66
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,583
I'm sorry, you guys.

67
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,166
I think I'm going to need
a day to think this through?

68
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,833
Hey, Minoa.

69
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,291
You don't want dinner?

70
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,958
Are you sick?

71
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,083
It's complicated.

72
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,166
I didn't know anime
was such serious business.

73
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,583
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,708
We lost our sound booth,
so we can't record your part.

75
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,041
No biggie.

76
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,208
I was looking forward to it,

77
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,750
but I can be "Cute Girl A"
on my own time.

78
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,833
[MINOA]
It's such a good scene, though.

79
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,000
Really tugs on the heartstrings.

80
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,666
And also, Mom helped
choreograph a dance routine

81
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,958
for us to use for
the end credits.

82
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,458
Oh! That looks like fun!

83
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,583
[chuckles]

84
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,750
I just hope we can
get it done in time.

85
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,583
[SHUGO]
Hey, Minoa.

86
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,750
You can finish
your lines with this.

87
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,125
It's a digital recorder.

88
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,541
Should do the trick.

89
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,958
You overheard us?

90
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,416
I know it's not been easy,
but it really sounds like

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
you're giving this
everything you've got.

92
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,958
I'm so proud of you.

93
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,875
But listen, Minoa!

94
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,041
What did anime teach you?

95
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,750
You remember <i>Akibako</i> , right?

96
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,541
Every last second matters!

97
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,333
Anime is a race against time!

98
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,666
A battle that continues until
the minute the show airs!

99
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,625
Why do the creators struggle so?

100
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,291
It's for those who
anxiously await the fruits

101
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,041
of their labor each week!

102
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,875
For the sake of their fans
across the whole world!

103
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,083
Don't you remember waiting
for your favorite show to air

104
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,083
when you were little?

105
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,958
Now it's your turn to make one!

106
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,833
Anime didn't teach you give up!

107
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,416
Anime taught you to fight!

108
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,875
You still have two days!

109
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,041
That's plenty of time!

110
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,083
You could write a
whole book in two days!

111
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:34,958
[MINOA]
Who's writing a book?

112
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,666
Ah! Uh, no one!

113
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,958
[chuckles]

114
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,083
Why are you getting
so pumped up about anime

115
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,250
all of a sudden, Dad?

116
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,916
Don't tell me
you're actually, uh...

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,875
That's right!

118
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,250
He's an otaku!

119
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,833
Huh?!

120
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,750
[MAYA]
Like, since when?

121
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,083
[MINOA]
Dad, I had no idea!

122
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,250
Oh yeah?

123
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,166
So you didn't see
him working at that con?

124
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,541
By the sea?

125
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,541
Con by the sea.

126
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,250
I guess those were dad jokes!

127
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,916
[AI]
He goes there every year.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You might say it's
his only purpose in life.

129
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,208
My secret, exposed!

130
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,375
I tried so hard to maintain

131
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,083
my image as a normal,
dignified father!

132
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,291
But now it's all gone to ruin!

133
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,958
[MAYA] We never
thought you were dignified.

134
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,375
Don't feel bad, Dad!

135
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,625
Huh?

136
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,375
I thought your speech
about anime was great!

137
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,291
In fact, it's just what
I needed to hear!

138
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,875
Do you really mean it?

139
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,166
Oh, thank you!

140
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,583
I'm so glad you understand!

141
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,791
Such good girls!

142
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,875
I'm so lucky!

143
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,375
Okay, can we stop this
and record now?

144
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,333
We could, but I don't
know if it's worth it,

145
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,208
since we might not
even finish the anime.

146
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,125
Well, think.

147
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,875
It's your show, right?

148
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,625
[MINOA]
Uhm, kind of.

149
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,750
[MAYA] Since you're the
director, just talk to your team

150
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,166
and tell them
what you want to do.

151
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,500
I don't want to be
too bossy, though.

152
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,083
My club has a coach
and nobody minds that.

153
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,458
The team is in it together,

154
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,500
but sometimes you still need
someone to lead the way,

155
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,833
especially when
things get dicey.

156
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,583
You think I'm up to it?

157
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,125
Cute Girl A, ready to go!

158
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,750
Man A is in the building!

159
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,000
Ugh! Back off, Dad!

160
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,708
[SHUGO]
You hit me!

161
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,041
Not even your
mother hit me before!

162
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,333
[AI chuckles]
Don't lie to the children.

163
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,041
[YUI]
I'm turning.

164
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,791
So how is your
anime coming along?

165
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,666
It's not done yet,
but we're getting so close.

166
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,541
I'm sorry, I know I haven't been
much help lately with the class.

167
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,875
I can handle this stuff.

168
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,666
Just do your thing!

169
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,458
Uh, right.

[MISTER KITTY] Nobody's replying
to your text message, huh?

172
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,583
Huh?

173
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,291
What are you doing up there?

174
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't have to explain
a damn thing to you!

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,208
Huh? It says they
didn't even read it at all.

176
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,208
[MISTER KITTY] So they're
hard-core ignoring you.

177
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,166
[MINOA] Wow, not
sugarcoating that at all.

178
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,500
[MATSURI]
We need more balloons.

179
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,125
[AYAME] If you had it your way,
we'd be buried in balloons.

180
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,958
I sent it out yesterday
and didn't get a single reply.

181
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,041
I guess everyone gave up.

182
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,250
They we're probably
half-assing it from the start,

183
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,791
'cause nobody thought
you'd actually finish.

184
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,958
That's not true!

185
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,250
These last three months,

186
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,041
everyone has
given it their best!

187
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,250
We've dealt with one
problem after another.

188
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,625
But never once did
they lose hope or give up!

189
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,958
As director, I know
better than anyone else

190
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,541
how hard they worked!

191
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,166
I couldn't have done any
of this without their help,

192
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,791
so don't blame them!

193
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,125
They're the reason
why I can't give up!

194
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,625
No matter what.

195
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,250
We have to...!

196
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,666

Good.

There's still time.

198
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,541
I'll keep working
till the last minute!

199

[ERICA]
Sorry I'm late!

200
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,583
They're not done, but I got our
scenes back from the art club.

201
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,500
I wrote a novelization
we can hand out.

202
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,625
I edited together
some production artwork

203
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,333
to use for the ending credits.

204
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,250
That's better
than nothing, right?

205
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,375
I recorded all of
the sound effects

206
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,541
we were missing at my place.

207
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,375
I finished up the action scenes.

208
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,875
And don't worry,
I used references.

209

[yawns]

210
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,375

I don't understand.

212

On my phone, it said
you didn't read my message.

213
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,708
Your message?

214
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,916
I was so wrapped up in work,
I didn't even think to look.

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,750
Yeah, that was the
last thing on my mind.

216
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,958
My phone was off all night.

Had what?

220
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,250
I thought you'd given up.

221
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,958
Unless our director says so,

222
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,458
there's no way
we're calling it quits.

Guess the fight's
not over yet, huh?

Haha! Either way.

I still don't know how
we're going to draw a crowd.

If you give up,
the game's already over.

Quoting <i>Slash Dunk</i>
for inspiration, are we?

228
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,875
Even if it's a sports team,
it's still a school club.

229

We can use these!

I'm confused.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,833
What's this got
to do with anime?

238
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,958
[KAI] It's like a live
commentary track.

239
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,875
We show a sports club
anime and you talk about

240
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,791
your experience
in your own sports club.

241
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,125
Like <i>Ace of Bench</i>
for the baseball club,

242
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,208
or <i>Fresh Prince of</i>
<i>Tennis</i> for tennis.

Oh, hey, I used
to watch that show!

This sounds like a blast!

246
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,208
Since they gave us
that huge stage,

247
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,958
it only makes sense to
share it with the other clubs!

248

Let's just have fun!

Even if you're not into anime,

I want to make this into
something everyone
