1
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,625
[MINOA]
Morning.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,333
[yawns]

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,708
You're up awfully early today.

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,916
I dunno why,
but I couldn't sleep.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,541
[SHUGO]
Sweetie, look!

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,625
You're not gonna believe this.

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,333
[AI] That's right
after we got married!

8
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,250
I found it when I was cleaning
out the downstairs office.

9
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,833
[AI]
I look so young!

10
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,208
Wow, I was pretty cute, huh?

11
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,708
And, you've gotten
cuter every single day.

12
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,125
Huh? Would you stop it?

13
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,750
[SHUGO laughs]

14
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:43,000
Every moment we spend together
is like a dream come true!

15
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,291
[AI]
Aww, Shugo.

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,333
[SHUGO]
Ai.

17
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,583
[AI]
Shugo.

18
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,666
[SHUGO]
Ai!

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,791
[AI]
Shugo!

20
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:49,583
[SHUGO]
Ai!

21
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,041
[AI]
Okay, stop.

22
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,416
Ahhh! I slept in late!

23
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,458
Hey, wait a second.

24
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,125
Do you--?

25
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,833
Sorry, no time, Mii.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,583
[MINOA]
Uh! Huh?

27
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,750
You're late?

28
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,916
But I thought you quit
the lacrosse club.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,958
Yeah, I did, but I've got
a yearbook committee meeting.

30
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,750
[MAYA]
Catch you later!

31
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:12,958
Huh?!

32
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,375
You quit your club?

33
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,708
[MAYA]
Hmm?

34
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,333
[gasps]

35
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,708
[SHUGO]
Minoa? Is there something wrong?

36
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,333
[MINOA]
Did you see her face?

37
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,291
It was weird!

38
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,833
You... Huh? Huh?!

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
[BOY C]
Hey, toots!

40
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,541
Stop it!

41
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,000
Jeez!

42
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,041
Yui-miliating!

43
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,791
[ALICE]
Their faces changed?

44
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,666
Yeah, but it lasted
only a few seconds.

45
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,916
Can you elaborate?

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,666
They changed in what way?

47
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,791
It was like...

48
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:26,166
Like, anime in the 90s
with these weird flat faces.

49
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,375
You might be getting too
stressed out for your own good.

50
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,791
[MINOA]
Huh?

51
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,958
I can hardly blame you,
we've been through a lot lately.

52
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,583
You guys gotta believe me!

53
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,958
I'm sure I--

54
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,750
[MINOA]
Huh?!

55
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,416
[YUI]
Morning!

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,791
[MINOA]
Yui!

57
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,500
Good!

58
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,166
Look at their faces!

59
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,958
What's wrong?

60
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,750
They're all so weird!

61
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,291
[MIKO, ALICE]
Wow. Rude.

62
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,333
What d'you mean?

63
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,333
[MINOA]
Their cheeks!

64
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,916
And their weird pointy chins!

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,416
Uhm...

66
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,416
[MIKO] First period
is art class, remember?

67
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,250
Let's go.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,041
[YUI]
C'mon, cheer up!

69
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,750
Huh?! Whoa, whoa,
what the heck is going on?

70
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:13,583
Huh?!

71
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,333
Eh?!

72
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,416
What now?

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,791
You okay?

74
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,875
[YUI]
Minoa?

75
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,083
It's the void!

76
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,875
It was right here!

77
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,875
Some big, empty, black hole!

78
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,375
An endless darkness!

79
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,208
An all-consuming void,
like a portal to hell,

80
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,208
ready to swallow me up!

81
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,083
You've got to pull
yourself together!

82
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,833
I'm afraid I don't
see any dark void.

83
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,000
[MINOA]
It was real!

84
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,000
You walk over here and then.

85
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,208
Huh?

86
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,291
Hold on.

87
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,000
Uhm.

88
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,291
That's weird!

89
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,208
Did you eat something strange?

90
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,041
If you're on drugs, Minoa,
I think you should tell us.

91
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,041
Maybe you should
go to the nurse.

92
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,125
[MINOA]
Huh!? No, it's real!

93
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,541
I nearly fell right in!

94
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,875
Hey! Ahh...!

95
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,541
[yawns]

96
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,708
[YUI]
I'm so hungry!

97
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,250
So, Minoa.

98
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,208
What's your plan?

99
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,000
Boxed lunch?

100
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,250
Or school food?

101
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,708
The cafeteria is
serving chicken katsu.

102
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,250
Oooh, then I might
have to go for that!

103
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,083
We're having a club meeting
during lunch, okay?

104
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,750
[MINOA]
Nothing's okay!

105
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,791
Huh?

106
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,541
We just got here
a second ago, right?

107
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,208
No way, nuh-huh!

108
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,791
That is not how time works.

109
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,666
You can't just skip around to
get through the boring parts!

110
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,000
You should calm your
nerves with some tea.

111
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,416
One moment. Sebasu!

112
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,666
Now that's not right.

113
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,750
The usual.

114
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,916
As you command.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,250
I live to serve you.

116
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,750
[MINOA]
And she talks!

117
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,708
S'il vous plaît.

118
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,916
Splendid. You may
excuse yourself.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,291
With moves like that, you'd
be perfect on the track team.

120
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,458
Come see me after school.

121
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,708
[ALICE]
Here you go.

122
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,250
[YUI]
Those are so cute!

123
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,125
Do you mind if I borrow one?

124
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,375
Please, help yourself.

125
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,541
Sparklies, yay!

126
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,916
Me too! They're
lovely, aren't they?

127
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,916
[TORU]
Am I irresistible or what?

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,875
How did you--?

129
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,000
This is wrong.

130
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,583
[ALICE]
Indeed.

131
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,958
Upon closer inspection,
you're right.

132
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,291
I see now.

133
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,875
Then you believe me?

134
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,125
It's plain as day.

135
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,791
This was clearly
supposed to be Earl Grey tea,

136
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,583
but it's hojicha.

137
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,666
[MINOA] That's what
you have a problem with?

138
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,041
[ERICA] We still need to choose
a president for next year.

139
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,958
[MINOA] We've got bigger
problems right now!

140
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,291
[ERICA]
Seriously?

141
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,250
Don't tell me the school
has another issue with us.

142
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,916
That's not what
I'm talking about!

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,041
Never mind our club,
the whole world's upside down!

144
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,541
What do you mean?

145
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,166
She's been like this all day,
talking about crazy stuff.

146
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,291
Crazy?

147
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,000
Everything's perfectly normal.

148
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,250
[MINOA]
That's not normal!

149
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,083
You mean you're seeing things
that other people can't see?

150
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,458
Acquired the power of
my Evil Eye, have you?

151
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,041
[MINOA]
I'm serious!

152
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,333
Everything's changed!

153
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,166
You haven't noticed?

154
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,583
It's news to me.

155
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,375
Huh, maybe so.

156
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,500
[MIKO]
Now that you mention it,

157
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,041
things do feel
a bit "different."

158
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,666
It could be a new
production team, right?

159
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,333
Wait, what're you talking about?

160
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,166
Can't be.

161
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,833
It's way too late for that.

162
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,666
Did Tahiro run away?

163
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,666
He's just doing
series composition.

164
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,541
It's not like
anyone would miss him.

165
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,708
"Tahiro"?

166
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,083
Who the heck is that?

167
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,791
We can't be certain
until we confirm it.

168
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,041
[ERICA] Want to watch
the opening again, then?

169
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,625
Yeah, ok.

170
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,166
We are not on the same page.

171
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,625
I'm gonna rewind.

172
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:53,791
[MINOA]
Huh?

173
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,250
What the heck is going--

174
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,416
Jeez!

175
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,000
Yui-miliating!

176
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,750
[ERICA]
It's still him!

177
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,833
[MINOA]
Huh?

178
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,750
Why is everyone okay with this?

179
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,250
All of you are acting
like it's normal!

180
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,125
You shouldn't
derail the narrative.

181
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,208
If we betray the audience's
expectations too much,

182
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,916
we might get canceled.

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
[ALICE]
But it's too late in the season!

184
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,000
You think this is too different
from what we've been doing?

185
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,458
What's our genre?

186
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,083
It's not slice of life.

187
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,416
It was slice of life, but it's
turning into something else now.

188
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,750
Should we try to increase our
appeal to moe or otome fans?

189
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,083
It's hard to tell what's genre

190
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,750
and what's subversion
of genre these days.

191
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,166
At the very least,

192
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,083
let's decide if this is a gag
show or a realistic one.

193
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,625
[MISTER KITTY]
Mm-hmm!

194
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,916
Let's explode.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,250
Do what?

196
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,541
Get your safety
goggles on, everyone.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,625
Okay.

198
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,750
Now it's a gag show.

199
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,625
I'm blind!

200
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,000
My eyes!

201
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,791
And now this show's realistic.

202
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,333
Huh, but we're still alive?

203
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,583
So it's not that realistic.

204
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,291
Shall we make
it extra real, then?

205
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,250
Let's try.

206
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:52,166
After this, I get sushi.

207
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,166
[MINOA]
Mister Kitty!

208
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,833
That's real.

209
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,125
Super real.

210
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,541
Intense, huh?

211
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,750
Hardcore.

212
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,333
Mister Kitty, no!

213
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,708
What have you done?

214
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,166
That was a cat-tastrophe

215
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,458
Are you gonna be okay?

216
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,291
[MISTER KITTY]
Yesh, I ain't dead, am I?

217
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,666
Hey, Minoa.

218
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,291
You're not going home yet?

219
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,250
I wanted to talk to Mister Kitty
some more, that's all.

220
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,791
I see.

221
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,458
I was worried since you were
having such a tough time today.

222
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,791
I hope you feel better.

223
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,583
Uh... Yeah, thanks.

224
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,291
[MINOA] The whole world
is completely bonkers,

225
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,375
and they think
I'm the weird one.

226
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:50,958
Sure.

227
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,583
Catch you later.

228
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,833
[MINOA]
Hey, Aurora?

229
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,458
Aurora?

230
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,208
Nakano?

231
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,250
That's me.

232
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,416
Uh, well, I, uh...

233
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,666
You said you had
five siblings, right?

234
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,208
I was just wondering.

235
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,833
Do you have a brother that's
a whole bunch older than you?

236
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,625
Like maybe.

237
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,125
Twenty years or so?

238
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,791
Not that I know of!

239
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,291
Why d'you ask?

240
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,208
[MINOA]
Nuh-uh.

241
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,916
Forget I said anything.

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,958
Sorry.

243
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,708
See ya!

244
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,375
[MISTER KITTY] What's this
brother stuff all about?

245
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,541
It's nothing.

246
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,416
[exhales]

247
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,208
Hey, I'm back!

248
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,208
[FAMILY]
Welcome home.

249
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,250
[MAYA] It was raining
out there, wasn't it?

250
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,541
Are you okay?

251
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,083
[AI]
You're home awfully late.

252
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,416
[SHUGO]
Sorry, we already watched

253
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,000
today's episode
of <i>Tennen Maid</i> .

254
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,250
[MAYA]
Earth to Mii.

255
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,458
Uh, yeah, I hear you.

256
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,583
Okay, nothing creepy.

257
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,833
You're acting weird.

258
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,750
Maybe you just need to eat.

259
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,916
Oh yeah.

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,375
We watched
<i>Molly the Witch</i> , too.

261
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,250
Hope you're not mad.

262
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Oh, please, no!

263
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,166
I'll get started cooking dinner.

264
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,208
I can lend a hand.

265
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,666
Let me help, too.

266
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,041
Aw, thanks!

267
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,000
Let's have a
race to the kitchen!

268
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,541
[MAYA, SHUGO]
Ha HA!

269
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,250
[SHUGO]
Looks good.

270
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:50,875
Take this.

271
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,166
[AI]
Of course!

[ERICA]
This is bad!

00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,875
What's happening?

275
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,875
[MIKO] A Gigamanchinju
showed up nearby.

276
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,750
Gigamanchinju?

277
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,791
It's headed for
the school as we speak.

278

[KAI]
Worry not!

279
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,291
I've got you covered.

280

My barrier's impenetrable.

281
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,125
[MINOA] I guess Kaikai hasn't
changed much, has he?

282
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,708
That's strangely reassuring.

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,166

That's the fifth goal
he's burned down.

00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,875
It's wrong.

Why don't any of you have
a problem with this?

The world's messed up!

00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,375
This isn't an anime!

"This isn't an anime," she says.

00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,458
What's there to complain about?

294
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,500
You've been acting
strange lately.

295
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,875
Anime is life and life is anime,
exactly how it should be.

296

If you've been possessed by
evil, then I will purify you!

You guys have got to wake up!

298
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,333
Anime's anime, it's not reality!

Don't act like I'm crazy!

Huh?

[ALICE]
What a terrifying child!

303

I thought you
loved the anime club

00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,583
more than anyone, but now this?

You traitor!

00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,625
You're missing the point!

If you can't embrace the world
of anime in its every form,

310
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,166
then you're not
a true fan at all.

You've disappointed
me greatly, Minoa.

This is stupid!

You've disappointed
me greatly, Minoa.

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,083
There's only one
episode left, after all.

333
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,250
[MINOA]
Stupid freakin' thing.

334
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,791
Huh?

335
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,291
Huh?

336
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,458
[MINOA]
Morning.

337
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,791
[MIKO]
Good morning.

338
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,875
[MINOA]
Morning, Yui.

339
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,125
[YUI]
Hey.

340
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,333
It's crazy,
but ever since I got here,

341
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,250
I feel like the whole
school's been staring at me.

342
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,708
What do you expect?

343
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,041
Huh?

344
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,541
After all, you said
you hated anime, didn't you?

345
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,791
I did not!

346
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,500
That's ridiculous!

347
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,583
Good day to you.

348
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,500
Let's talk.

349
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,041
Aurora.

350
00:17:55,958 --> 00:18:00,208
[AURORA] Could you, uh,
not call me that, please?

351
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,250
You're right.

352
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,083
Our world has
definitely changed.

353
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,541
[MINOA]
You believe me?

354
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,666
[AURORA]
I do.

355
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,166
Though I wonder if
I would have noticed

356
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,958
if you hadn't mentioned it.

357
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,625
I'm so glad.

358
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,916
No one else cared,

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,291
so I started to think that
I was the crazy one.

360
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,666
There must be
a cause for all of this.

361
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,041
Like what?

362
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,208
Like some sort of catalyst

363
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,791
that could make
the impossible, possible.

364
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,208
You know of anything
that sticks out?

365
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,666
Before the world changed, right?

366
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,083
This is all your fault!

367
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,583
'Scuse me?

368
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,833
[MINOA] I should have known
a talking cat wasn't normal!

369
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,083
And it took you this long
to come to that conclusion?

370
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,958
You showed up the second
I opened that weird door.

371
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,125
I remember.

372
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,958
That is correct, yes.

373
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,916
I never thought to question
why that room was off-limits.

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,583
And now, everyone else is
talking to you like it's normal

375
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,541
and reality is falling
apart more every day.

376
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,166
You're behind
all of this, admit it!

377
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,208
Right?

378
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,375
I mean he's gotta be.

379
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,500
It's time. We're going to
get to the bottom of this.

380
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,791
Uh... Uh, no! No, wait!

381
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:23,375
[AURORA laughs]

382
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,000
Huh?

383
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,875
It's gone.

384
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:43,458
[GUY] I summon the Black Eyes
Red Blue Yellow Golden Dragon!

385
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,125
Attack!

386
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,666
[GIRL]
Kick it into turbo!

387
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:54,208
[ALICE, MIKO] Essa essa, hoisa
hoisa, essa essa, hoisa hoisa.

388
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:54,916
[MINOA]
Alice!

389
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,333
Miko!

390
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,208
What is it?

391
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,583
[MINOA gasps]

392
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,458
[shrieks]

393
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,291
It's all anime now.

394
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,875
Even me.

395
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,791
The shackles have been broken.

396
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,208
What d'you mean?

397
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,750
With the Observer absent,
chaos will reign.

398
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,208
Order will be destroyed.

399
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,333
Oh no.

400
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,708
Did you betray us again?

401
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,791
Who are ya?

402
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,041
Huh, punk?

403
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,791
You from the other side?

404
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,291
[AURORA laughs]

405
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,166
That's right.

406
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm from the anime side.

407
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,125
Same side as you, kitty.

408
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,166
You're from the anime side, too?

409
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,958
[MISTER KITTY]
You're asking a talking cat?

410
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,958
Soon, this world won't exist.

411
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,458
It will be engulfed in anime!

412
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,750
What does that mean?

413
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,000
So who do you work for?

414
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,166
[AURORA]
See for yourself.

415
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,250
It's a new world.

416
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,000
A big bang!

417
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,000
[shrieks]

418
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:24,583
[laughter]

419
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,791
Everyone.

420
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,166
Huh?

421
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,208
Take a peek at the truth.

422
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,500
I was thinking, this episode?

423
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,458
No anime talk.

424
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:23,541
Which is funny, 'cause Anime-
Gataris means "anime talks."

425
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,250
Y'know, let's check
the opening to be sure.

426
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,250
[YUI]
Jeez!

427
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,625
Yui-miliating!

428
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,250
[MISTER KITTY]
Yui-miliating.

429
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,666
Man, that's a good one.

430
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,583
[laughs] They should give
that girl her own show.

431
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,333
Retro remakes are
in these days, right?

432
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,291
Okay, here we go, the title.

433
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,583
Anime-Gataris.

434
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,000
Anime talks.

435
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,875
Anime non-talks? What the?
