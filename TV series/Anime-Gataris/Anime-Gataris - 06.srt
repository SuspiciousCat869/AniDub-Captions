1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:08,625
[TORU]
'Kay!

2
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,416
One last push, then we'll break!

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,666
Training camp's just getting
started, you can't give up yet!

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,583
Good! Now wash that sweat off!

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,458
Time to hit the shower!

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,000
[YUI] Hmm!
I'm ready for round two!

7
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,125
[ALICE] Okay, the Kashima
Line train is decorated

8
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,791
with art from the anime,
so that's first.

9
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,583
Next is the mall
and the Aqua Tower.

10
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,500
Then we'll buy the limited-
edition plaques at the shrine.

11
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,166
We also need
to visit the udon shop

12
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,250
the Tildama II crashed into.

13
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,666
I want to check out that
one hotel that got blasted

14
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,958
in the huge fight, too.

15
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,625
Let's go see the
victory flag as well.

16
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,083
Oh! The one on the
firetruck, you mean?

17
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,500
During the parade?

18
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,833
And don't forget all
the restaurant events.

19
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,250
They sell Hamburg Steaks
with school crests!

20
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's get <i>anmitsu</i> , too!

21
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:35,666
And the limited edition <i>anko</i>
<i>manju</i> before it sells out!

22
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,041
Wow!

23
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,500
You've really been doing
your research, haven't you?

24
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,291
[MINOA]
Yup.

25
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,625
I'm a mecca expert!

26
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,541
Like "hotspots," not robots.

27
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,833
Uh... "There's over
3,000 real-life locations

28
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,583
that were featured in anime."

29
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,041
Oarai, Chichibu, and, uh...

30
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,458
There's the Hida region.

31
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,208
SayAma, Kamakura, Onomichi.

32
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,666
It's kind of a thing now.

33
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,916
In fact, some local governments
will even cooperate

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,166
with anime studios
during production.

35
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,375
[MINOA]
That's awesome!

36
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,458
But wait, what exactly
are you supposed to do

37
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,083
once you get there?

38
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,125
You can act out the scenes from
the anime, or take pictures,

39
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,708
or just bask in the glory

40
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,458
of the 2D and 3D worlds
coming together.

41
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,541
It's also fun to play
detective and figure out

42
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,875
which details are
different from the anime.

43
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,916
Or maybe just line up
shots and compare.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,541
That sounds fun!

45
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,333
Some places even feature
super exclusive recordings

46
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,833
from voice actors or
special merchandise.

47
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,166
Also, whether you're chatting
it up with another fan

48
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,083
or asking a
local about the area,

49
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,125
anime pilgrimages are
a great way to make friends.

50
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,166
There's lotsa smartphone
apps for this, too.

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,708
They have photo filters

52
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,458
with different anime characters
and maps of the entire area.

53
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,166
Better download those now.

54
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,625
It's not a theme park,
so we should mind our manners.

55
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,791
We can't leave a
bad impression, right?

56
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,083
No, ma'am!

57
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,458
Oh cool, I got the app!

58
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,291
[ALICE]
That's handy!

59
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,583
[ERICA]
Yep.

60
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:57,083
[ALICE] It's got official
art and everything!

61
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,958
You hungry?

62
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,333
[shrieks]

63
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,583
Sorry.

64
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,375
Are you okay?

65
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,416
Why are you sweating?

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,666
It's not a fever, is it?

67
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,666
[pants]

68
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,875
This is not my genre!

69
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,083
Get me out!

70
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,333
Zetoro, where are you Zetoro?

71
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,541
"Apple, otherwise known
as Margrave Mijarea-bat-golt

72
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,791
suddenly fled from
the scene of the accident."

73
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,166
Uhm, hey, do you have a second?

74
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,208
Actually, I'd better get going.

75
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,708
She starts a
conversation only to end it,

76
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,791
her long eyelashes
fluttering with hesitation

77
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,916
as she averts her gaze.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,541
Her silhouette vanishes,
melting into the sunset.

79
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,708
Could this seemingly
meaningless interaction actually

80
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,083
foreshadow something
far more dire?

81
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:00,625
Hey!

82
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,333
Not bad, you two!

83
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,458
I approve!

84
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,750
A little club romance
is no prob!

85
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,083
[KAI]
What romance?

86
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,750
Wait! Come back!

87
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:09,625
No way.

88
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,291
Koenji and me?

89
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,083
Calm down.

90
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,666
Calm down, you fool!

91
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,291
This situation requires careful
analysis, not flights of fancy!

92
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,625
Oh! There you are, Kaikai!

93
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,875
Why'd you run off?

94
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,083
Did'ja get motion sickness
or something?

95
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:29,750
My brain is currently executing
Emergency Order Nine-Nine-Nine,

96
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,583
otherwise known as
the heartless seal.

97
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,333
To use the language
of commoners,

98
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,625
I am investigating the
conspiracy known as "love."

99
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,666
Now leave me to my query!

100
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,416
You had me worried, but looks
like you're the same old Kaikai!

101
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Wait, no.

102
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,333
He didn't do the thing!

103
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,541
Musashisakai.

104
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,333
[KAI]
Kai!

105
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,416
Hee! That's better!

106
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,250
I bet the hot springs
are gonna be fun, too!

107
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,500
Speaking of hot springs,
now that I think back,

108
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,666
there weren't any
God Rays in <i>Girls and Tank</i> .

109
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,000
Fans will be disappointed
if there's no bath scene,

110
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,041
but the big bright God Rays
keep everything safe for TV.

111
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,291
I've heard of those!

112
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,833
Let's see.

113
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,125
God Rays are mysterious lights
that appear out of nowhere,

114
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,375
but disappear when a
show comes out on DVD, right?

115
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,500
Never actually seen
them myself, though.

116
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,291
But I hope I can soon!

117
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,208
You've really
been studying hard!

118
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,875
Your notes here are great, too!

119
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,791
She stayed up all night putting
together our travel plans.

120
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,750
We really owe you one!

121
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,666
It's fine.

122
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,500
I've got to be useful somehow!

123
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,875
I have a friend at training camp

124
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,750
that got me fired
up, that's all.

125
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,708
At camp this year.

126
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,541
I'm gonna break
my record, for sure!

127
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,916
Gotta keep pushing
yourself, right?

128
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,791
[ERICA]
I'll be the Minister of Anime!

129
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,208
[ALICE]
Wow, you're going global!

130
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,083
[MINOA]
Huh?

131
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,875
What're you guys talking about?

132
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,583
We're sharing our ambitions,

133
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,250
things we want to do as
anime club members.

134
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,666
[MINOA]
Whoa, cool!

135
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,291
But what's the
Minister of Anime?

136
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,708
Still working on that one.

137
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,791
But, like, someone who could
bring the world together

138
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,708
through the power
of anime, somehow.

139
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,208
And you guys?

140
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,041
To have a commanding knowledge
of every anime in history,

141
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,375
stored right here in my brain.

142
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,666
I want to write a light novel

143
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,625
and have it turned
into an anime.

144
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,541
[AURORA] I want to break down
the walls between 2D and 3D.

145
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,791
The distinction is clearly
a dated concept.

146
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,000
Ohhh. That's amazing.

147
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,666
You guys have got
some serious ambition!

148
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,291
I don't have anything like that.

149
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,083
So, speaking of goals,
how 'bout this:

150
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,541
For today,

151
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,500
we'll find every spot
from <i>Girls and Tank</i> !

152
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,333
From every single scene!

153
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,333
That would be a murder march!

154
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,791
But it wouldn't be a proper
pilgrimage if we didn't try.

155
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,375
Then we'll marathon
DVDs all night!

156
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,583
Let's do it!

157
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,166
[GIRLS]
Yas!

158
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,458
[MINOA]
Whoa!

159
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,916
I didn't think this
would be so official!

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,666
[ERICA] They put stamps
on a card and everything!

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,083
[MIKO]
This is it.

162
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,083
In the movie, Rosehappy's
Crubaider rammed

163
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,416
into Klaklara's T-34
and went through this wall.

164
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,416
And it's a real
place you can eat?

165
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,458
It's all real!

166
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,750
Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

167
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,833
People are super into this!

168
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,125
Here! Got some for us!

169
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,791
[ERICA] You're so
considerate, Minoacchi!

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,666
Well, you know what they say
about bird poop and good luck?

171
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,458
Don't be sad!

172
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,583
There's so much more!

173
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,791
Look at the ocean!

174
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,125
It's just like that
scene with Rinpomi!

175
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,541
Huuh?

176
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,458
Whoa, you're right!

177
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,708
I'll cheer up!

178
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,166
This is our pilgrimage!

179
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,708
I can't waste it!

180
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,708
Uh-oh.

181
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,166
Stupid wind!

182
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,541
I'm useless.

183
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,750
Why do I keep screwing up?

184
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,791
It's no big deal, really.

185
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,083
Crazy things happen
when you're on vacation.

186
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,750
[KAI]
Crazy things?

187
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,250
It's part of your charm!

188
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,458
You're the clumsy girl!

189
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,583
[MINOA]
Did I make Kaikai mad?

190
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,875
Am I ruining his trip?

191
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,708
I never thought that
you could breach my barrier!

192
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,833
Do you truly intend
to subject my heart?

193
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,458
Go away!

194
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,625
I'm sorry, guess I never
should've come on this trip

195
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,708
in the first place.

196
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,583
Begone!

197
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,291
Leave my sight, foul temptress!

198
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,416
I rebuke thee!

199
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,625
It's that bad, huh?

200
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,125
No, you're right, it's my fault.

201
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,875
I'll take the next train home.

202
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Fight the Organization
if you must.

203
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,916
But watch your timing.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,041
Oh, uh, sorry.

205
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,708
It's okay.

206
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,708
[GIRLS]
What?

207
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,375
[ERICA]
There's no DVD player!

208
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,791
[MINOA]
There's no TV!

209
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,166
[ERICA] We're going
to miss <i>Yuri on Nice</i> !

210
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,166
How are we supposed to have
our anime marathon tonight?

211
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,166
Yo! Hey, you guys're late!

212
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,541
You kept me waiting!

213
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,916
Mister Gomon!

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,791
What is the meaning of this?

215
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,041
[MASATO]
I know, I know, sorry.

216
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,125
On our tiny budget, this is
the best that I could do for us.

217
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,250
[ALICE] If money is the issue,
you should have consulted me!

218
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,583
[MIKO] We've gotten
in enough trouble

219
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,083
for over-spending, already.

220
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,625
Well, the outdoor
baths are still nice.

221
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,583
There's electric
massagers, out there!

222
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:56,875
[MASATO laughs]

223
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,666
[ALICE]
I can't hang them all.

224
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,083
[ERICA]
Obviously.

225
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,625
[MIKO]
Minoa, something wrong?

226
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,625
I, uh... No.

227
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,250
I was just gonna take a bath.

228
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,833
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

229
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,791
I'm just ruining the pilgrimage
for everyone else in the club.

230
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,333
[sighs]

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,708
[MINOA]
Whatever!

232
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,625
Just take your bath.

233
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,375
When one becomes
absorbed in the reality

234
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,166
they've constructed for
themselves, they become blind.

235
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,041
Then they start to
overlook obvious details

236
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,791
in the real world.

237
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,250
Like in <i>Donmachi</i> and <i>Aekoi</i> .

238
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,333
[AURORA] You mean when the
main character doesn't notice

239
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,166
that a girl is in
love with them?

240
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,125
The viewers see his
ignorance as a plot device.

241
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,333
But if that happened in
reality, would we notice?

242
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,500
Maybe we too would be
blind to obvious flirtation!

243
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,875
Then how would
we discern the truth?

244
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,541
Uhh...

245
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,666
I'm, uh, asking for
a friend, of course

246
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,916
Okay.

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,416
So your "friend" needs
to know how to find out

248
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,833
if a girl has a crush on him?

249
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,875
Yeah.

250
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,416
Well, that's easy.

251
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,291
It's just like in any anime.

252
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,541
A girl may be too shy
to say things directly,

253
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,416
but she'll leave little hints
to see if you reciprocate.

254
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,833
Like what?

255
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,208
[AURORA]
Think of it this way.

256
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,500
In <i>My Big Love Story</i> ,

257
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,416
Tsuyo misses all the obvious
signs from Tomato,

258
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,666
because he thinks that no one
would love someone like him.

259
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,250
Do you think the signs
would be that obvious

260
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,750
for someone like my friend?

261
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,541
[AURORA] The point is that
people shouldn't get caught up

262
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,833
on preconceptions
about themselves.

263
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,666
They should look
for signs objectively.

264
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,208
In a text, a phone call,
even a fleeting glance.

265
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,333
I see.

266
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,958
Objectively, huh?

267
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,583
Was that an accident?

268
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,958
Or was it a sign?

269
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,750
I suppose it was rather forward.

270
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,791
I'm a fool!

271
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,833
I've been a clueless romance
protagonist all along!

272
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,541
[AURORA]
Hmm?

273
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,041
[KAI]
Were there any other signs?

274
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,541
Come on, you fool!

275
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,666
Use that amazing brain
of yours to think!

276
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,333
Huh?

277
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,750
[shrieks]

278
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,166
[KAI]
It... It's a heart!

279
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,625
A heart mark?!

280
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,791
[AURORA]
What heart mark?

281
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,333
Like the one in Line Chat?

282
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,666
That's tricky.

283
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,166
Some girls use those
a bunch just to look cute.

284
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,916
But others save them
for someone they really like.

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,250
It's hard to say

286
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,958
unless I really know
the personality of the girl.

287
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,000
[KAI]
That doesn't help at all!

288
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,458
There are infinite
possibilities!

289
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,666
How am I to forge my future?

290
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,708
This is the choice
of Shrimp's Gate!

291
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,541
[ERICA]
We're here!

292
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,125
Come on in.

293
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,875
We're about to have
a club meeting.

294
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,750
Are you all right?

295
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,375
[KAI]
Uh, yeah.

296
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,583
It's strange.

297
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,750
I've never seen
Minoa act like that.

298
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,500
Something is wrong.

299
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,250
[MIKO] I agree, but maybe
there's a side of her

300
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,791
that none of us know about.

301
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,583
If you ask me, I think
Minoa's just trying

302
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,291
to find her identity as
a member of the club.

303
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,125
[GIRLS]
Identity?

304
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,500
[ALICE] She doesn't need to
worry about that sort of thing.

305
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,791
She just needs to be herself.

306
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,375
That's true I guess?

307
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,625
[MIKO]
She's a good listener.

308
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,666
She's nice,
and she's open to anything.

309
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,958
[ERICA]
Yeah, but then sometimes,

310
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,750
she'll get all fired up
and really surprise you.

311
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,000
Right.

312
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,625
Like when we were
having that argument.

313
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,250
You'll make anime cry!

314
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,791
You guys shouldn't
fight over it!

315
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,000
What she said then
really touched my heart.

316
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,500
[AURORA] And remember
her speech to the student body?

317
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,666
We have lost a club room

318
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,041
to our noble, glorious
cause, it's true.

319
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,666
The audience was a bit baffled,
but it all worked out.

320
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,833
I don't think we could have done
it without her breaking the ice.

321
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,125
[ERICA] And when I'd almost
given up on the club.

322
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,958
We're lucky to have
a president like you,

323
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,666
so I hope you'll stick
around a long time!

324
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,708
She always works hard,
and she never loses hope.

325
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,041
If it wasn't for her,

326
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,208
then we wouldn't even have
an anime club right now!

327
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,375
She's done so much
for us just by being herself.

328
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,916
I feel the same way!

329
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,958
[ALICE] Whatever she's going
through, she's our friend,

330
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,250
and she's an important
part of the club, too.

331
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,416
We'll find a way to support her!

332
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,833
[AURORA] Why don't you
tell her that in person?

333
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,583
Good point.

334
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,333
Let's go.

335
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,291
Okay!

336
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,625
Is she still bathing?

337
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,125
She's been gone a long time.

338
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,458
Where is the bath?

339
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,041
Where is anything?

340
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,041
[MASATO] Let's split up
here and search for her.

341
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,833
Ahem! Be careful
you don't get lost.

342
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,375
Call me if something happens.

343
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,958
Sebasu!

344
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,625
Does Koenji really blugh?

345
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,291
Does she blugh me?

346
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,208
I need to focus
on Asagaya right now!

347
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,291
But still, that heart mark.

348
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,541
[gasps]

349
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,041
Wait, what if you read
the message vertically?

350
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:23,916
It says,

351
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,625
"I can't tell you.

352
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,833
Heart mark."

353
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,500
There's only one way you
could possibly read that!

354
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,000
I love you.

355
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,541
Miko.

356
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:42,041
Our rainbow days
have arrived at last.

357
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,333
What deadly magic!

358
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,500
But forgive me, Koenji!

359
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:52,000
I was clueless for far too long!

360
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,833
I yearn to be your
one true blugh,

361
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,416
yet, Asagaya still needs me!

362
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,541
Do I choose love, or duty?

363
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,708
The yin and yang of
fate dances beguilingly

364
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,666
within my troubled mind!

365
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,250
I must dispel
this fog of indecision!

366
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,833
I will trounce all
uncertainty and be...

367
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,875
...free!

368
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,708
[AURORA] Are you
all right, little kitten?

369
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:20,708
[MINOA]
Huh?

370
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,458
Nakano, hey!

371
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,833
[AURORA] The anime club
still working out for you?

372
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:28,458
[MINOA]
Yeah!

373
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,750
I mean, of course!

374
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,500
It's opened up
a whole new world.

375
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,333
I can't even imagine life
without anime now!

376
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,958
Also, if it wasn't for anime,
I never would've met you guys!

377
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,125
I know I haven't been at it
as long as everyone else,

378
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,125
but it's so nice that
I can finally talk to you

379
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,291
about some stuff.

380
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,541
[AURORA]
Yeah?

381
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,125
[MINOA]
But...

382
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,458
I feel like I'm screwing up the
trip for everyone in the club,

383
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,541
and it's kinda making
me hate myself now.

384
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,708
[AURORA]
While you were gone,

385
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,166
we were all reliving
some Minoa-gataris.

386
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,833
[MINOA]
What does that mean?

387
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,291
It means we were
talking about you

388
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,958
and about your
place in the club.

389
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:00,958
[MINOA]
Huh?!

390
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,458
That sounds scary.

391
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,708
What did you say?

392
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,750
[AURORA]
Sorry.

393
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,625
Heh. It's a secret.

394
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,625
[MINOA]
Ah! Come on!

395
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,833
[AURORA] I can tell
you one thing, though.

396
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,666
All of us love you and we're
all happy that you're here.

397
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,750
[ALICE]
Minoa!

398
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,666
[AURORA]
See?

399
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,791
Everyone was worried about you.

400
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,083
It's written all
over their faces.

401
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,875
Thank goodness.

402
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,625
You shouldn't
scare us like that.

403
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,666
Really!

404
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,500
What were you thinking?

405
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,833
Stupid!

406
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,125
I didn't mean to worry you.

407
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,250
I'm sorry.

408
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,125
Hang on guys.

409
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,541
I think Kaikai just disappeared?

410
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,041
Is he lost, too?

411
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,250
Guess we'll look for him next!

412
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,916
[KAI screams]

413
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,458
A haunting cry.

414
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,791
Not human.

415
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,041
This must be a
paranormal phenomenon.

416
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,833
[MINOA shrieks]
Guess we found Kaikai!

417
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,250
Why is he nude, pray tell?

418
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,291
Don't worry.
It's safe to look.

419
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,375
He's right!

420
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,000
You can't see!

421
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,625
Ahh! Those are
God Rays, aren't they?

422
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,791
I finally get to
experience them!

423
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,875
[ALICE]
Real-life censorship beams!

424
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,375
How lovely!

425
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,791
[ERICA]
What are you talking about?

426
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,250
That's not a thing!

427
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,083
You can't apply a
digital censor to real life!

428
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,208
Oh good, everyone's safe.

429
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,041
Lights off.

430
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,125
[MINOA]
Real-life God Rays!

431
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,583
I still need to
see them in anime,

432
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,333
but that's a start at least!

433
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,041
I feel slightly less dumb now!

434
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,208
You're not dumb.

435
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,583
You're amazing.

436
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,750
And the anime club wouldn't
be the same without you.

437
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,791
Don't forget that, okay?

438
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,750
Huh?

439
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,583
[MINOA]
Okay.

440
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,916
[MIKO]
Hey, Musashisakai.

441
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
[gasps]

442
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,333
Have a sec?

443
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,125
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

444
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,333
Uh-huh.

445
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:31,333
I too had something
I wanted to say to you.

446
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,875
[MIKO]
All right, you first, then!

447
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,500
Well... I, uh...

448
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,333
Your magic, it's deadly.

449
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,333
No.

450
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,208
What I'm trying
to say here is...

451
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:48,416
...I like you!

452
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,166
[MIKO]
I knew it. I knew it.

453
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,833
You're in love
with Nakano after all!

454
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,041
Gyah! Yes!

455
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,875
Oh my gosh, you two
are such a cute couple!

456
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,500
I saw you on the train,
when you were sitting,

457
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,416
facing each other,
and Musashisakai,

458
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,458
you were looking at the
ground and turning all red

459
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,583
and then you freaked
out and ran away!

460
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,416
I thought, "Could it be"?

461
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,833
And yes! Everything is perfect!

462
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,583
[KAI]
I hate to burst your bubble.

463
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,125
I think there's been a
misunderstanding here.

464
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,708
I can keep it a secret!

465
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,875
Musashinaka?

466
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,625
Nakasakai!

467
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,166
I'll build a shrine
to your love!

468
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,291
Normally, I'm only into 2D,
but this is so adorable,

469
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,333
you just became my OTP for sure!

470
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,583
[KAI]
2D, huh?

471
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,375
Then, just so we're clear.

472
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,833
What was that text
message about last night?

473
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:44,916
Last night?

474
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,041
Huh? I already forgot!

475
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,791
Oh. Anyway, you two
have all of my support!

476
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,833
[AURORA]
You wanna hit the baths again?

477
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:56,500
[KAI]
Yeah.

478
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,875
Huh?

479
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:34,875
[MISTER KITTY shrieks]

480
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,166
Next episode, we
learn a dark secret!

481
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,291
You won't find the answer
hidden in text messages, though.

482
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,791
But while we're on the subject,

483
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,416
