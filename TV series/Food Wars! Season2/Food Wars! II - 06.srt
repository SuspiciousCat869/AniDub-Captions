Verily I say unto thee...

00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,512
it is as we step upon the final
battle at Gojo Ohashi Bridge!

Whereupon Benkei
grips his blade...

What's this awesome
smoky scent all over me?

00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,569
[IKUMI]
It's bacon!

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,572
But if he's trying to
copy Soma's recipe,

14
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,007
shouldn't he be using
oxtail in his stew instead?

15
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,243

that bacon for...

[MIMASAKA]
As you can see Soma...

21
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,051
Your recipe has no imagination

22
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,986
and is the type
that is strained.

23
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,657
The result is a plain dish
consisting of just
sauce and meat.

24
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,993
[ERINA]
<i>And that's where an</i>

I can't stand it!

It's pretty mellow
but still manages

He used mesquite for his
smoking chips... nicely played.

37
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,990
It's a tree native to
the southern U. S.
often used for smoking,

38
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,058
though it hasn't really
spread to Japan.

39
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,761
In Texas, famous for
its barbecue,

40
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,098
it's one of the most beloved
smoking chips to use.

41
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,766
It has a sharp aroma to it...

42
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,235
and when used for
certain cuts of meat...

43
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,838
it can lend to them a
nice golden brown color.

44
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,573
I brined it first for juices...

45
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,511
then added simple spices
like sage, nutmeg, and
some bay leaves...

46
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,579
then came my
secret weapon...

47
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,780
brown sugar.

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,950
That will really draw out
the umami in this stew.

49

How does he know that?!

50

He knows as much as Shun
about smoked meat!

what is going on?!

[SONOKA]
What's he thinking?

55
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,996
Soma doesn't look like he's
adding any special garnish.

56
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,100
He probably thought
it was kind of unessential
like most people do.

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,068
Huh?

(Sonoka crying)
But when it comes to beef stew,

60
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,907
the garnish is an extremely
important ingredient
to consider.

61
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,275
The war is over.

62
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,845
There's no way Soma Yukihira
can win now.

63
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,848
You can't possibly assume that
without even tasting it.

64
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,282
That's no way to judge.

In a top kitchen,
a person like that

66

would just cause friction

So you turned out to be
THAT type of cook, huh?

There are only two routes
someone who knows about my
perfect copies can take.

00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,858
There's pattern 1...

Bluffing until they launch
a surprise attack...

announcing what they'll
make ahead of time...

141
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,533
then shifting gears
and making something
completely different.

142
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,568
But guys who are confident
in their skills

143
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,637
tend to go with a
different approach...

144
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,171
I call this Pattern 2.

145
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,806
Impromptu cooking...

146
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,609
a way of battling out
with a perfectly clean slate

147

They've got nothing in mind.

Even so, most chefs
have panicked and lost

without being able to
bring forth a finished
dish to the judges.

00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,231
I know everything
about you boy...

156
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,669
including how you went to
Aldini's apartment this morning.

157
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,436
And how after that...

158
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:55,208
I watched as you stocked up
on a bunch of specialty meat.

159
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,613
All right. We will begin our
judging with Subaru Mimasaka's
beef stew.

160
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,214
[MIMASAKA]
Go ahead...

161
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,551
Time to eat up! Oooo...

162
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:09,590
So for your garnish, you
chose to use smoked bacon,
mushrooms, and oignons glacés.

163
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,226
Incidentally, glacés means
"frozen" in French.
Did you know that already?

164
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,797
Anyway, I think their
glistening sheen gives
your dish a delightful little‐

165
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,866
Shut up and
eat already will you!

166
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,935
[SONOKA]
W‐well, here it goes.

167
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,003
Ahh...

168
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,270
(Gulp)

169
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,139
Mmmm...

170
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,274
[SONOKA]
<i>The juicy thickness</i>
<i>of the oxtail</i>

171
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,813
<i>combined with the</i>
<i>mellowness of the white miso</i>
<i>is simply exquisite!</i>

172
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,381
I feel like my tongue
could melt right off me!

173
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:40,587
[TAKI]
<i>What's more, the scent of the</i>
<i>mesquite in the bacon packs</i>
<i>a real punch to the throat!</i>

174
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,055
This is unbelievable!

175
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,825
I read all your moves,
even being impromptu.

176
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,694
That's the reason for
this added bacon.

177
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,532
I let it age in my special brine
for the last five days.

178
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,433
Then just to add
insult to injury.

179
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,770
I left it out in the wind,
letting it dry for a full day

180
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,239
before smoking it
for five full hours.

181
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,708
That's how I was able to
make it so flavorful...

182
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,810
'cause I spent
all that time on it.

183
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,445
That's true enough...

184
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,180
rather than muddling
the impact of the beef,

185
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,583
the umami of this
slow‐prepared pork

186
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,752
elevates it to a
whole other dimension.

187
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,020
<i>The time and effort</i>
<i>this took is palpable!</i>

188
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,125
<i>It has a refined power,</i>
<i>the exact opposite of</i>
<i>impromptu cooking!</i>

189
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,427
This is how Takumi's match
went down as well!

190
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,698
He even tried improvising,
but it's not going
to be enough...

191
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,600
His every move
ended up
being read.

192
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,134
He was one‐upped
by a moron!

193
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,237
It's just like Heaven!
So soft! So tender!

194
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,340
This flavor goes way beyond
just a simple copy.

195
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,576
(Crowd cheers)

196
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,810
[GIN]
This is like...

197
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,478
(Bell ring)
shooting sparks of flavor

198
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,549
as meat battles meat,
wrestling against each other
in the ring!

199
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,951
It's a dreadnought of
deliciousness

200
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,187
rippling through a body
of blossoming doom!

201
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,591
[SONOKANA]
No! I can't take it anymore!
(Screams)

202
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,993
[GIN]
The beef and pork combine...

203
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,729
...in a mouth‐watering
explosion!

204
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,931
(Crowd cheers)
[BOY]
They're all up in that meat!

205
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,201
I don't believe it!
He even wowed those pro chefs!

206
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,978
(Mimasaka laughs)

207
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,148
Looks like you had the
wrong idea, there Soma.

208
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,551
You trusted in
blind inspiration

209
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,720
to make a dish
right on the spot.

210
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,421
Mark my words boy...

211
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:24,625
That's nothing more
than your brain
being at a standstill.

212
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:28,762
When it comes to cooking boy...
the devil is always
in the details.

213
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:32,232
Whoever preps the most
will always win the most!

214
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,502
You can come up with as many
tricks as you want Soma...

215
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,337
but it's always pointless.

216
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,572
Pointless!

217
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,006
UTTERLY POINTLESS!

218
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,943
You should burn
this rotten day
into your memory.

219
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:47,280
For it will be the last dish
you ever serve in your life,

220
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,950
Soma Yukihira!

221
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,752
(Hiss)

222
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,692
(Mimasaka laughs)

223
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,094
(Soma laughs)

224
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,030
That's some pretty pathetic
talk there, Mimasaka.

225
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,667
You're not the only one
relying on things.

226
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,002
I was relying on you too.
[MIMASAKA] What the?

227
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,004
I've thought about you
this whole week.

228
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,839
Trying to piece together
were you were hiding

229
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,575
and what you were up to.

230
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,876
Huh?

231
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,113
[MIMASAKA]
<i>What's he tryin'</i>
<i>to pull over me?</i>

232
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,349
<i>I should've accounted</i>
<i>for everything. So what...</i>

233
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,486
<i>what am I afraid of?</i>

234
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,021
[SOMA]
Well, here you are.

235
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:28,822
(Scared cry)

236
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,390
Your order is up...

237
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,593
Yukihira‐style beef stew...

238
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,961
Fall Selection Special!

239
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:35,929
(Gasp)

240
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,363
He used different cuts of meat!

241
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,932
[ERINA] Hmm...
[EIZAN] Huh...

242
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,568
You're not screwing around
with us, are you?

243
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,771
I'm never seen any beef stew
like this before‐
[SOMA] What are you saying?

244
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,673
Have you never seen
beef stew before?

245
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,544
After all, they're all
considered a garnish.
[TAKI] What's that?!

246
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,012
Did he say they're
all garnishes?

247
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,214
The charcoal grill
gives it a rich aroma!

248
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,584
It looks like it's simmered
to absolute perfection.
[GIN] Hmm...

249
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,554
[MIMASAKA]
<i>Ha! Looks like a bunch of</i>
<i>different ingredients</i>

250
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:01,955
<i>all thrown together.</i>

251
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,356
<i>This thing is a jumbled mess.</i>

252
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,358
<i>There's no way it'll</i>
<i>come close to the beauty</i>

253
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,828
<i>that my garnish</i>
<i>bestowed upon the world.</i>

254
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:12,999
<i>My bacon was aged with the</i>
<i>alluring aroma of smoked</i>
<i>sizzling mesquite.</i>

255
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,170
<i>The flavors were carefully laid</i>
<i>out to enhance each component!</i>

256
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,841
Soo, the stew itself is
pretty much the exact same

257
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,709
as the previous
presented dish.

258
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,878
As for the garnish...

259
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:32,753
Hmm...

260
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,355
(Hinako screams)

261
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,757
[TAKI]
<i>Help me!</i>

262
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,592
<i>Right!</i>

263
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,393
<i>Left!</i>

264
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,329
<i>And an unexpected</i>
<i>twist ramming into me!</i>

265
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,731
OH GOD!

266
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:45,932
(Worried gasp)

267
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,400
The cheek meat is
so tender and juicy

268
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,469
that it practically
melts when you chew it.

269
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,405
The texture of the tongue and
the honeycomb is a lap fest of‐!

270
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,274
(Joyous screaming)

271
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,376
The grilled skirt steak
was sliced thick...

272
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,645
so the amount of juices
flowing out of it

273
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,480
is something else
entirely new!

274
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:01,915
When paired with the stew,

275
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,450
it accentuates into a bounty
of splendid loveliness!

276
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:08,054
Well, it looks like it's
thrown in carelessly at first,

277
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,290
but each cut was
prepared perfectly.

278
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,993
An expertly built
thrill ride of flavor.

279
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,663
Such a menagerie
achieving perfect balance.

280
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,799
Impossible! How is that?

281
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,567
How's that created on the fly?

282
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,035
[SOMA]
To tell you the truth...

283
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,671
I had the same ideas
as you obviously had.

284
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:29,242
I thought to boost the flavor
by using a powerful garnish
like smoked bacon, as well...

285
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,945
But I knew that
wouldn't work for me.

286
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,248
It's not my style of cooking.

287
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,118
So then I came up with
the idea of trying to combine

288
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,787
various flavors and ingredients
into one single dish.

289
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:45,391
(Gasp)
To think, you were able to
make such layers of flavor

290
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,893
using just a beef stew.

291
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,062
Actually, I just used
the thinking behind

292
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,532
a popular dish that I like
as a model for this.

293
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:53,133
"A popular dish"?

294
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,602
Yeah, it finally hit me right
in the head this morning.

295
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,303
The Chikuzenni dish.

296
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,905
[Both]
Huh?!

297
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,341
It's usually thought of as just
a simple simmered stew,

298
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,745
but chikuzenni made by a pro
turns out to be a bit different.

299
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,112
Right, Master Hinako?

300
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,181
Yes! Simmer time varies

301
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,116
according to each of the
different vegetables...

302
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,819
so that the color and flavor
is expressed fully in each.

303
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,622
Allowing each ingredient
to shine through.

304
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:19,125
Then at the very end,
they're all rearranged
into a single dish,

305
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,696
taking care to achieve optimal
balance between everyone.

306
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,264

00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:09,402
Don't ever think you can
wipe out someone's pride
with a single battle.

463
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,038
All the confidence you
so tirelessly built up...

464
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:15,742
Even if you suffer a loss that
tries to wash all that away...

465
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:19,112
Or a memory so terrible it
feels like you can't recover...

466
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,313
You can't quit.

467
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,616
You absolutely
MUST open up shop.

468
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:25,018
That's what makes
a true chef after all.

469
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,821
And you're like that too.

470
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,289
Never forget that.

471
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,758
[MIMASAKA]
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>he's actually tellin' me</i>

472
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:35,696
<i>to keep on cooking,</i>
<i>to keep on fighting.</i>

473
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,764
(Mimasaka and clown laughing)

474
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:41,401
[MIMASAKA]
<i>My heart, which was</i>
<i>wound hard and tight...</i>

475
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,071
<i>is starting to flow free!</i>

476
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,473
<i>I glisten freely!</i>

477
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,843
<i>Like the cuticles</i>
<i>of a young girl...</i>

478
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,377
(Girls gasp)

479
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,947
[IKUMI]
He bet that he'd stop cooking
just to show that if you lose,

480
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,583
you can always just pick
yourself up and try again?

481
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,019
Well, that doesn't
make a lick of sense.

482
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,554
Hehe...
That sounds right.

483
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,423
That's just like Soma.

484
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:07,393
[SOMA]
Yo, Erina. I've managed
to make it this far.

485
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,462
Reaching the top spot
among the 1st years

486
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:11,464
and getting a chance
to take you on...

487
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:14,367
is just ONE step away!

488
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,302
Don't fool yourself.

489
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,540
I'm so far above you
it's not even possible.

490
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,499
[ERINA]
Also...

491
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,102
you still haven't brought me
that manga you owe me.

492
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,303
[SOMA]
Huh?

493
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:58,805
[URARA]
Now then folks,

494
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,542
time to move on to the second
round of the semifinals!

495
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:02,509
(Crowd cheers)

496
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,844
Facing off will be...

497
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:08,882
Ryo Kurokiba and
his opponent Akira Hayama.

498
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,423
[NARRATOR]
Next time:

499
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,960
"Beasts that Devour Each Other."
