So you're going to be
experimenting with your
beef stew, right now?

82
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,681
I believe there are two
focal points in a beef stew...

83
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,550
the cut of beef to be used
and the demi‐glace sauce.

84
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,752
Sounds simple but I know
there's more to it than that.

85
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,454
Some places specialize
in just this stew.

86
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,757
I hear they spend
two weeks on the sauce...

87
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,926
just letting it simmer down
that whole time.

88
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,260
Unbelievable!

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,196
So... I'm assuming
you chose this dish

90
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,165
because you're confident
you'll be able to make
it in a short time?

91
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,636
Hmm... Whether I'm confident
or not is besides the point...

92
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,371
Ultimately it comes
down to taste!

93
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,608
(Grinding)

94
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,575
(Sizzle)

95
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,777
As you can gather by now,

96
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,514
this process will
give the finished dish
a much deeper flavor.

97
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,248
Once the meat's got
a good color goin',

98
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,384
you simmer it in stock and
some bouillon till it's tender.

99
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,154
Then you bring it to a boil,
and skim the fat out.

100
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,489
It already smells
unbelievably delectable!

101
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,895
If you bundle parsley, thyme,
bay leaves, and tarragon
into a petite bouquet garni...

102
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,598
it makes it easy to remove
the aromatics when done.

103
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,000
[MITSURU]
Oh! What a lovely color!

104
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,870
The key is to strain your
demi‐glace once it's simmered.

105
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,905
That will improve
the overall flavor.

106
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,642
Then just season it with some
salt and pepper and voila.

107
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,978
It's really not to terribly
difficult to cook.

108
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,179
Okay... it's done!

109
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,881
[MITSURU]
Wow! It's so rich!

110

looks absolutely perfect!

111
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,585
I can't wait to taste it!

112
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,787
Okay, now for a bite...

113
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,322
The chunks of meat
are so thick...

114
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,726
and yet they fall apart
just by using a spoon!

115
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,794

Mmm...

118
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,731
The moment it enters the mouth,

119
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,233
the meat just melts away
softly on the tongue.

120
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,870
Its juices explode
with each new chew,

121
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,439
mixing in with the demi‐glace
in a vibrant dance of life!

(Swallow)

123
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,510
Exquisite!

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,878
I usually think of beef stew

125
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,813
as being really acidic
and tough to chew.

126
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,916
But yours is somehow
so mellow and tender.

127
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,217
Did you notice?

128
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,587
My secret ingredient
is white miso.

129
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,956
The trademark acidity in a beef
stew comes from adding tomatoes.

130
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,793
As you see some people
don't care for them very much.

131
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,295
Adding white miso at the end
while it's still simmering

132
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
will allow for the acidity
to mellow out some.

133
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,067
Making something more
in line with what
Japanese people prefer.

134
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,202
Amazing!

135
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,770
I remember comin' up
with this...

136
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,507
I was a 2nd year in
middle school, at the time.

137
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,776
I was up late trying to work
on an off‐menu item.

138
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,179
This was the first dish of mine
that my dad said was good.

139
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,084
Whoa! You could easily beat
Mimasaka with this dish,
don't you think?

140
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,419
It's really good.

141
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,154
Nah, not even in the runnin'

142
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,925

I served to him yesterday.

143
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,359
Wha?!

144
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,161
Wait, why would you do
something like that?

145
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,331
Well... He would've found out
about it eventually anyway.

146
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,935
Plus, I wanted to try and
level the playing field
for us a bit...

147
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,236
I guess you'd say.

148
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,005
This was the best thing I made
before I came to Tohtsuki.

149
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,342
But how far have I evolved
since then, and is it enough?

150
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,312
And will this make Mimasaka
try even harder to try
and replicate my dish?

151
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:30,150
That flavor is just
the starting line
for this competition.

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,652

00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:46,232
[RYO]
<i>The only way to find a winner</i>
<i>is to throw it down in</i>
<i>a fight to the finish!</i>

156
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,734
[SOMA]
Still no good.

157
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,504
I added some cumin and cardamom
to flavor the meat...

158
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,839
like I learned from
making the curry...

159
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,908
but the aroma is
all off on this.

160
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,544
The demi‐glace is
coming off as too potent.

161
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,313
Adding spices while it's
simmering makes it too strong

162
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,283
while at the same time the
mild flavor is way too sharp.

163
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,052
I thought about completely
changing the flavoring agents...

164
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,288
but if the white miso
loses its mellowness,

165
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,356
the dish becomes
something different.

166
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,492
I've tried different ideas...

167
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,861
but I can't seem to find
just the right one.

168
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,297
In my Food War against
Meat Meat,

169
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,399
I had to combat A5‐grade beef.

170
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,336
Then, in the first battle,
I needed to beat
molecular gastronomy.

171
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:27,508
My thinking so far has been
to use my opponent's
specialty against them...

172
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,843
but Mimasaka's an
entirely different breed.

173
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,879
It's like I'm being
chased by my own shadow.

174
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,682
Hey, Mitsuru...
for the next trial dish‐

175
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,584
I'm way too full
to eat more.

176
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,119
Did you really finish
each and every dish?

177
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,722
I couldn't possibly leave
any of that uneaten,

178
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,790
that would be a waste!
(Burp)

179
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,926
It's no good.
I know his heart's in it,

180
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,094
but something about him
is not working.

181
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,232
Is there anyone with a good
sense of taste I can use?

[ERINA]
"You want to...

"Huh?"

00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,238
Wait! They only met
a few months ago

186
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,707
but they're already
walking together... ALONE?!

187
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,244
It won't be long before
they're holding hands
and whispering sweet nothings.

188
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,746
How lewd of them!

189
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,048
Ugh! I don't have the next one.

They can't just
leave me like this!

[ALICE]
Are you serious?

195

Don't tell me there's no one

even though you're in
high school surrounded
by gorgeous boys.

197

You really are completely
hopeless aren't you?

Yeah! It's a good thing it looks
like she was welcoming us, huh?

214
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,706
I'm NOT welcoming you.

Ryo comin' out the front gate.

I heard you two

that you ride in the same car
and talk all the time.

Enough of this nonsense!

Listen here...

227
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,496
There are strict guidelines
you must follow.

228
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,533
First you must be judged
whether you're suitable or not

229
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,101
and you'll also have to pay
a quite sizeable contract fee!

00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,505
That's how precious my taste
evaluations are, understand?!

Hey Mitsuru,
how much have you got?

00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,810
Huh?
You want ME to pay?

234
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,813
How could your pathetic
pocket change possibly be
enough for my palette?!

235
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,281
Well in any case...

236
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,551
I have no time to waste
with you right now.

Stay out of my freakin'
business Soma Yukihira!

at Kyokusei Dorm is reading
that exact same manga.

Still, if your answer's no,
then that's that.

Wait right there!

245
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,335
(BOTH)
Huh?

246
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,372
Um... well... I guess I uh...

247
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,641
I'll make an exception today
and have a taste.

248
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:15,909
I'm feeling charitable.

249
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,078
Huh? But we don't
have any money.

250
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,281
Money is not the only form
of compensation I seek.

251
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,050
There's always room
for some negotiation.

252
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,985
Yeah?

253
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,787
However... given the situation

254
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,922
I won't be able to
give you any advice.

255
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,858
I can only gauge the flavor.

[SOMA]
Well, if you don't mind.

257

a bouqet of aromatics.

The demi‐glace is homemade too.
The secret ingredient is‐

259
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,266
It's white miso.

I suppose lending me the
next volume of this manga

just totally dismiss it
right off the bat.

I thought it was so delicious

I could have eaten a
hundred bowls of it,

I mean I've never had
anything like it.

She really tore it
a new one, didn't she?

All she did was
criticize it...

offer a single hint

There's something Erina said...

00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,005
Hey Soma, another one please!

311
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,740
Today's special was
really delicious!

312
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,108
Soma!

313
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,343
[MIMASAKA]
Here ya go. Eat up.

314
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,044
Oh!

315
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,513
Wow!

316
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,280
Your order is up!

317
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,750
[CUSTOMER]
Oh, that is so good!

318
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,418
[OTHER CUSTOMER]
Thanks for the food, man!

319
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,554
Welcome!

320
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,355
[MIMASAKA]
I'm Soma Yukihira.

321
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,025
My dream is to one day
surpass my father

322
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,260
and take over as chef
of this place.

323
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,697
This is off‐menu item number 5
at our Japanese eatery...

324
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,198
"Yukihira" beef stew!

325
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,100
(Foodgasmic gasp)
It's delicious!

326
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,869
[TOMITA]
I feel so young!

327
00:13:55,969 --> 00:14:00,140
[MIMASAKA]
First thing I gotta do is beat
the snot outta this FLAVOR!

328
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,608
[MIMASAKA]
This was the best thing I made

329
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,177
before I came to
Tohtsuki's Academy...

330
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,580
You're welcome.

331
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,316
[MIMASAKA]
But how far have I
evolved since then,

332
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,686
[MIMASAKA]
and will it be enough?
[EIZAN]
Heh. Back to his image training.

333
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,755
[MIMASAKA]
It's a battle of imagination.
[EIZAN]
He does it every single time.

334
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:20,594
[EIZAN]
Well then, Soma Yukihira...
how will you combat this?

335
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,564
[SOMA]
(Frustrated sigh)

336
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,166
[MITSURU]
U‐um, Master Soma sir!

337
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,569
How about we lighten the mood
a little bit, huh?!

338
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,071
Look, the latest issue of TohSpo

339
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,273
published an article on the
upcoming semifinals.

340
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,610
Oh! Chef Dojima and
Chef Mizuhara are coming...

341
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,478
even Chef Inui
is going to be here.

342
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,080
Haven't seen them in a while.

343
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,448
Speaking of, Master Inui's
challenge at the training camp

344
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,418
was a creative dish that
centered around Japanese food.

345
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,754
It's kinda similar to
this challenge, huh?

346
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,889
(Door opens)

347
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,091
Hm?

348
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,626
[SOMA]
Uh.. Meat meat?

349
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,628
What's up?
Is something wrong?

350
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,029
I brought you a present.

351
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,964
I mean, since you're in
Bowl Club and everything.

352
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,967
But it's not like you've got
my support or anything okay.

353
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,103
I just don't want that
big jackass to win.

354
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,270
He's a complete waste of space.

355
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,206
That's so sweet...
Meat Meat.

356
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,609
Shut up! I just said I'm not
doing it for YOU, all right!

357
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,344
Anyway, there's no way I'm gonna
let you lose to that A‐hole

358
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,814
and have you not become a chef.
Understand me?!

359
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,617
YOU CANNOT LOSE!!

360
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:22,388
Whoa. There's a sirloin and
filet... and even some rump.

361
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,958
It's an assortment of
different premium cuts.

362
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,060
That's our Meat Meat all right.

363
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,461
They're all top quality.

364
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:31,197
There's some interesting
items in here as well.

365
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,800
But I'm not sure
I can use these.

366
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,402
If I used this meat
to make a stew...

367
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:37,671
(Gasp)

368
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,941
[ERINA]
You don't understand
this theme at all.

369
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,109
Are you okay, Soma sir?

370
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,545
Is there something wrong?

371
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:47,748
[SOMA]
I really am grateful
to you, Mitsuru.

372
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,783
I'm glad that
you were here.

373
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:50,751
Yeah?

374
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:51,818
But...

375
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,119
no more information for you!

376
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,387
[MITSURU]
Ahhhhh?!

377
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,656
Huuhh?!

378
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,257
Aw, come on!
Don't be like that!

379
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,961
What about my in‐depth
article on you?! Soma, sir!

380
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,429
(Music plays)

381
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,259
[KOJIRO]
But still...
it seems a bit unseemly

382
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,228
for Tohtsuki Resorts'
Executive Chef

383
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,163
to personally go judge
something like this ...

384
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,332
I didn't know you had
that much free time, Dojima.

385
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,737
Haha... I have a vested interest
in nurturing these students.

386
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,371
I must answer the call of duty.

387
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,575
After all, I am but a poor chef
employed by Tohtsuki.

388
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,743
...Right?

389
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,044
[KOJIRO]
Quit holdin' a grudge

390
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,979
against something I said
when I was angry.

391
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,716
[GIN]
Words can hurt, Kojiro.
Words can hurt.

392
00:16:55,816 --> 00:17:00,220
Hm... Give my best to
Mizuhara and Inui okay.

393
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:04,157
(Music playing)

394
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,666
[MITSURU]
I wonder if he's all right?

395
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,668
It's about to start,
and he's still not here...

396
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:15,936
Where could he be?

397
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,470
Ah! Master Soma Sir!

398
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,506
Thank God you were able
to make it in time!

399
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,074
What the heck
were you doing?

400
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,876
[SOMA]
Sorry about that.

401
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,477
I had to do something.

402
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:25,912
So... did you‐uh...

403
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:30,551
did you come up with an idea to
beat Mimasaka's copycat cooking?

404
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,118
[SOMA]
Mmm... Dunno.

405
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,788
Huh?! What do you
mean you don't know?

406
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,790
I've done everything I can.

407
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,424
Now all that's left is...

408
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,227
just to have some fun
cooking out there.

409
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,634
Brother...

410
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,769
You doin' okay?

411
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,336
I was just talking to Soma.

412
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,006
He asked me to
give you a message:

413
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:56,442
"Be sure to watch my match."

414
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:57,511
(Loud cheering)

415
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,614
[URARA]
And now... Soma Yukihira!

416
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,983
The first bout of the
Fall Selection semifinals...

417
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,687
is once again being held as an
unprecedented official Food War.

418
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:11,157
A lot is at stake today,
as Soma has bet nothing less
than his career as a chef!

419
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,926
(Loud cheering)

420
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,829
Next up... is Subaru Mimasaka.

421
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,366
Will he come out firing
with another perfectly
recreated dish?

422
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,403
Now to introduce our judges,

423
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,606
five graduates of
the Tohtsuki Academy

424
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:28,942
and all former members
of The Council of Ten!

425
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,612
I'm Tohtsuki Resorts'
Executive Chef...

426
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,046
I'm Gin Dojima.

427
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:36,550
We shall judge firmly but fairly
on what we are presented today.

428
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,620
For this semifinal,
it's Soma Yukihira...

429
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,221
vs. Subaru Mimasaka.

430
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:45,258
Let the cooking begin!

431
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,229
(Gong rings)

432
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,865
(Loud cheering)

433
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,606
Hm! They're both presenting
a beef stew?

434
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,341
I don't care too much
for that big guy

435
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,577
who stuck his gum on
a cooking blade...

436
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,547
but that one with the headband
works in an eatery downtown?

437
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,651
He barely even transferred into
the Academy six months ago.

438
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:11,818
Not a chance.

439
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,419
I mean you agree with me right?

440
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,222
Yes. I think it would
be quite hard for him

441
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,658
to actually win here.

442
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,160
[GIN]
That may very well
be true ladies.

443
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,162
It'll take a special
stew to win this.

444
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,465
I'm afraid an eatery's
concoction could be
way off the mark.

445
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,267
[ERINA]
<i>The allure of eatery fare...</i>

446
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,435
<i>It is said that the best</i>

447
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,872

[GIN]
Whereas the flavors at
a high‐end restaurant

451
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,950
make one think a dish
is delicious from
the very first bite...

452
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,853
requiring a taste that is both
powerful and memorable.

453
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:50,991
[GIN]
Simply put, this inparticular,
calls for a "forceful" dish,

454
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,126
one that has
unforgettable impact.

[ERINA]

00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,880
Look at that meat Soma's
started preparing...

464
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,516
It's oxtail!

465
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:16,249
(Gasp)

466
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,383
(All gasping)

467
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,520
Looks like he just turned it up.

468
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,388
It would seem Soma
has found his own answer.

469
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:26,426
[ERINA]
<i>Oh my god. I can see</i>
<i>your idea... your intent.</i>

470
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:30,296
<i>Oxtail is known to have</i>
<i>the most gelatin of</i>
<i>any part on the cow's body.</i>

471
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:35,769
[RYO]
<i>All he needs to do is add salt,</i>
<i>pepper, and flour to the</i>
<i>parboiled oxtail.</i>

472
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:39,740
<i>Sauté the surface to a golden</i>
<i>brown then let it simmer.</i>

473
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,177
<i>That way, it will impart</i>
<i>all that gelatin when</i>
<i>mixed with the demi‐glace.</i>

474
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,379
<i>and wreck the senses</i>
<i>into submission.</i>

475
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:51,051
[ERINA]
<i>The thickness of the gelatin</i>
<i>will bind itself to</i>
<i>demi‐glace or dashi stock,</i>

476
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:54,320
<i>adding depth of flavor</i>
<i>while retaining that</i>
<i>of the white miso.</i>

477
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,589
<i>That's smart.</i>

478
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,457
<i>That's the same method</i>
<i>Hisako used</i>

479
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:01,027
<i>for her soft‐shelled</i>
<i>tortoise burger.</i>

480
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,029
[AKIRA]
<i>The spice he added to</i>
<i>the meat was clove...</i>

481
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,199
<i>which has a sweet and</i>
<i>powerful flavor,</i>
<i>that's hard to beat.</i>

482
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,570
<i>Adding to that... clove is sure</i>
<i>to increase the mellowness</i>

483
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,905
<i>of the stew and</i>
<i>enhance its umami. Hm.</i>

484
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,441
[ERINA]
<i>Also... that vegetable</i>
<i>combination is a matignon.</i>

485
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,077
<i>Not a bad idea.</i>

486
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:18,545
Look there!

487
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,614
He's going to take minced
carrots, onions, and celery

488
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,716
and sauté them all in butter
until they're tender.

489
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,718
You can also simmer
in Madeira wine.

490
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,987
That technique can be used
in different dishes...

491
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:29,823
it helps to impart the
sweetness of the vegetables.

492
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:31,491
(Pan sizzles)

493
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:34,094
[ERINA]
<i>Uhh... That stew is going to</i>
<i>be even more delicious</i>

494
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:35,929
<i>than the one he</i>
<i>presented last week.</i>

495
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,632
[SOMA]
<i>What's needed here</i>
<i>isn't some gentle flavor</i>

496
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:41,334
<i>that you can just eat</i>
<i>bowl after bowl of.</i>

497
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,170
<i>Meat Meat's gift</i>
<i>ended up being a hint.</i>

498
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,372
<i>With this, I can make</i>
<i>a powerful stew,</i>

499
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,374
<i>one where meat plays</i>
<i>the starring role!</i>

500
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,512
You said I didn't
understand this theme...

501
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,814
You'll eat those words!

502
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:55,649
Erina Nakiri!

503
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,909
(Smug laugh)

504
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:33,980
Huh?

505
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:36,482
(Cackling laugh)

506
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,451
[MIMASAKA]
Everything you've
done this week...

507
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,954
what you've bought...
who you've met...

508
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:43,456
and what dishes
you've all tried out...

509
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,692
I know about it all, Yukihira!

510
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:46,527
(Gasp)

511
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,729
Mimasaka too?!

512
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:50,597
Oxtail!

513
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:53,133
[AKIRA]
For spice... he's added
cloves and black pepper.

514
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,168
[MEGUMI]
He has a matignon too?!

515
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,436
It can't be!

516
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:57,971
[ZENJI]
They're the same.

517
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:01,875
He's following Soma's cooking
sequence to an absolute T!

518
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:05,145
Now... here's where
you fear me...

519
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:07,413
And I overtake you!

520
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,182
That‐that meat is...!

521
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,685
[MIMASAKA]
Here's my twist!

522
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:19,826
