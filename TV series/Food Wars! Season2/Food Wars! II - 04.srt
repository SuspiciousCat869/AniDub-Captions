1
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:05,405
(Urara):
The fourth bout
of the Fall Selection!

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:09,242
Tensions are high, as Takumi
Aldini takes on Subaru Mimaska

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:13,379
with their match deemed
an official Food War!

4
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:14,648
(crowd stunned)

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:16,983
Who the hell
has a Food War

6
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,519
in the middle of
the Fall Selection?!

7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,687
Is that even legal
to do that?

8
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,289
(Hisanao):
All of the necessary
conditions have been met.

9
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,291
The administrative
bureau has acknowledged

10
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:28,662
that this indeed counts as a
legitimate Food War Battle.

11
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,329
Hmm.

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,299
A true Food War battle...
knows neither time nor place!

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,602
(Urara):
Up till now, ratings
for the opposing battles

14
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,471
have been a cumulative score
from the five judges...

15
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,405
but in this bout...

16
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,441
each person gets just one vote.

17
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,978
In other words, it will be
held to the rules of a Food War.

18
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:45,579
(crowd murmuring)

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,882
And now folks...
here come the COMPETITORS!

20
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,719
(crowd cheering)

21
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,120
You got this,
brother...

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,221
(chuckles)

23
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,857
Must be rough,
havin' to bail out

24
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,193
such a no‐talented hack
of a brother all the time.

25
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,427
Hmm?

26
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,729
Pick it up.

27
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:03,597
Huh?

28
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:07,067
You're a pig, so allow me
to teach you some etiquette.

29
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,201
If you pick that up...

30
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,971
it will prove that you
accept this challenge.

31
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,606
This is a battle...

32
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,041
(Takumi):
in the manner of a DUELLO!

33
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,744
An Italian will always
respond to an insult.

34
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,313
Should I win, you'll throw
yourself to the ground

35
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,017
and apologize... apologize
for defiling my mezzaluna...

36
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,853
and for... my
brother's good name!

37
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,319
(Yuri):
Ah!

38
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,388
Hey, you two!
What's going on?

39
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,757
Where the heck
have you two been?!

40
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,158
W‐well we got lost...

41
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,327
So we were with
Takumi and Mimasaka

42
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,096
until just a
little while ago...

43
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:16,730
But no one...

44
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,732
(Megumi):
No one mentioned anything
about turning this

45
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:19,666
into a Food War!

46
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,603
Mimasaka would have planned
on turning this into a Food War

47
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,370
right from
the beginning.

48
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:25,357
Huh?

49
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:26,840
That's just the kind of
crappy thing he likes to do.

50
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,542
(Shun):
When he sets his eyes
on a student,

51
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,844
he'll begin to investigate
them thoroughly...

52
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,379
He'll than start to provoke
them and threaten them...

53
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,381
doing whatever he thinks
is necessary to get them

54
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,183
out on the battlefield.

55
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,686
And he's already taken
down many chefs...

56
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,855
99 to be exact.

57
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,590
Ninety‐nine battles?

58
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,292
(Senzaemon):
The theme will be dessert!

59
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,597
NOW... LET THE COOKING BEGIN!

60
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,101
(Megumi):
Look at their
ingredients...

61
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,937
they're completely the same!

62
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:00,106
I have brought documents
regarding Subaru Mimasaka's

63
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,808
prior Food War victories.

64
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,678
This is a list of what
both contestants made.

65
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,180
(Oizumi):
Huh? What the...?!

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,482
He's won all
his previous matches

67
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,619
by just making the same
dish as his opponent!

68
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,322
Semifreddo.

69
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,024
That's the name
of the confection

70
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,860
you and I will be making.

71
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,765
Semifreddo is a popular
semi‐frozen Italian dessert

72
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,667
that combines the
coldness of ice cream

73
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,434
with the fulfillness of cake.

74
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,803
(Subaru):
You're plannin' on makin' one

75
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,905
with a top layer
of crushed pralines...

76
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,609
followed by a second layer
of fresh cream ice cream.

77
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,912
For the third layer, you'll be
using a light sponge cake

78
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,446
to tie it all in.

79
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,715
Am I right or what?

80
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:45,786
Hmph. I see all your snooping
seems to have paid off.

81
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,889
You think you can beat me
with the same recipe?

82
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,892
Don't underestimate...

83
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,660
the ALDINI'S!

84
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,230
(Shun):
As you can gather... Mimasaka
is using the Food War system

85
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,865
as his personal plaything.

86
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,735
He forces his opponents
to bet their prized utensils...

87
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,638
And then he tramples the
chef's pride by taking the tool

88
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,774
that was most important to them,
and flaunts it around school.

89
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,611
Who does this ridiculous
fool think he is, Benkei?

90
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,478
That guy is
a sadistic freak.

91
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,880
I heard that in one Food War...

92
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,116
(Shun):
he took his opponent's
prized knife...

93
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,018
a memento of her
beloved dead mother...

94
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,987
all the while laughing
manically in her face.

95
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:26,927
So then... that means Takumi had
to have bet his... mezzaluna!

96
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,096
(Yuki):
Don't you worry, Isami!

97
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,266
Just look at Takumi. He doesn't
look shaken in the least!

98
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,669
Yeah, his movements
are clean and precise.

99
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,138
(Ikumi):
When making sweets,
even the smallest mistake

100
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,507
in measurements,
can ruin everything.

101
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,009
You must always remain exact
in your ingredients.

102
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,079
But a big lunk‐head like
Mimasaka couldn't possibly...

103
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,148
D'oh!

104
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,284
(Ikumi):
I can't believe
how meticulous he is!

105
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,820
It's as if he's
embroidering a tapestry!

106
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,757
Like a happy,
young bride babe!

107
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,895
See ya later... Takumi Aldini.

108
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,765
Next up, are some
tweaks of my own!

109
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:06,872
Oh!

110
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:09,235
(Megumi):
Something's going on!
It looks like Takumi is whipping

111
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,171
the whites and
yolks together...

112
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,472
but Mimasaka is
making his cake

113
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,975
by whipping them
in separate bowls!

114
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,744
(Eizan):
Subaru Mimasaka
thoroughly investigates

115
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,479
each of his
opponents.

116
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,015
He pilfers every last detail
of their trial dishes

117
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,451
to predict what they'll make
in their final presentation...

118
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,287
and then... he mixes things up

119
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,957
so as to make something one step
beyond that of his opponent.

120
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,326
Whipping them together
will result in a genoise,

121
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,896
(Zenji):
which has a refined
but dense texture.

122
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:39,065
Conversely, whipping them
separately will make a biscuit,

123
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,735
which expands due to
the amount of air it contains.

124
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,005
It absorbs syrup well
and has a velvety texture.

125
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,609
Y'know, mine will absorb as much
of that sweet syrup as possible,

126
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,744
makin' it tastier than yours.

127
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,879
You chose something
that would have a smooth

128
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,014
and gentle texture.

129
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,850
You've done that since
you've arrived here at school.

130
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,352
(Subaru):
But when you taste
these side by side,

131
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,989
mine will have the stronger
flavor and be the clear victor.

132
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,325
His strategy is to
make slight modifications

133
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,494
to his challenger's recipe,
giving his dish the advantage.

134
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,897
Thus, reducing
his chances of losing.

135
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,665
All right now...

136
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,134
next it's time
to make the syrup...

137
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,102
using this liqueur.

138
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,739
(Takumi):
He's using
limoncello?!

139
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,342
An Italian liqueur. It's made
from the zest of lemons.

140
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,878
This is a dire turn
of events for Takumi.

141
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,113
Normally, rum or
amaretto is used.

142
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,750
For him to blatantly
use something like this...

143
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,017
How could he possibly know

144
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,986
about our secret
limoncello panna cotta?!

145
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,688
There's a
specialty dessert

146
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,757
that you like to make
at your family restaurant.

147
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:40,060
I believe that dish makes
ample use of this liqueur.

148
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,128
That's how I was finally
able to figure out

149
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,198
that you were bound to
use it in your semifreddo.

150
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,900
(snickers)

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,603
Has he really read
my every move?

152
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,172
Well, I'm not done mixing
things up just yet.

153
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,275
My fresh cream incorporates
mascarpone cheese

154
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,512
to give it added depth that will
please the pickiest of eaters...

155
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,146
(Subaru):
just like in that curry pasta

156
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,816
you expertly made
during the preliminaries.

157
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,985
Well? How's it feel
to get shown up

158
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,088
by havin' your own tricks
used against you?

159
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,556
This can't happen!

160
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,658
We can't allow this
match to take place!

161
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:15,028
In a Food War, all that really
matters is the dish presented.

162
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,865
Subaru Mimasaka has done nothing
to warrant remonstration.

163
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,668
Mimasaka's only
interest is in winning.

164
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,003
And to accomplish that,

165
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,972
he will explore even
the minutest of details.

166
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,108
He mimics their
very personalities,

167
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,610
until he becomes them.

168
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,645
It's especially
easy for me...

169
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,446
to rattle impulsive
people like you.

170
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,416
(Subaru):
You look all cool and calm
on the outside,

171
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,718
but when it
comes to cooking,

172
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,786
you're just another
hot‐headed chef.

173
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,855
You have love and pride
for your homeland,

174
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,857
and that sentiment
always presents itself

175
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,359
in the dishes
you present.

176
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,861
I'm so happy with this!

177
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,997
You're exactly the kind of
person I expected you to be.

178
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,499
He constantly observes
his opponent,

179
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,503
laying them bare
before everyone...

180
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,304
(Eizan):
Subaru Mimasaka...

181
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,541
is truly the
King of Stalkers!

182
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,442
(Yuki &amp; Zenji):
(shriek)

183
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,778
This guy's even weirder
than I imagined!

184
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,613
In order for him to win,
Takumi must to come up

185
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,081
with some kind
of new technique!

186
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,483
How is the dude gonna
have enough time?

187
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,185
At this rate, he's
gonna lose, brah!

188
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,755
My brother has what it takes
to handle himself on the spot.

189
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:18,625
(Isami):
There's no way an Italian
man could lose at DOLCE!

190
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,060
He's completely
figured out the recipe

191
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,095
that I was
going to present.

192
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:22,963
What do I do?

193
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,498
Whip the eggs separately
and start over?

194
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,568
No... there's no time!

195
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:28,735
There has to be a way...

196
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,237
There has to be
something I can do!

197
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,807
Once I put it in the oven...

198
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,242
I can't make any
changes to the cake.

199
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,077
Should I add diced lemon

200
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,245
to increase the
fragrance of the dish?

201
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,883
No... That would affect the
texture, which is key!

202
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,551
Aldini!

203
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,952
If you don't
start baking soon,

204
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,488
you ain't gonna
have a cake to serve.

205
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,923
Gah...

206
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,394
Takumi just put his
cake in the oven!

207
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,729
If he's going
to change anything,

208
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,798
it can only be with the
toppings or in the sauce.

209
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,800
But Takumi doesn't have
any ingredients left

210
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,167
(Yuki):
to change things up!

211
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,571
I can't bear
to watch this go down!

212
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,772
(Takumi):
Time is limited.

213
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,241
I have to move forward
with the prep work.

214
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,945
I'm bound by the very
rails I've laid down.

215
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:16,082
(Urara):
Alright people... we're down
to the last 30 minutes!

216
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,351
Looks like they're
both done baking!

217
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,120
Huh? Check out
his cake, man.

218
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,923
(Aoki):
Mimasaka's is darker
than Aldini's!

219
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,559
(Sato):
You're right, brah.
How come?

220
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,728
So he turned it
into a BISCUIT JOCONDE.

221
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,363
Biscuit joconde substitutes
much of the flour...

222
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,099
with a liberal use of
almond powder for the cake.

223
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,637
The result gives us a richer...
and deeper sponge cake.

224
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,272
(Takumi):
He made another change!

225
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,107
The more pride
a guy has...

226
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,710
the more he seizes up like
a scared deer in headlights.

227
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,813
(Subaru):
It's scary to put out
a dish knowing you'll lose.

228
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,150
The same goes for
you, doesn't it?

229
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,586
Aldini!

230
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,555
(Takumi):
If I lose here today...

231
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,923
why did I even
come to Japan?

232
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,667
Brother!

233
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:14,240
You don't need to make
that face... Little Brother.

234
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,912
Just remember... all the
clamor of the Aldini kitchen.

235
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,715
Believe in what
was cultivated there!

236
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:25,819
(deep breath)

237
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,253
I have to do this.

238
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,691
To win this battle
I need to face myself...

239
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,759
and look at my recipes...

240
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,728
and exceed them!

241
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,836
Okay... dessert is ready.

242
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,539
(Saotome):
Ohhhh! It's beautiful.

243
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,041
I take it... this is
the semifreddo

244
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,876
made to eclipse
Aldini's dish?

245
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:50,911
(Bald Judge):
I must say...

246
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:54,681
the pralines accentuate the
sweet aroma of the almonds...

247
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,550
accompanied by a layer
of what looks to be

248
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,151
half‐thawed ice cream.

249
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,954
Each element was treated
with grace and precision.

250
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,156
Humph! This is a shallow idea!

251
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,858
One mimicking that
of his opponent.

252
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,060
The flavors won't
amount to much.

253
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,597
Well, I guess it's time
for us to have a taste.

254
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,699
The three layers
have differing textures.

255
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,169
(Judge):
That's clear simply
by inserting the spoon.

256
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,904
Mmmm!

257
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,106
The bracing sweetness of the
lemon spreads across the tongue

258
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,475
while the aroma of almonds
tickles the nose!

259
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,411
The flavors come
together perfect harmony,

260
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,480
not clashing in the slightest!

261
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,149
It's sweet but mellow!

262
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,151
It's conjured my
inner feminine side

263
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,820
wanting to frolic in fields!

264
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,222
I think a biscuit
jaconde works best.

265
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,059
It's pairing abilities
work wonders with pralines.

266
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,327
The rich aroma of the
almonds in the cake‐

267
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,262
Shut your mouth!

268
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,932
You have no conviction
as an honest chef!

269
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,602
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean by that.

270
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,637
"The devil is always
in the details."

271
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,139
(Subaru):
That's the source
of my conviction.

272
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,908
I've analyzed my
opponent's strengths

273
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,511
and wasted no effort
in trying to win.

274
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:01,014
What's so bad about trying to
beat your opponent at any cost?

275
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,517
I don't want
to admit it...

276
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,285
(Oizumi):
I don't want to!

277
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,153
But it's drawing me in.

278
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,856
He's a scoundrel!
He's a beast!

279
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,725

This dish has reduced to me
to an infatuated teenage girl?!

291
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:39,288
It was a sublime dessert, one
that brought Aldini's good looks

292
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:40,855
into sharp relief!

293
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:44,693
At this rate...
he has no chance of winning!

294
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:46,928
(Subaru):
Huh?

295
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:49,097
Seriously? You're
still serving?

296
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:52,467
Drop the attitude. I'm a
professional chef, after all.

297
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:56,204
(Takumi):
And a guest must always be
brought his dish no matter what.

298
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:57,238
What is that dish?

299
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:00,775
(Isami):
It's different from the
semifreddo he was working on.

300
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:02,210
Yeah, you're right!

301
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:03,912
There's a wafer‐thin layer
between the cream

302
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:06,247
(Ryoko):
AND the sponge cake!

303
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:07,982
(Ikumi):
A FOURTH layer?!

304
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:22,297
Please...

305
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:24,499
Work!

306
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,435
Ooh!

307
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:28,069
(Saotome):
This is intense!

308
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:31,373
Like a wind blowing
across the Mediterranean!

309
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:34,776
What did you add to it?

310
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:37,245
I've eaten semifreddo
several times.

311
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:37,979
But this is...

312
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,781
(Saotome):
it's different
from all of them!

313
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,950
The flavor of the lemon
is beautifully enhanced!

314
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,253
(Bald Judge):
What is this golden
layer delicately placed?

315
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:45,954
Lemon curd...

316
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,357
English lemon curd
to be precise.

317
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:49,691
I hope you enjoy.

318
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,825
Lemon curd?

319
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:53,261
Lemon curd is a favorite
amongst the British royalty,

320
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:55,764
and has a rather long
and complex history.

321
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:58,333
This paste has an elegant
aroma that pairs well

322
00:14:58,433 --> 00:14:59,133
with the tartness of lemon.

323
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,203
(Judge):
It melts in the mouth along
with the sponge cake made

324
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:04,273
using yolks and whites
beaten together.

325
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,875
You've added such a
beautiful, delicate texture!

326
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:10,044
It wouldn't have worked if you
chose to make a coarser cake.

327
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:12,414
I thought the Lemon curd would
lend itself well in this manner,

328
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:15,784
(Takumi):
with ingredients such as
eggs, sugar, lemon juice,

329
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:16,818
grated peel, and butter.

330
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,887
But it looked like you
had very little butter

331
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:20,489
left in your
arranged ingredients.

332
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:22,691
I was able to
use this instead...

333
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,125
olive oil.

334
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:26,961
That's no ordinary olive oil
he has in his hands.

335
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:29,664
Truly an Italian way
of thinking my good man!

336
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:31,766
The refreshing scent
of olives is a good match

337
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:33,468
for the tart
taste of lemons.

338
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:34,703
I fairly concede to defeat,

339
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:36,938
when it comes to the
semifreddo's cake.

340
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:38,673
It would have been
no match for the impact

341
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:40,709
of the biscuit jaconde's
sponge cake.

342
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,511
So it hit me,
I had to bet victory

343
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:44,178
on the flavor
of the lemon.

344
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,248
(Takumi):
If I could use lemon curd to
accentuate the lemon's briskness

345
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:49,217
and mild flavor depth...

346
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:51,019
then there's no way
I could lose...

347
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,121
(Takumi):
to HIS semifreddo!

348
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:54,856
To think, adding
a new twist by using

349
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:56,691
something invented
in England!

350
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,427
That too is quite Italian...

351
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:00,362
a display of one's
own originality!

352
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:02,331
What you're trying
to say is this...

353
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:04,999
should be called the
"Lemon Curd Italiano,"

354
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,436
an all‐new dessert
of perfection!

355
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:09,404
(shocked crowd)

356
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:10,839
Even under the gun
like that,

357
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:14,142
he was able to invent a
new and amazing flavor!

358
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:17,078
((Takumi &amp; Isami's Father):
Takumi... Isami...

359
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:20,282
I want you to take these
with you when you go to Japan.

360
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:23,952
It's own Aldini
Family Olive Oil.

361
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:27,055
I'm sure it will help you out
when you need it most.

362
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:30,892
How did he know? It DID help us!

363
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:34,629
(Takumi):
The moment it hit me,
I felt like a heard something.

364
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:36,030
The switching of the rails...

365
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,966
(rails switching)

366
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:41,370
surpassing the recipes
of the past.

367
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:46,174
Ah!

368
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,742
(Senzaemon):
Oizumi, sir.

369
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,778
It would seem
you finally noticed.

370
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,179
Director!

371
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:57,286
(chuckles)

372
00:16:57,386 --> 00:16:59,187
Hey. What is it?

373
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:06,628
(hearty laugh)

374
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,663
What do you think
is so funny?

375
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:09,964
"What's funny" you ask?

376
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:12,066
You sound so pitiful
when you ask that.

377
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,869
I know everything about you!
Come on Aldini, wake up!

378
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:17,939
(Subaru):
Now... it's obvious when
you compare the two, right?

379
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,242
MY semifreddo has way
more depth of flavor!

380
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:24,145
'Cause I too, snuck in
a secret ingredient...

381
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,014
I added preserved lemons!

382
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:28,350
That's a condiment
common in Moroccan dishes,

383
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,786
made by pickling whole lemons
in a brine for several weeks.

384
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:32,554
Good thinking.

385
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:36,157
I see... the acidity and
bitterness... is now tempered.

386
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:39,027
(Saotome):
for a mellower and more
refreshing crisp flavor.

387
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:42,664
I also added the sliced fruit
and brine to the sponge cake,

388
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,599
the praline topping,
and the sauce.

389
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:46,468
(Subaru):
Its slight bitterness
should have brought out

390
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:50,104
the sweetness of the
semifreddo perfectly.

391
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:52,173
I had some faith
in you, Aldini.

392
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,975
I was betting that
there would be no way

393
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:55,844
you'd ever
give up so easily.

394
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,211
That you'd come up
with a twist

395
00:17:57,312 --> 00:17:59,781
using the flexibility
you've honed in the kitchens!

396
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:02,484
Not to mention you always
got your lucky olive oil

397
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:05,053
right at your little
pathetic fingertips!

398
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,888
I just needed to think like you.

399
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:09,424
I marked out your intentions,
and the idea I figured

400
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:13,061
you'd arrive at, was an
Italian‐style lemon curd!

401
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:15,263
Look how cute you are.

402
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:18,967
You've gone in circles,
all in the palm of my hand.

403
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,670
I saw through
everything... EVERYTHING!

404
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,738
And you never
realized it!

405
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:24,706
(evil laugh)

406
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:25,907
(evil laugh)
It's so close...

407
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:28,910
Such the slimmest of margins
between the two dishes!

408
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,679
(Oizumi):
And yet...!

409
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,547
(Subaru):
There are two
things that dominate

410
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,115
your predictable thinking.

411
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:37,051
One is the deep bond you have
with your little brother.

412
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:41,290
The other... is a rematch
with Soma Yukihira.

413
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,025
How does it feel having
been robbed of them both

414
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,396
in one day,
you filthy mongrel?!

415
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,298
He's a Diablo...

416
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:50,599
(Urara):
It's unanimous, folks!

417
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:53,502
I gotta celebrate
my hundredth victory.

418
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:54,769
Thanks for being easy.

419
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,471
(Urara):
We have a winner!

420
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:58,873
The winner of
the fourth bout is...

421
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,943
Subaru Mimasaka!

422
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:03,412
(Eizan):
There you have it, everyone.

423
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:05,980
This will conclude the
first round of food battles

424
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,349
for the Fall Selection.

425
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,250
The second battle
will be held in a week.

426
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:10,552
As with the first battle...

427
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,954
the match card will
be decided at random.

428
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:15,457
It will be announced
later today.

429
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:17,058
That is all.

430
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,052
(Yuki):
I totally can't
accept this puke fest!

431
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:52,587
What's with that
creepy stalker, anyway?!

432
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:54,389
You don't need
to take it out on ME.

433
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:56,958
Poor Takumi... he must
be pretty shocked.

434
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:58,460
I would like to make
him feel better...

435
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,229
but what can you say
after a match like that?

436
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,255
Oh?

437
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:02,731
Wait up, Soma.

438
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:03,665
I'm leavin'.

439
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,099
(Megumi):
Huh?

440
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:07,869
(Yuki):
Really, Soma?!

441
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:11,340
You mean you're okay with not
saying anything to support him?!

442
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:14,443
(gasps)

443
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:15,544
Hey there.

444
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:16,210
Mimasaka?!

445
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,079
Hey, how did you
get in Soma's room?

446
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,281
Had a spare.

447
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:20,715
Waaaah!

448
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:21,783
Can I help you?

449
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:25,320
Yeah. There's somethin' I think
I should tell you about.

450
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,421
(Soma):
All right, fine.

451
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:28,823
Hang on a sec.
I'll make some tea.

452
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:33,227
Say, Mimasaka...
you eaten dinner yet?

453
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:35,930
I've got some beef stew
I made earlier today.

454
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,665
You wanna have some?

455
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:39,501
(Subaru):
Thanks, that would be lovely.
I appreciate it.

456
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:42,103
(Yuki):
He should punch that loser
in his stupid face, right now!

457
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:45,073
(Ikumi):
Why is Soma treating that TURD
like he's some kinda guest?

458
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:48,610
(Subaru):
That match card for
the second battle has...

459
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,412
been decided.

460
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:51,680
Yeah?

461
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,849
(Subaru):
It's gonna be Ryo vs Akira.

462
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:56,851
And me vs. you.

463
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:58,720
You got that... Soma?

464
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,054
I do.

465
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:02,757
So you came here just to
tell me that, did you?

466
00:22:02,857 --> 00:22:04,025
Know where this is going?

467
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,227
Let's just make this
a Food War.

468
00:22:06,328 --> 00:22:08,863
That knife you're
always seen using...

469
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:11,766
if I win, that's
gonna be all mine.

470
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:15,904
In return, I'll offer up
something YOU'D might like.

471
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:17,071
Soma Yukihira.

472
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:21,310
I know what gets under your skin
and makes you really angry.

473
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,711
There's no way you can look away

474
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:26,615
when someone you've
acknowledged is insulted.

475
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,484
That Italian guy was kinda
pitiful, don't you think?

476
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:32,053
He was utterly defeated
before he was able

477
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:33,555
to try and settle
things with you.

478
00:22:33,655 --> 00:22:36,925
His future and his pride
as a chef are in tatters!

479
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,093
(cackles)

480
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,362
Well? Get angry.

481
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:43,164
I want you furious!
Don't just sit there!

482
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:45,467
Your good friend has
just been made a fool of

483
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:46,868
and stripped of his prize!

484
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:50,972
(Soma):
Yeah... it's really
too bad actually.

485
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:51,640
But...

486
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,142
what you did won't
be enough to crush him.

487
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,378
And just so you
understand...

488
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:59,948
YOU'RE the one to really
feel sorry for... Mimasaka.

489
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:00,949
What did you say?

490
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,485
(Soma):
I've figured out
your petty little game.

491
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:06,321
Replicating Takumi's cooking
takes a lot of skill...

492
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:08,790
Skills I don't think
you were ever capable of.

493
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,627
so why would you bother doing
such a worthless challenge?

494
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:14,106
(chuckles)

495
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:17,699
That "worthless challenge" beat
Takumi out of his Mezzaluna.

496
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,902
As a chef, I'm way above
him and any other fool that‐

497
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:21,636
No, you're not.

498
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:25,407
All you really did was leech off
of his hard work, am I right?

499
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:27,809
(Soma):
His cooking comes from
trying out new dishes,

500
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:30,345
of countless failures
before finding something

501
00:23:30,445 --> 00:23:32,213
that truly shines.

502
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:34,983
I pity you. I really do.

503
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,285
You don't know
the true joy

504
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:38,753
that comes from cooking
an original dish.

505
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:41,556
That's how you could laugh
at a challenge like that.

506
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:44,158
All you care about is some
superficial victory

507
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,494
to steal others' pride.

508
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:47,962
I don't acknowledge
you as a proper chef.

509
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:49,398
I'll do a Food War.

510
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:52,501
But I want more than just that
mezzaluna you got there...

511
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:55,236
you'll return all 99 items
you've stolen so far

512
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:57,406
from the worthy chefs
you've challenged.

513
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,541
Hah! Cut the crap, boy.

514
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:02,277
That challenge ain't
nearly worth it for me!

515
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:04,313
There's gotta be
somethin' to match 100‐

516
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:07,616
Then if you win, I'll quit
being a chef and leave.

517
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:13,655
I'll quit... being a chef.

518
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:17,926
(Narrator):
Next Time:

519
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,629
"The Secret of the First Bite."
