1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:08,344
(Digging in cooler)

2
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:11,313
What are you...
are you going somewhere?

3
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:14,516
Oh, sorry.
Did I wake you?

4
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:17,319
It's not even
light out yet.

5
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,055
I'm headin' off to
the fish market.

6
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:22,024
The fish market?
Are you going to
check out the saury?

7
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:23,592
<i>I love the fish market!</i>

8
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:26,996
Say, do you mind if I
tag along and go with you?

9
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:28,297
Sure, fine with me!

10
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:30,066
I'll go get ready!

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,367
I'll be waitin' outside.

12
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:33,702
[SOMA]
I need to come up
with some ideas...

13
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:34,971
there has to be somethin'.

14
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,174
Some kinda key to beating
Ryo and Akira...

15
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:40,642
and I plan on finding it!

16
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,671
[MAN]
Move it, move it!

17
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:16,872
[BUYER]
How much for one kilo?

18
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:18,607
[GUY]
Get me that one! The big one!

19
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:21,643
[MEGUMI]
Oh! It's really
bustling in here!

20
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,645
It kinda gets the blood
racing, doesn't it?

21
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,115
[SOMA]
<i>Whoa! That amberjack is cheap!</i>

22
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:28,584
<i>And so is that</i>
<i>mackerel over there.</i>

23
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:30,052
[MEGUMI]
Stop it Soma...

24
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:32,854
You can worry about the
other fish next time, okay.

25
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,357
[SOMA]
Oh! Yeah, I guess you're right.

26
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:38,127
[MEGUMI]
Have you been here before,
or is this your first time?

27
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:41,397
Oh yeah, my dad used to
bring me around here a lot.

28
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:42,364
Oh.

29
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:44,233
Here we go, Pacific saury!

30
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,270
Yeah, I think I'll be able to
come up with some trial
dishes pretty easily.

31
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,508
Back at home, Saury was one of
our fall staples at "Yukihira."

32
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:56,445
I'm good.
When it comes to saury,
I feel pretty confident.

33
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,547
(Gasps)
Huh?

34
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,882
Well, well, well...

35
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,052
It's Ryo!
Alice is with him!

36
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,687
Hey did you guys come to
check out the saury as well?

37
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:07,389
That's a coincidence.

38
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,958
[RYO]
Not a "coincidence"...

39
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:11,760
I come down every day,
so I can see what's fresh.

40
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,162
Really...

41
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:15,331
I come here only when
it's deemed necessary.

42
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,267
The market gets started
way too early for my taste!

43
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:22,438
[MEGUMI]
Eeeeekkkk! I can't believe
he ran into one of his
opponents here!

44
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:24,440
There's no way I can
lose this theme.

45
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,576
I gotta pick out some good saury
to get a leg up on these guys.

46
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:31,380
So I've been told,
a saury's body is kind of
puffy and swollen...

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,951
and their eyes will be bright
and clear when they're
at their peak freshness.

48
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,086
And they say when the tip of
the mouth is yellow...

49
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:40,322
that means it's not only
nice and fresh but fatty
and yummy too.

50
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,159
That's true, but you can't just
go about blindly picking one

51
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,826
because it looks like
it's "fresh".

52
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,663
It may not have fully
developed its umami yet.

53
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:49,298
You need to let it sit.

54
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:53,202
Sitting allows it to
develop inosinic acid,
an umami component.

55
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:55,237
The amount and speed
with which it develops

56
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:58,140
will change depending on how
it was brought in from the sea.

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,743
It takes a measure of experience
to gauge the right balance...

58
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,712
It's between
freshness and umami.

59
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:08,184
That's true, but being a
good judge isn't just about
using only your eyes guys.

60
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:12,588
You can use your hands too!
Gotcha!

61
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:16,658
OOh, amazing!
You're holding it by the tail
but it's completely straight!

62
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,860
That shows you that
the body is firm!

63
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:22,031
Judging by the bright eyes and
the belly, this one is fresh.

64
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,599
I have no doubt about it...

65
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,736
this looks to be the freshest
saury in this shop today. Oh!

66
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:30,106
You're wrong again.

67
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:32,874
I'll take...
THIS one right over here.

68
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:35,044
[MEGUMI]
Huh? That one?

69
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,645
<i>Why would he bother</i>
<i>with that one?</i>

70
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:38,180
<i>It's smaller than Soma's</i>

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,717
<i>and the stomach isn't</i>
<i>as extended either.</i>

72
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:44,253
[RYO]
Your face says you don't
agree with my choice.

73
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:47,123
Care to give it a try?

74
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,958
If we turn these guys
into some sashimi...

75
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,293
it will be clear which one
is the better saury...

76
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:55,397
Not to mention...
who's got better
judgment picking fish.

77
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:57,033
(Alice giggles)

78
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:00,302
I'm really sorry,
we shouldn't do this here.

79
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:04,373
No, no, no.
If you're students at Tohtsuki,
I don't mind at all.

80
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:12,248
(Crowd gasps)

81
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:14,516
[SOMA]
It's done!

82
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:15,717
[RYO]
Done!

83
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:18,754
Come try a bite,
Megumi Tadokoro.

84
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,289
[MEGUMI]
Uh...

85
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:28,830
There's really not much
texture here Soma.

86
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,566
I'm sorry but I had to say it!

87
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,900
[SOMA]
Hm...

88
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:34,270
Whereas the one Ryo picked out,

89
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,373
it has a nice and firm
feel to it. Not sure why.

90
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:40,276
That's easy. It's all because
of the time difference,

91
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:43,512
between the saury's rigor index
and its muscle‐breaking
strength.

92
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:45,014
[MEGUMI &amp; SOMA]
Ohhhh?

93
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:47,383
The rigor index is an
indicator of a saury's firmness.

94
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:50,019
To preserve the freshness,
the fish's blood is drained,

95
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,221
and gradually lowers
beyond the 10 hour mark.

96
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:55,591
You see, it's the muscle
breaking strength that
determines firmness,

97
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:59,195
and that begins to drop
rapidly after just about
five hours or so.

98
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:01,830
I see, so even if
the flesh is rigid...

99
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,100
it can still deteriorate
and lose all its firmness

100
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,901
once the five hour mark
has passed.

101
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:09,071
Correct. That's the pitfall
when working with a saury.

102
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,907
Whatever, that has nothing to
do with how I pick a fish.

103
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,776
Oh come on, Ryo!
And after I took
the time to explain!

104
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:15,978
[RYO]
You'll just know it...

105
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:17,846
Just pick somethin'
and touch it.

106
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:20,016
You'll know how fast
or slow it swam...

107
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,218
you'll know how it was
originally preserved...

108
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:25,487
you'll know if there was
enough ice when it was
finally transported...

109
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:27,723
You'll know everything there is.

110
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:29,158
Listen here, Soma...

111
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,393
The timing of the seasons
is absolutely crucial

112
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,895
for the quality and
taste of an ingredient.

113
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:36,532
In other words... choosing
anything less than the best

114
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,067
makes all the difference.

115
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,236
I'll let you in on
a little secret of mine.

116
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:43,072
There's a reason why I
frequent the fish market.

117
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:46,608
It's because if just a little
time goes by without doing so,

118
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,644
my senses become dulled.

119
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:50,212
I've done this for 10 years.

120
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:53,049
It's how I've survived and
how I will always survive.

121
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,384
I'm not gonna let some
half‐ass punk win this.

122
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:58,754
There's no way you'll ever
be able to beat me.

123
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,622
(Scared gasp)

124
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:03,092
Be seeing you guys around!

125
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,197
[MAN]
You know, there was
another young kid

126
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,732
from Tohtsuki Academy
here earlier.
[MEGUMI] Hmm?

127
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:14,770
Yeah, it was that tanned,
good‐looking boy with
the white hair, right?
(Both gasp)

128
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,940
[WOMAN]
He looked like he was
just walking around
with his head down,

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,577
but suddenly he just stopped.
[WOMAN] Oh!

130
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:24,880
Excuse me ma'am.
I'll take what's in the
middle of that box...

131
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:27,249
as well as the one that's
second to the left.

132
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:31,520
[WOMAN]
Can you believe he was able to
chose the best fish of the day
without even looking at it?!

133
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,591
[MAN] Oh really?
[WOMAN]
I mean it was like he could just
sense where the best fish was.

134
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:39,828
[SOMA]
Relying on my hands to judge
the fish isn't going to be
enough anymore, huh?

135
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:42,331
This is gonna change
everything for me.

136
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:46,502
Not choosing the absolute best
can ruin the entire dish.

137
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:51,740
It's ready.

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,142
Yep!

139
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:56,245
(Sniff) Ahhh!

140
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,316
Mm... Mm...

141
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,483
Mmmm...

142
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,052
My god that's really good!

143
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:05,421
That's the power of
fish being in season.

144
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:08,490
But I'm pretty sure those two
will find the very best
saury out there.

145
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,161
They'll find one better than
this one and they'll do it
on the day of finals too.

146
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,763
If you really want to get
better at picking out fish,

147
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:17,233
I guess you'll just have to
come here every single day

148
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,301
and try to figure it all out.

149
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,302
You're right.

150
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:23,239
But still, it's gonna

Hmm?

00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:29,478
C'mon, Soma.
That sardine's no good.

Huh? What's wrong with it?

155
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:34,583
There are countless things
you need to look for
depending on the type.

156
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,586
Even if you just concentrate
on one type of fish...

157
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:41,790
it will easily take you
more than 10 years to get
a good eye for it.

Either way, no matter how good
I get at choosing one...

162
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:53,802
it will all be pointless
if I don't have a
solid idea for my dish.

That's the most

mind telling us what kind of
assistant Akira Hayama is?

[JUN]
U‐um! Well, um...

173
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,334
Akira is a v‐v‐very talented
young man indeed!

A‐as an assistant,
he's just wonderful!

175
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,540
Um, his nose is a real asset to
our work here in the lab.
[AKIRA] Don't go getting nervous
over some simple interview, Jun.

This is why you're
such a lab rat.

Please don't call me "Jun!"

178
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:38,147
So Akira, is it really true
that you're able to pick out

179
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:40,516
a good saury just by
the scent alone?

180
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:41,517
That's right.

181
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:43,552
As you know fish carries
a strong odor.

182
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:46,922
The smell is made of aldehyde
and other compounds and well...

183
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:51,893
these particular compounds
increase as highly unsaturated
fatty acids oxidize...

184
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:54,363
My nose can detect
the volatile components.

185
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,565
That smell is my tell‐tale sign.

186
00:09:56,665 --> 00:10:00,602
There's also the scent of the
blood, that helps me determine
the degree of umami.

187
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:03,172
And Saury gives off a wealth of
information.

188
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,441
Allow me put it this way
for you to understand.

189
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,444
My nose can naturally detect
not just fresh saury,

190
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,846
but ones that are
perfectly suited to my dish.

on Soma Yukihira yet?

Oh, ah, no...
No, I haven't.

194

I don't think he's gotten back
from the fish market...

195

even started on his dish yet.

Sounds like he's
running behind schedule.

not gonna make it in time.

If we do well in
the Fall Selection,

it'll raise Kyokusei's

moved from that position.

with such a good eye...

If the odds were
a little more even,

238

there'd be some way for him to
close the gap. I'm sure of it.

How so?

240
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,573
Like for example when to
sprinkle on the salt.

241
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,675
You know what I'm talkin' about?

242
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:23,045
Saury's flavor changes depending
on how long the salt sits
before you cook it.

243
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:24,646
Oh, I get it...

244
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:27,316
The flesh becomes more firm
as the moisture is removed.

245
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,850
The same as pickled vegetables.

246
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:32,088
That's right.
And you can expect
an increase in umami.

247
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:34,856
Trouble is, if you
let it sit too long,

248
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:37,393
you'll run the risk of
losing all its freshness.

When they're just

they haven't built up
their umami yet...

252

But if too much time goes by,
they lose their freshness.

00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:50,139
But I've also heard
that these typically

254
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:53,842
have their best flavor
right before they're
about to go bad, though.

I assume you wanna know
about aging beef.

292
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:17,693
It's a method of curing
where you expose it to air

while controlling
temperature and humidity.

isn't just about how
fresh it is, right?

to age it and bring out

00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:36,778
Well, of course I will!

301
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,181
After all, you're one of us
you silly little goose!

302
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,683
Well, it's definitely
worth a shot!

303
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,619
Are you going to try
that out on Shun?

304
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,754
[SHUN]
Yes. I'm not opposed.

305
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:48,790
[SOMA]
All right!
It's time to try out a dish!

306
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,060
[OTHERS]
Yeah!

307
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,997
Hm... Those crazy youngsters.

308
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:56,898
[SOMA]
There are three ways
we can try aging...

309
00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:02,338
salt yeast, smoking,
and THIS, which is
a high‐humidity fridge.

310
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:05,574
Hey. Thanks for
helping me out okay.

311
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,609
Uh, sure,
it's nothing really.

312
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,611
Just so we are on
the same level,

313
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:12,814
this method will take at least
three days to age properly.

314
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,216
Same goes for smoking.

315
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:16,552
It takes two days
to salt and dry it,

316
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,754
then one whole day for it
to properly mature.

317
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:22,324
The fridge is about the same,
three to four days as well.

318
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:24,426
Alright, so with
just this schedule,

319
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,495
we should be able to try
each method twice

320
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:28,364
as long as there
aren't any hiccups.

321
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,099
You're sayin'
we'll only have two tries?

322
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,102
I don't know whether that'll
be enough to beat their
trained eye...

323
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:36,205
THAT'S the challenge.

324
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:39,675
I can guarantee that
the rice malt will
totally permeate the saury.

325
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,443
But we must watch
the temperature.

326
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:44,246
You'll find subtle differences
in aging depending...

327
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,914
on liquid or smoking agents.

328
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,916
We need to be precise
with the setting.

329
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:50,452
Let's do 3 degrees Celsius
and 90% humidity.

330
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:55,924
That will allow the optimal
amount of moisture to
concentrate the umami.

331
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:02,364
Yes. Rice malt, smoking,
and now this...

332
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,899
they'll be done in three days.

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,767
I've gotta make use of
this wait time.

334
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:09,605
I'm going to do everything
I possibly can now!

335
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:14,776
(Music playing)

336
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:25,787
[RYOKO]
Are they finally ready?

337
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:28,457
[SOMA]
Yeah. There all done now!
Aren't they beauts?!

338
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:30,926
Well, let's give them
a taste then.

339
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:32,694
(Chomp)

340
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:34,263
(Chomp)

341
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:35,797
(Chomp)

342
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:37,899
That's really good!

343
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,003
They all have so much more umami
then I expected they would!

344
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,639
[IKUMI]
They turned out fantastic, Soma!

345
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:46,075
The one in rice‐malt has
a mellow depth of flavor,

346
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:48,810
while the smoked one gives off
an incredible smell.

347
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,479
[RYOKO]
And the humidity‐aged one

348
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,949
seems like it could be used
in any number of dishes.

349
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:56,852
Like foil cooked... marinated...
or even fried or grilled.

350
00:16:56,953 --> 00:17:00,022
Or it could be totally
wonderful just as a sushi!

351
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:00,889
But it's...

352
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,857
[ALL]
Oh?

353
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,292
I still feel...

354
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:05,627
the saury that Ryo served
back at the fish market...

355
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,629
just tasted a lot better.

356
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:08,965
After all that, huh?

357
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:11,033
But these were aged
absolutely perfectly.

358
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:14,036
But you're still thinking
that it's not enough?

359
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:15,471
Hmm...

360
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:21,077
[IKUMI]
Hey, Megumi, will you tell
Soma something for me?

361
00:17:21,177 --> 00:17:24,013
Tell him if he needs anything,
anything at all...

362
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:25,281
don't hesitate to ask.

363
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:26,282
'kay!

364
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:27,583
See ya.

365
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:30,552
I'll see you
a little later,
goodbye now.

366
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,292
[SOMA]
<i>Well that didn't go as planned.</i>

367
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:39,728
<i>Maybe tryin' to beat their</i>
<i>saury by smokin' mine</i>
<i>is a dead end?</i>

368
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:42,431
<i>Maybe I should spend</i>
<i>at least a little time</i>

369
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,866
<i>trying to develop a better eye?</i>

370
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,836
<i>No, that's still</i>
<i>a little premature.</i>

371
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,572
<i>The aged saury definitely had</i>
<i>increased umami.</i>

372
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:52,141
<i>This has to be</i>
<i>the right approach.</i>

373
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:54,110
<i>I just don't have any</i>
<i>other direction to turn.</i>

374
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,479
<i>There's just one more chance</i>
<i>to experiment with the aging.</i>

375
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,716
<i>After that, I'll have to</i>
<i>do it in the finals.</i>

376
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:01,850
<i>So which one should I?</i>

377
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:04,253
<i>Should it be the rice malt...</i>

378
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:05,454
<i>the smoking...</i>

379
00:18:05,554 --> 00:18:07,423
<i>or the humidity aging?</i>

380
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:10,092
<i>What can I use that</i>
<i>those guys can't beat?</i>

381
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,660
<i>I have to think.</i>

382
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,264
<i>I need something better...</i>

383
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:17,433
<i>Some kind of trigger for aging,</i>

384
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:20,669
<i>one that will develop</i>
<i>the saury's umami.</i>

385
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:23,805
(Drip)

386
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:24,740
Hmh!

387
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,776
Guess I'll go buy
some more fish.

388
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,516
[FUMIO]
What going on with you, Soma?
[SOMA] Oh!

389
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:36,652
You seem kinda down.
[SOMA] Oh...

390
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:39,621
Your dishes won't turn out well
with you moping about.

391
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,390
Why not try and
pull it together?

392
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,426
You're gonna lecture me
while sittin' around
having a nightcap?

393
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:46,828
Hm...
Well, at times like these,

394
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,498
it's important to stop
and take stock for a minute.

395
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:51,233
[SOMA]
Hm?

396
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:53,302
(Gasp)

397
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:54,736
Huh?

398
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,605
I love you so much, Fumio!

399
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,340
[FUMIO]
Boy! You're gonna
spill my drink!

400
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,044
Looks like inspiration
has finally struck, Soma.

401
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:05,314
[SOMA]
Uh‐huh!
This just might work after all!

<i>What is he up to?</i>

404
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,259
<i>He hasn't come to</i>
<i>the market in days.</i>

We're here for you, Soma!

Oh! Look at Isshiki.

I know, it's hard to recognize
him wearing clothes, huh?

426
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,194
More importantly, did Soma ever
come up with a dish to present?!

427
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:28,230
Well we... we don't really
know that either.

428

But I try very hard, yes.

453
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,827
Her grammar's atrocious!

454
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,463
Gimme a break!
You could've at least practiced
before coming out here, y'know!

455
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:37,866
You need to get out of here,
this area is off limits to
non‐committee members!

456
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:41,070
[LEONORA]
Oh, Alice, are you well?
And Erina, are you well?

457
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,571
Is there something I say now?

458
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:45,774
I see Ms. Erina has quite
a temper, as always she does.

459
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,609
[ERINA]
It is all your
daughter's fault!

460
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:51,347
Hm... You are the
Soma Yukihira who beat Alice,

461
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:52,548
I hear you are, yes?

462
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:54,450
Quite surprised
I was to know.

463
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,819
So, your food is what
I am looking forward to
the most to eat.

464
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,188
Sound good, yes?

465
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,290
If it is not delicious,

466
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,760
I may be very upset
and angry on you.

467
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:38,955
[SATOSHI]
Contestants, if you would please
unveil your saury to the judges!

468
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:47,296
Oh! Such incredible luster
and with just the right amount
of firmness and fat...

469
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:49,765
It's like the glint
of cold steel!

470
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:51,333
(Swords clash)

471
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,935
Those blades are extraordinary,
perfectly suited for war.

472
00:23:54,036 --> 00:23:56,505
Dammit!
Can Soma really pull this off?!

473
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:58,440
[MEGUMI]
Oh, Soma!

474
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:04,213
(Grunting)

475
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:06,848
[IKUMI] Ah!
[SATO] What in the heck is that?

476
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:08,450
That thing's got...

477
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,452
[GROUP]
...no edge!

478
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,526
[NARRATOR]
Next Time:

479
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:20,329
"The Sword that Announces Fall."
