00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:08,288
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Popular Japanese chef
and owner of the lauded
"SHINO'S" in Paris,

2
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:12,576
Kojiro Shinomiya will
be opening his first
branch location in Tokyo.

3
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:15,612
And the anticipation level
among food connoisseurs

4
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:19,348
for the cuisine of Chef Kojiro,
continues to rise.

5
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:23,887
[KOJIRO]
Huh? I don't even have time
to sleep, much less babysit.

6
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:25,422
[NISHIZONO]
<i>Precisely why, sir.</i>

7
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:27,657
<i>Chef Dojima thinks that</i>
<i>by sending a student</i>

8
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:29,025
<i>to work with your</i>
<i>opening staff,</i>

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,127
<i>you could both benefit from it.</i>

10
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,095
Ugghh...

11
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,730
Oh I'm sure he'll be fine.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,366
He should be more than
happy getting to help
someone like that.

13
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:40,203
After all, it's just
a small favor for a poor
chef employed by Tohtsuki.

14
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:41,938
[NISHIZONO]
<i>He said you'd understand, sir.</i>

15
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:44,207
[KOJIRO]
<i>How long is he going</i>
<i>to hold that grudge?</i>

16
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:46,410
What would you know
about any of this?!

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,579
You're just some poor chef
employed by the Tohtsuki Group!

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,082
Well tell him I won't
take 'em unless they at
least made it to the finals

19
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,919
in the Fall Selection and
even then I prefer if they won.

20
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,320
[SOMA]
Hey!

21
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:58,555
Hm?

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,860
Thanks a lot for taking
me in, Chef Kojiro.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,328
Hmm...

24
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,365
(Opening song)

25
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:42,926
[KOJIRO] Interesting... I never
expected YOU of all people...

26
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:44,260
Yukihira.

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,896
Yeah, I was pretty
surprised about it too.

28
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:48,498
I mean, ME at
YOUR restaurant!

29
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,635
<i>I can't believe I'm here</i>
<i>in Chef Kojiro's kitchen...</i>

30
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:54,671
<i>But now I've gotta</i>
<i>leave one of their</i>
<i>"visible accomplishments"</i>

31
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,440
<i>to clear the Stagiaire.</i>

32
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,875
It won't be easy to improve
anything around here ...

33
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,477
but I'll see what I can do.

34
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:02,145
Ugh!
To start...

35
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,080
why don't you go clean
all the interior areas.

36
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,483
Huh? You haven't
finished that yet?

37
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,653
Hey! MOVE, dammit!
Or you're fired!

38
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:10,654
Right!

39
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:12,088
Excuse me there, Chef...

40
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:13,823
We need to start working
on putting the final menu

41
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,158
together for the opening.

42
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:16,760
Oh, that's right!

43
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,162
Why don't you hire
someone to do the
rest of the dirty work?

44
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:21,064
Considering what's
left of our budget,

45
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:22,999
we need to try and do
all that we can ourselves.

46
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,670
I was very particular
on how I wanted the
interior and dishware.

47
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,773
I mean, can't you
go ask for as much
investment as you want?

48
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:31,340
You have the
Brousse‐Poiret Award.

49
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:33,877
Almost all of our sponsors
for the main restaurant

50
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:35,745
were against
opening a new one.

51
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,246
There's no way
I could ask them.

52
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:39,649
Ugh! He's got way
too much pride!

53
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:41,985
And our soft open is
happening tomorrow!

54
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:43,787
Oh, sorry
about this.

55
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:46,490
We're staff from the
main "SHINO'S" restaurant
located in Paris.

56
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,725
We came to help out with
opening the Tokyo location

57
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:51,227
and hang around a bit
until things settle some.

58
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:52,929
Alrighty! Nice to meet ya!

59
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:56,500
[WEI]
Oh, and over
there's the head chef
of "SHINO'S Tokyo,"

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,834
Chef Blondin.

61
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:00,370
He was assistant head chef
at the main restaurant.

62
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,839
He acted as
Chef Kojiro's right hand man.

63
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,207
[SOMA]
It's good to meet ya!

64
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:05,842
Yeah, same here.

65
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:07,176
Do your best, okay?

66
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:09,846
[KOJIRO]
Hey, quit talkin'
already, people!

67
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:11,615
Hey, Soma,
get over here.

68
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,516
[SOMA]
Sir!

69
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:14,050
This seems like
a lot of work,

70
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,318
opening a restaurant.

71
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,120
But y'know,
I feel pretty lucky

72
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,022
that I get to train
here with you, Chef.

73
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,624
[KOJIRO]
Just shut up and lift!

74
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,626
<i>What the heck is</i>
<i>wrong with that kid?!</i>

75
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:24,994
<i>He's being so casual</i>
<i>around Chef Kojiro!</i>

76
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:29,298
[ABEL]
<i>How much time did I spend</i>
<i>before finally thinking</i>
<i>I'd gotten in with him?</i>

77
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,603
<i>And until finally in the end,</i>
<i>he made me head chef</i>
<i>of the Tokyo location!</i>

78
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:37,140
I'd never been so
moved as I was at that
breathtaking moment!

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,610
(Sobbing)
There, there. We've heard
it a thousand times already.

80
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,547
It seems ever since Chef
returned from Japan back
in Spring...

81
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,515
he's really mellowed
out quite a bit, huh?

82
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:48,885
I agree... Wasn't
he actin' as judge
or something?

83
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:51,187
You're right, he's
been a little nicer
since he's been back.

84
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:55,024
[WEI]
He answers so nicely
when we ask questions
about cooking now.

85
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:56,292
[LUCIE]
Totally!

86
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,994
He likes to complain
from time to time,

87
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:00,329
but in the end he actually
teaches us what we need to know

88
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,366
and looks out for us!
Hm?

89
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,300
Stop yappin' and get to work.

90
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,102
(Squeak squeak squeak)

91
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:07,971
[SOMA]
By the way, Chef Kojiro...

92
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:11,441
why did you decide to
open up a new restaurant?

93
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,342
And open it here
of all places.

94
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,178
I saw an article
in TohSpo...

95
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:17,447
it said it's unusual to open
another restaurant

96
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:19,449
when you're trying
for a three‐star rating.

97
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:21,751
So let me ask you...
what did you mean before?

98
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:25,822
Huh?
You said you were "lucky"
to be training in my restaurant.

99
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:29,959
It would've been easier to
clear the Stagiaire at some
mom‐and‐pop eatery.

100
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,227
(Sigh)

101
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,062
It's so I can learn
to make my Specialty.

102
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:36,533
I can't just keep
cooking the way
I always have.

103
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:39,403
I just...
I want to move forward.

104
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:43,206
And discover a new
understanding of
the way I cook.

105
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:46,610
[LUCIE]
Break time! I'm so beat!

106
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,012
I can feel the end
is almost in sight.

107
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:50,514
What should we do
for lunch?

108
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,148
Well, I guess I
could cook something‐

109
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:54,083
I'LL make us lunch.
Uh!

110
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:56,152
You're gonna cook
something yourself?!

111
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:58,187
Is something wrong,
what brought this on?

112
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,390
Just set the
tables, will ya?

113
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,260
We get to eat a meal cooked
by Chef Kojiro himself?!

114
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:08,765
[ABEL]
<i>He's mincing chicken...</i>

115
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:09,866
[LUCIE]
<i>So exciting!</i>

116
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,501
<i>He's added button, maitake,</i>

117
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,070
<i>and shimeji mushrooms and</i>
<i>slowly sautéing them in butter.</i>

118
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,241
[WEI]
<i>Now he's just laid out a</i>
<i>piecrust and he's filling</i>
<i>it with eggs, and soymilk,</i>

119
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:20,243
<i>combined with white miso!</i>

120
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,180
(Fumes and sizzles)

121
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,248
Woah!

122
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:27,984
[SOMA]
Ahh! That looks amazing!

123
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:29,719
What kind of dish
is this?

124
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,120
It's called a quiche.

125
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,723
It was originally a local
specialty of the Lorraine
region,

126
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:36,325
but it's made its way to Paris
where it's now a lunch item.

127
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:40,063
Given you probably know
nothing of the area,
I'm sure this is lost on you.

128
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,798
I dunno, maybe so.

129
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:43,900
But this is perfect
for a staff lunch!

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,334
I'm diggin' in!

131
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:47,270
<i>This is gonna</i>
<i>be so delicious!</i>

132
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,105
[LUCIE]
<i>"Legume Magician" sorcery!</i>

133
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:50,940
(Crunch)
(Crunch)

134
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,612
[BOTH]
<i>What is this crunchy texture</i>
<i>sliding down my throat?!</i>

135
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:57,080
Ahhhh!

136
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,449
Ahhhh!

137
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:01,551
It's burdock root.

138
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,586
"Burdock"?

139
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:04,588
I'm not surprised you
don't know of it.

140
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:07,757
It tends to be an overlooked
ingredient in Western cuisine.

141
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:10,126
<i>The crunchiness of the</i>
<i>burdock is a great match</i>

142
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:11,828
<i>for the creaminess</i>
<i>of the cheese.</i>

143
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:14,363
<i>The juicy chicken and the</i>
<i>accent of black pepper</i>

144
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>complement the rest of the</i>
<i>ingredients perfectly.</i>

145
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,804
How was he able to get
such depth of flavor
without using any bouillon?!

146
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,839
He managed to draw
out the perfect balance

147
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,841
of the sweet tartness
of the burdock's skin

148
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,877
and concentrated
the velvety flavors of
the chicken and cheese.

149
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:31,981
He paired an ingredient
from Japanese cooking with
a provincial French dish!

150
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,950
It's good enough to be
served at SHINO'S in Paris!

[ABEL]
That's the Legume
Magician for you!

Alright, let's open
some wine!

155
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:49,065
Huh? We're pushing
the budget as it is!

156
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:51,635
[KOJIRO]
But this is a staff meal
that I made.

157
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:54,037
It would be a shame not
to pair it with some wine.

158
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:55,572
I've got some right here!

159

[KOJIRO]
Soma...
Uh?

165
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:06,983
There should be no doubt...

166
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,686
that this week will get you
closer to your specialty.

167
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:14,123
If you can do exactly what I ask
of you up till the end, that is.

168
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:15,425
Are you ready for that?

169
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:16,993
Shouldn't be a
problem, right?

170
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:18,395
Ready!

00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:26,603
Hmph!
Hm?

172
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:28,538
Strangely, it doesn't
seem odd.

173
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:30,273
Um, what are
you talking about?

174
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:31,775
[KOJIRO]
Your chef's outfit.

175
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,377
I was expecting
a laugh out of it.

176
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:34,878
Hmph!

177
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:36,045
Oh well.

178
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:37,914
Time for our soft opening.

179
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:38,882
No slacking off.

180
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:40,417
Right!

181
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,019
So, uh, by the way...

182
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:45,722
how is a "soft open"
different from just
a regular open?

183
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:48,357
Oh yeah, well it's
kind of treated as a trial run

184
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,760
prior to us having
the official opening.

185
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,129
[WEI]
Mostly just friends and
associates who are invited.

186
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:57,100
It's a way for us to
see how the staff coordinates
during an actual service.

187
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,134
[SOMA]
Ohh!

188
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,803
That makes sense.

189
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,238
[WEI]
Also, it's a way to try out
some of the new menu items

190
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:03,740
here at SHINO'S Tokyo.

191
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,308
We'll adjust the dishes daily

192
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:07,310
according to the different
customer reactions.

193
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:10,780
Then, on the last day, the
staff will have a competition
over the new menu items.

194
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,849
Really?
Hey, Soma!

195
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:15,318
You've finished all of
your assigned tasks, right?

196
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,620
Uh, yeah.

197
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,187
I've peeled everything and
made a bouillon

198
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,689
of homard lobster,

199
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:22,325
and I got the octopus and
daikon set up in the marinade.

200
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:23,627
Very good.

201
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:25,294
Alright for now,
I'll have you assist me

202
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:27,230
with getting all my
prep work done.

203
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,598
Once you've gotten
the hang of things,

204
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,534
I might have you
support Chef Abel too.

205
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,135
Sounds fun! Lead the way.

206

00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:15,612
[KOJIRO]
The soft open ends tomorrow.

458
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:18,482
Don't go slacking off
on your last day here.

459
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:19,783
Understand?

460
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:21,017
Of course not!

461
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:22,285
(Chuckles)
You did really great!

462
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:24,020
I'm so proud!
Thanks a lot!

463
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,691
Hey, Abel. Do you have
any objections with
Yukihira staying?

464
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,758
(Scoffs)

465
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,126
I don't.

466
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,396
Well, I guess he gets
a passing grade after all.

467
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:35,899
For a while, I was worried how
things would turn out for him.

468
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:37,867
He didn't get a
single word of advice.

469
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,804
It means nothing if you don't
overcome on your own.

470
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:42,238
<i>Besides...</i>

471
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:46,075
Um, excuse me Chef.
There's just one more thing.

472
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:48,344
What is it,
Monsieur Yukihira?

473
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:50,213
Do you have another complaint?

474
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:51,781
Does that rule at Tohtsuki

475
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:55,184
still apply after a student
has already graduated?

476
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:56,686
What are you talking about?

477
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:58,588
I'm challenging you.

478
00:20:58,688 --> 00:20:59,523
(Gasp)

479
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:03,460
If I beat you in a
Food War challenge,

480
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,030
will you take back your
decision to expel Megumi?

481
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,799
(Megumi whimpers)

[SOMA]
He beat me...

486
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,116
And I...

487
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:28,585
I lost.

488
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:29,519
Hm!

489
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,521
Dammit...

490
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:34,991
[SOMA]
Chef Kojiro.

491
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:37,293
Excuse me...
you have a quick second?

492
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:38,828
Yes, what is it, Soma?

493
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:39,996
Do you have a complaint?

494
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:41,364
No.

495
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:43,367
Since it looks like I've
made it to the last day,

496
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:45,502
I have a favor to ask.

497
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:46,803
What now?

498
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:48,605
The battle...

499
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:49,739
(Gasp)

500
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,007
If I could...

501
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:52,308
I'd like to enter the
competition tomorrow

502
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:53,677
for the new dish.

503
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:55,412
I have something
that I'd like to submit.

504
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:57,213
What?!
The competition?

505
00:21:57,313 --> 00:22:00,049
But you had your hands
full just trying to support
all of us back here.

506
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:01,250
Uh!

507
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,519
You know, Soma...

508
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:03,553
Oh come on.

509
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,589
I had always planned
to submit something.

510
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:09,125
I've been putting an
idea together in my head
the past few days...

511
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:11,895
but now I'd like to make
it happen for real.

512
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:16,165
(Gasps)

513
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:18,668
Are you sure you can put out
a worthwhile dish?

514
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:19,335
I am.

515
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:20,970
And as you said...

516
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,540
this would be the first time you
get to taste your recette, yes?

517
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,173
That's right.

518
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:25,875
Very well.

519
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,577
However...

520
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:29,979
Don't come crying to me if your
budding self‐confidence

521
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,749
withers under pressure!
