1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,673
(Narrator):
The Tohtsuki
Fine Dining Academy...

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:10,076
an institute of fine cuisine
that continually produces chefs

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,679
of worldwide renown.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,616
Chief among its highlights
is its Fall Selection,

5
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,852
a contest for first‐years
of the high school division.

6
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,854
After an intense
preliminary round,

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,624
winners move forward to face off
in the main tournament.

8
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,159
Where the fates of eight
contestants will be played out

9
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,228
on the big stage.

10
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,598
(Megumi):
Okay!

11
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:36,903
Oh no! My petite knife!
Did I make sure to pack it?!

12
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,839
There it is!

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,073
What about
my timer?!

14
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,775
I know I packed
it somewhere!

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,475
Oh God,
where is it?!?!

16
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,978
They're just EXPLAINING
the competition today.

17
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,547
You don't need any
of your gear, yet.

18
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,515
(panicked scream)
Are you sure?!

19
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,585
Girl...You're never
gonna change?

20
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,119
Hey...Megumi!

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,321
(Soma):
The car's already
here for us.

22
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,056
Huh?

23
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,758
Time to go!

24
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,426
(Narrator):
These eight elite
contestants excel

25
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,428
in both personality
and technique.

26
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,566
Waging a fierce battle with
their eyes on the top spot...

27
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,634
they await for
the curtain to rise...

28
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,437
on the final battle
of the Fall Selection!

29
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,845
(Isshiki):
Hey there Soma, the results
of the draw are in.

30
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:22,482
You will be competing
in the first round of the
upcoming competition.

31
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,284
Your theme will
be the bento box.

32
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,521
Bento box? Like,
normal bento box?

33
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,589
That is up to you.

34
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,091
Be sure to get all of your
prep work done early.

35
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,759
You'll be in the
finals tomorrow.

36
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,727
This is
a surprise...

37
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,696
Guess this school
CAN be down to Earth.

38
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,131
(Soma):
I mean, a bento
box? Really?

39
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,266
Do you even know
what you're saying?

40
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,735
You just don't
get it, do you?

41
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,038
The bento was developed in Japan
and has its own unique culture.

42
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,674
(Erina):
By using only the choicest
seasonal ingredients...

43
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,811
the bento has remained beloved
in many culinary circles.

44
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,747
The word "bento" is now
even in the French dictionary.

45
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,017
It's an appropriate theme for
a celebration of haute cuisine.

46
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,952
(Erina):
If you even know
what that MEANS.

47
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,055
A sharp line divides it
from second‐rate drab cooking...

48
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,189
which happens to be
YOUR specialty.

49
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,460
(uncomfortable laugh)
Sure enough, that's one thing
I don't like about you.

50
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,270
(scoffs)

51
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,930
I'm good with listening
to people and getting them

52
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,264
to talk more
openly....

53
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,033
but you're just
too much, Erina.

54
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,200
Ugh!

55
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,569
Coming back from the
training camp

56
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,403
was pretty
uncomfortable, huh?

57
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,040
What do you mean?! What does
that have to do with ANYTHING?!

58
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,575
I swear to God,
Soma Yukihira! UGH!

59
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,475
Hm?
I swear to God,
Soma Yukihira! UGH!

60
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,646
This is unusual. Nakiri is
actually raising her voice.

61
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,882
Very well. I have a
client to attend to.

62
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,651
(Eizan):
If you'll excuse me.

63
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,687
Soma Yukihira.

64
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,824
Promise me you will give it
your all and win tomorrow.

65
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,060
(Eizan):
You don't want to lose
your first battle.

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,362
That would be
disappointing.

67
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,465
So...

68
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,033
who will I be
competing against?

69
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,403
(Urara):
The moment you've all
been waiting for is here!

70
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,973
It's the finals
of the Fall Selection!

71
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,509
Contestants ready?
Audience ready?

72
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,745
Let's begin the first battle
of the competition!

73
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,916
First up is the contestant from
A Block, tied for 2nd place,

74
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,651
Soma Yukihira!

75
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,285
Aww yeah!

76
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,320
Kick some
butt, Soma!

77
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,422
(Urara):
And the opponent
he will be up against...

78
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,859
the contestant who nabbed
the top spot at B Block...

79
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,160
Alice Nakiri!

80
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,599
(crowd cheering)

81
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,600
Alice Nakiri...

82
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,267
(Takumi):
This can't be good.

83
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,169
She's the granddaughter
of our school director.

84
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,640
she's competed in countless
competitions and won them all.

85
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,443
She's a genius known as the
Prodigy of Molecular Gastronomy.

86
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,346
Her curry dish had the best
score in the preliminaries,

87
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,116
and used the very latest
cooking techniques.

88
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,084
It definitely
made an impact.

89
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,854
How will you possibly
combat this, Soma?

90
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,523
(Alice):
Aren't you lucky?

91
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,958
Get ready to be
enthralled today...

92
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,492
by me and my cooking.

93
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,027
(Male Student 1):
Awesome!

94
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,230
(Male Student 2):
Look at her equipment! It's
like... from outer space!

95
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,464
(Zenji):
Sitting up here
in the stands,

96
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,700
has my sensitive skin
tingling with anxiety.

97
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,103
To think, he has to take
on the Nakiri family HERE.

98
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,706
Yeah. The
pressure is on.

99
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,108
He definitely has his work
cut out for him.

100
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,410
It really is a shame,
now, isn't it?

101
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,112
We're finally
together on stage...

102
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,449
and I'll only get to experience
your famous cooking once.

103
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,717
Yeah, but if you lose...

104
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,353
you'll see more sitting
up there in the stands.

105
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,155
Ah, yeah... I don't think
that's gonna happen.

106
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,891
(Alice):
Your skills rely
on mostly showmanship

107
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,660
and are hopelessly outdated.

108
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,062
They're no match for
a trained culinary mind.

109
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,864
(exaggerated yawn)

110
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,098
Well, look at you.

111
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,833
Too worried to get
any sleep last night?

112
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,236
Yeah... I was up pretty
late trying out ideas.

113
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,905
Before I knew it,
it was already dawn!

114
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,140
But you don't
gotta worry about me.

115
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,142
This battle is
pretty normal fare

116
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,578
for me to have
to contend with.

117
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,613
(Soma):
We've got guests
with picky tastes...

118
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,314
Knives sharpened
and gleaming...

119
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,916
and ingredients
all laid out.

120
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,485
The only thing different,
is havin' to go up against

121
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,287
a tough industry
rival like you.

122
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,990
Alice... I'm going
beat you today...

123
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,694
and add everything I've
learned to my repertoire.

124
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:56,930
Here we go, folks!

125
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,932
(Urara):
The theme is bento boxes!

126
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,768
Two hours will be
placed on the clock!

127
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,604
NOW, LET...

128
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,872
(Senzaemon):
the Cooking BEGIN!

129
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,240
(crowd cheering)

130
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,711
Good luck, Soma.
You can do this!

131
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,586
It's like some
science experiment.

132
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,755
Zenji, explain
all this!

133
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:22,322
I can't...

134
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,190
this cooking is outside
of my frame of reference.

135
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,793
WHAT ARE THOSE
NERD GLASSES FOR?!

136
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,329
(Alice):
Mmmm!

137
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,764
The Japanese DNA inside me

138
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,000
is quite happy with my
gastronomic prowess.

139
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,838
(Soma):
Ooooh!

140
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:38,705
Huh? What's wrong?

141
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,742
Well, you made fun of
showmanship earlier...

142
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,143
but you're pretty
good at it.

143
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,377
Well, of
course I am!

144
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,979
Jeez... you're
such a dolt!

145
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,981
And don't you know
it's not polite to stare?

146
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,751
It's funny, I remember getting
the full stare‐down from you

147
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,952
at our last
training camp...

148
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,688
(Male Student):
He's going up against the school
director's own granddaughter!

149
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,122
Dammit! Soma, please,

150
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,660
tell me you have at least
some kind of plan!

151
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,829
(Takumi):
Yes... I'm sure he does.

152
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,733
(Urara):
Now then...both contestants
are about to finish up.

153
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,069
Looks like the first
one done will be...

154
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,337
(Urara):
It's Alice Nakiri!

155
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,940
Well... who's
ready for lunch?

156
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,843
What is that contraption?!

157
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,513
Inside that dome it looks
like... there's smoke?

158
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,048
That's something I could
never even imagine.

159
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,619
Ah... she's put out
something strange again.

160
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,655
(Saotome):
How fitting for a
celebration of fine cuisine!

161
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,457
This presentation
piques one's interest.

162
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:40,534
(students in awe)

163
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,368
Temari‐zushi, eh?

164
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,238
Yes! I have showcased my
vast culinary techniques

165
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,407
into this specialized
temari bento box.

166
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,942
This is VERY exquisite!

167
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,813
(Senzaemon):
Hm. This "smoke" is
actually liquid nitrogen.

168
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,748
I see that your intent
was to preserve

169
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,150
the sushi's freshness
using cold air.

170
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,151
Gentlemen please...

171
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,287
if you wouldn't mind, I'd ask
that you eat this bento in order

172
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,656
(Alice):
from the top left.

173
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,692
First, we have the
bounty of the sea...

174
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,629
abalone topped with a
delicate touch of foam.

175
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:09,796
I made this portion...

176
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,165
by turning a stock of
kombu seaweed into foam.

177
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,769
(Alice):
And the toppings were pressed
between sheets of kombu.

178
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,839
(Hisako):
Sandwiching them in kombu,

179
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,508
removes a bit of moisture
and also preserves them.

180
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,210
It's a good cooking
technique for a bento box.

181
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,579
Yes, it is.

182
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,650
But I don't think that's the
only reason for using kombu.

183
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,984
(Alice):
This is skipjack tuna...

184
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,419
It was aged for two days
at low temperature,

185
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,888
bringing out
its bold flavor.

186
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,725
Mmm...MMM! How
exquisitely divine!

187
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,227
(slurp)
It's wonderful...

188
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,395
the umami's complex!

189
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,765
Note that the tuna
has inosinic acid

190
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,067
while the kombu
contains glutamic acid.

191
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,970
When combined, the umami
components create a lovely

192
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,171
synergistic effect.

193
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,339
(Alice):
By eating this bento
in successive order,

194
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,711
the umami profile grows more
complete on the refined palate.

195
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,512
(Male Student 1):
Oh, my gosh!

196
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,713
(Female Student):
I wanna eat that!

197
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,581
(Male Student 2):
That looks incredible!

198
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,849
(Alice):
Next... we come down
to the second row.

199
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,352
These are so‐called "cake sushi"
made using vegetables.

200
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,288
There is absolutely
no seaweed.

201
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,556
Vegetables sliced paper‐thin

202
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,324
were used to wrap
the ingredients.

203
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,895
After all, a variety of colors,
adds to the eating experience.

204
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,230
(Alice):
And now let me present
the third row.

205
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,700
It embraces the main dish.

206
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,469
That's a meat sushi using beef
filet, aged at low temperature.

207
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,606
Mmm... mmm...

208
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,840
THERE IT IS AGAIN!

209
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,745
Two kinds of umami components
are spreading on my tongue!

210
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,147
I see... I understand
it's inosinic acid.

211
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,350
Given it's a meat sushi...
but glutamic acid?

212
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,685
It comes from tomatoes.

213
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,187
Tomatoes? I don't see
any tomatoes here.

214
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,957
They were incorporated
into the cake sushi.

215
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,560
(Alice):
I used a centrifuge...
which thoroughly broke them down

216
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,797
into pigment, fiber,
and jus components.

217
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,900
I then filtered the jus
to make it even more pure...

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,169
and added a few drops to each.

219
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:56,870
Genius!

220
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,240
Not a trace of the original
ingredient seems to remain.

221
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,944
And what about this last piece?

222
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,681
(Saotome):
Looks like sea bream sushi,
but what's that orb?

223
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,415
(Judges):
Mmm.

224
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:10,751
Oooh!

225
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,353
This isn't an orb!

226
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,921
It's solidified dashi stock!

227
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:19,425
(Saotome):
It develops on the tongue...
a sea bream ochazuke!

228
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,961
(students in shock)

229
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,564
The Prodigy of
Molecular Gastronomy...

230
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,932
She's done justice
to both those terms,

231
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,301
using her skills
to continually pique

232
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,236
the interest
of the diner.

233
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,539
Such a sense
of satisfaction!

234
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,508
This has equaled
a sumptuous meal

235
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,877
served at the finest
of restaurants!

236
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:37,611
Mmm!

237
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,580
(Senzaemon):
From this small bento box...

238
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,148
a knowledge of
fine cuisine has...

239
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,918
BURST INTO EXISTENCE!

240
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,653
(Male Student 1):
HE SHOWED HIS CHEST!

241
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:48,121
(Male Student 2):
Dude, he's jacked!

242
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:48,655
(Female Student):
The director took
his clothes off!

243
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,691
Excellent job
there, Alice.

244
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,858
(pleased giggle)

245
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,728
(Male Student 1):
Wow! That's what
Alice Nakiri is capable of!

246
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,197
(Female Student):
I can't believe that girl's
the same age as us.

247
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,133
(Male Student 2):
I could spend my whole life
and never catch up.

248
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,302
(Saotome):
The light of such
prodigious skill

249
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,671
will create its
own shadow upon the world.

250
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,507
It's simple
cause and effect.

251
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,042
This is the renowned
Tohtsuki Academy.

252
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,545
Any coward who would buckle
under these conditions

253
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,779
is dead weight.

254
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,180
(Senzaemon):
Behold.

255
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,049
Hmm?

256
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,152
Five bento boxes...
order up!

257
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,588
There is at least one cook
who doesn't falter

258
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,857
in the face of
insurmountable odds.

259
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,260
(Senzaemon):
Soma Yukihira...
What have you prepared?

260
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,096
Seaweed bento!

261
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,598
(Male Student 1):
Did he say "seaweed"?!

262
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:32,365
(Female Student):
Seriously?!

263
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,969
(Male Student 2):
How could he possibly
beat Alice Nakiri with THAT?

264
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:48,481
(defeated groans)

265
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:49,315
(Male Student 1):
Seaweed bento?

266
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,784
(Female Student):
Is he like, mental?

267
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,519
(Male Student 2):
He's done for.
Hey, uh... Soma.

268
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,787
Yeah?

269
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,789
What's a seaweed
bento, huh?

270
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,058
Really? Wait, you
seriously don't know?

271
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,260
You want me to make you
a box afterwards?

272
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,929
The thing is, this ain't
your normal variety.

273
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,600
(Soma):
It's Yukihira‐style
"evolved" seaweed bento!

274
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,902
Please, help yourselves,
gentlemen.

275
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:09,736
Oooh!

276
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,805
Soma:
This here is a food jar.

277
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,840
It's made from
all stainless steel.

278
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,577
You can keep things like rice
and soup hot until ready to eat.

279
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:20,213
Wow... Japan's bento boxes have
come a long way, haven't they?

280
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,448
Some modern ones can
keep things nice and hot

281
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,317
for half a day
or sometimes more.

282
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,720
If you put the soup in
while it's piping hot...

283
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,689
it will help keep the
rice warm, as well.

284
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,724
Really? That's
so clever!

285
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,659
He doesn't even
look nervous at all!

286
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,194
Even though he's in
the middle of the match!

287
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,664
Is she talking down to Soma?!
That pasty, little tramp!

288
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,832
(Ikumi):
Look at that smirk.

289
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,902
The slunk meat thinks
she's already won this!

290
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,270
Alright...
let's begin.

291
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,707
(Judge):
Starting with
the three sides.

292
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,241
Mmm!

293
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:52,513
(Judge):
What a splendid isobe‐age! The
fish cakes are perfectly fried!

294
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:53,046
Thank you.

295
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,848
I personally made
those fish cakes

296
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,382
and then fried
them up for you.

297
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,118
He used beer
in the fried batter.

298
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,954
Alcohol will help volatize
the batter a lot faster.

299
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,089
It'll give it a texture
that isn't too gummy.

300
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,159
Huh? How do you
know that Ryoko?

301
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,730
(Ryoko):
Easy. I saw Yukihira trying out
recipes in the dorm last night,

302
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,232
and he let me
taste a few items.

303
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,734
(fish‐tastic moaning)

304
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,268
It's brimming with umami!

305
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,004
I can practically
smell the seaside!

306
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:18,739
Yow!

307
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,974
It seems to fairly
envelop oneself!

308
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,143
Um... who are you?

309
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,245
(Senzaemon):
Mmm...

310
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:29,215
(Judge):
This shredded burdock root is
mellow but has depth of flavor.

311
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,216
I have a secret.

312
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,252
You just have to add
a hint of mayonnaise

313
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,587
and balsamic vinegar.

314
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:34,187
How thoughtful!

315
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,123
You made this considering
the smallest details.

316
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:41,094
(Oizumi):
Wow! It is easily parted
with only chopsticks!

317
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,664
It was seasoned
with dashi stock,

318
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,166
and simmered before
going in the fryer.

319
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,771
That would certainly give it
this beautiful texture.

320
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:54,708
(Oizumi):
(beer‐battered laughs)

321
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,478
The mellow flavor of it
envelops my heart!

322
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,716
Like the gentle breeze of
the highlands in Spring time!

323
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:03,784
(overjoyed laughs)

324
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,853
Such refined
flavor and spirit!

325
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,288
Oizumi:
What is this?!

326
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,525
It seems the answer lies
in the fish stock.

327
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,859
I see it, now.

328
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,128
It was made with
maguro tuna flakes.

329
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,462
Exactly right.

330
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,764
I simmered the cod...

331
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,667
in maguro and seaweed
from Rishiri Island.

332
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,735
Maguro flakes...

333
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:25,138
Those are made from dried
yellowfin tuna, are they not?

334
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,875
Right. The stock is milder
than using shaved bonito,

335
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,745
but they have a very
delicate, refined flavor.

336
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,180
The maguro flakes
are the PERFECT match

337
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,617
for the subtle
umami of the cod.

338
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,985
Such an elegant dish
for us to savor!

339
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,554
Now to try the soup...

340
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:44,791
(Bald Judge):
Oh! This miso soup
has bacon and onions!

341
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,092
(soup‐er slurping)

342
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:50,196
Oooh! Unbelievable!

343
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,066
(Bald Judge):
The unique fragrance
of the maguro stock

344
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,235
permeates the nostrils.

345
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,437
Combined with the sweetness
of the tender onions...

346
00:13:57,538 --> 00:14:01,908
it's like being hugged
on the inside by an angel!

347
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,977
Incidentally... there's
a trick to the soup

348
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,179
that makes this bento
work even better...

349
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,750
Just add the stock, ingredients,
and seasonings to the food jar,

350
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,884
and voila!

351
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,153
In a few hours, you'll have
a sweet‐tasting soup

352
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,955
with all the vegetables
cooked through.

353
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,591
Whoa... that is
really convenient.

354
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,493
Though I did put mine over flame
since we're eating pretty soon.

355
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:24,264
You do seem to be quite
knowledgeable about bento boxes.

356
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,065
I guess so.

357
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,768
I've made them before at
the family eatery back home.

358
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,203
But it's not enough,
Soma Yukihira.

359
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,773
(Alice):
Your attempts
are too pedestrian.

360
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,107
It may just be a bento,

361
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,077
but you have to make something
glamorous and surprising...

362
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,913
like MY perfect bento box.

363
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,648
Oh, yeah, that was cool!

364
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,283
Yours looked
super delish, alright!

365
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,185
You'll have to let me
try it, sometime!

366
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,854
(haughty laugh)
Sure, that will be fine.

367
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,824
(Soma):
But still... the thing
about your dish...

368
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,827
Are you confident that it
was a great Bento box?

369
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:54,995
What are you saying?

370
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,898
Did you put everything
you have within yourself

371
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,000
into your own creation?

372
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:05,872
(Soma):
One of our regular customers
was an old lady named Mrs. Kiyo.

373
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,608
She came almost every day...

374
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,944
but then she hurt her lower back
and couldn't come anymore.

375
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:11,978
(doorbell rings)

376
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,314
(Mrs. Kiyo):
Yes, be right there!

377
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,582
Mrs. Kiyo, hey!

378
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:16,717
Is your back okay?

379
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,118
Oh, Soma dear!

380
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:22,689
Isn't this when the restaurant
gets busy and‐ Ow, ow, ow!

381
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,758
Here... have this!

382
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,060
You haven't had dinner.
See ya!

383
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,462
(Mrs. Kiyo):
He came just to give me this?

384
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:30,463
(panting)

385
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:33,934
(Young Soma):
It was crazy slow at the shop,
so I thought I'd make you this.

386
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,336
Eat it, and feel better, okay?

387
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,539
P.S...

388
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,106
Peel back the seaweed...

389
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,442
Have a look
before you eat the rice!

390
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:43,644
Oooh...

391
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,250
(Present Soma):
I tried to convey something
with the bento box that day.

392
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:55,956
You should have taste.
But there should be more...

393
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,559
Something that lies
beyond taste.

394
00:15:58,659 --> 00:15:59,760
Oooh!

395
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,995
What is this
magical‐looking rice?!

396
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,030
Whoa... Can this be...

397
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,966
...called a mere seaweed bento?!

398
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,400
Hm?!

399
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,069
(Oizumi):
Look at this beauty!

400
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,972
It's topped with some sort
of dark granules!

401
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:12,839
(Male Student 1):
The hell are those?

402
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:13,840
(Female Student 1):
Caviar, maybe?

403
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,508
(Male Student 2):
Salmon roe?

404
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:15,909
(Female Student 2):
They're so dark!

405
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,310
This is all
so mysterious...

406
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,216
And I MUST solve the mystery!
One way to find out!

407
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,920
The texture is like salmon roe
that explodes in the mouth!

408
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,123
(Oizumi):
The flavor of seaweed
bursts from within,

409
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,925
cleansing my very soul!

410
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,561
(Students):
Whoa!

411
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,863
I taste the divine
saltiness of seaweed.

412
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,365
It has bound it's deliciousness
to each grain of rice...

413
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,069
I can't take it! I could
get seriously hooked on this!

414
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,539
He was able to extract the
umami of the seaweed...

415
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,074
and used sodium alginate
and calcium chloride

416
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,577
to make granules. That
was quite inventive of him.

417
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,378
Molecular gastronomy?!

418
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,473
But that's...

419
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:54,548
...Alice's area
of specialty!

420
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:57,751
So tell me, how do you
know about that technique?

421
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,985
From Isshiki.

422
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,687
He asked me if
I wanted to help out

423
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,356
with teaching the kids'
cooking class the other day.

424
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,468
Huh?

425
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:06,426
I got along pretty
well with the children.

426
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,262
They even gave me some candy
when the class was over.

427
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,533
When I saw some of the stuff
they gave me, I remembered...

428
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:16,036
That I used to eat these when
I was just an unruly kid, too!

429
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:16,970
What are those?

430
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,004
Traditional sweets?!

431
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,273
Traditional?
I don't get it?

432
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,544
Are you kiddin' me? They call
this stuff brain fuel.

433
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:26,613
(Alice):
It contains Calcium chloride
and sodium alginate.

434
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,216
That just means you can make
artificial salmon roe with it.

435
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,486
Even made a few dishes using it.
I loved it as a kid.

436
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,256
Look what I made!
The miso soup is hard!

437
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,424
That's great!
Looks pretty cool!

438
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,527
But don't serve that
in the shop. Ever.

439
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,828
(Soma):
You see these
dark things?

440
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,397
There seaweed I've
changed up in my own way...

441
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,233
little bullets
of seaweed umami!

442
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,370
He used molecular
gastronomy...

443
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,005
through the use of candy.

444
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:55,976
Oooh... there's
something in this rice.

445
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,545
Such exquisite flavor!

446
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:02,716
(Oizumi):
He made a sweet, playful
filling using the maguro flakes!

447
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,519
This is a four‐layer rice!

448
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,254
If Alice Nakiri
gave us a jeweler box

449
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,423
of immaculate presentation,

450
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:15,862
THIS is a treasure chest of a
delight in its delicious riches!

451
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,431
I remember as a small child...

452
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,701
(Judges):
...opening the lid
of the bento box...

453
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,003
(Saotome):
...and that
feeling of elation...

454
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,739
It's all rushing back to me NOW!

455
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,875
My bento box even included
a sea bream ochazuke

456
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:29,743
for the final course.

457
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,813
In terms of overall flavor...
my bento is by far‐

458
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:34,180
Oh... please stop!

459
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,782
If you don't mind,
I need you to save

460
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,017
a third of
your rice, please.

461
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,653
(Soma):
There's another compartment
under the top layer

462
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,622
of the bento box.

463
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,724
Kudzu sauce?

464
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:46,627
That sauce includes three
times as much maguro flakes

465
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:49,362
and Rishiri Island
seaweed as normal.

466
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,498
(Soma):
I would like for you to pour
that over the hot rice.

467
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,234
Time for the final course!

468
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,836
This will most...

469
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,203
...definitely...

470
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,271
...impressively...

471
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,373
(Judges):
...be DELICIOUS!

472
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,909
OOOH! That kudzu sauce!

473
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,477
It's TOO delicious!

474
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,713
Mixing it with the
"bubbles" of seaweed...

475
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,149
...gives it a whole
new level of luscious!

476
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,384
All the judges
are wiggin' out, bro.

477
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,887
They're totally different from
when it was Alice's turn.

478
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,791
(Aoki):
It actually looks like
they're all best buds, now!

479
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:18,759
Okay, Soma...

480
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,994
Are you trying to tell me
that one must put one's

481
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,263
heart and soul
into the bento box?

482
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,999
Wouldn't you say being delicious
is a tad more important?

483
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,668
Idealism is
nothing more‐

484
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:28,434
No.

485
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,838
This is not considered
idealism at all, Alice.

486
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,173
But Grandfather!

487
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,709
When did he get naked?!

488
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,613
Look, Alice...

489
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:41,682
your bento box made
use of cold air

490
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,584
for its presentation,
correct?

491
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,452
Yes. After all, a bento box
should be served cold.

492
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,254
And that's what
most would conclude.

493
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,858
But Soma Yukihira came
to a different conclusion.

494
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,562
(Senzaemon):
First... he considered his
bento box from the outside...

495
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,731
then infused it with
a sense of flair

496
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:00,834
where HEAT was the source
of its deliciousness.

497
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,969
The result was this bento.

498
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,807
Of course, yours was remarkably
delicious as well...

499
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:09,475
But here... the difference is
that you could have served

500
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,613
the exact same thing if this
had just been a sushi battle.

501
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:13,379
What?

502
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,481
(Senzaemon):
You did nothing more
than apply your skills

503
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,584
toward the contents
of that box.

504
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:21,087
A bento box has a
special charm. It's unique.

505
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,625
This is a twist that will
advance the bento culture.

506
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,761
A sense of excitement
or newness toward bento...

507
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:31,364
(Senzaemon):
Would you say your cooking
had any of that?

508
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,498
But you're right...

509
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,267
it's still important
to taste good.

510
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,237
There's no argument
when it comes to that.

511
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,240
Your order is up...
Alice Nakiri.

512
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,013
(slurp)

513
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,415
(amazed sigh)

514
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,021
(Rich Man 1):
Ms. Alice...I trust
you're doing well.

515
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,823
Is Ms Erina
in good spirits?

516
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,025
(Rich Man 2):
Please give my
regards to Ms. Erina.

517
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,961
(Rich Guests):
Ms. Erina is...

518
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,286
(Rich Man):
Ms. Erina!

519
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:02,963
(Rich Woman):
Ms. Erina!

520
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:06,332
(Young Alice):
Father! I want to go with
you to Northern Europe!

521
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,934
Take me to your
test kitchen!

522
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:11,838
Please, I want to
go with you! I beg you!

523
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,040
The latest, most
advanced techniques...

524
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,444
I'll come up with an arsenal
that not even Erina can beat!

525
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:21,381
(Present Alice):
I cannot lose.
Not until...

526
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,884
I defeat Erina...
But...

527
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:25,752
Om, nom, nom, nom!

528
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,621
(bento‐ful moan)

529
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,022
Mmm.
Mmm.

530
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,190
Mmm.
Mmm.

531
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,392
Hand me my BRUSH!

532
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,428
(calligraphic roar)

533
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,800
(sobbing)

534
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,068
(whimpering)

535
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,471
Huh?

536
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,816
This is so warm.

537
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,552
(saucy moaning)

538
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:02,789
In the first battle of the
first round... the winner is...

539
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,993
SOMA YUKIHIRA!

540
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:07,594
You're welcome!

541
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,230
(Yuki):
All right!

542
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,132
(students cheering)

543
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:13,233
Heh.

544
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,167
Wow, Soma!

545
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:15,969
She looks devasted!

546
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,772
Well, well, Soma...

547
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:21,942
I'll say this about you...
you're a peculiar one.

548
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:56,036
You did it, Soma!
Way to go! You did so great!

549
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:56,917
(door knocking)

550
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:57,761
Huh?

551
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:59,172
(Female Stage Manager):
Your battle is about to begin.
Please be ready.

552
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,474
Oh... uh... 'kay!

553
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:05,445
Next... it's my turn!

554
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:16,623
(Narrator):
Next time:

555
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:19,560
"Interplay of Light and Shadow."
