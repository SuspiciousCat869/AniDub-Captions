1
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:13,291
[AKIRA]
The first dish holds...

2
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:16,461
a little turmeric and pink
peppers and cumin...

3
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,396
and coriander and then cloves.

4
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:23,734
The dish to the right has
amchur, cardamom, dill,
bay leaves, and savory herbs.

5
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:28,206
And the dish over to the left
has star anise, fennel,
wild yam, and lemon balm.

6
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:30,941
[JUN]
That was terrific, Akira!

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,711
Even without being able to
see or touch them...

8
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:36,046
you guessed them all 100%!

9
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:39,184
That's right.
I'm completely ready for this.

10
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,953

112... 113...

13
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:54,399
I would say it looks like you're
completely ready for this.

14
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:55,633
114...

15
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,268
Jeez, you smell
like rotten death!

16
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,504
And you're sweating
everywhere!
Uh...

17
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:02,607
[ALICE]
I wanted to ask if you'd
like to go clean my room...

18
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:04,442
but you'll have to
take a shower first!

19
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,843
[RYO] Mistress.
[ALICE] Hm?

20
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:08,846
You're in good spirits
after losing to Soma...

21
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:10,848
So maybe consider...

22
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:13,083
That is WHY you lose.

23
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:14,319
Just a thought.

24
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:17,555
Ha! That's a cheap attempt
at provoking me...

25
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:19,023
but you're on Ryo!

26
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:23,127
And please, no wimpy tears
when you get destroyed.

27
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:25,496
(Crowd cheers)

28
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:29,234
I'm gonna crush you!

29
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:31,769
Yeah? I don't feel like
I'm going to lose

30
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,438
to some glorified attendant.

31
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:34,839
I give my own orders here.

32
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,675
[SOMA]
<i>Hmmm... those two are up next.</i>

33
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:39,444
<i>I wonder what kind of bout</i>
<i>this will be...</i>

34
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:41,846
Why are you acting like you
have the right to be here?!

35
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:44,782
Well, it looked like
the bout going to start,
so I didn't have much time
to waste.

36
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:48,085
I mean, which of
them is gonna win?
[ERINA] <i>What are you doing</i>
<i>in here?! Get out of my face!</i>

37
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:50,821
This is going to be one exciting
bout to keep an eye on,
<i>Move it already! Who do you</i>
<i>think you're talking to?</i>

38
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:52,390
don't you think?
<i>You're barely even a chef!</i>

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,460
What's he? Why's he over
there with Erina Nakiri?

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,427
Huh?

41
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:57,662
[MEGUMI]
What's he doing?

42
00:01:57,762 --> 00:01:59,297
(Ikumi gasps then grunts)

43
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:01,899
[GIN]
We now enter the last
bout of the day.

44
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:04,202
As with the first round
in this semifinal,

45
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:08,138
the theme will be a dish
showcasing Western food.

46
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,407
Contestants...

47
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,843
LET THE COOKING BEGIN!

48
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:16,046
(Crowd cheers)

49
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:54,111
Dude! Look who's pulled out
his ingredients.

50
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:55,513
Is that a chicken?

51
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,882
It's not... That's...

52
00:03:57,982 --> 00:03:59,250
...a duck!

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,486
[SONOKA]
Duck has a distinctive
flavor to it.

54
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:04,522
How you temper that is key to
the outcome of the dish.

55
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:07,458
That's the "scent expert,"
Akira Hayama, huh?

56
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:10,261
That fool sure knows how to
play up his strengths all right.

57
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,163
Lets see what he
offers up to us.

58
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:15,099
A chef's taste buds should
draw on his past experiences.

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,802
What he can make
depends on those factors.

60
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:20,171
Yes. If, along with
a refined palate,

61
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:22,807
one could also distinguish
between the scents
of mixed spices

62
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:26,911
they would double their
culinary expertise and
become unstoppable...

63
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,147
[GIN]
<i>He has a sense of smell</i>
<i>like no other...</i>

64
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:33,318
<i>and he's studied at Tohtsuki</i>
<i>Academy since his first year</i>
<i>in middle school.</i>

65
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:35,953
<i>Akira Hayama is definitely</i>
<i>one of the elites.</i>

66
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:39,957
<i>One of the candidates</i>
<i>likely to succeed</i>
<i>Erina Nakiri on The Ten.</i>

67
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:41,726
We know where
this is going.

68
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:45,062
Yeah. No question,
it's most definitely
gonna go to Akira, huh?

69
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:51,035
[SOMA]
You know, rumor has it that
Akira totally has the advantage
for today's semifinal bout.

70
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,371
What do you think, Erina?

71
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:55,340
Yes, well...

72
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,009
I have been in a few of the same
cooking classes as Ryo before.

73
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:00,845
Even if I was being
kind about it all,

74
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:03,814
I couldn't say the food he put
out was all that interesting.

75
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:07,285
I wouldn't really
rank it up there as
a total failure per se,

76
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:09,654
it just seemed
kinda perfunctory.

77
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:12,923
Like he was just doing enough to
fulfill the class requirements.

78
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:18,028
That's why I was so surprised
to see the originality of his
food in the preliminaries.

79
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:21,432
Oh, you are always
so clueless, Erina.
(Gasp)

80
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:23,634
[ALICE]
Hmph! If you'll excuse me.

81
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:24,869
(Grunt)

82
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:26,371
If you really wanna
know the truth.

83
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,873
Ryo's abilities can't be
measured through logic.

84
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:31,709
(Crowd gasps)
[BOY] Is he using eel?!

85
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:35,045
Is he for real?
I heard seafood was
his main specialty,

86
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,382
but this is an
unexpected turn.

87
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:40,050
Could it be...
a Kabayaki?

88
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,253
After all...
the theme is Western.

89
00:05:42,353 --> 00:05:43,921
Eel is used in
several recipes,

90
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,624
not just French but
other high‐end cuisines
around the world.

91
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:49,627
It's not found just in
Japanese food anymore .

92
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:54,232
[ERINA]
<i>Eel. Could he possibly</i>
<i>be going for it?</i>

93
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:57,402
Say, what did you mean before
about the whole logic thing?

94
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,805
How is Ryo's food
measured exactly?
(Alice giggles)

95
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:04,575
For YOU to start talking
philosophical jargon...
is insane.

96
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:08,146
Your whole doctrine
when it comes to cooking
is based on science and logic.

97
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:10,648
There's nothing philosophical
about Ryo's cooking.

98
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:13,218
In a very real sense, there's
something about the taste

99
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:16,987
of Ryo's cooking that transcends
the usual measure of logic.

100
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,589
[YOUNG RYO]
<i>I have to win...</i>

101
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:22,927
<i>If I don't, I'll have</i>
<i>nowhere I can say I belong!</i>

102
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:27,365
<i>Here, today,</i>
<i>either I win or die!</i>

103
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,468
[ALICE]
Ryo has made it through kitchens

104
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:34,038
that were more like the pits
of hell than an actual kitchens.

105
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:35,473
In such terrible environments...

106
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:37,842
the only thing he could
rely on was his skill.

107
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:41,612
In order to survive, Ryo
cultivated absolute attention

108
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:44,182
toward perfecting the most
difficult of flavors...

109
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:47,051
And he did so with an
all‐consuming fighting spirit

110
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:48,353
that burns from within!

111
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:50,321
Everyday it's always there...

112
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:52,890
Ryo and I constantly wage
culinary wars with each other.

113
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,659
And yet not a single
day has gone by

114
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,094
that he hasn't given it
everything he's got.

115
00:06:57,195 --> 00:07:00,831
Once he gets a taste of
victory, it's over.

116
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,967
It makes me think...

117
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:05,170
If there's one thing I'm lacking
when it comes to competition...

118
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,272
I'd say it would be...
(Erina gasps)
[SOMA] Hm?

119
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,106
[ALICE]
Hmh? Oh, nevermind.

120
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:12,943
<i>[ALICE]</i>
<i>If there's something</i>
<i>I lack about competing...</i>

121
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:14,812
<i>it would be tenacity.</i>

122
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:17,415
<i>A tenacity that burns</i>

<i>absolute hottest is Ryo.</i>

That knife is specially
designed to break down eel.
Masterfully done.

126
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,363
Has he mastered the techniques
of Japanese cooking, as well?

Hmph...

134
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,682
This is a battlefield down here!

135
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:54,719
Anyone who isn't prepared to win
should get out while they can!

136
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,287
Quite possibly.

And you may be right
about one thing.

138

I do have less of
an imperative to win.

00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:30,020
coriander and fennel, oregano,
and I don't know what
that is.. um...

152
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,691
Ah! It's so complex
that I can't get IT!

153
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,196
How could he have possibly
created such a splendid aroma
from such a young chef?

154
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,831
Spicy yet mellow
at the same time.

155
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,533
And rich though slightly sweet.

156
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,870
Soon he'll show us who is
the real king in the
kitchen around here.

157
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,774
This time and place
belongs to the god of AROMA!

158
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:50,941
(Crowd cheers)

159
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,343
[TAKI]
Hm? The heck's up with him?

160
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:54,379
What happened to the drive
he had a minute ago?

161
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,080
Perhaps the cheers
for his opponent

162
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:58,015
have driven him to
withdraw a bit?

163
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,984
He doesn't even hear
any of those cheers.

164
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:03,988
Right now, Ryo's senses
are focused purely on
the sear of his protein

165
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:05,756
and the sound of
the fat as it pops.

166
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,593
He's only taking in
what lies in that frying pan.

167
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,761
Measuring the weight of
the eel as it cooks.

<i>Now! It's done!</i>

173
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:25,109
Sure enough, Ryo looks to be
going with a matelote.

174
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,944
What's a Matelote?

175
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:29,914
It's a way of cooking fish by
simmering it in a wine sauce.
Ohhh...

176
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:33,218
[SOMA]
Wait up!? Didn't he already
break down that eel before?

177
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:34,985
Why's he putting it
back together?

178
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:37,121
That was after
he wrapped it.

179
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:40,191
He's cooked it after
encasing it in crepine
to restore its natural shape.

180
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,092
Hey isn't crepine caul fat,

181
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:44,795
that netting that's around
the stomach of animals
like cows and sheep?

182
00:09:44,895 --> 00:09:47,465
[ALICE]
Yes. The fat adds
more depth of flavor

183
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:49,367
and gives the dish
a definite impact.

184
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:52,237
This dish is an
old classic for Ryo.

No matter how much you
play up the aroma

190
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:11,989
and use it like some kinda
lame performance art...

191
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,158

I have some aces up
my own sleeve, as well.

Also, it doesn't matter
what cards you're holding

for you have to know how to use
them to their fullest extent!

Usually Akira's so calm, but...

199
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,609
...he's like a whole
different person.

200
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,412
To this point there's been
no need to bear his claws,

201
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:36,447
but now they're fully extended.

202

Akira is the first
to unveil his dish!

I present to you a duck Apicius.

[SONOKA &amp; TAKI]
Oh!

209
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:58,336
It's an ancient Roman dish...

210
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:00,805
favored by the Roman
gourmand Marcus Apicius.

211

[HINAKO]
The caramelized honey seems to
glisten vibrantly...

212
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,645
...and the spices coating
the duck's surface
give off their own aroma.

213

The aroma is
captivating my senses.

214

So, what happens
when I taste this?!

the juiciness of the eel
even more pronounced.

From the lack of aroma,
this is by far the loser.

the battle should be
temporarily shelved

later date. You're thoughts?

In the past, it was
considered an inferior fish

appropriate to eat.

have been serving it.

00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:53,218
What?

451
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,785
I'm continuing on,

452
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:56,587
my plans to make it to
the finals and gain victory

453
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:58,956
have been not been
affected in the slightest.

454
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:00,658
[RYO]
Ha! Our bout ended in a draw

455
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,893
and you're still trying to act
like you've got a chance,

456
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:04,495
you spice‐loving pretty boy?!

457
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:07,532
You're nothing but a one‐trick
pony who's only good at spices.

458
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:10,601
Remember I've seen your
whole deck of cards ponytail.

459
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,537
I'll get you next time.

460
00:23:12,637 --> 00:23:14,439
You too, Soma Yukihira!

461
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:16,774
[ALICE]
What are you doing you goof?

462
00:23:16,874 --> 00:23:18,476
We're going home.

463
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:19,510
Yeah...

464
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,845
If you'll excuse us.

465
00:23:20,945 --> 00:23:22,313
[RYO]
Good job, guys.

466
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,249
[AKIRA]
Well look who suddenly
lost his conviction!

467
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:27,885
[SOMA]
I can't follow that
change in intensity...

468
00:23:27,985 --> 00:23:29,320
[AKIRA]
See you later, Soma.

469
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,023
Have fun, while you still can.

470
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:35,226
Uh Mistress, can I challenge
you to a food battle

471
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,927
when we get back home?

472
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:38,229
Huh?

473
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:40,431
I'm still pretty amped up
after all that...

474
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:42,633
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
till the finals.

475
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,702
[AKIRA]
<i>Hm. He thinks I'm only</i>
<i>good at spices.</i>

476
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:47,472
[GIRL]
Today's semifinals
were awesome to watch!

477
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:48,406
(Gasp)

478
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:49,474
Huh?

479
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:50,908
(Girls gasp)

480
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:53,811
[AKIRA]
<i>Fine. I'll show you,</i>
<i>Ryo Kurokiba.</i>

481
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:58,416
<i>You'll know the true</i>
<i>world of enticing aroma!</i>

482
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:00,585
[SOMA]
<i>The finals, huh?</i>

483
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:03,221
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>I've finally made it here.</i>

484
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:06,724
<i>No, I'm just getting started.</i>

485
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:08,159
<i>Guess I'll go check it out...</i>

486
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:11,162
<i>the best view from</i>
<i>a place higher than this!</i>

487
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:17,868
