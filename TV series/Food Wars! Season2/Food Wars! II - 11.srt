00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:06,234
[SOMA]
What do you think?
Two kinds of omelet wraps.

2
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:09,371
Mmm...
This one has chili sauce, and
the other has a basil sauce.

3
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:12,541
Whatever, I could make these
way better than this.

4
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:13,708
What?!

5
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:15,610
All you two ever do is eat.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,111
[SOMA]
So, Professor Shiomi...

7
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:19,848
This thing you mentioned...
the "Stagiaire".

8
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:20,982
What is it exactly?

9
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:22,584
Stagiaire is French for
"trainee."

10
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:25,186
So basically you're all going to
be helping out somewhere.

11
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,288
[JUN]
It's part of your
curriculum here.

12
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:30,692
All first years are sent
to train at different food
establishments.

13
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:35,263
Places can range from
high‐class restaurants
to food manufacturers...

14
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:37,732
Really all areas
of the public sector.

15
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:41,135
It's part of your studies,
a chance to learn what it's
really like on the job.

16
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:43,104
This will be
a piece of cake.

17
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:44,639
Even among all those pros,

18
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:47,776
I doubt there are many who can
do what I can in a kitchen.

19
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:50,044
It's not as simple
as that, Ryo!

20
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:51,646
[JUN]
Other things are at play...

21
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,247
Each location has
specifically asked

22
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:55,049
to take in Tohtsuki's students.

23
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:56,851
So if you think about
causing problems

24
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:58,387
and tainting the
Tohtsuki name...

25
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:01,390
know that some students have
been expelled on the spot!

26
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,093
<i>Of course they were.</i>
<i>That's how this</i>
<i>school is operated.</i>

27
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:07,696
<i>So I'll be working</i>
<i>in a foreign kitchen...</i>

28
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:10,532
<i>That means I can get exposure</i>
<i>to the outside world!</i>

29
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:13,902
So if we complete our work
without causing any problems,

30
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,737
then we should be
in the clear.

31
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:17,305
Again not so easy...

32
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:20,041
the basis for passing is to
leave a "visible accomplishment"

33
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:21,810
during your training period.

34
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,514
We need a visible
accomplishment?

35
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:28,082
(Crowd chatter)

36
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:29,317
[SOMA]
Let's see...

37
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:31,520
We're supposed to be
working in pairs.

38
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,655
I wonder who my partner is.

39
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:35,256
(Thud)
Mm?

40
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:36,057
Huh?

41
00:01:36,157 --> 00:01:38,693
(Dumbfounded whimper)

42
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:40,962
It can't be you...

43
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:42,431

44
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:43,932
(Opening song)

45
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,427
[SOMA]
Well, let's do
our best, Miss Secretary!

46
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:20,128
Don't call me that,
you jerk!

47
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:22,831
I have no intention of
working with you at all.

48
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,366
So you just need
to back off of me!

49
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,234
I'll complete this
thing on my own!

50
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:27,836
Do as you please.

51
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:29,504
I wonder what kind
of place this is.

52
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:31,606
It's a bit exciting,
don't you think?

53
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:33,041
Don't ever speak to me!

54
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:34,643
[SOMA]
If Tohtsuki is bothering
to send us here,

55
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:37,078
it must be some super
luxurious restaurant!

56
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:39,080
[HISAKO]
Are you even
listening to me?!

57
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,349
[SOMA]
Really?

58
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,317
Well it's not quite
what I imagined.

[CUSTOMERS]
I don't have all day!

00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:48,757

[BOTH]
Hm?

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,703
(Laughs) Looks like you
caught me at a bad time.

Um, I'm the owner Mitamura...
Welcome aboard, guys.

Nice to meet you.

00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,343
My name is Hisako Arato,

00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:11,045
and I'm here for the week.
Pleasure to be your stagiaire.

72
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:16,017
I'm sure I have little to
offer your restaurant, but I'm
grateful for the opportunity.

73
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,852
I'm Soma Yukihira.

It's a pleasure.

Well, sorry to get right
to it, but, uh...

00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:28,863
could I maybe please
get your autographs?

79
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:29,798
Huh?

80
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:31,032
I mean, come on!

81
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:33,034
You're students
of THE Tohtsuki Academy!

82
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:35,269
You could go on to
become superstar top‐chefs

83
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,238
known throughout
the entire world!

me of someone...

Hey, Soma!

[HISAKO]
He's mistaken...

87
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,179
I'm not the kind of chef
anyone would be proud of.

any manners?! (Growls)

[SOMA]
Whatever...

93
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:57,359
Feels pretty weird
to be wearing anything

94
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,828
other than my
Yukihira apron.

95
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:01,396

Y'know, that apron
really suits your style.

Hey, this is the first time

100
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,373
we've been able to
talk like this, huh?

101
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,742
I mean, you're always
hanging around with Erina.

102
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:15,444
Uh?
Oh, yeah!

103
00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:17,211
Next time when you see her,
will do me a favor‐

104
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:18,747
That won't happen.
Huh?

105
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:22,216
There won't ever be a next
time for Erina and I.

106
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:24,819
Having failed her
in the Fall Selection,

107
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,088
I don't have that right.

108
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:29,924
Oh yeah, you lost
to Akira, didn't you?

Shut up, you little punk!

110
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:35,497
[HISAKO]
Miss Erina is the embodiment
of perfection in all she does.

111
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:38,467
She can't have a loser like me
to be at her side...

112
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,470
it would lessen Miss Erina's
reputation.

113
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,404
(Sigh)

114
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:44,673
Stop standing around.

that commotion earlier.

All right! Let's do
our best today.

Hisako, for starters,
will you‐

119
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:58,520
Don't you dare
order me around!

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,889
Listen! You may have
experience in the kitchens,

121
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:02,223
but don't put on airs!

122
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:04,058
I've taken courses
on forming teams

and cooking in
an assembly.

Plus, I easily cleared
that 200 speed challenge

The Stagiaire will be
no problem for me!

I understand
that, but...

128
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:18,006
those situations don't involve
multiple random orders
coming at you all at once.

Yep. I've already
made some headway.

314
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:56,805
Oh. Great.
Carry on.

315
00:12:58,072 --> 00:13:00,842
<i>This restaurant needs</i>
<i>to make some changes?</i>

316
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:02,777
<i>Just what is that</i>
<i>supposed to mean?</i>

317
00:13:02,877 --> 00:13:04,413
<i>I don't get it.</i>

318
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:05,647
I get the feeling that things

319
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:08,049
aren't really going
very well, are they?

320
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,385
Hmph!

321
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,020
What does he
know anyway?

322
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,021
See there?

323
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:14,656
Ever since we've
been working here,

324
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:16,324
the sales are going up
and complaints are‐

325

(Gasp)

326
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,160
This isn't good...

327
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,363
So once we leave here...

328
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:22,731
[SOMA]
Yup.
(Gasp)

329
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:24,198
Things will go right
back to how they were

330
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:25,334
before we arrived.

331
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:26,501
Uh?!

332
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:28,236
Maybe they could
keep things running,

333
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:30,171
if they got a few temp
workers to help them out

334
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:31,806
around the busiest times.

335
00:13:31,906 --> 00:13:34,175
But I doubt it would be
a permanent fix for them.

336
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,544
Hm...

337
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:37,579
Maybe things are fine as they
are...

338
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,713
Ahhhhhh!

339

emergency meeting!

Hah?

347
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:07,041
[MALE STAFF]
We should go looking for
some more part‐timers.

348
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:09,077
We need to get some
workers lined up down here

349
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,179
before these two have to
leave us and go back.

350
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,882
Agreed. But do you think
we'll be able to find people

351
00:14:13,982 --> 00:14:15,684
who can fill
that void so easily?

352
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:16,985
[MALE STAFF 2]
Oh...

353
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:19,621
May I? Maybe pare
down the menu.

(Gasps)

355
00:14:21,155 --> 00:14:24,125
Having so many dishes can
end up being a hindrance.

356
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,928
If you print a new menu,
leaving just the popular items‐

357
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:29,130
I can't do it! Some of
those recipes have been here

[FEMALE STAFF]
Now listen...

361
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:35,770
You two have been
a really big help

362
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,305
since you've been
here, but c'mon...

363
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:39,741
You can't just change
things... not this.

364
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:43,177
Some of us have been working
here all the way back to the
previous owner.

365
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:46,515
If we changed the menu,
it wouldn't be Mitamura
anymore.

366
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:47,949
(Sigh)

367
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,419
Isn't that doing a
disservice to the customer?

368
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,787
They specifically chose to
come to this restaurant.

369
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:57,626
Whether the food is delicious
or not doesn't matter if you
can't even serve it, right?

00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:58,660

[SOMA]
Mitamura...

Huh?

373
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:03,264
What kind of place do
you want this to be?

374
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:04,633
Uh...

375
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:08,970
[SOMA]
Please... There's something
I'd like you to hear...

376
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,740
[MEGUMI]
Excuse me! Um...
What do you want?!

377
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,375
I discovered something
that I think might help

378
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:16,345
improve the fish salad you're
serving for the second course.

379
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,146
Now YOU'VE got something?!

380
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,681
Just go back to
washin' dishes!

381
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:22,016
Ah! Okay!
I'm sorry! Aaaah!

382
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:24,419
It's fine. You may
go ahead and speak.

383
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,020
(Grumbling)

384
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,590
It's just, uh, I was thinking
it would be better

385
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,960
if the customers had the
chance to choose the amount
of sauce they wanted.

386
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,995
Looking at all the dishes
that come back...

387
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:36,398
I'm seeing a lot
of leftover sauce.

388
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:39,300
But on the other hand,
when customers sop it
up using the bread...

389
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,003
there ends up being a few
more leftover vegetables.

390
00:15:42,103 --> 00:15:43,672
<i>Well isn't she something?</i>

391
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,775
<i>She was able to</i>
<i>improve things just</i>
<i>by washing dishes.</i>

392
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,777
Still, it might be
too hard to fix.

393
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:52,146
I'm sure it would cause more
traffic in the kitchen
and in front‐of‐house.

394
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:53,314
No it wouldn't.

395
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:55,384
We could always just place
the sauce in a saucer

396
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:56,618
and serve it that way.

397
00:15:56,718 --> 00:15:57,819
It's a widely popular
serving technique

398
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,187
throughout France.

399
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:01,222
Though it's known as a
traditional method...

400
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:03,525
it could be seen as
something fresh and
new with customers.

401
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,360
Enough of this nonsense!

402
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,962
Don't forget, customers
are here for MY food!

403
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:09,297
Who cares how much
sauce they get?

404
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:11,500
[WAITER]
Um, Chef!
What now?

405
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,769
One of our customers
is asking for more sauce
for her fish course.

Thank you for
choosing Mitamura!

[MITAMURA]
You want it to be
reservation only?!

410
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:35,457
You already know
your food is delicious.

411
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:36,958
There's no doubt about that.

412
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:38,893
You have a refined touch,

413
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:41,596
and the extensive menu leaves
customers satisfied.

414
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:42,964
But things change.

415
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:44,966
Your situation is different
than it was before.

416
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:47,168
And it's putting a dent
in how good this place is.

417
00:16:47,268 --> 00:16:50,038
So I thought this might be an
option that could work for you.

00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:52,841
[SOMA]
Though I do feel bad for the
people off the street.

419
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:55,176
So you think
reservation only?

420
00:16:55,276 --> 00:16:57,078
It's easy enough
to implement...

421
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,080
but do you think it'll
go over well?

422
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,915
There would be a pretty
big risk of us

423
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:02,784
potentially losing
all of our new customers.

424
00:17:02,884 --> 00:17:05,286
[FEMALE STAFF]
We've always done things
the same way around here...

425
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,989
I don't know about suddenly
changing everything.

426
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,758
[HISAKO]
Your situation has
changed though.

427
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:13,294
You need change as well,
or the avenues open to you
will be closed.

428
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:16,365
If there really is a way for
you to achieve something...

429
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,567
then you need to set your pride
aside and latch onto it.

430
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:22,303
I think this restaurant
has outstanding potential.

431
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:23,538
But you have to...

432
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:25,374
You have to believe
in yourself.

433
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:30,812
[SOMA]
Well, in any case,
it's not up to us.

434
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:32,847
That's for the guy at the top.

435

That would be you.

you want to achieve?

Sure. I'm just sorry
it's been so long.

Your place just seemed
so busy all the time

"Thank you very much."

466
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,597
"Please come again,
Glad you enjoyed"!

467
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:57,466
Hm?
Don't go being original!

468
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:02,704
You two have passed
Stagiaire No.1.

469
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:03,872
What?

470
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:05,707
I have no complaints
with your work.

471
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:07,208
Thank you so
very much, ma'am.

472
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:09,578
How was she watching
us this whole time?

473
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:11,012
Tohtsuki is
pretty awesome.

474
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:12,614
You should be receiving papers

475
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:15,249
for your next training
assignment tomorrow morning.

476
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,285
I hope you perform well.

477
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:20,121
(Chuckle)

478
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:21,456
Hey, by the way,

479
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:23,692
you plan on goin' back
to Erina soon, right?

480
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:24,659
Agghhh!

481
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,761
Um, what's with you?

482
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,096
You need to
lighten up already.

483
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:30,699
[SOMA]
At least hear me out.

484
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,972
<i>I'm all nervous!</i>

485
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:39,808
<i>Why'd this have to happen?</i>

486
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:42,310
That is an unusual
amount of luggage.

487
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:44,012
Go ahead and get in
if you can fit.

488
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:45,380
(Nervous sigh)

489
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,315
There's something
I don't quite get.

490
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,784
How has someone of
your caliber gone
unnoticed till now?

491
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,421
<i>I‐I can't take all</i>
<i>this attention!</i>

492
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:54,088
(Nervous sigh)

493
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:57,492
So how were your grades
whenever you advanced
to the high school division?

494
00:19:57,592 --> 00:20:00,261
Um, the truth is,
they were pretty
below average...

495
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:03,031
<i>I can't tell her they were the</i>
<i>absolute worst in the school!</i>

496
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:06,468
[MEGUMI]
But you know, it wasn't just
me that turned things around.

497
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:09,070
I needed help making it
through training camp.

498
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,172
And competing in
the Fall Selection...

499
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:12,974
well that was thanks
to my dorm mates.

500
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:15,944
They were a huge help.
And then of course Soma
was always there for me.

501
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:17,178
Uh!

502
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,147
The first time I saw
Soma I stayed away.

503
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:20,482
I thought he was
nothing but trouble

504
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:22,283
and should be avoided
at all costs...

505
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:24,353
But before I knew it,
we'd become friends.

506
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:27,221
Do not ever mention
his name around me
ever again!

507
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:29,057
(Grunting)
Ah! I'm so sorry!

508
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:31,893
<i>Why does talking about</i>
<i>Soma upset her so much?</i>

509
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:33,895
By the way, where is Hisako?

510
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:35,764
I'm used to her
always being with you.

511
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:36,931
(Sigh)

512
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:39,368
Wh‐what did I say?
Are you all right?

513
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:41,770
<i>Hisako...</i>

514
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,937
[YOUNG ERINA]
Come on, Hisako.

515
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:46,040
The cherry blossoms
are so pretty!

516
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,409
(Laughing)

517
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:50,178
Aw, come over here
and spin around with me!

518
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:52,180
I couldn't possibly
do that.

519
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,049
I must always stand
behind you, Miss Erina.

520
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:57,486
For I am here as your attendant.

521
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:58,720
Hmm...

522
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,590
[ERINA]
<i>Hisako, back then,</i>

523
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,360
<i>all I really wanted</i>
<i>you to do... was...</i>

524
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,562
[HISAKO]
Pitiful, isn't it?

525
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:09,964
I still don't have
enough confidence.

526
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:13,234
I think up till now, I've always
been perfectly at ease...

527
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:16,571
Content to walk behind
Miss Erina forever.

528
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:19,574
I never thought I was worthy of
being able to do anything else.

529
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:22,944
(Yawn) So, what're
you worried about now?

530
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:24,479
Were you even listening to me?!

531
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,147
I was, and the
answer is easy.

532
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,817
From now on, don't just
stand behind Erina...

533
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:33,955
You should think more
of yourself and stand and
walk at her side instead.

534
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:35,089
(Gasp)

535
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:37,359
Don't forget,
I lost to Akira too.

536
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:40,128
But one day,
I'm gonna knock the
wind outta his sails!

537
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:41,563
You got that?

538
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:42,497
It's just that...

539
00:21:42,597 --> 00:21:44,232
I feel that having
lost just once,

540
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,767
I don't have
that right again.

is a way for you to

pride aside and
latch onto it."

543
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:52,707
You know you
said that yourself?

544
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:54,443
Oh, I almost forgot.

545
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:56,445
These belong to
someone in my dorm.

546

to borrow them.

[SOMA]
I promised Erina
she could read them,

549
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:04,318
but never had a
chance to go over there.

550
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:05,987
But this'll
be perfect.

551
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:08,923
Now I don't have
to go... Sweet.

I'm counting on you, girl.

Don't go quitting on me, okay?

554
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:18,533
Soma, I'm...
I'm very honored.
