The Stagiaire: a mandatory
curriculum requiring

2
00:00:06,584 --> 00:00:10,888
the student to leave a
"visible accomplishment" at the
venue of a professional chef.

3
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:13,758
It is a trial by fire that has
now reached a fever pitch.

4
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:17,195
[ABEL]
No, no, NO! That's not the
right timing for a suer!

5
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:18,329
Just watch.

6
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:19,764
You want to take your time,

7
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:23,268
cooking slowly to get a
"sweat" off the vegetables.

00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,371
[ABEL]
See there? Don't forget what the
surface of these looks like.

[SOMA]
Man, this French cooking

11
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:30,175
is pretty interesting.

12
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:31,942
The thinking seems
completely different

13
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:34,345
from everything I know about
traditional Japanese cooking.

14
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:38,082
That's true enough.
Japanese cuisine has a
strong "hands‐off" approach,

15
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:40,385
keeping the ingredients
they use close to rare,

16
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:44,155
but French cooking takes
a lot of time and energy
to treat the ingredients.

17
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:48,393
Even making a simple fish
stock can take a lot of
time and effort to perfect.

18
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:51,896
It's the opposite of katsuo
fish flakes used in Japan...
What is it?

19
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:56,000
It's just... You really go
into a lot of detail when
it comes to cooking, dontcha?

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,669
Well it's your fault for
not knowing the basics
of French cuisine!

21
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,937
Don't you get that yet?!

22

Oh, hey there, Soma...

23
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:02,807
you've memorized the recette

24
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:04,041
for today's fish dish,
haven't you?

25
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,711
Right!
No problem, ma'am.

26

[LUCIE]
So, Soma... About tonight...

27
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:13,017
have you decided on what
you'll make for the competition?

28
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:15,720
Yeah, I've got a general idea
of what I want to do...

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,788
but it's not quite there yet.

30
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:19,790
I assume you're prepared.

Are there any plans
for a third site?

That's a bit
ambitious for me.

41
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:19,944
I want SHINO'S Tokyo to
be famous AND be on par

That's the first step
for us to take.

running late tonight.

Table 5 first instead.

little early on the last day.

for the night yet.

00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:49,647
I'll be fine on my own.

154
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:51,716
Don't go makin' a fool of
your helpless mother.

155
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:53,451
Please be careful.

156
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,285
Honey...

157
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:55,920
That was really fantastic.

158
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,888
Hmm.
(Chuckles)

159
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:04,662
Now then...

160
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:06,096
A competition?!

161
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:07,632
There's no way I can miss that!

162
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:09,634
It really is lucky
I could make it today!

163
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,002
I'm telling you I don't want
you here, so you need to leave!

164
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:15,573
How could I possibly leave after
you've told me about this?!
Don't be cruel!

165
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:18,809
Oh come on, Kojiro, it's only
natural she would feel this way.

166
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:21,279
I heard that Soma will be
competing for a dish, as well.

167
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,047
I want to watch too.
Ugh!

168
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:24,415
I see!

169
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,083
This will be the first time
Kojiro gets to have

170
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:28,386
a one‐on‐one battle
with Soma again!

171
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:31,622
It's a revenge match for the
Food War back at training camp!

172
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:35,593
Huh? A Food War took place
at the training camp?

173
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:36,627
Huh?

174
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,263
Um... Yeah I personally
have no idea

175
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:39,864
what she's talking about,
Master Chapelle.

176
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:42,467
I think she's probably just
drunk and confused, sir.

177
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,735
She is known for
drinking too much!

178
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:45,903
(Laughing)

179
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:46,871
(Muffled screaming)
As you say.

180
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,038
Hm...

181
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,275
A Tohtsuki observer...

182
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,511
So... the food that Soma
Yukihira puts out...

183
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,181
I guess will determine whether
he passes the Stagiaire or not.

184
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,384
Well now... These conditions
are a bit harsh, aren't they?

185
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:02,787
Yes. Tohtsuki is known
for difficult tasks.

186
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:06,491
Still, students are taught
ze basics of French cooking
in middle school...

187
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,659
but he lacks having
zat experience.

188
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,263
He was quite apt at
replicating the French
recipe from my lecture...

189
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,632
and was able to pass
Kojiro's recette challenge

190
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,767
presented to him
at ze training camp...

191
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:20,938
But creating a new menu item
from scratch is an entirely
different story.

192
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:24,409
[CHAPELLE]
What's more frightening is zat
he will be judged by ZAT man.

193
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:25,543
Huh?

194
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:28,346
Hey there, Wei,
are you competing too?
I am.

195
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:31,449
She was the meat manager at the
main "SHINO'S" restaurant

196
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,184
up until about six months ago.

197
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,619
Oh, yeah? Really?

198
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,321
Why'd she go back
to service manager?

199
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:38,223
Well, these competitions
have been going on

200
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:40,325
at the main restaurant
a couple times a month.

201
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:43,428
You see, I've been competing
for 2 years in these battles,

202
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:44,995
but my dish has
only been used once.

203
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:48,233
[WEI]
I thought to myself,
"This just won't do..."

204
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,435
So I went into being
the service manager

205
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,503
thinking that if I dealt
with the customers directly

206
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:55,506
I might get some good menu
ideas from them.

207
00:09:55,606 --> 00:10:00,745
Don't worry... not one day has
gone by that I haven't practiced
my culinary kung fu.

208
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,112
Same here.

209
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:03,581
I didn't become
the meat manager

210
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:05,916
just because Wei stepped
aside and let me in...

211
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:07,885
and I will prove that tonight.

212
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:11,256
That's how serious everyone
takes this tonight.

213
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:12,823
The competition, that is.

214
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:16,361
Do you have that level
of resolve within you?

215
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:25,303
When I heard Chef Kojiro's
story before, I caught a
brief glimpse of something.

216
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:28,873
And now, all I can think,
is how to make it a reality.

217
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:32,443
You can talk about "resolve"
and all that business...

218
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:36,347
But I'm here to turn my idea
into something great!

219
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:39,717
The time has come now.

220
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:40,951
Begin cooking!

221
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:43,288
Oui, Chef Kojiro!

222
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:45,122
<i>Heat a mixture of</i>
<i>honey and sugar...</i>

223
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:49,527
<i>then once it's reached</i>
<i>a dark color, add Madeira</i>
<i>and red wines.</i>

224
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,829
<i>Then add fond de veau,</i>
<i>and let it simmer.</i>

225
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:55,666
<i>Meanwhile, sauté the</i>
<i>ground chicken in butter</i>
<i>and suer the onions.</i>

226
00:10:58,436 --> 00:10:59,770
(Sizzling)

227
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,140
Say, uh, why do you
cook the fish like that?

228
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:07,545
Hm? Well because doing
it this way will make
the skin nice and crispy.

229
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:10,848
Huh. I've never seen
that technique.

230
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:13,251
There sure is a lot to learn
from an eatery!

231
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,985
Hmm...

232
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:16,221
What?

233
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:19,457
Nothing...
That'll do for now, Soma.

234
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:22,560
[ISSHIKI]
Would you mind telling me,
young Soma?

235
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,530
Where did you happen to learn
your French cooking techniques?

236
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,765
From my dad. He's my mentor.

237
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:29,600
He taught me how
to cook like this.

238
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,070
He said it's perfect for making
fish nice and crispy.

239
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,839
<i>Now I get it.</i>

240
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:36,741
<i>All the things my dad</i>
<i>ever learned...</i>

241
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:40,110
<i>He combined all of it.</i>
<i>Everything.</i>

242
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:41,846
<i>All those experiences...</i>

243
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:43,281
<i>All those cultures...</i>

244
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:44,382
<i>All the techniques...</i>

245
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,184
<i>And all the emotions...</i>

246
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:48,253
<i>He used them to realize</i>
<i>his dream:</i>

247
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:50,621
<i>the dream of the</i>
<i>perfect eatery!</i>

248
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:54,058
<i>So what I have to do now is...</i>

249
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:57,027
<i>Poêlée, suer,</i>

250
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:58,796
<i>allumette, escalope,</i>

251
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,265
<i>déglace, ciselé,</i>

252
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:02,032
<i>rôti, braiser.</i>

00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:05,970
(Pained grunts)

254
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,439
(Heavy breaths)

255
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,378
Urgh! AHHHH!

256
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:17,715
(Heavy exhale)

257
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:20,251
<i>I'll take the person</i>
<i>that I've been...</i>

(Slow exhale)

261
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:44,409
Thank you, that concludes the
tasting of all your dishes.

262

[HINAKO]
Lucie... Wei... and Abel...

263
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:50,181
Yo, Soma!
You're the last one up!

264
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,082
You done cooking yet?

265
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:58,823
I'm sorry for the wait.

00:12:58,923 --> 00:12:59,624

He cooked a whole quail!

270
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:08,799
Mmm. Such aroma!

271
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,702
Soma Yukihira,
just what is that dish?

272
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:15,673
Uh, yeah, well, it's
called an oyako‐don.

273
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:16,474
Huh?

274
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:17,808
Oyako‐don?

275
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:18,776
Huh?!

276

[SOMA]
Oh, well I guess I, uh...

277
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:22,280
I didn't put it in
a bowl though, did I?

278
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,582
Still, please give it a try.

279
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:27,452
[SOMA]
I haven't learned ALL
the French techniques yet...

280
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:29,154
This is what I know so far.

281
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,821
<i>Quail meat...</i>

282
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:33,023
<i>Usually served in French</i>
<i>and Italian restaurants...</i>

283
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:36,060
<i>but is also known to be a</i>
<i>staple of household cooking.</i>

284
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:39,264
<i>It certainly looks like</i>
<i>French cuisine, but...</i>

285
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:40,698
<i>...an oyako‐don?</i>

286
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:43,033
<i>Is it the combination</i>
<i>of quail and poached egg</i>

287
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,335
<i>that makes it 'oyako'?</i>

288
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:46,904
<i>Just what exactly</i>
<i>are you up to, Soma?</i>

289
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,039
Very well,
now to begin the tasting.

290
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,109
<i>Everyzing rests on what</i>
<i>lies on zat plate.</i>

291
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,780
<i>Will he be able to impress</i>
<i>the highly placed taste</i>
<i>buds of Chef Kojiro?</i>

292
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,549
<i>Can Soma grasp the extent</i>
<i>of what he's up against?</i>

293
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,887
<i>Does he know the true</i>
<i>intent of the Stagiaire</i>
<i>that he is playing in?</i>

294
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:06,257
(All gasp)

295
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,499
Aaahhh...
(Grunting)

296
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,367
I'm having some too!

297
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,568
This is...

298
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:19,103
He filled it with egg...

299
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:21,038
and even risotto!

300
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:27,745
<i>It's so delicious!</i>

301
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:30,715
<i>The soft, creamy egg</i>
<i>and the meat of the quail</i>

302
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:34,752
<i>perfectly complement the</i>
<i>lusciousness of the risotto!</i>

303
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:36,987
<i>What is this texture?</i>

304
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:39,657
There are five essential
ingredients in oyako‐don:

305
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:42,993
There's chicken, and eggs,
rice, onions, sukiyaki.

306
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:47,698
I first browned the quail
in oil, and then slow‐roasted
it in the oven.

307
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:50,100
Doing that ensures the
skin will come out crispy,

308
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,769
and the meat rich and juicy.

309
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:54,172
I also seasoned the eggs
with salt and black pepper

310
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:55,606
for a little kick...

311
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:57,508
And then added
fresh cream to the eggs

312
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,710
so they would have a
nice thick texture.

313
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,480
The key is to get the eggs
runny AND soft‐boiled.

314
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,017
(Splash)
I then finished out the risotto
with milk to keep it mellow.

315
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:10,988
Then I combined the
butter‐sautéed chicken with
onions that had been sweated

316
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,890
for added sweetness
and depth of flavor.

317
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,092
For the sauce
I added honey and sugar

318
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:17,662
to make a slightly
sweet Madeira sauce,

319
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,830
and finished it
with some soy sauce.

320
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,601
I used it like sukiyaki
stock, to tie it all together.

321
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,136
And this oyako‐don
is what came of it.

322
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:28,539
I just reinterpreted it
by using French techniques.

323
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,277
<i>But still, stuffing the</i>
<i>quail with something</i>
<i>moist like risotto,</i>

324
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,580

<i>to leak out before the</i>
<i>presentation was made...</i>

325
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,648
Hey, Soma,
how did you stuff it?

326
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:40,218
(Gasps)
That texture earlier!

(Chuckle)

328
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,653
It was cabbage.

329
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:45,190
I lined the quail with cabbage
I'd blanched in salt,

330
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,757
then stuffed it with risotto.

331
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:49,494
Oh, it's just like the Food
War at the training camp!

332
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:50,228

356
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:59,297
Chef Kojiro, earlier today you
said you came back to Japan

357
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:02,167
to aim even higher with
your French cuisine, right?

358
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:06,304
So I decided what I need to do
is the exact opposite of that.

359
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:10,908
I've got to smash down
the familiar walls of the
cuisine I grew up with.

360
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,544
So in that vein,
this is the first of that...

361
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:16,147
the first new 'Yukihira' item.

362
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:19,116
<i>And now, ze verdict awaits.</i>

365
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:31,729
Not good enough.

366
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:33,264
It lacks quality.

367
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:39,036

is at the moment.
Uh?

368
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:41,206
[KOJIRO]
You can serve that in
whatever hole‐in‐the‐wall

restaurant you plan on
running in the future...

370
00:17:43,508 --> 00:17:48,213

to serve in a Kojiro Shinomiya
restaurant.

371
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:49,947
With that being said...

00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,938
Who'd have thought something
like this would work out?

457
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:03,241
Just changing flavors cut
back all our leftovers!

458
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:07,044
Yes, that would be the power
of just the right spice.

459
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,015
[CUSTOMER]
Chef, I'd like to
try another dish.

460
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:12,983
Do you have anything
exotic to offer?

461
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:17,655
Yes, sir. There's one dish
I wholeheartedly recommend
as something one must try:

462
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:22,460
That would be the
Risotto‐Stuffed Quail with
Egg, "Cheeky Youngster Style."

463
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,230
(Ending song)

464
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:29,734
I'm home!

465
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,202
Hm? Soma!

466
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:33,037
So you're the first one back?

467
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:34,805
I missed you Ms. Fumio...
It's been too long.

468
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:38,643
Hmm. Well, you
certainly look pleased
with yourself there, Soma.

469
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:42,347
Look... All these came for
you while you were gone.

470
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:45,350
Hm? Whoa! What the
heck is all this?!

471
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,418
It looks like they're all
challenging you to a Food War.

472
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:49,220
(Door opens)
[STUDENT]
Excuse me!

473
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,156
So you made it
back here, Soma.

474
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:54,359
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Tetsuji Kabutoyama...

475
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:56,361
A second‐year in the
High School Division.

476
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:58,429
I'd like to challenge you
to a Food War.

477
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,632
You first‐years are
already in the same league
as us upperclassmen.

478
00:22:01,732 --> 00:22:03,468
So‐
I will.

479
00:22:03,568 --> 00:22:04,569
Huh?

480
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:06,704
But let's do it right now.

481
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:03,294
Erina!

482
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:04,529
Oh!

483
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,933
Welcome back, Hisako.

484
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:10,401
(Notification sound)

485
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:14,172
[HISAKO] Breaking news...
It's a Food War...

486
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:15,906
Soma Yukihira?!

487
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:17,375
[SOMA]
It's like this...

488
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:19,444
I wanna do as many
challenges as possible

489
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:21,612
to rack up all
the knowledge I can.

490
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:24,515
I want to push myself
to the limits of my abilities.

491
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:27,185
[KOJIRO] There are countless
opportunities for growth out
there.

492
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:29,220
You just need to grab them
as they are presented.

493
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,491
That's why you're at Tohtsuki...
to take on the world's best.

494
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:53,544
You're welcome!

495
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,646
(Cheers)

496
00:23:55,746 --> 00:24:00,017
[SOMA]
So, everyone here today...
I have somethin' to say:

497
00:24:00,117 --> 00:24:04,622
I'll take any challenge
from any one of you,
at any time you want.

498
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:05,556
Bring it on.

499
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:07,592
And if it isn't
something boring,

500
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:10,094
I'll take you on
right here and now.

501
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:13,498
Cause it's time for Food Wars!

502
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:19,537
[TOGETHER]
Everyone, you're welcome!
