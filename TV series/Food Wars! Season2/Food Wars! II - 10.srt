That's correct.

64

with a bit of miso

Usually the key to soup
is the dashi fish stock.

72
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:26,023
But for this soup
he replaced the dashi stock

73
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:28,091
and used soymilk
for the soup base.

74
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,760
I see what you mean...

75
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,096
<i>Dashi fish stock is</i>
<i>essentially umami itself.</i>

76
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:37,334
<i>And like dashi,</i>
<i>soymilk contains plenty</i>
<i>of glutamic acid.</i>

77
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:38,969
<i>So it could easily</i>
<i>be substituted</i>

78
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,805
<i>and serve as the base for</i>
<i>all the flavors of the soup.</i>

79
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:45,042

<i>Plus, umami has a</i>
<i>synergistic effect.</i>

<i>When two elements</i>
<i>are present,</i>

<i>With the inosinic acid</i>
<i>of the saury</i>

<i>and the glutamic</i>
<i>acid of the soymilk</i>

an important element.

95

They lend a pleasant
crunchy texture and are
pleasing to the eye.

96
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:21,044
Their brisk flavor helps cut
the fattiness of the saury,

97
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:22,913
giving the dish a fresh,
bracing acidity.

98

He's made full use of
acidity's ability to
increase one's appetite.

99
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:28,285
What's more, is that
these Japanese plums

100
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:29,820
are made by being
pickled with salt.

101

They are the perfect
adornment for the aged saury.

noteworthy is the parmesan
cheese that's added to the soup.

00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,967
And slowly,
one step at a time,

156
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:25,335
he's reaching his goal.

157
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:26,837
I didn't see it at first...

158
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:29,807
Until one day I noticed there
was something about Soma.

159
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,309
That he's missing something
that others hold on too.

160
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,044
And what is that?

161
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:36,279
Everyone wants
to believe that...

162
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,551
if you lose to someone
talented, it just can't
be helped. Ya know?

163
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:42,653
That's how people keep
a lid on their hearts,

164
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:47,491
because they want to preserve
their pride, or sense of
self‐worth, or whatever it is.

165
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,326
But Soma doesn't have that
"lid."

166
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,330
He's the first one
that will go headfirst into
anything he's not good at.

167
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:57,835
That's an unbelievable
strength, one that I could
never possess myself.

168
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,471
Soma's food has a
certain "spark" to it.

169
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:04,241
But rather than it being
the result of some sort
of genius‐like ability...

170
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:05,676
it's simply hard work.

171
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,211
A countless, obsessive stream
of trial and error.

172
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:11,482
It's something anyone
can do, but the fact is,
they don't bother to.

00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:13,617

He's got no chance
against him.

174
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:16,186
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
He's up against Akira Hayama,
the Master of Aroma.

think of any possible way.

177
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,094
[SCHOOLGIRL 1]
It's hopeless for him.

178

[SCHOOLBOY 5]
I mean, come on,

179
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,464
it's the genius who will win.

180
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,098
[ISSHIKI]
Why do you think that is?

181
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:30,401
Why look down on Soma
for excelling?

182
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,069
Because they can't
acknowledge him.

183
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,205
If they did, they'd be admitting
that they themselves don't try.

will be changing very soon.

[SCHOOLBOY 2] Big time.

[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Yeah, there's no way

<i>...is here!</i>

214
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,208
I'll begin by saying,
masterfully done.

215
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:48,345
This was a clash between
individuals worthy of
being in the finals...

216
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:52,282
and all of you
successfully showed us
your approaches to taste.

217
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,984
Let's being with
the cooking skills...

218
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,887
In this respect, all three
were evenly matched.

219
00:09:56,987 --> 00:10:00,223
[SENZAEMON]
Next, we judge you on your
ability to choose ingredients...

220
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,926
this undoubtedly goes to
Ryo and Akira.

221
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:06,029
They've shown to have the skills
to pick the absolute best saury.

222
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:10,368
However, Soma was able to keep
up through use of that
ingenious technique.

223
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:14,538
His creativity and perfect
execution of it sets him
above the other two.

224
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:15,739
(Crowd gasps excitedly)

225
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,408
(Excited gasp)
Yes!

226
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,443
[SENZAEMON]
However, we were
surprised to learn

227
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,178
that in our final judging
all three dishes

228
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,914
were essentially matched in
terms of deliciousness.

(Crowd gasps)

230
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,686
With all that said
and ruminated over,

231
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:29,887
the deciding factor...

232
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:31,389
was whether or not
the dish showed

233
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,656
the essence of the chef.

234
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:35,593
Huh? The essence of
the chef? Wait, what?

235
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,628
[LEONORA]
Yes, Soma. The essence
of the chef.

236
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:40,498
You see if a dish truly bursts
with one's originality,

237
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,134
then by simply tasting it
the essence of the chef's
aura and personality

238
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:46,169
should become visible
in the mind of the eater.

239
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:49,640
To put it differently, a dish
only that chef could make...

240
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,809
one that displays their
true ingenuity.

241
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:53,944

those sorts of dishes...

probed deepest within
to show us his dish...

who truly faced the question,
"What is my cooking," and how
can I represent that?

cool and calm as ever.

305
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:16,780
Get a little happy,
why don't you?

306
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,315
You know you‐

307
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,617
(Gasp)

308
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:20,984
(Crowd gasps)

309
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:22,386
Huh?!

310
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,154
(Screaming)

311
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:25,055
(Gasp)

312
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,056
A‐Akira!

313
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,125
Why would you do that?!
What's wrong?!

314
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:30,093
It's... nothing.

315
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:31,228
(Rustling)

316
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,897
Akira, did you know that
the aroma of cinnamon

317
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:37,034
has the effect of lifting
one's spirits in an instant?

318
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:41,439
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

319
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:44,307
[GIN]
<i>The expression he had</i>
<i>at the semifinals...</i>

320
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,411
I'M the one who'll
be moving forward.

321
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,946
I won't let anyone
get close!

322
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:51,782
[GIN]
<i>It wasn't a smile</i>
<i>of confidence after all.</i>

323
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:54,084
<i>It was a means</i>
<i>to inspire himself.</i>

324
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,186
<i>Yet was threatening</i>
<i>in its display.</i>

325
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,822
[GIN] That's scary good.
[LEONORA] Huh?

326
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:01,725
Akira Hayama, that was
some splendid cooking.

327
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:03,927
Thank you, I did my best,
Chef Dojima.

328
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,196
Take heed, when talent
is too great,

329
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:09,166
it can turn its talons
upon itself.

330
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:11,001
I hope that you're
able to keep that
talent of yours

331
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:13,504
in check for both
yourself and for Jun.

332
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:15,305
Huh?

333
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:17,408
Geh!

334
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:18,709
You freaking moron!

335
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:21,244
My God! You suck, suck,
suck, suck, suck!

336
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:23,881
I can't believe you'd
lose when I was right there
watching the whole time!

337
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:26,349
You're such a stinky
rotten boy! I can't even!
Will you stop hitting me?!

338
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,652
Get off me or I'm
going to end you!
I don't believe this!

339
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:30,754
How dare you use
that tone with me!

340
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:32,155
I am so done with you!

341
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,157
Come apologize when you've
learned your lesson.

342
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:35,693
AAGGHHH!

343
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:39,363
[YOUNG SOMA]
Watch out! 'Cause I'm gonna
become a chef and beat you!

344
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:40,864
Hm?

345
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:43,701
C'mon, Soma, that
sardine's no good.

346
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,369
Huh?!

347
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:49,807
But don't go losing to anyone
until you've lost to me again.

348
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,412
Akira...
Huh?

349
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:56,947
Are you still able to
make that carpaccio?

350
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,682
I think I should have
enough leftovers...

351
00:15:58,782 --> 00:15:59,683
Let me try a little.

352
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:02,219
Huh? What? Why should I‐?

353
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,521
Let me try.

354
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:05,088
Uh, the thing is, it's‐

355
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:07,858
Hey! Let me have some of that
loser stuff too, you loser!

356
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,428
Why do you always have to be
so obnoxious?

357
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:12,896
(Both munching)

358
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,065
Okay. You satisfied?

359
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:18,802
No! But I bet I could make this
dish way better than this!

360
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:20,538
Ugh. You're such a sore loser.

361
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:23,006
Now listen: Tonight, we've
come up with a ranking system

362
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:24,475
for all the first‐years.

363
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,744
And naturally, I'm sitting up
amongst the top of them.

364
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:30,147
so you'd better watch how
you speak to me from now on.
You understand?

365
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,783
You wanna throw down right now?
Bring it on, quick silver!

366
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,317
Sure but the results
would be the same though.

367
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:36,319
[SOMA] Now, now...
[BOTH] Huh?

368
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,356
I must say, you made
a pretty decent dish
over here, buddy boy.

369
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,360
I just told you to speak
to me with respect,
you third‐place nimrod!

370
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,127
We don't know what
place anybody is!

371
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,729
Don't go getting
full of yourself!

372
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,865
(Garbled) Do you think you could
actually do better than me?!

373
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,567
[SOMA AND AKIRA]
Don't talk with your mouth full!

374
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,301
(All three bickering)

375
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:54,237
Well, I guess there may
be no reason to worry
about him, after all.

376
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:58,341
[GIN]
Those three look as though
they're going to make a
most interesting trio.

377
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:00,544
[LEONORA] (Laugh)
Why, yes they do.

378
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,281
It's by smashing against
each other that raw ore
becomes polished.

379
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:07,217
I believe that is Tohtsuki's
sole philosophy.

380
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,388
Indeed. Presented tonight
at the final selection,

381
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,523
another new "jewel"
has been rendered!

382
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:16,193
(Applause and cheers)

383
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:26,069
[EIZAN]
Tch...

384
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:52,062
You were great! I couldn't
be more proud of you!

385
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:54,432
[YUKI]
All right, suckers!
Tonight, we're gonna celebrate

386
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,000
Soma winning the semifinals!
Let's tear it up, right?!

387
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,902
[AOKI]
Yeah, in Zenji's room!
(Phone vibrating)

388
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:00,471
[ZENJI]
Why is it always in my room?!

389
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:01,972
[SATO]
'Cause it's nice
and big, bro?

390
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,942
Ugh! Sorry, you guys
go ahead.

391
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,010
(Phone ringing)

392
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:10,147
[SOMA]
<i>What's goin' on, Pops?</i>

393
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:12,349
Hey, Soma,
it's been a while.

394
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,619
[JOICHIRO]
<i>So, how did finals go for you?</i>

395
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,255
Uh, well, you see...
I sorta‐

396
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,658
<i>WHAT?! You're sayin'</i>
<i>you lost?!</i>

397
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:22,426
<i>Who the heck won then?</i>

398
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,694
Akira won.

399
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,429
<i>Ah, Jun's apprentice, huh?</i>

400
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:29,132
<i>C'mon now. I don't wanna</i>
<i>lose to someone like Jun.</i>

401
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:31,301
You feel me?
(Mocking laugh)

402
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,204
[SOMA]
<i>He always gets so strangely</i>
<i>excited when cutting me down.</i>

403
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:37,608
<i>What kind of parent gets happy</i>
<i>when his own son loses?!</i>

404
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,076
But seriously though...

405
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:41,645
<i>his sense of smell is</i>
<i>really somethin' else.</i>

406
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,715
It wasn't just his gift
of smell that did it.

407
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:46,917
There was something else
about it...

408
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:49,887
[SOMA]
<i>It was like it</i>
<i>had purpose.</i>

409
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:52,790
Hey, Dad, I'm glad
I left "Yukihira."

410
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,191
Hm?!
<i>Otherwise, I...</i>

411
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,927
<i>I'd be missing</i>
<i>out on learning so much.</i>

412
00:18:57,027 --> 00:19:01,365
I think going forward, I'm out
to look for the answer to one
question...

413
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:04,034
"What is the dish that...
that only I can make?"

414
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:07,004
[SOMA]
<i>Without that, I'm nothing.</i>

415
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,138
<i>You there?</i>

416
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:09,907
Okay I take it
from your silence

417
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,842
that I must have said
something wrong. Sorry.

418
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,013
[JOICHIRO]
Nah, you're alright.
That's a good way to put it.

419
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,881
(Yawn)

420
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:20,584
[SOMA]
<i>Alright, I guess I'm</i>
<i>boring him.</i>

421
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:21,552
[JOICHIRO]
<i>See ya, son.</i>

422
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:23,220
(Phone clicks)
Ugh...

423
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,088
<i>So you finally found it...</i>

424
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:28,726
<i>Amongst your peers you've</i>
<i>found the ones that will</i>
<i>drive you forward.</i>

425
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:30,828
<i>That's good. You're learning.</i>

426
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:34,732
[JOICHIRO]
<i>It's these relationships that</i>
<i>will drive you forward.</i>

427
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,967
<i>Embrace them while you can.</i>

428
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:40,404
<i>[JOICHIRO]</i>
<i>You can always turn towards the</i>
<i>plate for answers,</i>

429
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:44,675
<i>but if you're alone,</i>
<i>all that'll change</i>
<i>is your reflection.</i>

430
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:47,344
My food.

431
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:50,581
How do I find food
that's uniquely mine?

432
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:53,784
(Ending song)

433
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,006
Hey, girls! Hello!

434
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:24,207
Meat‐Meat's here!

435
00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:25,308
Welcome back!

436
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,577
[IKUMI]
Thanks for inviting me.

437
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:28,546
So, you got ahold of
some good wild game?

438
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:31,081
[YUKI]
Yeah, it looks
perfect to eat!

439
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,416
[MEGUMI]
There!

440
00:21:32,516 --> 00:21:34,918
You look great in this.
It really suits you.

441
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:36,353
Oh, thanks a lot, Megumi.

442
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:38,756
Okay! Let's begin
the massacre!
(Girls cheer)

443
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:40,758
(Laughs)
How wonderful!

444
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:43,627
I love seeing such dainty young
women standing in the kitchen,
having a good time.

445
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:46,830
From where I'm standing, those
girls are anything but "dainty."
[IKUMI] You like that, do you?!

446
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,298
Rawr!

447
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,568
So, by the way,
where's Soma?

448
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:53,003
Oh! He went over to hang
out with some friends.

449
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,237
[SOMA]
And so you see...

450
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:55,639
that's why the
mildness of the soymilk

451
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,608
is able to highlight
the gentle saltiness

452
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,943
of the delicate saury
in a beautiful synergy.

453
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:03,313
Still, the crunchy plums
seem like a pretty cheap
addition to me.

454
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:04,548
I can't even finish this!

455
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:06,650
You're totally eating it
all up, idiot!

456
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,518
Gimme some more.

457
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,119
Must like something
about it!

458
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:11,188
Yeah, the cartoccio
I made for you yesterday

459
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,556
was way better than this gruel.

460
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:15,125
HUH?! Why don't you try
making it again?!

461
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:16,494
We'll do an
eat‐and‐compare!

462
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:17,795
That's all well and good,

463
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,763
but why are we doing
these taste tests here?

464
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:21,098
I've made some tea, guys!

465
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:23,100
[AKIRA]
What? You don't have
to do this, Jun.

466
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,970
Woah! You don't need to
serve these idiots our
best gourmet cookies.

467
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,472
Just give 'em some
of the old ones.

468
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:29,973
I heard that,
you tightwad.

469
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:32,042
A specialty dish...
[RYO] You're a friggin a‐hole.

470
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,412
A dish that shows
the essence of the chef...
(Bickering continues)

471
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:37,448
<i>Something Akira</i>
<i>has that I don't...</i>

472
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:40,050
Ahhhhhhh...
Hey, you're supposed
to savor those!

473
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,151
Akira.

474
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:43,220
I wanna do an
eat‐and‐compare.

475
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,255
Make that scorched saury
carpaccio again.

476
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:46,457
Make that two, m'kay.

477
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:48,125
Just shut up and go home!

478
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:49,292
[SOMA AND RYO]
Chop‐chop.

479
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:50,928
[AKIRA]
Don't you "chop‐chop" me!

480
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:51,962
(Chuckle)

481
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:53,130
[AOKI]
I don't understand it.

482
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,264
I can't believe he'd
climb into bed

483
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:55,666
with those dillweeds
he lost to!

484
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:58,168
Yeah. It's like the dude
ain't even upset!

485
00:22:58,268 --> 00:22:59,803
Oh, Soma's upset
alright.

486
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:02,239
In fact he's so upset
he can't stand it.
Huh?

487
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,274
That's why he's
with them.

488
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,110
You see, the only way one
can learn who they truly are

489
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,481
is to step outside
their boundaries and
experience others.

490
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:15,619
And well... even if that means
turning toward the very people
who've bested them.

491
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:19,089
Obviously, the girls
certainly feel the same way.

492
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,591
[ISSHIKI]
No matter how small...

493
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,093
they're all learning
something from their opponents.

494
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,162
And Soma's no different.

495
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:27,398
Crap. Ain't no way we're
bein' left behind!

496
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:30,333
[AOKI]
Let's throw it down!
It's a Festival of Test Dishes!

497
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:32,169
[SATO]
We'll do it up, ninja style!

498
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,705
[BOTH] Time to get this party
started, mi bro‐migos!
(Zenji protesting)

499
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:37,875
[AOKI]
Shun, get your
skinny ass over here!

500
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:40,177
What's the matter, Shun?
Are you not going along?

501
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:43,847
Ah, could it be that
you prefer to mingle with
the fairer of the sexes?

502
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:46,984
Oh Shun, you dirty
little dog, you!

503
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:50,954
Well, not that there's
anything wrong with that.

504
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,523
[JUN]
In any case,

505
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:54,458
this is the only chance
you'll get to relax

506
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,860
and enjoy your time
as first‐years here.

507
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,928
(Slurping)

508
00:23:58,028 --> 00:23:58,996
"Our only chance"?

509
00:23:59,096 --> 00:24:00,698
What does that even mean?

510
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:02,566
Well it just means
that pretty soon

511
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,002
you boys will all be tossed
out of Totshuki Academy.

512
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:07,070
Huh?
You're about to begin...

513
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,106
The on‐the‐job
training program...

514
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:11,208
Known as a Stagiaire.

515
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,477
A Stagiaire?

516
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:20,017
(Narrator)
Next time: "The Stagiaire"
