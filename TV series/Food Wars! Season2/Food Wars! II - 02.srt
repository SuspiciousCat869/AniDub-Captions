1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,809
(Urara):
If you missed the first round.

2
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,912
The winner of the first bout
of the Fall Selection is...

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
(saucy moaning)

4
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,884
(Urara):
Soma Yukihira!

5
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:18,752
You're welcome!

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,720
He did it!

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,987
(delighted squeal)

8
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:24,691
(child‐like crying)

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,592
(Soma):
Look at you...

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,696
Sure you lost, but don't
be a kid. C'mon, get up.

11
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,097
Huh?

12
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,144
Thank you‐

13
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:36,937
That was pretty fun,
wasn't it?

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,139
I'm now one step closer
to being on The Ten.

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:39,940
Get over yourself!

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,442
You may have won, but you don't
have to be so HAPPY about it!

17
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,612
And let me tell you...
our battle is far from over.

18
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,214
I'm not giving up the
top spot at Tohtsuki Academy!

19
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,751
Mark my words... Soma Yukihira.

20
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,619
Hmph.

21
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:55,656
Hmm?

22
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,259
So have you learned the limit
of your abilities?

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,794
What the hell did you
just say to me?!

24
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,396
You're turning into quite the
expert not only on cooking

25
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,865
but at being
trash, too.

26
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,768
You do realize that you just
praised my cooking, don't you?

27
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:08,535
Listen here!

28
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,271
You're going to be an absolute
mess when I get my revenge!

29
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,339
You're asking for it,
you skank!

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,309
Must be nice...
being you.

31
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,680
You get to throw your little
tantrums whenever you like.

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,814
(exausted sigh)

33
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,582
(Megumi):
Hey Soma!

34
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,084
I watched your match
from the waiting room.

35
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,119
Congratulations!

36
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,355
Ah, Megumi.
You're up next, huh?

37
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:31,558
You seem to be calm
about it. Good!

38
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:35,328
You think so?
Yeah, you're right!

39
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,564
You know... during the
preliminaries,

40
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,265
the only thing
I was thinking about

41
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,467
was doing
the best I could.

42
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:42,503
But now...

43
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,105
for the first time
ever in my culinary life...

44
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,974
I think I just wanna
be able to enjoy cooking.

45
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,409
Oh yeah? Cool.

46
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,945
have fun
out there, okay?

47
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,113
Good luck!

48
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,648
Yeah!

49
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,855
(Ryo):
As always, your food
was TOO pretty.

50
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,492
Are you attempting to lecture
ME, Ryo? Don't be ridiculous.

51
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,461
I'm just telling
you the truth.

52
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,397
But I think you
already knew that.

53
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,166
And don't push it...

54
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:17,037
Save your smack talk for after
you've beaten me at something.

55
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,841
Urara:
And now... the second battle
of the first round!

56
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,676
Here come the competitors!

57
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:23,510
(crowd cheering)

58
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,978
Urara:
First up is the dark horse...

59
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,513
the winner of the
very last round

60
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,915
of the B Block preliminaries...

61
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,017
Megumi Tadokoro!

62
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,252
And her opponent...

63
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,155
is from A Block,
AND tied Soma Yukihira

64
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,257
for second place
in the preliminaries...

65
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,893
Ryo Kurokiba!

66
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,163
The theme for this battle is...

67
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,898
RAMEN!

68
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,903
(menacing growl)

69
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,437
Let the cooking...

70
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,239
BEGIN!

71
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,104
(Isshiki):
Well, that's
the basic explanation.

72
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,073
One last thing
to disclose to you...

73
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,609
the noodles will be
provided by US.

74
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,409
Huh?

75
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,044
Your battle is set
for tomorrow...

76
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,648
so we've gone ahead and aged the
appropriate noodles accordingly.

77
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,084
Choose your noodles
from among these.

78
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,151
Let us know
in time for‐

79
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,119
I'll take this one...

80
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,589
Here... I'll use
this wide style noodle.

81
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,791
You don't need
to decide now.

82
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,892
Yeah, whatever.

83
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,360
I already know what kind
of ramen I'm going to make

84
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,162
for the competition
tomorrow.

85
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,898
He already knows?

86
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,400
Don't worry...

87
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,168
there's no need
to get in a rush.

88
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,870
Just let me know
by midnight tonight,

89
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,871
and everything'll
be fine.

90
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,272
Yeah... 'kay!

91
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,776
(Megumi):
So if they're providing us with
the correctly aged noodles...

92
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,112
then that means I mainly
need to concentrate

93
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,247
on the flavor of the soup.

94
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,517
A delicious soup
is based on the stock,

95
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,251
a concentrated
KAESHI sauce...

96
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,587
and various flavoring
oils and spices.

97
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,623
They all have to harmonize
with each other,

98
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,558
or else you'll end up
with conflicting flavors

99
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,127
that ruin the
delicate balance.

100
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,729
The noodles that
Ryo chose are oblong

101
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,864
and known for their
super elasticity.

102
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,833
What is he
planning to make?

103
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,135
Wide noodles are the
tried and true choice

104
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,903
for rich, thick broths...

105
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,405
So most likely, he's using
those particular noodles

106
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,909
to make something
robust and pungent.

107
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,910
If I want to beat him...

108
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,548
I will need to find a flavor
strong enough to hold its own.

109
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:50,751
It's time to move forward
with my trial dish!

110
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,887
Nothing's working!

111
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,455
When I try to
make it taste strong,

112
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,924
the flavors start to
fight against each other!

113
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,259
What am I going to do?

114
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,326
(whimpers)

115
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,562
(Fumio):
Megumi!

116
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:05,265
This just arrived for you.
It's from your mom.

117
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,267
Oh...

118
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,368
(Megumi's Mom):
Dear Sweetie...

119
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,604
Congratulations on
making it to the finals

120
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,872
of the Fall Selection.

121
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,975
I can't be there to cheer you
on 'cause of work...

122
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:15,876
but do your best.

123
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:19,245
I'm sendin' your favorite
ingredients from back home.

124
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,014
Oh Momma!

125
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,886
(Megumi):
Wow! This certainly
takes me back!

126
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:29,455
So many ingredients
I used to use back home!

127
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,757
Huh?

128
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:32,893
I've got it!

129
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,461
I'll use the ingredients
my mom just sent me!

130
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,097
This is perfect!

131
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,168
Oh... let
me see...

132
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,041
That section over there
is strangely gaudy...

133
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,376
Oh! Soma! We're over here!

134
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,478
Why would they write
her name on a fan?

135
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,114
Kind of... bizarre.

136
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,016
One of life's mysteries.

137
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,052
(Oizumi):
Ah... Ramen...

138
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,388
a simple dish always made
with three ingredients:

139
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,925
noodles, toppings,
and broth.

140
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,893
Excessive demands
are being placed

141
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,095
on the contestants
this year.

142
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,633
Mmm.

143
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,532
Ramen became
incredibly popular

144
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,367
during the post‐war
Reconstruction Period.

145
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,836
Not only was it
fairly cheap...

146
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,272
but was delicious and easily
served from mobile food stalls.

147
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,508
And currently...
this once humble dish,

148
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,443
has spread throughout
the entire world.

149
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,612
It's unmatched
both in depth of flavor

150
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,548
and amount of required
preparation time.

151
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,116
They're to present this
in a SINGLE night!

152
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,218
At a major venue,
no less.

153
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:32,819
That's right...

154
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,722
they're being tested on their
adaptability and ability

155
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,757
to think on their toes.

156
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,659
(Senzaemon):
What strengths
will they draw on?

157
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,993
To what extent
will they make use

158
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,462
of the experiences
they've accumulated?

159
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,998
In the prelims, Ryo made
a seafood curry...

160
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,367
(Zenji):
Will he use fish again?

161
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,303
I wonder what he
has going on up there?

162
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,037
(Ikumi):
Look at that!

163
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,574
The stock is prepared
by using all the fish parts!

164
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,608
He has rockfish...

165
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,942
and eel
and flatfish.

166
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,444
His ramen has a
seafood base for sure!

167
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,513
Oh‐ho!

168
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,582
(Oizumi):
Fish innards
and shrimp heads

169
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,117
will give it a
robust flavor!

170
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,151
He cleaned them well.

171
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,821
There shouldn't be ANY
unwelcomed fish smells.

172
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,924
Ryo made a rich, fish‐based soup
just as I thought.

173
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,492
(Ryoko):
She has scallops!

174
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,628
Megumi is using their
dried adductor muscles

175
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:15,896
to flavor the
base stock with!

176
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,064
(Megumi):
I'll add a strained
chicken broth to this stock

177
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,066
and let it
simmer down even more!

178
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,902
(Yuki):
Wait... so does that mean...

179
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,772
Megumi is actually going with
the same seafood base as Ryo?!

180
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,609
No. They're both using
a seafood stock of sorts...

181
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,443
(Zenji):
But opposed to
Ryo's thick soup...

182
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:34,347
Megumi decided to go for a
lighter, more mellow flavor.

183
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,749
That's an
excellent choice.

184
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,984
But will that stand a
chance against the impact

185
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:38,752
of Ryo's soup?!

186
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,722
Oh, right! Megumi's
hometown is a port city.

187
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:42,856
There's no way
she can lose

188
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,525
when it comes to her
knowledge of seafood!

189
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,526
(Alice):
(giggles)

190
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,660
That's interesting.

191
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,829
It's a battle of those
raised by the sea.

192
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,798
That's correct. It's
a fishing challenge‐

193
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,465
Mm‐hmm.

194
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,800
Oh, I don't
think so!

195
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,335
Wh‐what are you
doing here?!

196
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,737
Whatever
I want to.

197
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,506
Did you just say "a battle of
those raised by the sea"?

198
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,240
That's right.

199
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,176
(Alice):
Ryo also grew up
down by the water.

200
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,880
(Ikumi):
A stock of Homard lobster and
shrimp shells? Seriously?!

201
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,315
He's using THAT
in his soup, too?

202
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:18,324
(lobster‐grinding grunts)

203
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,304
(Male Student 1):
What the?!

204
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:21,662
(Male Student 2):
He's grinding the
shells into powder!

205
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,232
(Male Researcher 2):
Down in the bar district where
the sailors get together...

206
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,669
apparently there's a place
that's really popular.

207
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,004
Yeah? I'd like
to check it out.

208
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,373
(chuckles)
That's not a good idea.

209
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,643
(Male Researcher 1):
Some ruffian would
probably rob you blind.

210
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,615
(Young Alice):
I'm finally out of
the shadow of Japan...

211
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,185
So I should eat up everything
I can get my hands on!

212
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,287
What's this place? Oh.

213
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,274
Huh?

214
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:49,122
Whaddya want?
We're closed.

215
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,157
You'll have to come back later
or just go somewhere el‐

216
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,326
Fine, then, I'll just
wait till you're open.

217
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,454
(growl)

218
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:55,829
Well, well, it
sure is filthy!

219
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,031
Oh, excuse me, would you
mind introducing me

220
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,266
to the cook who
runs this place?

221
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,203
Quit talkin' like you
own the damn place.

222
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,939
Anyway, the chef
you're looking for...

223
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,373
is ME.

224
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,341
Huh?

225
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,843
(Soma):
"The chef"?

226
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,279
Yep. As you can see, Ryo has
held the top spot in the kitchen

227
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,681
since he was just a little kid.

228
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,683
He's been good
for a long, long time

229
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,284
Yeah...
but Megumi...

230
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,287
(Yuki):
She's also helped out in the
kitchens back in her hometown

231
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,789
as a kid!

232
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,858
MEGUMI!

233
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,627
You gotta keep
your spirits up!

234
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,596
We're all up here
rooting for you, girl!

235
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:30,864
(embarrassed whimper)

236
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,498
What is that
horrible noise?

237
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,700
Um... my friend...

238
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,236
she's from the same
dorm as me. She's nice!

239
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,237
(groans)

240
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,204
How revolting.

241
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,841
Cooks who act all warm
and fuzzy with each other

242
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,275
make me wanna puke.

243
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,977
(Ryo):
It's a disgrace!

244
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,379
A chef either eats
or gets eaten...

245
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,781
there is no middle
ground here!

246
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,050
It's all about
winning and losing!

247
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,385
Um... you really
believe that?

248
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,820
Huh?

249
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,421
I don't agree
with that at all...

250
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,757
I think what's
really important

251
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,324
is for everyone
to cooperate and‐

252
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,860
The kitchen
is a warzone...

253
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,361
and cooking is its power!

254
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,697
But I guess someone
raised all nice and cozy

255
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,265
wouldn't
understand that.

256
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,034
(Ryo):
Cooking means bringing
the other guy to his knees

257
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,904
and enslaving him
to your superior skills!

258
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,606
Anyone who doesn't get that,

259
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,876
has no business creating
flavors in the kitchen!

260
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,343
Open your eyes, girl!

261
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,880
You guys have been fooling
yourselves this whole time.

262
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,183
You've made nothing
but total garbage!

263
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,318
Well, you are wrong.

264
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,920
You're the one who is blind...

265
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,422
at the very least,
everything I've come across...

266
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,023
(beeping)

267
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:33,126
has been anything
BUT garbage!

268
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:36,162
The vegetables have
been parboiled.

269
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,198
Now to add two types
of soy sauce...

270
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,266
and keep the temperature
around 80 degrees

271
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,403
so as to preserve
their depth of flavor.

272
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:44,137
Yes!

273
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,372
Look at that.
She's staying calm.

274
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,040
Oh, Yeah.

275
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,709
She's going through
all the right steps

276
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,376
and not wasting
any of her moves.

277
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,914
The key to ramen's
rich flavor is in its broth.

278
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,215
She's going with a lighter soup,

279
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,919
which will be ruined if she even
slightly muddles the flavors.

280
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,988
(Students):
Ooooh!

281
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,892
What beauty is this...?

282
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,762
(Senzaemon):
It's so clear,
that it's sparkles.

283
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,797
(Judges):
(oohs and aahs)

284
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,934
(Megumi):
A lot of people have
supported me along the way...

285
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,002
So watch
your mouth!

286
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,739
Don't talk
bad about them!

287
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,074
(menacing growl)

288
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,110
Yeah, that's all I really
wanted to say, so...

289
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,020
(Urara):
Well... we're almost
out of time for this round!

290
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,658
Which contestant will finish
first? Tensions are mounting!

291
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,258
It's good!

292
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,926
(Male Student 1):
What the heck?!
Look at the judges!

293
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:40,861
(Male Student 2):
I'm not sure what
this is about!

294
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,829
(Female Student):
What do you think's
going to happen?!

295
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,431
You know... one of the
highlights of ramen

296
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,733
is sitting at the counter,

297
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,635
watching the chef
work his magic!

298
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,304
(Zenji):
Yeah... but cooking with
the Demon of the Kitchen

299
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,406
standing right there
in front of you?!

300
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,474
Watch it, old man!

301
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:57,678
Don't go giving Megumi more
pressure than she can handle!

302
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,846
It's all right.
She's calm.

303
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,683
Seeing it up close,
it's not only beautiful

304
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,151
but has a splendid
aroma to it!

305
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,353
So the toppings
will be vegetables?

306
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,856
I must say, I'm looking
forward to this.

307
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,491
Everything's going well.

308
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,660
Bring it on, home‐girl!

309
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,096
Take this thing
and win IT!

310
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,098
(Students):
(shocked gasps)

311
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,969
(hot‐tempered grunt)

312
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,674
Yes... That's
the Ryo I know.

313
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:30,010
Who are you? Don't get
many chicks like you‐

314
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,012
Well don't you have
some crude manners!

315
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:35,081
I have a real name, you know.
It's "Alice Nakiri"!

316
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,261
Oh, yeah?

317
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:38,084
Hello! Aren't you gonna
introduce yourself?!

318
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,251
Ryo.

319
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,988
"Ryo"? So what's your
family name, then?

320
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,123
Kurokiba.

321
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,426
Huh? But that's sounds a lot
like a Japanese family name.

322
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,795
So... you've got enough
to pay for your meal, right?

323
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,363
'Course I do.

324
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,665
You'd better.

325
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,566
(Male Customer 1):
Man! I sure am starving.

326
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,067
(Male Customer 2):
What're we gonna eat today?

327
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,136
(Young Ryo):
The regulars are
lining up already.

328
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,772
There's still a bit more time
before we open for dinner,

329
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,141
but whatever. Let's do this.

330
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,142
Hmm?

331
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:03,677
What's happening?

332
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,913
(Young Alice):
He seems... he seems
different all of a sudden!

333
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,849
Line it up!

334
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,017
You will pay for your food
upon your receipt.

335
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,653
And you will do
exactly as I tell you.

336
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:16,089
Bein' a customer of mine,
means obeying these two rules.

337
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,090
We're friggin' open!

338
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,125
(Customers):
(cheering)

339
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,261
(Young Ryo):
You're taking too long!

340
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,263
I told you, doing
the MISE EN PLACE

341
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,498
with what we've got in the
kitchen takes priority!

342
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,168
It's your no‐talent asses
trying to do it all at once,

343
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,003
that's gettin'
us into trouble!

344
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:30,537
(salty seething)

345
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:34,140
Whatever. Get out there
and take some DAMN ORDERS!

346
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,678
I've had enough of you!

347
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,713
What's with
your attitude BOY?!

348
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,882
Quit talking down
to your elders, dammit!

349
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,383
Are you done,
meathead...?

350
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:47,287
Do you possibly think you can
put out food better than mine?

351
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,489
(Young Ryo):
I could fire you
and still do your job

352
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,626
without breaking a sweat,
you dim‐witted hack.

353
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,364
Please forgive me, Chef. Sorry!

354
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,035
All right!
The food is here!

355
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,069
This is the best!

356
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,071
I can't imagine
heading out to sea

357
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:08,074
without having Ryo's
cooking to come back to!

358
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,843
(intrigued giggle)

359
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,512
(Urara):
We have a finisher folks...

360
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:14,414
looks like Ryo Kurokiba
is ready to show!

361
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:15,415
(Male Student 1):
Whoa... what is that?

362
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,217
(Male Student 2):
What's he adding?

363
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,319
(Male Student 3):
Is that... Melba toast?

364
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,154
Shove this down your throat.

365
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,223
It's a SOUPE DE POISSON ramen.

366
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,325
Really? Soupe de poisson?

367
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,061
A southern French soup made
with a base combining shellfish

368
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:28,895
and fish parts.

369
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,865
What a splended idea
for a rich ramen!

370
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,334
Well, let's start
with the soup...

371
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,404
Both the tomalley
and fish innards...

372
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,742
their richness come
together perfectly.

373
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:44,044
Such a bold, aggressive flavor!

374
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:48,448
Now to get some of the noodles
bathed in this soup...!

375
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,120
No! It's enough to
make me lose my senses!

376
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,657
(Oizumi):
It's an avalanche of umami!

377
00:15:56,757 --> 00:16:00,527
The cheese... the rouille of
aioli... and the chili peppers!

378
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:04,097
And tempura bits
that act as croutons!

379
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,899
I have gathered the Melba toast.

380
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:10,036
(Oizumi):
It's been slathered with
Echire butter and slow‐toasted.

381
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,638
(toasty crunch)

382
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,441
(Oizumi):
I GET IT!

383
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,178
The ground up shells
had been dried out

384
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,913
to intensify the flavor!

385
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,414
Glad you noticed, old man.

386
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:24,618
The flavor of this ramen comes
from the soup base emulsified

387
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,654
with butter and drenched in the
essence of the shellfish powder.

388
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,089
The umami of
that extract...

389
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,457
comes from glycine,
arginine, and proline,

390
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,528
but shellfish has the highest
concentration of any seafood.

391
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:37,230
He added so much of that
powdered extract to the soup,

392
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,265
that of course it became
fiercely delicious,

393
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,302
grabbing the souls of the
judges by their taste buds!

394
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,506
(eager slurping and crunching)

395
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:46,507
I understand...

396
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,175
The ferocity of it, is like
a blow to the head.

397
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:52,412
To this man, having
other people eat is...

398
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,449
(Senzaemon):
like an all‐out brawl
to the death!

399
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,519
This is how he's
made it this far,

400
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,353
by bringing others
to their knees.

401
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:04,758
How long are you gonna keep
on pontificatin', grand pa‐pa?

402
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,126
We're at war, here!

403
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,661
Very well!

404
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,262
(grunt)

405
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,497
(battle grunt)

406
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,605
Baring yourself without
striking a dramatic pose...!

407
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,341
This is quite a rare sight
for all of us to witness!

408
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,911
Getting ME to strip bare
through sheer brute force...

409
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,413
your ambition
is admirable!

410
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:28,749
(crowd cheering)

411
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,451
Uh. Megumi hasn't even
been judged yet...

412
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,787
but the atmosphere
in here has changed!

413
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:34,788
Shifted all it's focus.

414
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,758
Ryo's presentation wasn't just
for the showmanship...

415
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:41,562
any interest, concern, or even
relevance for Megumi's dish...

416
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,597
well he just... took it.

417
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:46,132
He left her nothing
to work with, didn't he?

418
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,835
This is going to make
things really hard for her.

419
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:49,570
She's fine.

420
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,671
Huh?

421
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,275
(Megumi):
Take the noodles
from the strainer

422
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,178
and imagine cutting
the surface tension...

423
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:01,615
Go Megumi!

424
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:02,983
She doesn't
seem phased.

425
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,184
The atmosphere
is fine.

426
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,086
Yes. Just
concentrating...

427
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,622
she looks focused
on her cooking...

428
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:11,792
Ryoko:
In a way... it's kind
of like Soma!

429
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,895
My dish
is ready.

430
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:15,862
Enjoy!

431
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,799
(Oizumi):
What an incredibly
light soup

432
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,400
that's beautiful
in appearance.

433
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,604
Still, after the previous
rich, seafood ramen,

434
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:26,372
it's looks rather
lacking in impact.

435
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,541
(skeptical slurp)

436
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:28,775
Mmm!

437
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,376
(euphoric slurping)

438
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,512
(Students):
Whoa...

439
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,646
So powerful!

440
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:35,248
This umami is a
shock to the senses!

441
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,350
(Female Student):
So it's not
a light soup?

442
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,454
The flavor is fresh, but where
am I getting the sweetness?

443
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:43,524
And this choice of
toppings tastes like...

444
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,725
KOZUYU!

445
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:45,391
Yes!

446
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,394
I used kozuyu as a model, then
added strained chicken broth

447
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,196
and concentrated soy sauce.

448
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,498
It's a kozuyu‐soy ramen!

449
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,634
Kozuyu...

450
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:57,871
How interesting. Kozuyu is a
local dish of the Aizu area.

451
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,541
It's made by using
a broth of dried scallops.

452
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:04,010
And often served at
celebratory events throughout.

453
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,346
You interpreted
local cuisine as ramen?

454
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,549
I see the scallop adductor
is the star...

455
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,551
while the robust heartiness
of the chicken broth

456
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,686
serves as
the flavor base.

457
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:13,920
And what's even more...

458
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,321
the concentrated kaeshi sauce

459
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,423
is a blend of mild
and sweet soy sauces.

460
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:18,692
(Saotome):
The flavor of the soy sauces

461
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,061
is a perfect match
for that of kozuyu!

462
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,496
That's not enough
to explain it.

463
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,166
Just what is the
source of this umami?!

464
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,169
Well, sir... it all comes
from the vegetables.

465
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,336
Vegetables?!

466
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,740
In some mushrooms plus burdock
root and green beans as well...

467
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,610
They were all dried and then
simmered into a simple broth.

468
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,410
I get it now!

469
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,813
Drying the vegetables
concentrates the flavor...

470
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,683
(Zenji):
giving it a completely different
umami than if they were raw!

471
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:46,787
All that insane flavor got
absorbed into the broth!

472
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:47,788
That seems about right.

473
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,857
Vegetables tend to be Megumi's
secret ace up her sleeve!

474
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,694
(Judge):
This unique combining
of fibrous vegetables...

475
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:55,696
Who would have thought it
could make such a refreshing

476
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:58,431
and powerful impact
in one delightful bowl?!

477
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,735
I'm so ecstatic that my
facial muscles won't respond!

478
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:04,304
Oh! Before you
finish the noodles...

479
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,773
please try that small
bowl in front of you.

480
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,576
(Megumi):
Just add however much
you want to the soup.

481
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,011
Huh?
Huh?

482
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:14,314
Ooooh! This acidity
is a shock to the palate!

483
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,316
It makes the flavor
profile even tighter!

484
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,418
What on Earth
is this stuff?!

485
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,786
It's an Aizu dressing.

486
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,889
I made it with local chicken,
shredded leeks, shiso leaves,

487
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:23,757
and pickled plums.

488
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:26,192
I thought it would be sort
of fun to change up the flavor

489
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,127
just a little bit.

490
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,429
This is far more
than "changing it up"!

491
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,032
This not only harmonizes the
delicateness of the kozuyu,

492
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:35,235
but draws out the sweetness
of the vegetables even more!

493
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:38,138
(Ryo):
Hey, let's see
that ramen of yours!

494
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,106
Lemme have
some of it, NOW!

495
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,975
Um, okay!

496
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,343
(Judge):
I'm speechless.

497
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,278
They're both seafood‐based
ramen...

498
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,547
but she created such umami

499
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,448
using a drastically
different approach,

500
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,751
much lighter than Ryo's
soupe de poisson!

501
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:51,652
Well at this point...

502
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,555
I still can't make a rich broth
using pork or seafood.

503
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,823
Either I fail at removing the
unpleasant smell...

504
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,425
or I can't manage to get
the flavor to come out right.

505
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,629
It takes an incredible
amount of true skills.

506
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:03,897
But...

507
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:07,500
by using scallops and vegetables
to bring out it's natural umami,

508
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,102
I thought I might
retain the balance...

509
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:12,606
and make a powerful
ramen using my own skills!

510
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:15,008
You knew I'd make a ramen
with a thick broth,

511
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,078
so you came at me with a silly
little counterpoint like this?!

512
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:23,016
Aren't you a little box of
surprises... Megumi Tadokoro?!

513
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,317
Within that
slender frame,

514
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:28,622
burning silent and fierce lays
the spirit of a great warrior!

515
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:31,024
(Oizumi):
Not fearing even
the strongest of enemies,

516
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,360
this delicate belle raced
headfirst into a brutal

517
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,497
and raging battle of umami!

518
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:41,835
Come here, girlie.
Get this down your gullet!

519
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,638
The umami and aroma
of the ocean is overwhelming!

520
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:46,807
I feel like
I might... collapse!

521
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:48,942
I can't... I can't
believe he was able

522
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,343
to make something like this!

523
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,746
But... I still
don't want to lose!

524
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:55,248
What a fierce battle
we are in the midst of!

525
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,350
Both dishes presented
such strength and power!

526
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,555
(Oizumi):
They're the true embodiment
of deliciousness!

527
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,625
I'm gonna pound you good!

528
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,528
SOUPE DE POISSON!

529
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:09,730
I can take your thick soup
any day of the week!

530
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,132
My scallop and chicken stock
can squash opponents

531
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,000
far tougher than you, scumbag!

532
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:20,406
Scallops! Scallops! Okay?
It's all about scallops!
Lobster! Lobster!
It's all about lobster!

533
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,757
You got that?!
You wouldn't know!

534
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,208
You want a piece of me?!
I don't think so!
You don't understand how
it's better than scallops!

535
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:23,910
Scallops, you hear me?!
Scallops!
You need to take
your country ass back

536
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,511
I'll crush you
in the face!
You need to take
your country ass back

537
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,123
I'll crush you
in the face!
to wherever it came from!

538
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:26,079
Go back? You'll have to find out
before me what's the best...
Lobster is the king of the sea!

539
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,714
Go back? You'll have to find out
before me what's the best...
Lobster will crush you
and your stupid SCALLOPS!

540
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:28,915
it's SCALLOPS!
Lobster will crush you
and your stupid SCALLOPS!

541
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,509
The director
has his brush!

542
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,476
Who's it gonna be?

543
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:06,046
Who's the winner?!

544
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:07,748
(obsessed giggle)

545
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:16,990
Narrator:
Next time:

546
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,192
"The Age of Kings."
