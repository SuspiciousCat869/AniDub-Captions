00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,315
[ALL]
Eeee...

2
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,382
What am I looking at?

3
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,018
That's one blunt sword!

4
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,520
[BOY]
That transfer student is up to
his weird tricks again.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,155
[OTHER BOY]
Is he trying to
throw this thing?!

6
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,091
I understand now, must be
why you didn't bother

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,827
coming out to the market
this morning, Soma.
[SOMA] Huh?!

8
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,430
You chose to age your fish
to make up for the difference

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,398
in quality that your
fish would lack.

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,534
Nice try, but I could
tell what you used

11
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,702
the second I looked at your
pathetic little fish...

12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,204
It won't be enough.

13
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,573
You're not going to match a
fresh, seasonal ingredient.

14
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,943
[SOMA]
Yeah well you can't really know
that without eatin' it, can ya?

15
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,846
But don't worry, I made enough
for you guys to try as well.

16
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,615
You can talk all you want,
the competitions been decided.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,917
Congratulations...
coming in third.

18
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,220
That's still plenty
to be proud of.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,555
[SOMA]
Hm.

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,057
[SATOSHI]
Ladies and gentlemen...

21
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,459
It seems the time
has finally arrived.

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,727
Let the finals of the
Fall Selection begin.

23
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,963
Turn your attention
to the ceiling.

24
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,133
[CROWD]
Ohhhh...

25
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,902
[STUDENT]
So awesome!

26
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,305
[BOY]
The friggin' ceiling
just opened up man!

27
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,240
Very soon now...

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,943
Everyone, we shall witness
the Celestial Room's true form.

29
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,379
[CROWD]
Ohhhh!

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,981
[SATOSHI]
Cooking time for the competition
will be two hours.

31
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,550
It will last from when
the moon peers upon us...

32
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,186
to when it disappears from view.

33
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,721
It will be a night of
cooking under the stars.

34
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,858
[GIN]
This may be an annual custom,
but it's quite majestic,
isn't it?

35
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,329
<i>It brings me back</i>
<i>to those nostalgic days.</i>

36
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,366
<i>Back to that magical night</i>
<i>when I had to fight</i>
<i>in my own Selection.</i>

37
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,669
<i>All the chefs that have</i>
<i>stood on this same stage</i>

38
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,938
<i>have all gazed in awe</i>
<i>upon this moon.</i>

39
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,275
Don't go losing to anyone,
until you've lost to me again.

40
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,513
[SOMA]
<i>This is mine!</i>
<i>I will be taking the top seat.</i>

41
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,315
[SENZAEMON]
Prepare yourselves!

42
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:01,022
LET THE COOKING BEGIN!

43
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,918
[GIN]
This is interesting...

44
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,254
none of the contestants have
reached for their saury.

45
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,824
They're continuing to prep
their other ingredients.
Playing by the book, huh?

46
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,761
They seem to know that
needless handling can lead to
a decrease in freshness.

47
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,532
Not wanting to ruin it,
they must retain as much of
that freshness as possible.

48
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,868
Hehe...
I find I am becoming
quite excited in here.

49
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:59,173
There is no better sight than
watching such handsome young men
playing with their swords, yes!

50
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,742
Goodness, Mother, that was
extremely lewd of you!

51
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,345
And as always,
your vocab is a bit off.

52
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,980
Alice! Go back to your
stupid seat already!

53
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,849
You should come over
here too, Erina.

54
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,852
Um, it's okay,
right, Grandfather?

55
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,487
Yes, I care not.

56
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,522
See? What did I
tell ya, Erina?

57
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,659
Haha... You can't say you're
family isn't fun, Erina.

58
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,127
What's this?

59
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,230
It seems Soma Yukihira is
the first to grab his fish.

60
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,566
I wonder if he's managed
to age it properly.

61
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,469
Yeah, and what kind of dish
is he going to make with it?

62
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,405
Ryo Kurokiba and Akira Hayama,

63
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:35,342
Will you be able to beat
those two monsters, Soma?

64
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:40,181
[OIZUMI]
Oh! Young Ryo has assorted
seafood at his cooking station!

65
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,051
And I see he added
ripe tomatoes and
olive oil as well!

66
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,352
This should be delicious.

67
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,354
He probably intends to make
an acqua pazza.

68
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,492
[GIN]
Acqua pazza, a popular
rustic dish reigning
from southern Italy.

69
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:55,762
The star ingredient is fish,
which is simmered with
various ingredients.

70
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,864
It's a dish that is simple
yet luxurious.

71
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,269
It common knowledge to add
the olive oil, tomato,
and shellfish to dish like this.

72
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,372
A key feature is that
it doesn't have much
seasoning added to it.

73
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,543
By him simplifying this,
he's able to highlight the
quality of the ingredients.

74
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,978
It's the perfect dish
to make use of his eye
for freshness.

75
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,250
[OIZUMI]
Still, all those ingredients
can play starring roles
on their own.

76
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,685
I'm not quite sure
what he's trying to do.

77
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,988
Simmering the saury with those
will muddle the flavor.

78
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,259
That's a good point.
That seasonal saury would be...

79
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,693
Ah! Seasonal!

80
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,162
[GIN]
That seems to be the key.

81
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,097
Rather than becoming
muddled and lost,

82
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,800
seasonal saury has
the potential to be
the star of the entire dish.

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,137
There's no doubt
why he chose this.

84
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:38,739
He's showing how confident
he is in his trained eye.

85
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,974
As you can see,
he's very calm...

86
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,344
There's not a trace of
pressure on his face.

87
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,047
He's in his element.
Very impressive.

88
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:48,549
That's just him in
his natural state.
[GIN] Huh?

89
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:52,286
The two of us have been fighting
in serious culinary battles
for years now!

90
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,488
Hehe...
That does take me back.

91
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,524
You two were so cute
when you were young and
rebellious in fighting, yes.

92
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,894
I didn't know you
knew him while he was
in living in Europe...

93
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,229
Well, Auntie Leonora?

94
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,498
You dare call me "Auntie"?!
How rude!

95
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,667
You are selfish to
brag about your own
pretty girl youth,

96
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,170
you miserable creature
of ageless vim and vigor!

97
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,373
Oh whatever! I didn't call you
"granny," I said "Auntie".

98
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,874
So just simmer down.

99
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,110
You really think such
of this boy, Alice?

100
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,711
Yes, I do Mother!

101
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,014
I'm thinking of making him
my personal attendant!

102
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,782
Let go of me
you white viper.

103
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,085
Erina gets to have
her own secretary.

104
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,653
So I want my own attendant
who's my age too!

105
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,823
(Dog barks and growls)
Yes, well, we must ask your
father about this dear.

106
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,425
Don't get ahead
of yourselves!

107
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,960
I own the top spot in
this restaurant, honey.

108
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,329
I have no intention
of serving unde‐

109
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,963
I believe I told you
to address me properly,

110
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,499
mind your manners servant.
[RYO] Just leave!

111
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,634
Well then, how about we
have a cooking battle?

112
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,405
[RYO] What?
If you lose, you'll become
my loyal puppy dog forever.

113
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,639
Woof, woof, woof!

114
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:50,244
(Ryo roars)

115
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,946
That girl's dish there
is much tastier. Sorry.

116
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,915
(Ryo groans)
[ALICE] Well then...

117
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,118
Time to get on all fours
and bark for me.

118
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:02,056
Argh! I challenge you to
another BATTTLE! RIGHT NOW!

119
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,525
(Music plays)

120
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,628
Tee‐hee hee‐hee.

121
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,064
(Crowd cheers)

122
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,536
AAHHHH!

123
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,173
[RYO]
Two years after our
very first battle...
it finally happened...

124
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,841
I WON for the first time.

125
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,844
[COOK 2] Way to go chef! Yeah!
[COOK 3]Victory is yours Master!

126
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,147
(Cooks cheer)

127
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:29,183
Hmf! I'm challenging you
again tomorrow!

128
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,152
You got that,
you're going down!

129
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,854
[RYO]
Sure thing, Miss Alice.

130
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,721
Huh?

131
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,023
Mark my words...

132
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,592
I'll fight as long
as you want.

133
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,561
(Giggle)

134
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,962
(People laughing)

135
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:43,330
If I win next time,

136
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,199
you have to speak to me
more politely. Okay?

137
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,068
Don't push it, honey!

138
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,973
[SOMA] Oh?
[ AKIRA] Huh?

139
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,541
[AKIRA]
Heat‐resistant film?

140
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,843
[SOMA]
Ooh. That isn't
regular plastic wrap.

141
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,246
[ZENJI]
This type of film is
able to resist temperatures

142
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,715
from minus 40 degrees
to almost 400.

143
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,186
It's a special film that
lets you cook food while
it's still wrapped.

144
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,588
[ERINA]
<i>It smacks of</i>
<i>molecular gastronomy...</i>

145
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,790
<i>something he surely must have</i>
<i>picked up from Alice.</i>

146
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,226
<i>The dishes he makes now would</i>
<i>have never occurred to him</i>

147
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,561
<i>if it hadn't been for Alice</i>
<i>and her new methods.</i>

148
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,530
<i>She showed him</i>
<i>all these techniques.</i>

149
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,765
<i>It's a reflection of</i>
<i>their history.</i>

150

<i>That goes without saying,</i>
<i>Miss Alice.</i>

153

155
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:38,152
Akira! I'm gonna use this
to finally finish you off!

156
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,554
Only one chef will reach
the top of the Selection...

157
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,090
and that Chef is ME!

158

[MEGUMI]
Hey look, the moon's gone
halfway across the sky.

159
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,135
So that's leaves just
one more hour left.

160
00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:55,636
Ah, look at that.

161
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,039
Now it's ready.

162
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,241
It looks like Ryo is
the first one done.

163

But could you really call it...

164
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,744
...a real dish?

165
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,412
You finished quite fast, Ryo.

166
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,215
Here's hoping you didn't
overlook anything
in the process.

167
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,252
You just keep on talking crap
while you still can, spice boy.

168
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,855
My dish is going to slay
anything you think you've got!

169
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,258
[SOMA]
What the heck is that Ryo up to?

170
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,793
And what's that thin film he's
got wrapped around everything?

171
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,097
You'll see, it's something
you're probably familiar with.

172
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:24,531
[SOMA]
Huh?

173
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:28,302
And Ryo Kurokiba is the
first contestant to serve.

174
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,239
[GIN]
As the competitor
approaches the judges'...

175
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,242
the Moon offers
a shimmering glow...
Reigning down...

176
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,511
soaking both the chef
and his dish...

177
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,746
as if being purified
by the night.

178
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,215
Pleasure!

179
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,185
I find it is still bubbling
inside of bag, yes.

180
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:45,952
It is very hot and
steamy, please.

181
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,056
He's serving it as is
and making the judges
do the work themselves?

182
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:52,493
Very well!
Let's get to tasting!

183

[GIN]
<i>Shrimp, mussels, clams,</i>

[LEONORA]
<i>Oh! The tension is</i>
<i>draining from my face</i>
<i>to a new found glow!</i>

188
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:16,517
[OIZUMI]
Oh! The director!

189
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:20,221
Even our austere director
is grinning a glorious grin!

190
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:23,590
[SAOTOME]
It's a real grin!
I never imagined he would
break into a grin!

191
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,628
[RYO]
As you see the ingredients
are essentially the same
as an acqua pazza.

192
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,663
But wrapping it in
heat‐resistant film

193
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,499
gives this dish a
different name altogether...

194
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,867
Cartoccio!

195
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:38,439
The dish I've served to you all,
is cartoccio of fall saury!

196
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,509
[SOMA]
Oh...

197
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,346
[SOMA]
<i>In the semifinals, he used</i>

199
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,651
And now he's introducing
a huge bomb of flavor.

200
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,818
Impressive.

201
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,355
Alright, stuff your fat face!

202
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:57,291
Mmmm... too delicious!

203
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,625
Fat of the saury so sweet.

204
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,827
Seems to melt...
dance in my mouth, yes!

<i>and give it such boldness...</i>

207
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:09,670
<i>it's almost too much!</i>

208
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,639
<i>This is the essence</i>
<i>of Ryo Kurokiba!</i>

209
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,376
But there's even more
to it than that...

210
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:19,446
he developed such rich flavors,
using only a little seasoning...

211
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,848
Oh, there's something
refreshing...

212
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,085
Something different.
This is...

213
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,087
...Yes, herbal aromatics!

214
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,454
Exactly right!

215
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,391
When wrapping it in film...
I also added this...

216
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,394
An herb butter bomb
of intensity!

217
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,962
[ERINA]
<i>He took regular</i>
<i>room‐temperature butter...</i>

218
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,633
<i>and added it to a variety of</i>
<i>thinly diced herbs and spices.</i>

219
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,269
<i>He then placed it in</i>
<i>the fridge overnight to rest.</i>

220
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:47,274
And let me tell you it took its
glorious time melting in the
oven while basking in the heat.

221
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,576
Slowly penetrating
its rich flavor...

222
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,446
permeating the saury as well as
all the other ingredients!

223

It looks like it's
going to happen.

00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,526
Expose herself!

It was a splendid dish.

Truly, when brought
to the table,

235
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,243
it was like a visual
assault to the senses.

236
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,544
Even the way it was served
paid adherence to

the important elements
of the dish

238

as well as current
culinary trends.

239
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,815
Throughout this venue, people
leaned forward to gaze intently,

240
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,917
by which one can say the intent
of this dish was realized.

As you are probably
well aware of this...

You know when Mother
eats something delicious

she stops talking like
an idiot and starts
speaking fluently.

Oh yes,
almost forgot.

245
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,096
None of this makes
any sense. It's weird.

246
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:46,400
[LEONORA]
The mellowness of the butter
ties together the ingredients'
contrasting extracts,

247
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,369
while the herbs impart a
powerful flavor impact,

248
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:50,904
while at the same time
allowing the aftertaste
to not be too persistent...

00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,426
[AOKI] Badass!
[SATO] Delish!

299
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:53,927
I'd eat the crap outta that!

300
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:56,430
It looks incredibly juicy
and decadent with flavor!

301
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,332
That's more powerful
than smokin' it.

302
00:14:58,432 --> 00:14:59,666
[IKUMI] Oh!
[RYOKO] Amazing!

303
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,502
It's totally different
from anything!

304
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:04,605
[YUKI]
Whaaaatttttt?!

305
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,208
[ERINA]
It's so seductive,

306
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:09,576
it's enticing the eater
to shed its constricted dress.

307
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:13,047
Help! I cannot wait
a moment longer!

308
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,550
(Leonora foodgasming)

309
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,921
[LEONORA]
The dressing uses extra virgin
olive oil and wine vinegar.

310
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:22,789
Even the saury's liver
has been dressed.

311
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,858
The bold taste of the liver
spreads across the tongue,

312
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,827
accentuating the
sweetness of the flesh!

313
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,663
I feel I could drown in the
outpouring depths of flavor!

314
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,333
God! It's a compilation of
so many different spices
I can't think!

315
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:37,804
That's wrong!
He has used but only the
one spice known as allspice!

316
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:38,905
What the?!

317
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,707
He used just
one flavoring in that?

318
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,676
But isn't blending
a bunch of spices together

319
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,812
to create the ultimate aroma
his main weapon?

320
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:47,914
[ERINA]
<i>No.</i>

321
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,750
<i>His ability to</i>
<i>manipulate aromas</i>

322
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,752
<i>is more than just</i>
<i>mixing them together.</i>

323
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:54,588
<i>By cutting back on flavorings,</i>
<i>he was able to elevate</i>

324
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,858
<i>the fresh taste of seasonal</i>
<i>saury to new heights.</i>

325
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,794
Well then what was
that wealth of aroma
that came bursting out?

326
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:04,031
It was an even match
for Ryo's cartoccio.

327
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,268
Please, yes. That was not to
be possible just by charring.

328
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:09,303
Ha. It was kaeshi.

329
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:12,539
I brushed some on
the surface of the fish
just before serving it.

330
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,807
"Kaeshi, huh"?

331
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,343
You mean like tsubamegaeshi?
Kojiro Sasaki?

332
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,812
Obviously, you have no idea
what that term means.

333
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,082
And no, that's not right.
Okay listen...

334
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:25,152
Kaeshi is a seasoning made
by adding mirin or sake
to soy sauce.

335
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:28,755
It becomes a dipping sauce
for soba noodles,
when adding dashi stock

336
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:33,160
It's viewed as an all‐purpose
condiment for any number
of Japanese dishes.

337
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,498
And that is why, even with
the high temperatures of
a hand held blow‐torch;

338
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:39,733
it's hard to get a fish
to burn properly...

339
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,470
but the sugars in the kaeshi
make it easier to get
a good char.

340
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,472
I think I understand now.

341
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:49,143
By using a short burst of heat,
you were able to preserve
the saury's fresh flavor.

342
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:53,180
[AKIRA]
That heat caused both the
saury's fat and the sugars
in the kaeshi to bubble,

343
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,915
allowing it to
surface correctly.

344
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:57,984
In other words, I took the
conflicting theories of aroma...

345
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:01,922
and presented them both
on this single saury plate,
creating a balance.

346
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:04,225
[GIN]
<i>Ryo Kurokiba</i>
<i>and Akira Hayama...</i>

<i>clashed just once?</i>

348

<i>The duck dish that Akira Hayama</i>

to follow the doctrine
of knowing spices.

It's almost too much to take.

To someone for whom rice
is a staple, this will
bring unbridled joy.

(Yuki sceams)
[MEGUMI] So delicious!

389

his crusty‐lookin' fish,

I wasn't sure
how this would turn out.

Oh yeah. He pickled
that puppy in rice bran!

392

The happiness of fall is
rushing through my body...

408
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,524
tip toeing through the leaves.

409
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:53,194
Such a soft and
fluid wash of flavor!

410
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:55,162
The saury was
charcoal grilled and then‐

411
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,198
[LEONORA]
Once it was charcoal grilled,
it was cooked with the rice.

412
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:59,166
Such attention to detail
is what resulted in

413
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,668
the rice's splendid depth of
flavor and refinement.

414
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,270
And the saury itself
is wonderful!

415
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,207
It has a depth of salt‐based
umami as well as a gentle aroma,

416
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:09,043
both of which spread across
the tongue in a dance of joy!

417
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,778
The quality of this rivals or
surpasses that of other two.

418
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,247
Tell me sweet boy.

419
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:15,516
Is this rich flavor the result
of pickling the saury?

420
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:20,387
[GIN]
Indeed. In Hokkaido,
it is a traditional
and long‐beloved favorite.

421
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,156
It brings out the umami...

422
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:26,527
reducing unwanted odors
from the saury,
increasing nutritional value,

423
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,695
and for some is
the best way to eat it.

424
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:33,567
Soma Yukihira, you've done
a brilliant job of lifting
the saury's true flavors...

425
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,702
It was a bit of
a race against time,

426
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,004
but nothing I couldn't handle.

427
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,373
I got the best saury
I could from the market

428
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,776
and did a lot of experimenting
with the possibilities
while they were fermenting.

429
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:46,947
And I tinkered with some other
aging methods other than
pickling, as well.

430
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,550
Now, when it comes to the very
best the season has to offer,

431
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,586
I couldn't come up with anything
that could truly compete.

432
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,356
But, at the last moment, I was
finally able to come up with

433
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,425
an aging method I was
happy with ‐ rice bran.

434
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:02,929
It was all thanks to Ms. Fumio
and her pickled late‐night
snack at the dorm.

435
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,866
Plus, I got a little help
from some of my friends.

436
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,501
They were my inspiration.

437
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,571
You're saying you
arrived at this method
of aging on your own?!

438
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,207
I thought your blade
to be blunt...

439
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:17,411
but instead, you presented
a fine sword indeed!

440
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:21,482
Like a sword‐smith forging
steel of historic renown.

441
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:26,187
You have struck your hammer,
on your own "sword of fall"!

445
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,320
Yup! No complaints here!

446
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,155
That's sure to get him
great reviews‐

447
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:11,158
Ah! The director!
He hasn't bared his chest!

448
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:12,426
[BOY] Dude!
[STUDENT] Yeah.

449
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,728
[ZENJI]
And both Dojima
and Leonora...

450
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,731
have put down both
their chopsticks.
[SATO] That mean somethin'?

451
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:20,234
[OIZUMI]
<i>Huh? Must be because Young Soma</i>

452
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:23,670
<i>lost too much time making up</i>
<i>for a less‐trained eye.</i>

453
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,108
<i>The idea for his dish must not</i>
<i>approach that of the other two!</i>

454
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:30,277
[GIRL] Sure enough, there was
no way he could beat them.
[BOY] Yeah, I guess...

455
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:32,979
[STUDENT]
Like I thought, this battle
is going to be between...

456
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,448
[BOY]
...Ryo and Akira.

457
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:37,084
[SOMA]
I think you guys
might want a little more.

458
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:39,520
Anyone up for seconds?

459
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,923
This competition... is over

460
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:44,325
Oh, Soma!

461
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:51,832
This will now conclude...
all the judging for today‐

462
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,201
[SOMA]
Because if you were
up for seconds...

463
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:57,438
I was thinking I might pour in
a little splash of this.

464
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:58,739
[SENZAEMON]
Hmm?

465
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,606
[LEONORA] Huh?
[GIN] What?

466
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:00,674
(Akira &amp; Ryo gasp)

467
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,577
[SOMA]
My saury dish...

468
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:07,848
isn't quite done yet.

469
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,284
You are now about to witness...

470
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:13,354
...all of its sharp flavor!

471
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,993
[NARRATOR]
