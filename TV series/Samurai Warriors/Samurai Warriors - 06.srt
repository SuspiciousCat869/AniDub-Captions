[YUKIMURA pants]
What's the matter?

322
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,208
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you some help.

[KUNOICHI pants]

324
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,833
Don't be scared.

You're gonna be okay, I promise.

[YUKIMURA grunts]

327
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,083
Almost there.

328
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,583
It's just a little bit farther!

329
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,083
[KUNOICHI]
He's always been like this.

[YUKIMURA grunts]

331
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,625
[KUNOICHI]
Lord Yukimura!

332
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,666
Here you go!

00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,833
[TSUKIMARU squeaks]

334
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:36,541
Understood. And you believe
this is the best way forward?

335
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,375
[KANETSUGU]
Yes.

336
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,958
Then we'll go to Yonezawa.

337
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,416
Yes, lord!

338
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:57,541
Who goes there?

339
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,000
Stand down!

340
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,500
[YUKIMURA grunts]

00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,458
[BLUE GUARDS gasp]

342
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,875
That's Yukimura Sanada!

343
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,583
He's getting away!

[TSUKIMARU squeaks]

345
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,541
Stop right there! Now!

[BLUE GUARDS shout, cough]

347
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,666
[KUNOICHI]
Lord Yukimura! This way!

Please follow me!

[TSUKIMARU squeaks]

350
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,125
What is the meaning of this?

00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,541
[DOCTOR gasps]

352
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,166
[YUKIMURA]
This child needs your help.

353
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,291
She has a dangerously
high fever.

354
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,375
[gasps]
Wait, you're...

355
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,250
Poor thing is burning up.

356
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,750
She'll be safe with me.

357
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,625
Thank you, doctor.

They've come for us!

00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,208
I willingly surrender!

[gasps]

363
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,708
[INA] You've returned.
I'm so glad to see your face.

[NOBUYUKI exhales]

365
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,291
I'm sorry to worry you.

366
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,958
[INA]
It's fine.

367
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,291
This is quite a momentous day.

368
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,625
I hereby declare that I
shall bequeath the title

369
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,000
of Seii Taishogun to my son,
Hidetada Tokugawa.

[MASANORI]
This is wrong!

373
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,250
[KIYOMASA]
It should be Lord Hideyori.

374
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,250
I ask that from
this moment forward,

375
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,333
each of you pledge your aid
to ensure his peaceful rule.

Yes, my lord!

[chuckles]

378
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,625
[NOBUYUKI]
This is quite premature.

379
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,708
The Toyotomi daimyo
will not stand for this.

380
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,833
I fear for Yukimura.

381
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,416
And I'm afraid it will throw
the world into war yet again.

[HIDETADA laughs]

383

Everybody kneel before
your new Shogun!

I knew that I was always
destined for greatness!

00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,291
Huh?

387
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,791
[YUKIMURA shouts]

388
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,458

[HIDETADA whimpers]

391
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,083
My father may have
spared his life,

392
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,375
but I shall have
him put to death.

393
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll have his head!

394
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,083
I'll show no mercy!

[NAOMASA]
To serve my lord, Tokugawa,

397
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,041
I shall do what I must.

the spear of the soul leads
