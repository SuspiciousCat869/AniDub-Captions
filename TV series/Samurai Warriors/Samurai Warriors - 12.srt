10
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,208
I wonder...

11
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,250
Whose souls will they
lead to the underworld?

12
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:54,500
They look like a sea of flames,
threatening to engulf us.

Their conflagration of fiery red

Head straight to Osaka castle.

[NARRATION] The Toyotomi
were greatly outnumbered.

39
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,666
Their strategy relied on
concentrating their forces

into a spear-like formation.

41

With the intention
to pierce their way

through the invading army.

43

The Tokugawa responded
by closing in

By pulling in the enemy forces,

53
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,625
they created space for
Yukimura to circumvent

54

[HIDEYORI] These foot

A few more rounds
of cannon fire,

72
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,625
and victory will be
theirs to claim.

However,
