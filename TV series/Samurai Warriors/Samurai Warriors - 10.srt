the Tokugawa were staved off

by the Toyotomi's

and fierce determination.

The newly constructed
Sanada ward

also served as a major deterrent

[KEIJI] Yukimura, you're as
good a warrior as they say!

I appreciate the sentiment,
but my soldiers

62
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,791
deserve all the praise.

But thanks to you,
morale in our ranks

is higher than ever before.

65
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,875
And the ward you
created is invincible.

66
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,500
That's the whole reason why
I named it the Sanada ward!

Aw, thank you, Tsukimaru.

They're calling it
the Sanada ward?

This battle...
has only just begun.

73

The Toyotomi are trapped
inside their castle.

If we stay the course,
victory is ours.

[KANETSUGU] Seems Yukimura
is playing a central role

in the castle's defense.

77
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,916
I imagined that once
he came to Osaka

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,333
that would be the case.

[LEAD MUSKETEER 10A]
Next rotation! Hurry!

81
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,375
Why are we not
firing back at them?

82
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,875
Because the angle and elevation

83
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,916
from which they're shooting
gives them an advantage

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,500
on their range. For our
guns to reach them,

85
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,250
we must get much closer.

86
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,625
So then order your
men to push forward!

87

The enemy is rotating
their gunners,

but not very quickly.

89
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,375
We are taking advantage
of this by moving forward

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,416
and Toyotomi will suffer
losses far too great to bear.

328
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,916
We ask that you
consider a truce.

329
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,041
Nobuyuki!

330
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,583
[NOBUYUKI]
Stay out of this.

331
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,125
[YUKIMURA] If Lord Hideyori
refuses your offer,

332
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,333
tell me. What will you do, then?

333
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,500
[NOBUYUKI]
You know what I will do.

334
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,625
Please lower your
spear, Yukimura.

335
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,250
[gasps]

336
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,333
I will speak with him

337
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,250
about our terms.

338
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,958
You have made a wise decision.

339
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,416
Are you certain, my lord?

340
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,958
Look. All this destruction.

341
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,541
If I have a chance to
stop it, I must take it.

342
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,916
[growls]

343
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:06,291
[horn sounds]

344
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,583
Nobuyuki.

345
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,541
You've truly done it.

346
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,875
Heh.

347
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,916
Cease your fire!

348
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:28,208
[MASANORI sobs]

349
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,125
[MASANORI]
Kiyomasa. Kiyomasa.

350
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,125
Kiyomasa!

351
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,875
This will not satisfy
the Tokugawa for long.

352
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,500
[NOBUYUKI] The next battle
will end all fighting.

353
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:52,375
[WARRIORS]
Samurai Warriors Highschool!

354
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,875
This will be
covered on the exam!

355
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,875
[YUKIMURA]
Be... covered... on... exam...

356
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:58,875
[gasps]

357
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,541
[gasps]

358
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:09,541
[NOBUYUKI] Yukimura,
I'm watching out for you.

359
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,000
[YUKIMURA]
Brother.

360
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,250
Nobuyuki Sanada!
Go back to class!

361
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,750
[YUKIMURA]
And he can't even hide well!

362
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,333
[NOBUYUKI chuckles]

363
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,916
[NARRATION] The seeds of war
have grown into thorny vines,

364
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,166
ensnaring all who
tread among them.

365
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,541
Will they reach the peace
on the other side?

366
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,041
Or be strangled by
the bloody brambles?

367
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,041
The final battle
is on the horizon.

368
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,833
