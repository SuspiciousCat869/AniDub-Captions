do we see these smiles?

163
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,750
Is it those like you,
who take delight in war?

164
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,166
War can be a tool of governance.

165
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,500
But I take no delight in it.

166
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,875
Then explain to me.

167
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,250
Although bloodshed
could have been avoided,

168
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,750
you chose to stain the
fields at Sekigahara.

169
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,875
Tragically, that
battle was inevitable,

170
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,916
in order to protect
the rule of the Toyotomi.

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,291
Of course. I see.

172
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,041
While we're on the subject...

173
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,625
I've heard talk that Ronin
from all over the land

174
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,833
have been traveling to Osaka.

175
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,291
The rumors say they
are gathering there

176
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,041
for a war against the Tokugawa.

177
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,458
Unfortunately, that battle
you deemed "inevitable"

178
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,166
created many Ronin in its wake.

179
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,500
They are merely
looking for direction.

180
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,041
I'd like to steer them
away from another war.

181
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,041
In that respect,
you should thank me.

182
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,250
So,

183
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,625
is it true that
Yukimura Sanada was allowed

184
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,791
to enter Osaka Castle?

185
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:26,875
Yes.

186
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,458
I believe that's
happened over 30 times.

[HIDEYORI]
That name has garnered

189
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,125
quite a fierce reputation.

Those who adopt it demand a
high price for their services.

191

Sadly, there's no way
to tell which, if any,

00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,583
is truly him.

assist me in that regard?

The proliferation of
such rumors exposes

a general unease in the nation.

The intended purpose
of this meeting today

was to quell this restlessness
by making you an offer.

I'm afraid that I can't.

00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,125
I find the climate of
Edo less than pleasant.

And the women back
home would miss me.

How dare you--

208

But if you're so eager
to share my company,

209
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,583
you're more than welcome
to live in Osaka.

Since you have

As you said,
the climate of Osaka

215

does not suit me
very well, either.

216
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,708
And Hidetada still
needs guidance

in the ways of governance.

218
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,166
I feel I owe it to Edo
to stay and do my part

219
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,750
to help it grow.

220
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,250
I have heard
Edo is prospering.

221
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,750
And that the castle there
is being fortified, as well.

they say it rivals the one
my father built in Osaka.

You've made it obvious
you'd like the nation

to be led from Edo.

324
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,416
attack Osaka.

325
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,541
Let 'em attack!

326
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,791
They're gonna regret it!

327
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,041
Lord Hideyoshi himself
built this castle

328
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,041
to be the strongest
of any nation!

329
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,333
It will not fall!

330
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,791
Lord Hideyori!

331
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,416
We are ready for anyone
foolish enough to take us on!

332
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,416
Yukimura.

333
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,416
Lord!

334
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,083
[HIDEYORI]
What are your thoughts?

335
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,458
If I led their army,
I'd attack from the South.

336
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,291
Earlier, I looked
around this castle

337
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,083
from the attacker's
point of view.

338
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,500
The rivers on three sides form
an excellent natural defense.

339
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,708
Besides the main fortress here,

340
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,333
there are multiple wards

341
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,208
and a large outer enclosure.

342
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,833
These factors all together
are quite formidable.

343
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,083
However, if an enemy
were to break through,

344
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,083
they would then be free
to regroup and assemble

345
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,958
their forces inside the
space within the outer wall.

346
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,041
[ALL gasp]

347
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,208
If I were trying to lay
siege to the castle,

348
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,666
I would concentrate my
troops on the south side,

349
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,375
which has no river,
and force my way in.

350
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,000
And once the enemy
has broken through,

351
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,583
there could be no way
to drive them back out.

352
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,750
I see. What then?

353
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,291
I've come up with a strategy.

354
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,000
[KIYOMASA]
This is quite ambitious.

355
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,625
It's like a fortress.

356
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,291
Yes. That's exactly what it is.

357
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,666
Another ward.

358
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,000
We will stop the
invaders inside it.

359
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,916
[TSUKIMARU squeaks]

360
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,666
You might as well just build
a whole 'nother castle.

361
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,166
This is an excellent idea!
We'll call it the Sanada ward!

362
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,791
Wait. You're naming it after me?

363
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,041
Well, that's what
you're supposed to do

364
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,708
with inventions, right?

365
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,666
Name 'em after the person
smart enough to think 'em up!

366
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,125
Sounds right to me!

367
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,541
It's a fitting name.

368
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,958
Sanada ward, it is!

369
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,291
[cheers]

[KUNOICHI giggles]

371
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,041
Between our guts, our men,
and this fortress,

372
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,916
the Tokugawa won't
stand a chance!

373
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,208
They're gonna wish
they never messed with us!

374
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,166
No matter how many
soldiers they wanna

375
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,166
throw at it,

376
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,041
Lord Hideyoshi's
castle won't fall!

377
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,000
Yes!

378
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,875
[KEIJI]
It's a real thing of beauty.

379
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,791
You should be proud
to put your name on it.

380
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,291
I hope you're right.

[NARRATION] In response
to Ieyasu's call to arms,

382
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,625
Daimyo from all over
the nation gathered

383
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,208
in the Tokugawa
stronghold of Edo.

384
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,458
[NARRATION] Ieyasu himself led
a large battalion of troops

385
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,958
heading southwest,
towards Osaka.

[WARRIORS yelling]

[NARRATION]
As their forces advanced,

388
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,541
they encountered many
pockets of resistance.

389
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,458
No Toyotomi loyalists
were spared.

390
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,208
[NARRATION]
In little time,

391
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,250
the Tokugawa army--
over 200,000 soldiers strong--

392
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,458
surrounded Osaka castle.

393
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,541
[NARRATION]
Their ranks more than doubled

394
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,250
those of the Toyotomi.

395
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,291
[TAKATORA] Those fools still
cling to Hideyoshi's dream.

396
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,791
That they would rule
over a land of peace.

397
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,250
It's time they woke up
and faced reality.

[gasps]

399

Lord Hideyori really
knows his presentation.

400
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,625
Look at the color of
the armor on our soldiers.

401
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,208
It feels like we're
back in Ueda Castle!

402
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,250
[HIDEYORI] The warrior's heart
gave life to the Sanada's men.

403

They stared death in the
face and never backed down.

404
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,208
Now their heart has returned.

them with the same vigor
