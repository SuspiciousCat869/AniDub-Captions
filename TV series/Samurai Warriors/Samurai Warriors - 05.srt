The summer grasses

00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:15,416
rise from where brave warriors
dared to dream a dream.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,125
It was a dream many
warriors shared.

4
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,416
To unite this fractured
land under their banner.

8
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:33,000
But now, one warrior has made
that elusive dream a reality.

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,208
Hideyoshi Toyotomi.

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,583
It would seem that he,

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,750
has sown peace in the land
by the tip of his spear.

12
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,583
However...

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,666
After his sudden passing,
chaos began to grow again.

Threatening to
disrupt the balance

so many others died to achieve.

16
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,458
Ieyasu Tokugawa
seized this opportunity

17
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,541
to expand his influence.

18
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:56,500
Mitsunari Ishida vowed to
halt his quest for power.

19
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,833
The two met on the
field at Sekigahara.

20
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,625
The outcome of this battle would
determine who holds the reigns

21

on the land once and for all.

22
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,375
Having sworn an oath of
righteousness and solidarity

23
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,875
with Mitsunari, Kanetsugu Naoe
attempted to lead Uesugi's

24
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:13,125
forces and bring Tokugawa's
march to a halt.

25
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:16,166
They were met by The One-Eyed
Dragon, Masamune Date.

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,625
He and his men saw to
it that the Uesugi army

27

did not reach Sekigahara.

With Hidetada's failed
siege on Ueda castle

smile on Mitsunari.

Many things shift with the
winds of war, however.

32

Betrayal and soft-hearted
decisions wreaked havoc

on the Western Army,
and in the end,

00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,041
They're saying Tokugawa
will attack us any day now!

161
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,125
That's nothing but idle chatter.

162
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,291
And even if that
scenario were to happen,

163
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,250
Osaka castle won't fall to
such a blowhard like Ieyasu.

164
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,583
But still...

165
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,375
And he wouldn't dare
challenge Lord Hideyori.

166
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,291
So calm your fears.

167
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,666
[MAIDS]
Yes ma'am.

168
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,916
[NARRATION] Kai, the woman
who once crossed blades

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,833
with Yukimura in Odawara,
now calls Osaka castle her home.

170
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,500
She is a fearsome warrior
faithful to the Toyotomi.

171
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,541
I thought that I
might find you here.

172
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,291
Lord Hideyori.

173
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,750
My lady, Kai.
Is there a problem?

174
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,291
[NARRATION]
His father no longer alive,

175
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,041
Hideyori claimed his birthright

176
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,500
and assumed rule
over the Toyotomi.

177
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,333
There is much uneasy talk
amongst your vassals.

178
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,125
Perhaps they need to hear
your calm and reassuring voice

179
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,875
to relieve their tensions.

180
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,166
My voice?

181
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,291
What's wrong?

182
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,291
You know Mitsunari
was defeated.

183
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,625
The people fear that Tokugawa

184
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,833
has his sights on
our house next?

185
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,583
They do. Should they my lord?

186
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,125
[HIDEYORI] Tokugawa swore
fealty to the house of Toyotomi.

187
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,625
Nothing will change
but the seasons.

188
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,041
The chrysanthemums
all lose their blooms.

189
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,875
The sky darkens and
the ground grows cold.

190
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,208
[KAI]
What?

191
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,666
[HIDEYORI chuckles]

[KAI] Wow, he must have
his father's charm.

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,208
[NOBUYUKI] I will read
the sentence aloud.

195
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,791
Yukimura Sanada,

196
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,458
you shall be exiled to
the Mount Koya region.

197
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,708
[gasps]

198
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,333
[NOBUYUKI] Confined indefinitely
to Mount Kudo.

199
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,500
[NARRATION] Yukimura's life may
have been spared by Tokugawa,

200
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,916
but it was no longer his own.

201
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,083
This punishment, known as
"Chikkyo," or house arrest,

202
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,375
was a way to isolate

203
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,458
and render an insubordinate
samurai powerless.

204
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,750
Chikkyo?

205
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,375
That's the sentence? Not death?

206
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,083
[YUKIMURA] Why would
he allow me to live?

207
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,458
I sided with his enemy!

208
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,708
I threatened the life
of his favorite son!

209
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,375
I was willing to die in my
fight against the Tokugawa

210
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,458
and I still am!

211
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,291
Wait... Tell the truth.

212
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,375
Brother, did you beg
forgiveness on my behalf?

213
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,333
You have a right to know.

214
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,000
I did not.

215
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,458
Though it pains me say this,

216
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,541
his life is forfeit.

217
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,083
I understand.

218
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,125
Sanada will be sentenced...

219
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,708
[HIDETADA chuckles]

220
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,125

Father, are you mad?

228
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,458
His very existence is a
threat to the Tokugawa--

229
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,791
[IEYASU]
Silence!

[gasps]

231

You brought shame
upon our house!

232
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,541
You were to join us
on the battlefield!

But your frivolous distraction
nearly cost us the war!

I shall sentence you to
confinement as well!

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,500
But father, have mercy!

That's mercy!

Yes, my lord.

And Nobuyuki.

I order you to deliver
Yukimura's sentence

[NOBUYUKI]
Yes, my lord.

[NOBUYUKI]
So you see.

245
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,666
It was Lord Ieyasu's charity and
honor that spared your life,

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,333
not I.

How can you speak of honor
when I've had mine taken?

[YUKIMURA grunts]

A warrior like me walks his
path staring death in the face,

not living in shame!
You know that!

What will I say when
we meet again?

When I see Master Mitsunari
in the afterlife?

I'll commit seppuku to save
face if that's the only way!

Look, you can believe life
will be nothing but shame,

if that's what you choose.

262
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,666
However, you can also believe
you live for a reason.

263
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,791
And what reason would that be?

264

Tell me!

00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,958
[NOBUYUKI]
I can't.

You are the only one
with that answer.

Look inside yourself and
discover what that is.

268

From now on, I will guard
both our family castles.

I will ensure the
Sanada's survival.

That's what I'm living for.

You will find your next purpose
in this life, I know it.

You said it to me yourself.

Advocating mercy in this case

But I did not follow my heart.

00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,625
It's insignificant.

320
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,416
I let it keep me
from the sentencing.

321
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,583
I would have demanded his head.

322
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,708
[MASANORI]
You know what?

323
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,041
[KIYOMASA]
Hm?

324
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm actually kinda relieved
about what happened.

325
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,375
You mean Yukimura's sentencing?

326
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,791
[MASANORI]
Yeah.

327
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,958
[MASANORI]
I dunno, he's...

328
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,000
He's just really solid.

329
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,625
He does whatever
he thinks is right

330
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,083
no matter what the cost may be.

331
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,541
To be honest with ya,
we need more guys like him.

332
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,875
[TADAKATSU] I must
confess my surprise, my lord.

333
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,000
I didn't expect you
to spare his life.

334
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,208
[IEYASU]
Tell me.

335
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,750
Why did you advocate
against death for him?

336
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,541
Because my daughter is
his older brother's wife.

337
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,416
Nobuyuki has been
a devoted husband.

338
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,875
I didn't wish to bring more
unhappiness to the family.

339
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,666
[TADAKATSU]
That, and...

340
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,875
Honestly, I'd like to
face Yukimura again

341
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,958
in battle one day.

342
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,166
I remember when he and I
clashed for the first time.

343
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,958
My blood was boiling
from the intensity.

344
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,125
It had been an eternity
since fighting gave me

345
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,083
that kind of feeling.

346
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,875
[IEYASU] Doubtless, there will
be more fighting to come.

347
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,458
[gasps]

348
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,500
To create this world of
peace to which we aspire,

349
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,250
we must first destroy the
world of warfare.

350
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,416
You mean...

351
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
We must destroy the
world as it is now?

352
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,291
[IEYASU]
I do.

353
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,500
To end this era of conflict
with an act so univocal,

354
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,000
no one could deny
its termination.

355
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,750
That requires a sacrifice.

356
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,750
One lone death to save
innumerable lives.

357
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,000
This man needs to be
a valiant warrior.

358
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,666
We must exhibit him as
samurai among samurai

359
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,916
and cut him down for all to see.

360
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,916
The exile is just to bide
time until his death.

361
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,666
[IEYASU] We all must pay a
price for peace in this world.

362
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:15,166
[HIDETADA shouts]

363
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,666
It's not fair!

364
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,208
I don't deserve to be treated
like some common criminal!

365
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,458
They did this to me!

366
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,958
Those vile Sanadas
were never to be trusted!

367
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,375
They... made a fool of me!

368
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,291
[KOTARO]
Then, they must be eliminated.

[KOTARO]
Imagine your vengeance.

374
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:48,000
I can make your blood-soaked
dreams a murderous reality.

Beloved brother and sister.

I bid you farewell.

379
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,666
These dark days will soon pass.

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,250
I know.

381
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,708
Still, the cherry
blossoms bloom and fall.

382
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,250
Keep our home safe.

383
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,208
Godspeed brother.

[SOLDIER 1]
Lord Yukimura! Please!

Let me go with you!

[VASSAL 4] Me too!
I will follow you there!

Lord Yukimura!

But, my lord!

Listen well, all of you.

I leave you with
one final order.

You all must swear that
you'll remain in Ueda

00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,500
and serve my brother.

the "great unifying leader."
