00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,666
[NARRATION] The Tokugawa
laid siege to Osaka castle

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,500
with over 200,000 soldiers.

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:17,750
Historians would later dub this
the Osaka winter campaign.

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,208
The fighting raged on, until the
Toyotomi accepted the truce

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,708
offered by the invading army.

6
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,000
According to the terms
of this armistice,

7
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,750
Hideyori would be absolved
of any responsibility

8
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,333
for the battle. It also
allowed the Toyotomi

9
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,500
to maintain possession
of the Osaka province.

10
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,708
Less favorable to them

11
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,583
were the conditions
that they must demolish

12
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,416
the secondary and tertiary
wards of their castle

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
and fill the outer moat.

14
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,250
[NARRATION] The razing of
these wards began immediately,

15
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,208
with both sides working
together on the destruction.

16
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,958
But what truly
stood between them

17
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,958
was the blood of thousands
lost in the conflict.

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:03,125
Resentments etched into the
spirits of those who survived.

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,541
I just can't believe
that we're being forced

20
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,166
to tear down Lord
Hideyoshi's castle.

21
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,666
Please forgive us, my lord.

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,166
[WORKER 11C]
Shh!

23
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,083
[MASANORI] What the hell
do you think you're doing?

24
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,375
We're supposed
to be in charge of

25
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,916
taking this one down!

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,250
That must be the reason why
work has not yet begun on it.

27
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,541
[YUKIMURA]
Be reasonable!

28
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,375
How could we do that
when we also need to start

29
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,291
reconstruction of the main ward?

30
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,958
That's precisely why
I am offering

31
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,416
our help with this.

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,833
I think you bastards have
"helped" enough around here!

33
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,791
Who can say how long
this will take you?

34
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,958
I can't have you
dragging your feet.

35
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,166
Do you wanna fight
about this, huh?

36
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,916
Honestly, I do not.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,083
But if we must...

38
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,416
So be it.

39
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,833
Let's go then!

40
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,958
Hey, cut it out, you two!

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,541
[KEIJI]
We already had a war.

42
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,125
Let's not start another one!

43
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,000
He's asking for it!

44
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,791
Do you really think
fighting this guy

45
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,875
is gonna help out
Lord Hideyori in any way?

46
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,333
[grunts]

47
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,250
Tch.

48
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,291
I thought you would know better

49
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:07,041
than to egg him on
like that. You do, right?

50
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,041
[NARRATION] The Tokugawa forces
completed the demolition

51
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,750
of the tertiary ward
and filled the outer moat.

52
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,916
They went on to topple
the secondary ward,

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,291
a job intended for the Toyotomi.

54
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,208
In addition, they filled
the inner moat,

55
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,916
which was not listed in
the terms of the truce.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,375
My heart is ripped to shreds.

57
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,875
I'm so sorry.

58
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,208
This place has been your home.

59
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,166
It's not for my
own sentimentality

60
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,083
that I weep today.

61
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,666
My father didn't
build this castle

62
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,333
for the sake of our family.

63
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,250
He did it to provide
stability and hope

64
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,208
for the townspeople.
For them to feel safe.

65
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,583
To smile.

66
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,000
And when they looked
upon my father

67
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,458
and what he had built, they did.

68
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,333
My lord, I know
exactly what you mean.

69
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,833
A castle

70
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,708
is where a warrior's
heart can find rest.

71
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:09,750
The people it protects are
a balm to the wounds of battle.

72
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,958
[MASANORI grunts]

73
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,708
Damn them! Damn Tokugawa!

74
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:20,541
They took Uncle Hideyoshi's
dream and tore it to pieces!

75
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,875
[HIDEYOSHI] I will bring this
fractured land together!

76
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,833
And thus, create
a peaceful world

77
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,375
where everybody in it
can smile again!

78
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,791
But I need you!

79
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,666
I can't make this dream
come true without your help!

80
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,750
Ieyasu was right there
with us that day.

81
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,375
And now this castle
is practically naked.

82
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,208
You're right.

83
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,625
Another pounding and the
whole thing's going down!

84
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,750
Was that their plan all along?

85
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,958
Lord Hideyori!

86
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,333
We gotta get ready
for another round!

87
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:57,833
Well...

88
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,291
Your thoughts?

89
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,541
What do you advise we do?

90
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,541
This will not satisfy
the Tokugawa for long.

91
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,458
The next battle
will end all fighting.

92
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,625
Beyond the shadow of a doubt,

93
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,250
there will be another
clash with the Tokugawa.

94
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,125
I know you're right.

95
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,125
[NARRATION] Once the castle
was reduced to a fraction

96
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,083
of its former
strength and grandeur,

97
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,500
Takatora Todo had another
message to deliver

98
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,833
from the victors.

99
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,541
The Tokugawa had more
demands that must be met.

100
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,708
First, that all Ronin
inside the fortress,

101
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,833
which included Maeda
and Yukimura, be expelled.

102
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,666
And that Hideyori
himself leave the castle.

103
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,833
Hideyori could not
accept these conditions,

104
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,791
and thus, the truce was
rendered null and void.

105
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,041
Nothing stood in the
way of more warfare.

106
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,208
[KAI]
There you are.

107
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,625
Forgive my candor, my lord,

108
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,000
but we will not
survive another battle.

109
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,541
Do you think it's
wise to fight again?

110
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,125
The state of the castle

111
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,666
reflects the state
of the Toyotomi.

112
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,791
Our secondary and
tertiary wards are rubble.

113
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,000
We have no moat for protection.

114
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,458
We are naked. Vulnerable.

115
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,375
But we are not alone.

116
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,000
We have people who love us,

who would do anything for us.

Their lives

are more dear to me
than even my own,

that the winds of fate

are at the backs
of the Tokugawa.

124
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,666
But as Toyotomi, we stand
against these currents,

strongly they may blow.

of Hideyori's refusal,

to all the Tokugawa Daimyo.

such things to me, my lord?

162
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,125
The cost is great.

163
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,250
Many will pay with their lives.

164
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,583
But still,

165
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,000
I will carry the stones
marking every single grave

166
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,625
on my shoulders
without complaint.

167
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,666
I'm beginning to
understand what the stakes

168
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,000
of this war truly are.

169
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,166
The sacrifice made
to attain one's goal

170
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,583
determines the value.

171
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,125
Those reached without
pain are empty.

172
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,458
That's right.

173
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,083
Those stones will build
the foundation for peace.

174
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,541
We must endure the struggle
no matter how painful.

175
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,458
[IEYASU] For the sake of
building a lasting peace,

176
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,458
the stone you must
carry will be the one

177
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,916
marking your brother's grave.

178
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,750
[NOBUYUKI]
Yes.

179
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,958
If it will bring an end
to this era of warfare,

180
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,000
I shall face my brother
and strike him down.

181
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,500
[HIDETADA]
War for peace.

182
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,416
[NOBUYUKI]
Lord Hidetada.

183
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,708
I hope this night
finds you well.

184
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,000
Of course, it's you again.

185
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,416
Were you sucking up
to my father tonight?

186
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,541
It couldn't be more transparent.

187
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,041
You can't even
be bothered enough

188
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,666
to furrow your brow or sneer,

189
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,416
you're so high and mighty.

190
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,083
I know you believe
that I'm beneath you.

191
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,750
A spoiled idiot with
an elaborate title.

192
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,916
A figure head.

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,291
Is that all that you consider
yourself to be, my lord?

194
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,625
[HIDETADA growls] It's the
truth! There's no denying it!

195
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,666
Father makes every
single decision!

196
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,791
I do absolutely nothing
for the Tokugawa!

197
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,458
I completely detest
warfare and battle!

198
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,166
And I don't give a damn
about honor in combat!

199
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,916
Does this sound
remotely like anything

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,083
that someone deserving
the title of Shogun

201
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,000
would ever admit to?

202
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,291
You say that you detest war.

203
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,208
I find that quite honorable.

204
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,458
You do?

205
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,208
I'm being honest with you.

206
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,708
War is something that
deserves to be hated.

207
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,583
And the one who leads
this nation should do

208
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,416
everything he can to prevent it.

209
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,666
But I don't know if I
have the power to do that.

210
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,125
[NOBUYUKI]
You find it

211
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,166
or the spirits of
those lost to warfare

212
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,875
will never rest in peace.

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,791
Hey now!

214
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,666
I will not be scolded by you!

215
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,791
That's why I can't
stand you Sanadas!

216
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,541
[NARRATION]
Once more, Tokugawa mobilized

217
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,833
a colossal army.

218
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,791
They marched towards
Osaka for the battle

219
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,250
to end it all.

220
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,291
You know exactly what
you're gonna do, don't ya?

221
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,625
I'll have to take Ieyasu's head.

222
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,000
That's the only way that
we can truly claim victory.

223
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,166
Now you're talkin'
like a real samurai.

224
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,666
[KEIJI] Slice through the
enemy forces like sawgrass

225
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,958
until you get to
the bastard's camp.

226
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,583
Works for me.

227
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:11,041
I place my life solely
on my own spear.

228
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,458
Exactly the way that
a true samurai should.

229
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,750
In the past,

230
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,333
the Takeda cavalry
was considered

231
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,750
the most powerful force,

232
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,041
but they were rendered obsolete
by the Oda matchlocks.

233
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,500
Defeated.

234
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,916
Osaka castle was thought
to be invincible,

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,416
but the Tokugawa's
cannons proved

236
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,041
that wasn't the case either.

237
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,833
They reduced it to rubble.

238
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,625
As the times change,
wars will no longer

239
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,666
be fought hand to hand--

240
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,375
crossing swords,
a thing of the past.

241
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,833
And that's why

242
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,375
I am going to honor the
traditional way of the samurai.

243
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,458
Charging with spear in hand.

244
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,541
This final battle demands it.

245
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,541
[KEIJI]
The final one, huh?

246
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,041
I wonder how he sees this.

247
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,541
Your brother.

248
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,458
[YUKIMURA] Nobuyuki is
no longer my brother.

I know you don't want
him to risk his life.

He is my lord.

254
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,541
It's not my place to
tell him what to do.

Are you serious?

[KUNOICHI]
He has to make this final stand.

257
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,875
He has to go and carry out

258
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,958
what he believes in
his heart is right.

259

He can be a strong warrior,

What is it?

323
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,166
When this battle's
reached its end,

324
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,958
I'd like for you...

325
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,291
For me to what?

326
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,041
I'd like...

327
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,375
...for us to see the
cherry blossoms in Ueda!

328
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,875
I would like that as well.

329
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,500
Of course. Let's go.

330
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,666
You and I will
see them, together.

331
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,291
So it's a promise.

332
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,000
Which means you're
also promising

333
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,375
that you'll survive this fight.

334

[gasps]

335
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,166
[YUKIMURA]
Now promise me

336
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,125
that you'll hold onto this.

337
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,291
Please keep it safe with you

338
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,333
until I return here.

339
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,166
You promise?

340
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,333
I promise. I'll keep it safe.

341
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,791
[KUNOICHI]
I made my pledge long ago.

342
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,333
I will protect you.

343
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,583
Wherever you go,
I shall be your shadow.

344
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,541
He promised.

345
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,083
[TSUKIMARU sighs]

346
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,916
[KANETSUGU] Once again,
we gaze down upon Osaka.

347
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,541
We can not take this
battle past tomorrow.

348
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,416
Will you kill your brother?

349
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,416
His is the stone whose
weight I must shoulder.

350
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,666
[KANETSUGU]
The stone?

351
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,875
You share a similar burden.

352
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,875
You broke the oath
you swore with him

353
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,333
and Mitsunari to
protect the Uesugi.

354
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,166
Do you not still feel the
weight of that decision?

355
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,833
Yes, I do. Constantly.

356
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,916
For peace in this nation--

357
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,875
in order for everyday people
to live a happy life.

358
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,250
We samurai must carry
the weight on our shoulders.

359

[gasps]

360
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,333
What are you doing here?

361
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,708
[NENE] I came to clarify
something with you.

362
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,833
That this will be
the last battle.

363
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,458
Yes.

364
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,416
This nightmare will
make way for the dream

365
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,208
that we shared of
everyone smiling.

366
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,000
I swear it.

367
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:35,458
[NENE] Then I shall join my
husband and watch it all unfold.

368
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,291
And sleep in the
world of dreams.

369
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,916
On my honor.

370
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,583
I promise.

Samurai Warriors Highschool!

379
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,958
Mitsunari's totally
trolling us, man!

380
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,666
He wants us to
transfer to Kyushu

381
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,291
"because reasons and stuff"?

382
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,583
Yeah. Uber troll.

383
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,583
He should see my rage face!

Yeah. Stupid poser.

385
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,625
I'll show that dude a
facepalm he won't forget.

Yeah, dude.

387
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,458
We're gonna pwn him so hard

You're really reachin' there.

[KIYOMASA]
Ouch.

You two dorks are
like, so whatever.

with the hopes of
harvesting Ieyasu's head.
