[NARRATION]
The summer grasses

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:15,291
rise from where brave warriors
dared to dream a dream.

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,041
It was a dream many
warriors shared.

4
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,333
To unite this fractured
land under their banner.

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,416
Shingen Takeda.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Kenshin Uesugi.

7
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,208
Nobunaga Oda.

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:32,916
But now, one warrior has made
that elusive dream a reality.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,083
Hideyoshi Toyotomi.

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,458
It would seem that he,

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,625
has sown peace in the land
by the tip of his spear.

12
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,416
However...

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,541
After his sudden passing,
chaos begins to grow again.

14
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,041
Threatening to
disrupt the balance

15
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,291
so many others died to achieve.

16
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,791
Ieyasu Tokugawa seizes
this opportunity

17
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,541
to expand his influence.

18
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:56,416
Mitsunari Ishida vows to
halt his quest for power.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,375
The two men lead their
respective armies

20
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:02,125
in what will prove to be a
historic clash at Sekigahara.

21
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,500
Although the Sanada brothers
both desire to keep their

22
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,875
family name alive,
they take separate paths

23
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:10,458
in the hopes of someday merging
once again under one banner.

24
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,083
But those paths cross
in Hidetada Tokugawa's

25
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,791
ill-advised siege on Ueda.

26
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,250

once called home.

I refuse.

33

Lord Hidetada,
please retreat at once!

34

I'll ask you one more
time to get out of my way!

I will not.

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,583
[NARRATION]
Covered in a dense fog,

49
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,666
Sekigahara was eerily silent.

50
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,416
This silence would soon be
broken by the call to arms.

51
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,875
Followed by the savage
cacophony of combat.

52
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,666
Tranquility would not
return without a price.

53
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,250
Ieyasu Tokugawa's Eastern Army
had both Masanori Fukushima

54
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,291
and Kiyomasa Kato leading
the charge at the front line.

55
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,250
With Tokugawa's main
camp at their backs.

56
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:39,625
This was the Gyorin,
or fish scale formation.

57
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,916
Across the Sekigahara Basin,
Mitsunari Ishida led his

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,125
Western army from his
primary camp on Mount Sasao.

59
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,916
His forces were
more dispersed.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,250
Spread out to surround
the Eastern army.

61
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,416
This was the Kakuyoku,
or Crane Formation.

62
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,791
Due to Hidetada's
misguided attack on Ueda,

63
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,541
the Tokugawa forces seemed
to be at a disadvantage.

64
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,875
Mitsunari was able to establish
a superior footing, and had a

65
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,500
large array of soldiers
and arms at his disposal.

66
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:08,375
From this view, victory appears
to be his for the taking.

67
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,416
[MASANORI]
Are we ever gonna fight?

68
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,416
I can't stand all
this waiting around!

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,625
We will fight in due time.

70
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,000
Lord Ieyasu is simply allowing
this thick fog to clear.

71
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,291
And when that happens,
we'll see the enemy coming

72
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,291
right for us while
we just sit here.

73

Still we must wait.
We were trusted by our lord

74
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,250
to lead the vanguard
and not act rashly.

75

[BLUE SOLDIERS groan]

325
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,333
Mitsunari!

326
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,625
Concede defeat or you'll die!

327
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,000
You will not stop me!

328
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,666

[MITSUNARI inhales]

332
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,625
Ieyasu!

[IEYASU grunts]

334
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,791
[MITSUNARI growls]
I'll kill you!

335

[VILLAGERS murmur]

336
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,250
Lord Yukimura!

337
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,625
[YUKIMURA]
Hm?

338
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,250
Your brother is approaching
with Tokugawa soldiers!

339
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,791
He is?

340
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,875
[YUKIMURA]
Why have you returned?

341
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,083
We stand firm behind
master Mitsunari!

342
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,333
[NOBUYUKI]
The war is over!

343
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,750
[YUKIMURA gasps]

344
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,666
Mitsunari has fallen.

345
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,833
No... No!

346
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,458
I refuse to believe that!

347
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,416
[NOBUYUKI]
He lost!

348
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,416
Our presence here more
than proves his failure!

349
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,666
[gasps]

350
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,833
So... where is he now?

351
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,708
[MITSUNARI groans]

352
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,208
You... I'll kill you.

[MITSUNARI grunts]

356
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,791
[HIDEYOSHI]
Mitsunari.

357
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,041
People will say what
they will about you,

358
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,833
without any thought.

359
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,250
But I understand you.

360
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,708
Perhaps better than anyone else.

361
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,416
[MITSUNARI]
Forgive me, my lord.

362
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:59,875
[sobs]

363
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:04,208
Mitsunari!

[WARRIORS]
Samurai Warriors Highschool!

365
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,041
[YOSHITSUGU] I choose
to go against this flow.

366
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:04,833
[YOSHITSUGU grunts]

367
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,916
[YOSHITSUGU]
Well...

368
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,666
Maybe next time.

369
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,666
[NARRATION] For his stance
against the Tokugawa,

370
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,625
Yukimura stands trial.

371
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:25,125
Calls for his head are met
with arguments for mercy.

372
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:28,750
But will his brother's voice
be the loudest to condemn him?

373
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,875

"Where Life Shall Go."
