1
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:21,833
Preserve the Toyotomi.
Ensure that my legacy lives on.

2
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,666
Hideyori.

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,291
My... son.

4
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:30,208
Protect him. Please.

5
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,250
You're like my brother,
but you are not my master.

6
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,458
This is goodbye Mitsunari.

7
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,625
[MASANORI]
Kiyomasa.

8
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:55,625
[MASANORI]
We're gone!

9
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,958
[YUKIMURA]
Please, wait!

10
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:00,208
Master Kiyomasa!
Master Masanori!

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,166
We must remain stalwart.
And never lose heart.

12
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,166
For in our hands rests
the fate of countless lives.

13
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,833
May I ask why you are saying
such things to me, my lord?

14
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,750
[KANETSUGU] We three shall
fight together as one.

15
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,333
And share a righteous victory!

16
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,583
To preserve the
soul of the Sanada.

17
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,833
I shall wage war
on behalf of peace.

18
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,458
Fighting alongside the Tokugawa.

19
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,583
I shall wage war on
behalf of righteousness

20
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,916
and fight alongside Mitsunari.

21
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,583
[NOBUYUKI]
I knew this day would come.

22
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,791
[YUKIMURA] Be it victory
or death, I'm ready!

23
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,916
[BOTH shout]

24
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,958
[NARRATION]
The summer grasses

25
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:51,208
rise from where brave warriors
dared to dream a dream.

26
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,958
It was a dream
many warriors shared.

27
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,250
To unite this fractured
land under their banner.

28
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,625
Shingen Takeda.

29
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,333
Kenshin Uesugi.

30
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,083
Nobunaga Oda.

31
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,625
At last. The dream
that eluded so many

32
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:11,125
was within the grasp of
one extraordinary man.

33
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,541
Hideyoshi Toyotomi,
the emperor's Chief Advisor

34
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:19,125
and Grand Minister, was only one
step away from uniting the land.

35
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,791
All that blocked his path
was Sagami province.

36
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,500
Ujiyasu Hojo ruled this,

37
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,708
and the entire Kanto region
from his stronghold in Odawara.

38
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,666
Although a massive force
besieged the castle there,

39
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,208
Hojo remained firmly
ensconced within its walls.

40
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,000
The battle was
at a stalemate.

41
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,541
Seemingly without end.

42
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,666
[MASANORI]
It has been three months!

43
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,625
We wait much longer and
we'll be dead of old age!

44
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,625
We could have sat on
our asses at home!

45
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,458
There is a reason
we're all here, right?

46
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,458
So if you have
a plan, Mitsunari,

47
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,708
now would be a good
time to share it with us!

48
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,541
Calm down, Masanori.

49
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,541
I'm just wondering if there's
any kind of strategy

50
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,708
floating around in
that big head of his!

51
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,166
We should've taken this
castle from the very beginning!

52
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,416
[YOSHITSUGU]
Yes, that is correct.

53
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,791
And we could have
done just that,

54
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,750
had you not broken
formation and charged in.

55
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,666
[gasps] I'm not gonna take
all the blame for that day!

56
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,500
Anyway, that's in the past.

57
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,666
Aren't we talking about
what we're gonna do now?

58
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,500
[KANETSUGU]
Shouting won't win the war.

59
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,708
I think we should
trust Mitsunari.

60
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,958
After all, he is the
one put in charge here.

61
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,833
[MASANORI grunts]
Fine!

62
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,458
[BOTH gasp]

63
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,666
This castle seems
impossible to breach.

64
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,250
The bones of that
fortress are strong indeed,

65
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,083
but its heart is the
key to its resilience.

66
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,208
Hojo and his vassals are
willing to sacrifice their lives

67
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,750
for the sake of survival.

68
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,291
That resolve is their defense.

69
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,583
[YUKIMURA]
Defense by will alone.

70
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,708
[IEYASU] Master Mitsunari
has been laying siege

71
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,458
for three months now, my lord.

72
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,958
Ujiyasu Hojo has
proven his reputation

73
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,458
as a warrior is
well earned indeed.

74
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,666
He's known as "The Lion
of Sagaki" for good reason.

75
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,583
Let me take command, my lord.

76
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,583
The castle will be rubble
by this time tomorrow.

77
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,958
Naomasa. Be quiet.

78
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,125
[NAOMASA scoffs]

79
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:29,000
[laughs]
That quickly, eh?

80
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,083
While I do appreciate
your vigor,

81
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,458
Mitsunari will claim
victory in due time.

82
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,791
Right, Nene?

83
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,375
[NENE chuckles]
He will indeed, darling.

84
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,750
The boy's never let us down.

85
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,208
So. Let us discuss
what is to become

86
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,083
of the Kanto region
after Hojo's defeat.

87
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,083
I think that should fall under
the aegis of Master Ieyasu.

88
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,125
[gasps]

89
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,500
[HIDEYOSHI]
The land is vast,

90
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,666
and Hojo has controlled
it for many years.

91
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,625
A great man like
master Ieyasu

92
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,625
could maintain order in
the wake of his departure.

93
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,541
Agreed?

94
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,625
[IEYASU grunts]

95
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,458
It would be an honor, my lord.

00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,916
[HIDEYOSHI grunts]

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,583
Now! The time for
unification is upon us!

98
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,250
[WARRIORS]
Yes, my lord!

99
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,041
[HIDETADA] Father.
I'm afraid that Hideyoshi

100
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,791
is merely trying to placate you
with that worthless offer!

101
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,750
Kanto may be
"vast" as he said,

102
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,000
but it's also completely
inconsequential!

103
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,333
We are Tokugawa!

104
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,791
Not some back-country daimyo!

105

You know, your cooking
really isn't half-bad!

108
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,458
[UJIYASU] Ha! And here
I thought Hideyoshi's men

109
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,041
would pack up and leave
after a month or two.

110
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,458
They're patient little buggers!

111
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:06,125
Perhaps they still believe that
they can simply wait us out.

112
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,958
If they think they can outlast
Hojo in a test of endurance,

113
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,166
they're a bunch of damned fools.

114
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,708
That's putting it mildly.

115
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,875
Hideyoshi is definitely
hard-headed.

116
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,500
I'll give him credit,
but he'll never have Kanto.

117
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:22,166
[UJIYASU] That said. I feel
the endgame is soon to come.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,041
[MITSUNARI]
The wait is over.

119

All forces,
prepare to engage.

120
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,458
We will crush Odawara
with a full on assault.

Why now? I mean...

What?!

125
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,916
It took you this long to come up
with "let's storm the castle"?!

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,208
Isn't that risky?

127
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,958
You do realize Odawara
won't go down easily.

128

[YOSHITSUGU]
Don't you see?

[BOTH gasp]

130
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,916
[YOSHITSUGU]
Since the siege began,

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,833
The smoke from cooking
fires has risen from

132
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,666
all over the castle at
this hour. Without fail.

[KIYOMASA gasps]

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,958
[YOSHITSUGU] But today
the plumes are sparse.

135
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,541
You're right! They must
be running out of food!

136
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,500
So you were just biding time
until their morale dropped?

137
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,541
Perhaps you should
consider letting us know

138
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,041
what's on your mind,
lest ours drop as well.

139
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,041
[NOBUYUKI]
Please, wait!

140
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,166
Such a massacre would
surely leave an indelible

141
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,583
stain on our image in Kanto.

142
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,291
Your point being?

143
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,083
What our lord seeks is
peace and unification.

144
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,500
Needless bloodshed is
contrary to that aim.

145
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,958
That's love.

146

Huh?!

147
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,833
It's soft. Our image
must be that of

00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,166
decisiveness and
strength to rule.

149

The glorious
might of Toyotomi

shall be what unifies the land.

[KANETSUGU] Hm. Love that
spawns from admiration.

remain strong.

00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,750
diminish over time
takes mental fortitude.

325
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,541
Now, that's leadership.

326
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,375
[gasps]

327
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,125
[HIDEYOSHI] People will say
what they will about you,

328
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,333
without thought.

329
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,333
But I understand you.

330
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,666
Perhaps better than anyone else.

331
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,750
That's love.

332
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,250
Thank you.

333
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,291
Without you, there would be
neither victory, nor peace.

334
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,791
Hideyoshi, my lord.

335
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,291
[NENE chuckles]
I'm proud of you.

336
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,500
That goes for all my boys.

337
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,041
I'm sorry. I should say,
"my strong young men."

338
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,291
--[NENE chuckles]
--[MASANORI groans]

339
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,166
[NENE]
You've all grown so much!

340
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,458
You've done well!

341
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,750
You've dreamed of a world
where everyone can smile,

342
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,916
haven't you, dear?

343
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
Indeed I have.

344
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,416
Let us be counted among them.

345
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,333
Drink and be merry!

346
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,583
[ALL]
Yes, my lord!

347
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,125
[NENE, HIDEYOSHI chuckle]

348
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,000
You always knew that
the day would come

349
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,416
when we would all live
in a peaceful world.

350
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,208
It's true.

351
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:09,000
Dear brother. Let us work
together to maintain that peace.

352
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,250
That is our family's purpose.

353
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,791
Our name shall be
synonymous with harmony.

354
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,166
Yes. It shall.

355
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,541
But that can only happen

356
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,500
if you stop making your
poor brother worry so much.

357
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,458
Right, Yukimura?

358
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,166
[YUKIMURA gasps]
I mean, I...

359
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,750
Wow!

360
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,416
So now you're not only a wife,
but a bossy big sister as well?

361
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
--How cute!
--[TSUKIMARU squeaks]

362
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,500
Uh... Beg pardon?

363
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,250
It seems like only yesterday
you were the Sanada's

364
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,666
sworn enemy, and now you're
just one big happy family.

365
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,583
Yes! But I am not bossy!

366
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,500
[KUNOICHI giggles]
Look, I made her blush!

367
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,625
I have a strong feeling
Ina will regret marrying

368
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,791
into that silly little
clan before too long.

369
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,833
Careful not to
underestimate them.

370
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,291
Sanada's star is on the rise.

371
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,166
I don't know about that.

372
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,208
Master Ieyasu.

373
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,000
[IEYASU]
Yes, my lord.

374
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,000
Mitsunari.

375
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,125
[MITSUNARI]
Yes, my lord.

376
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,166
[HIDEYOSHI]
I consider the two of you

377
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,208
as pillars of this empire.

378
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,916
And I ask that you work
together to support it.

379
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,666
[BOTH]
Yes, my lord!

380
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,541
Nobuyuki Sanada and Yukimura!

381
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,208
[ALL gasp]

382
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,500
[YUKIMURA, NOBUYUKI]
Lord!

383
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,166
My praise!

384
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,458
You're the embodiment
of warriors for peace!

385
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,000
[BOTH chuckle]

386
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,916
[HIDEYOSHI] And I shall need
your strength to preserve it.

387
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,458
[BOTH]
Lord!

388
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,541
[BOTH chuckle]

389
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,750
My dream has come true.

Samurai Warriors High School!

[TADAKATSU] Social studies
teacher: Tadakatsu Honda!

392
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,875
You must learn
this for the exam!

393
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,958
Unification!

394
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,583
[BOTH chuckle nervously]

395
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,291
[TADAKATSU]
Now pay attention!

396
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,708

Get it right or you fail!

401
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,625
[YUKIMURA, KUNOICHI]
Huh?

402
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,791
[NARRATION] Seeds of mistrust
and resentment have been sown

403
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,375
amongst the summer grasses.

404
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,041
Fed by blood, they grow,

405
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,500
tearing apart the
strongest of bonds.

406
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,458
Will they flower into
total dissolution?

407
