blossomed across the land.

3
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,250
They were planted by men
who thirsted for power.

over this divided country.

the "Tiger of Kai."

00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,916
At his command, the largest
cavalry of the age.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,250
He rode them hard.

9

00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:03,125
They put all they had
into a single battle:

Each loyal to the
Oda and Tokugawa.

22

Three thousand of them
carrying matchlocks,

could be taken down so easily.

32

This will change everything.

[NOBUYUKI, YUKIMURA yell]

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,833
[NARRATION]
They put forth a valiant effort,

50
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,666
but the Takeda
forces were defeated

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,083
on the bloody
fields of Nagashino.

52
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,166
And with the death
of Katsuyori Takeda

53
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,166
at Mt. Tenmoku, the clan
was effectively wiped out.

Though they once
raced towards death,

55
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,625
the Sanada brothers were
now forced to flee from it.

We gave everything we had.

But still, Takeda fell.

How could the house
not survive the master?

00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,458
I feel like our failure means
we've betrayed his legacy!

[NOBUYUKI] Takeda is no more,
but still, we must walk on.

Yes, but what path do we
follow now, brother?

We have lost our way!

Without Takeda to lead us,
where will the Sanada go?

We will find our way.

How could you have
been so foolish?

You charged in blindly,

87

with no regard for our wounded,

nor consideration for
how many enemies

may have been waiting!

Listen, brother.

I don't know if I can
carry the shame with me.

93

We failed our master,

94
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,166
and living without
honor goes against

95
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,208
the code of the Sanada!

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,958
we always have these
six coins at the ready?

98
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,250
It's so we are prepared to give

the boatman of
the Sanzu his toll,

100

and cross into the underworld.

You're a fool!

102
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,083
They represent living
without fear of death,

103
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,666
not a desire for it!

104
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,250
They signify our strong heart,
our will to face challenges!

105
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,875
They are a pittance!

106
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,416
The true cost of crossing that
river is the Soul of the Sanada!

107
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,541
Takeda's dreams must
go on living with us.

108
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,083
That means our struggles
cannot end here.

109
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,333
For now, we must live on
shouldering the burdens

00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,250
My dream is to become

165
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:38,250
such a good warrior that I
can teach the Uesugi a lesson.

166
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,625
The Uesugi are pretty
strong, too, ya know.

167
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,791
Yeah, I know they are,

168
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,875
but they're not stronger
than Lord Takeda!

169
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,708
[NOBUYUKI]
Maybe not.

170
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,250
But do you remember when
the Imagawa and Hojo

171
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,000
cut off our supplies of salt?

172
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,416
The Uesugi made sure that

173
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,125
people of Takeda still
had access to it.

174
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,291
But they are our
enemy, aren't they?

175
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,750
[NOBUYUKI]
They are,

176
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,291
but they treat their enemies
with respect and humanity.

177
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,083
They don't take their grievances
out on the regular folk.

178
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,416
That kind of strength
is rare in the world.

179
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,750
Do you see, Yukimura?

180
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,833
Yeah! Definitely!

181
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,750
I know. That's it.

00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,791
[KUNOICHI gasps] Lord Yukimura,
where are you going?

00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,500
Always running off!

184
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:27,791
[YUKIMURA]
Brother.

[gasps]

186
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,041
What is it? Something wrong?

187
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,291
Hear me out.

188
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,041
I have made up my mind
to go to the Uesugi.

189
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,208
[NOBUYUKI]
What do you mean?

190
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,291
I love our home,
but as it is now,

191
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,541
we're surrounded on
all sides by our enemies.

192
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,708
We can never truly
be at ease here.

193
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,291
So what I'm proposing
is a defensive strategy

194
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,250
that would make the Uesugi
our allies instead.

195
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,541
If I offer myself up
to them as a hostage,

196
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,375
we should have some protection
on that front, at least.

197
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,500
A hostage?

198
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,666
You know what you're
saying, don't you?

199
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,000
[YUKIMURA]
I do.

200
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,125
[NOBUYUKI]
But you'll be putting your life

201
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,000
in our enemy's hands!

202
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,375
I'm aware of that.

203
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,541
I'll do it to
protect the Sanada.

204
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,250
Right now it's the best
option that we have.

205
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,250
[YUKIMURA]
We have our disputes,

206
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,833
but they're not monsters.

207
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,500
Even when we fought,
they made sure

208
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,375
some of our needs were met.

209
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,041
Yukimura...

210
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,000
[YUKIMURA]
I may be gone for a long time.

211
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,041
But my heart will remain
here with you, brother.

212
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,208
This is it. I shall
take my leave.

213
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,916
Best of luck. Farewell, brother.

214

Farewell.

Though the cherry
blossoms may fall,

in spring every year.

I overheard the vow you swore
to your brother back there.

It means that you can't

Of course. I know that.

You can't be reckless either.

Lord Yukimura!

As your loyal ninja, have I
ever let you down before?

After they fell, siding
with Uesugi makes sense.

Of course. I was joking!

If I may ask.

What exactly do you mean
by calling him that?

328
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,750
I mean, I see him
as a shape shifter

and a trickster.

00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,833
He's close to Lord

He's taken Shinano, and he'll
surely want Echigo as well.

335

I wonder how the

337

It'll be quite interesting.

00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,541
Our family won control
of Numata in battle,

339

and we have governed
it well ever since.

340
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,250
There's no way
that we would ever

341

just hand it over to the Hojo.

342
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,791
Perhaps.

343
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,541
But the Tokugawa clearly
have the advantage

344

This is not a fight

Please forgive his bluntness.

He can come off as a
little abrasive at times.

The Sanada are
not afraid of death,

but that does not mean
that we desire for it.

We must keep the soul
of our family alive.

So I will do just that.

[NOBUYUKI] We could give in

Yukimura.

815
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,958
I want to see the
world that awaits us

816
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,416
once this dark age
of chaos is over.

817
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,875
Is there such a world?

818
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:16,333
One without chaos?

819
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,750
There is.

820
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:21,166
But I fear that the path
to reach it may be darker still.

821
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:14,083
[NARRATION] The land was
unified by Hideyoshi Toyotomi,

822
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:17,833
but his sudden death plunges
it into chaos once again.

823
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,708
This fracture leads
to the Bloody Battle

824
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,333
of Sekigahara, which rocks
the nation to its core.

825
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,875
The path to peace
would grow dark indeed.

826
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:28,500
Its only light from the
flames of war that burned

827
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:30,291
with a righteous fury.

828
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:33,833
Will the soul of the Sanada
survive this conflagration?
