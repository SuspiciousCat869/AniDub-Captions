[NARRATION]
The summer grasses

00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:15,291
rise from where brave warriors
dared to dream a dream.

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,000
It was a dream many
warriors shared.

4
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,291
To unite this fractured
land under their banner.

5
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,416
Shingen Takeda.

But now, one warrior has made
that elusive dream a reality.

9
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,083
Hideyoshi Toyotomi.

10
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,416
It would seem that he,

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,625
has sown peace in the land
by the tip of his spear.

12
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,458
However...

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,500
After his sudden passing,
chaos begins to grow again.

Threatening to
disrupt the balance

15

so many others died to achieve.

16

To preserve the
Soul of the Sanada,

17
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,875
I shall wage war
on behalf of peace.

18

Fighting alongside the Tokugawa.

Mitsunari has begun to mobilize.

Interfering with our
attack against Uesugi

30
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:04,583
is a blatant act of
war on Toyotomi.

31
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,666
One that begs
dire consequences.

To secure victory, I believe
we should split up our forces.

I will lead our main battalion
along the ocean side.

set foot in Kanto.

to the invading army.

163
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,500
The Tokugawa forces split
up and tried to surround us.

164
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,958
It's just as you had predicted.
The strategy worked perfectly!

165
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,625
I can't take credit for it.

166
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,833
[KUNOICHI, TSUKIMARU]
Huh?

167
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,666
You see? That's why
you can't be careless.

168
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,250
And if you choose to
underestimate your enemy,

169
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,458
you will lose.

170
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,916
[YUKIMURA] I never
expected those traps

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,041
to be waiting for me.

172
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,791
[NOBUYUKI] So, you should
change your strategy.

173
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,791
But what will you do?

174
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,000
[YUKIMURA]
Hm...

175
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,750
Well...

176
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,541
[YUKIMURA gasps]

177
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,291
I don't understand.
I never told you that

178
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,750
I was going to split
up my army like that.

179
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,166
Is there some
kind of secret?

180
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,666
It's like you were reading
my mind or something.

181
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,208
I wasn't reading your mind.

182
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,583
But I was reading the battle
and that told me everything.

183
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,250
Battles tell their own stories.

184
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,791
You can read them from
one part to the next.

185
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,333
So, look at the bigger picture.

186
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,666
If you know what's
happened before,

187
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,791
you can likely see
what'll happen next.

188
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,791
Never forget what
I've told you.

189
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,541
If you read the battle, pay
attention to the way it flows,

190
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,083
and know the lay of the land
you will always have a major

191
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,166
strategic advantage
over any opponent

192
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,333
you may face in the future.

193
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,333
[YUKIMURA] Brother, I haven't
forgotten the lessons

194
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,125
you taught me all
those years ago.

195
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,916
That's how I will
win the fight today.

196
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,500
[HIDETADA]
What is this?

197
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,916
Where are my other squads?
Why aren't they attacking?

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,500
[MESSENGER 1]
My lord!

199
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,416
I'm sorry but, It appears the
other squadrons have all been

200
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,333
pinned down by ambushes
set up by Sanada's men!

201
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,625
That's ridiculous!

202
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,791
What are your orders, my lord?

203
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,291
The remaining force still
massively outnumbers

204
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,208
the Sanadas'. Do you
think we should attack?

205
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:48,958
I have no desire to make the
same mistake as last time.

206
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,750
I know.

207
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,375
We shall just have to
stay outside their walls.

208
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,041
At a safe distance.

209
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,541
Flaming arrows, then.

210
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,750
I'd like to see them
defend a pile of ashes.

211
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,208
My lord, the forces that
went through the mountains

212
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,916
were all met with ambushes.

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,750
I'm afraid the casualties
were quite significant.

214
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,541
Just as I thought.
We must get back to camp.

215

What about the mission?

216
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,625
I cannot let Lord
Hidetada perish.

directly into Yukimura's trap.

Thoughts of
my brother. That's all.

He's quite formidable.

That's true.

262
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,333
Because he's using our
age-old Sanada strategies.

The same ones that I taught him
while we were both children.

[YUKIMURA] When Nobuyuki
and I built this fortress,

to defend it from him.

[YUKIMURA] Although our bond is
strong, my will is far stronger.

I must continue to walk
the path of righteousness.

To repay my debts and keep
my word to Master Mitsunari.

We shall protect

it as a mere prize.

when I was treated as a pariah,

289
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,083
you alone stood up
to defend my honor.

00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,833
About what?

320
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,041
About our vanguard forces.

321
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,500
Every last one of them
served under Hideyoshi.

322
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,666
Who knows what other
alliances may come into play.

323
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,416
Has Tokugawa considered
this side of things?

324
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,958
Then, what would
you propose he do?

325
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,333
[NAOMASA gasps]

326
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,291
Were it I...

327
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,166
Do you think we'll
see Mitsunari?

328
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,958
I can't say for certain.
The only thing I'm sure about,

329
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,583
Is fate brought us to the
battlefield and there's nothing

330
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,875
we could have done to avoid it.

331
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,375
I'm right there with you!

332
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,375
This is what you and me
were supposed to do!

333
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,875
But still I wonder.

334
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,291
Does Mitsunari
feel the same way?

335
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,500
If we do see him...

336
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,083
...I'm gonna give him a punch

337
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,541
right between the eyes and
knock some sense into him.

338
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,750
Well, I hope it turns
out to be that simple.

339
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,291
[YUKIMURA] This is where
we Sanada call home.

340
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,000
[YUKIMURA] When our lord passed
away, we had no place to go.

341
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,666
We were fugitives
in our own land.

342
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,416
But the cherry blossoms
were waiting to greet us.

343
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,083
They welcomed us here.

344
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,791
The beauty of that
moment was breathtaking.

345
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,458
We knew this was
where we belonged.

346
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,166
This is our new home.

347
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,250
Yes. It is.

348
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,458
We'll build our
castle here.

349
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,833
[YUKIMURA]
Right.

350
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,583
[YUKIMURA] I must protect
this place with my life.

351
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,958
So one day...

352
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,333
My brother will have a
place to call home again.

Hidetada, my lord.

00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,291
I beg you to stop!

358
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,833
Your father is waiting on
us to deliver these supplies

359
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,041
and you're putting
his life in jeopardy!

[scoffs] After shelling this
tiny hut you call a fortress,

361
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,708
I will still have plenty of
supplies and a victory

362
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,541
under my belt.

[VASSAL 1]
Take the women and children

366
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,166
to the back of the castle!

367
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,083
Lord Yukimura, you have
to get out of here, now!

368
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,250
I'm going directly
to the enemy's camp!

369
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,541
Are they still putting
up resistance?

370
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,000
[VASSAL 2] We see no action
in the fortress, my lord.

371
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,833
They've lost the will
to fight. How pitiful.

[gasps]

The enemy is approaching!

374
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,875
[scoffs]
Such utter nonsense.

375
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,000
Wait! What's happening?

376
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,500
[NOBUYUKI gasps]
The gunpowder stash!

[BLUE SOLDIERS yell]

378
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,708
They're blowing up our supplies?

00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,416
Do not lose focus!

380
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,125

Once again Nobunaga
Oda proves he's no dummy.

After winning this battle,

he takes over all the
land he could grab.

This will definitely
be on the exam!

What are you doing?

Wait. Are you crying
over your notes?

Oh. It's just drool.

Huh?

[NARRATION] The forces
collide at Sekigahara,

where a momentous clash could
turn the tide of history.

399
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:25,416
Guided by their own ideals,
one must follow their own path.

But many of those paths
end on the field of battle.
