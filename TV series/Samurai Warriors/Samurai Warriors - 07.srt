1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:08,916
[NARRATOR]
The country is broken,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,833
yet mountains and rivers remain.

3
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,791
Spring comes to the castle,
and the grass is green again.

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,250
Poisoned by blood,
Hideyoshi's dream of unity

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,333
now rests on its own deathbed.

6
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,625
The winds of destiny blow,

7
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,166
carrying both seeds
of peace and war.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,250
Which will sprout from this
ground, fed by fallen bodies?

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,166
Not satisfied with blood alone,

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,791
Tokugawa demands more from
those who sided with his enemy.

11
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,333
The Uesugi, a powerful
Toyotomi ally,

12
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,458
were to be stripped of most
of their wealth and their land.

13
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,291
Rather than suffer
this humiliation,

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,250
they were willing to give
their lives for honor.

15
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,458
However, Nobuyuki
again made the point

16
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,041
that survival was paramount,

17
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,125
and the Uesugi agreed
to Tokugawa's terms.

18
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,416
Meanwhile Yukimura
was living in exile,

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,916
his warrior's path cut off
by the Shogunate.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,500
Seemingly devoid of purpose,

21
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,916
he spent his days
engaged in idle reflection.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,625
When offered Mitsunari's
keepsake, he refused.

23
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,166
A symbolic act of
turning away from

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,583
the life of violence
and warfare.

25
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,416
An encounter with Suzu,
a child of the village,

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
lifted his spirits, somewhat.

27
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,375
Although he was known
as a "bad man,"

28
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:18,250
she was still willing to
share food with him.

29
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,541
Unfortunately, she fell ill.

30
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,541
Yukimura broke through
the guards and rushed her

31
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,625
to a doctor in a village
at the mountain's base,

32
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,208
directly violating the
terms of his exile.

33
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,916
As a result, his punishment
was intensified.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,291
He now found himself
under house arrest,

35
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:38,041
unable to leave the confines
of his modest dwelling.

36
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,666
[NARRATOR] Regarded as a mad
dog by the Tokugawa Shogunate,

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,875
Yukimura was penned
up in Mount Kudo.

38
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,916
That selfless gesture seen
as a threatening outburst,

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,208
his leash was
tightened even further.

40
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,708
Denied interaction with
the world around him,

41
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,125
all he could do now
was simply exist.

42
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,875
What's wrong?

43
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,083
Why can't Yukimura come
out and play with me?

44
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,375
[SUZU'S MOTHER] I haven't even
had the chance to thank him yet.

45
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,375
I feel this is all my fault.

46
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,916
You never asked him
to do anything.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,500
[KUNOICHI]
He can't change who he is.

48
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,708
[KUNOICHI]
Wait up, Tsukimaru!

49
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,083
[KUNOICHI]
Please, come back!

50
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,791
[KUNOICHI]
Ina's here!

51
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,875
[INA] Although I'm happy
the girl was saved,

52
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,583
that was still a very reckless
thing for him to do.

53
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,000
If given the chance,

54
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sure he would make the
same decision over again.

55
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,625
[INA] There's no doubt about it,
but I'm afraid his punishment

56
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,208
would be far more
severe the next time.

57
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,458
Not just house arrest.

58
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,916
Indeed, he may be forced
to pay the ultimate price.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,041
I know.

60
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,375
Once we reach the peace
we've all been striving for,

61
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,416
I believe he'll be forgiven.

62
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,916
But to see that day,
he must abide by the rules

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,833
as they stand now.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,583
Please look after
Yukimura for us.

65
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,750
You're the only one who can.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,250
I will.

67
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:17,041
Oh yes. I brought a
few gifts with me.

68
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,375
I imagine it's difficult to
get many things out here.

69
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,000
[KUNOICHI] Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

70
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,708
It's so sweet of you
to think of us!

71
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000
[KUNOICHI] Goodbye!
Hope to see you soon!

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,125
It's nice, but...

73
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,041
How in the world am
I supposed to carry

74
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,791
all of these heavy boxes
up the mountain by myself?

75
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,708
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Nobuyuki was once again

76
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,583
sent as Tokugawa's envoy.

77
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,500
This time to the
castle in Osaka,

78
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,833
from where Lord Hideyori
leads the Toyotomi.

79
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,791
[NOBUYUKI] I'm here to
inform you that Lord Ieyasu

80
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,791
has stepped down from his
position as Seii Taishogun.

81
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,625
In his place, the Imperial
court has chosen his son,

82
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,375
Lord Hidetada, as his successor.

83
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,583
They feel he has the
experience and leadership

84
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,416
to maintain peace in the land.

85
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,750
This is an outrage.

86
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,708
That title rightfully belongs
to Lord Hideyori!

87
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,250
[HIDEYORI]
You should relax.

88
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,500
I know that you're not
the one to blame for this.

89
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,000
[NOBUYUKI]
Apologies, my lord.

90
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,875
Yes. Thank you.

91
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,083
The situation is
rather troubling.

92
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,791
So he's appointed
his favorite son...

93
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:35,416
The Toyotomi rule is over
now. This makes it final.

94
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,791
[HIDEYORI]
Anything else?

95
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,333
Yes.

96
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,041
He'd like to speak with you.
About the future of the empire.

97
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,416
He wishes to hear your thoughts
on how to preserve peace

98
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,416
in the land.

99
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,791
[HIDEYORI]
Does he now?

100
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,291
Indeed, my lord.

101
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,500
I will not go to Edo.

102
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,750
[NOBUYUKI]
You needn't.

103
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,416
Lord Ieyasu will
visit the capital

104
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,458
to receive the imperial
proclamation

105
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,750
regarding the transfer of power.

106
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,583
As part of his journey
he wishes to meet

107
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,333
at Nijo castle to facilitate
this discussion.

108
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,958
That power-hungry
fool has no right

109
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,208
to treat Lord Hideyori
as an afterthought!

110
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,625
He's just a vassal himself!

111
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,250
Settle down.

112
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,916
Of course, my lord.

113
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,041
Please forgive me,

114
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,083
but I cannot make this
agreement at the moment.

115
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,083
I shall need some
time to think.

116
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,500
The implications are far too
vast for a hasty decision.

117
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,416
Kai. Please prepare a
room for Master Nobuyuki.

118
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,875
[KAI]
Yes, my lord.

119
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,375
[HIDEYORI]
By the way,

120
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,583
I hope that Yukimura is
doing well these days.

121
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,750
[KAI]
Ugh.

122
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,291
I was afraid that things
would someday come to this.

123
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,833
What do you mean by that?

124
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,625
That Tokugawa would
try to assume

125
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,625
absolute power, obviously.

126
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,250
It really breaks my heart
for Lord Hideyori.

127
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,750
Does Lord Hideyori always
carry himself in such a way?

128
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,583
What way would that be?

129
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,125
[NOBUYUKI]
How do I put this?

130
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,958
Perhaps "lackadaisical"
is the right word?

131
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,291
I think he behaves like
that to mask his true feelings.

132
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,666
Honestly, sometimes I find
it absolutely adorable!

133
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,083
But what is in his mind?

134
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,291
What does he really think?

135
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:37,416
That's hard to discern.
He's quite an enigma.

136
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,375
He wears many faces.
The stern leader.

137
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,083
The innocent young man.
The poet.

138
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,041
And the one full of mystery.

139
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:51,916
For the life of me, I can never
tell which one is truly him.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,416
But no matter the face,
he's always paying attention.

141
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,583
Lord Hideyori,
I strongly urge you

142
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,291
not to agree to this meeting!

143
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,083
[VASSAL B] Your father
brought peace to this land

144
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,791
and it was his wish for you to
be its shepherd, not Tokugawa.

145
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,375
This is a slap in the face!

146
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,000
[VASSAL C]
His job was to see us through

147
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,583
until you could continue
your father's legacy!

148
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,375
[VASSAL B]
This is unforgivable!

149
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,458
[VASSAL A] We cannot allow him
to strip you of your birthright!

150
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,166
So in other words,
this is your advice:

151
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,583
That we should prepare for war.

152
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,000
And soon.

153
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,000
[KIYOMASA]
Everyone in town was smiling.

154
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:56,958
[MASANORI]
Huh?

155
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,500
[KIYOMASA]
Remember?

156
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,375
Lord Hideyoshi said
he wanted a world

157
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,625
where everyone could smile.

158

Yeah, he did say that a lot.

159

[KIYOMASA]
This was his dream.

160
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,875
And it seems to me that Ieyasu
always wanted to take

161
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,833
what Lord Hideyoshi
worked so hard to build.

162
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,583
And claim it as his own.

163
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,500
[MASANORI]
That's probably what's going on.

164
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,625
And now Hidetada
will be the Shogun?

165
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,958
We were loyal to the Toyotomi.

166
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,625
And so was Tokugawa.

167
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,875
We swore no such oath to Ieyasu.

168
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,291
[MASANORI yells]

169
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,083
Just say it already, that the
Tokugawa are lousy thieves!

170

[TAKATORA]
Did I hear that right?

171
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,041
Takatora.

172
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,916
[TAKATORA] That's quite an
inflammatory statement.

173
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,041
Were you spying on us?

174
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,291
Yeah, so what if I said it?

175
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,208
[TAKATORA] I have heard quite
a bit of this kind of talk

176
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,583
from the two of you,

177
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,083
this support for Toyotomi.

178
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,291
[TAKATORA]
These words,

179
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,750
will they lead you to
betray the Tokugawa?

180
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,541
There is no betrayal.

181
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:04,083
We've always served
the same lord as Ieyasu.

182
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,208
And what exactly do
you mean by that?

183
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,458
Tokugawa are Toyotomi
vassals just like we are!

184
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,250
We're not the type to switch
masters for our convenience.

[TAKATORA, MASANORI, KIYOMASA]

195
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,083
Master Naomasa Ii.

196
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,125
What's wrong?
Who's in there?

197
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,000
Do not interfere.

198
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,458
Leave him alone!

199
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,333
Do as he says.

200
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,791
My lord.

201
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,041
Yukimura.

202
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,833
Pick up the spear.

203
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,666
What Lord Ieyasu wants
is a long-lasting peace.

204
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,458
One that extends beyond
our lifetimes.

205
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,041
That said,

206
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,041
it cannot come to fruition as
long as you are allowed to live.

207
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,791
You are a warrior
through and through,

208
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,083
one worthy of honor and respect.

209
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,916
Thus, I will give you the
opportunity to die as a warrior.

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,083
Now pick up the
spear. And fight!

211
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:40,083
I will not disturb this peaceful
world with an act of violence.

212
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,916
So you choose to
die as a coward?

213
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,666
I'll not die by
violence, either.

214
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,125
A life of shame is
your choice then.

215
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,375
That is unacceptable!

216
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,208
Look, you can believe life
will be nothing but shame

217
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,875
if that's what you choose.

218
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,041
However, you can also believe
you live for a reason.

219
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,666
It may be considered shameful
for me to live in this way,

220
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,833
but I must continue to do so.

221
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,625
I promised my brother
that I would.

222
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,375
Alas, Nobuyuki himself
told Lord Ieyasu

223
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,500
that your life was forfeit.

224
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,791
That maybe true, but
I made a vow to him to live.

225
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,541
I'll honor it.

226
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,000
I swore to think
about why I live.

227
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,083
To find my purpose.

228
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:34,083
Until I've made that
discovery, I cannot die.

229
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,000
But I know you can't
be allowed to live.

230
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,333
You threaten the Tokugawa
regime and peace itself!

231
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,500
How can I pose such
a threat to the world

232
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,416
when I'm exiled from it?

233
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,458
By simply being alive!

234
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,958
Possessing your
warrior's spirit!

235
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,625
It's time you accepted
your fate.

236
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,458
I told you that I will
never wield a spear again.

237
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,125
Then I shall honor that pledge.

238
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,791
Now you die!

239
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,000
No! Please don't kill him!

240
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,666
You have a serious injury!
