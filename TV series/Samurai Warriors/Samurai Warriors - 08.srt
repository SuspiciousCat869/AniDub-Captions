00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,875
[NARRATION] The country
is broken, yet mountains

00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:11,416
and rivers remain.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,125
Spring comes to the castle,
and the grass is green again.

4
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,125
Poisoned by blood,
Hideyoshi's dream

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,666
of unity now rests
on its own deathbed.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,916
The winds of destiny blow,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,500
carrying both seeds
of peace and war.

8
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:27,541
Which will sprout from this
ground, fed by fallen bodies?

9
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,541
Once again,
Nobuyuki was sent out

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,166
as the Tokugawa envoy.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,791
This time to Osaka to meet
with Hideyori and deliver

12
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,958
the message that Hidetada
was to be the next Shogun.

13
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,208
On Mt. Kudo,
Yukimura was challenged

14
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,333
by Naomasa, but before
they could duel,

15
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,958
the village was set
ablaze by Kotaro Fuma.

16
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,000
By protecting the people there,
Yukimura realized his purpose:

17
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,000
To be a righteous warrior.

18
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,916
[YUKIMURA]

[BLUE SOLDIERS yelling]

So how do you guys
like my pepper bomb?

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,208
It's homemade!

28
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,875
[YUKIMURA]
Master Mitsunari. I promise,

29
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,000
I will uphold the oath
I swore with you.

30
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,000
[IEYASU]
Then... Naomasa perished.

31
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,375
[TADAKATSU]
Yes, my lord.

32
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,458
He died with honor,
as a warrior fighting

33
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,166
for the Tokugawa Shogunate.

34
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,333
Rest his soul.

35
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,750
[TADAKATSU] It seems
Yukimura has rediscovered

36
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,291
his warrior's spirit.

37
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,625
Yes.

38
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,666
The wheels of fate are set
in motion, albeit early.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,250
And the time that
you spoke about

40
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,791
has come to pass.

41
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,166
Indeed.

42
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,416
For peace to truly prosper,
we must first be sure

43
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,041
to cut away all
of the dead wood.

44
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,916
Dead wood?

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,541
[MALE VASSAL 8A]
I beg your pardon, my lord.

I can't pretend what I'm
doing now honors the pledge

I made to preserve the Toyotomi.

I hear ya.

53
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,458
But are you really sure that
Lord Hideyori will forgive us?

54
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,625
I will beg for his forgiveness!

I don't understand.

146
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,458
You are well aware
that many of our vassals

147
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:56,125
are chomping at the bit
to go to war with the Tokugawa.

148
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,833
And that is precisely
why I believe

149
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,541
it is imperative that we try
to resolve our differences

150

So, in other words,
this is your advice:

155

That we should prepare for war.

156

no thirst for bloodshed.

To take us down

162

we have to choose
which one to follow.

163
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:51,083
[TADAKATSU] I'm certain that
all of you have heard by now.

164
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,208
Yukimura Sanada has
broken his exile

165
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,958
and escaped from Mount Kudo.

166
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,083
What's more,

167
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,458
Kiyomasa Kato and
Masanori Fukushima

168
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:02,416
have left the castle here
in Edo to go to Osaka.

169
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,333
Takatora Todo, I order you

170
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:09,166
to locate and
eliminate Yukimura.

171
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,666
Lord.

172
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,875
Masamune Date.

173
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,708
You will take down
Kato and Fukushima.

174
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,083
Lord.

175
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,666
Forgive me, my lord.

176
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,583
But I would like
to make a request.

177
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,708
Allow me to hunt
down the deserters.

178
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,375
With all due respect.

179
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,958
I would prefer to find Yukimura
and defeat him instead.

180
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,083
Are you refusing to follow
Lord Ieyasu's orders?

181
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,125
[TAKATORA]
No, sir, I am not. But...

182
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,458
Those two have pledged
allegiance to the Toyotomi.

183
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,625
And as a former vassal myself,

184
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,583
I must prove my loyalty.

185
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,458
As for me: I am a warrior.

186
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,291
The chance to fight
a man like Yukimura,

187
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:54,541
who has defeated whole armies
singlehandedly, is irresistible.

188
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,750
Denied.

189
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,125
My lord--

190
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,791
[IEYASU] No! Accept your
missions, and leave at once.

191
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,333
Is that clear?

192
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,250
[TADAKATSU]
Tell me, my lord.

193
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,375
Why did you not allow them
to change their missions?

194
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,875
It was because I
understand all too well

195
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,250
the motivations behind
why they requested

196
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,875
that I switch their
initial assignments.

197
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,000
They stem from an
unslakable thirst for blood

198
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,708
and vengeance that must
not be allowed to continue

199
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,625
in the era of peace
we're about to enter.

200
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,291
It has no place.

201
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,958
Samurai must learn how
to exist in this new world

202
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,125
that decries war and
strives for harmony.

203
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,000
Adaptation is the
key to the survival

204
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,583
of any species,
including warriors.

205
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,916
To move forward,
we must unburden ourselves

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,791
of these bloody desires.

207
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,791
So are you saying
we must leave behind

208
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,416
our fighting spirit?

209
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,916
I am.

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,583
And that is exactly the reason
why I am denying them

211
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,916
the battles they believe
will satisfy them.

212
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,375
What then?

213
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,666
If samurai abandon fighting,
what will they do instead?

214
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,166
As I said, they'll adapt.

215
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,875
They've all honed very
useful skills over the years:

216
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,500
The ability to read the flow
of battle, strategize,

217
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,458
and command troops
must now be applied

218
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,666
to governing this nation.

219
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,416
But if they give in to
their violent tendencies,

220
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,666
peace will have no chance,
and we may never

221
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,833
crawl out of the chaos of war.

222
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,041
It is a lofty
and difficult goal.

223
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,791
[IEYASU]
Hm. Indeed it is.

224
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,375
Pretty relaxing, don't ya think?

225
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,083
Very much.

226
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,875
Look there.

227
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,541
Even in the most gentle
of streams, there can still

228
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,250
be pockets of turbulence.

229
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,500
What a metaphor, huh?

230
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,833
[NOBUYUKI]
Indeed.

231
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,791
If those bandits were
in fact Toyotomi vassals,

232
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,375
it shows that there
are those among them

233
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,708
ready to resort to violence.

234
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,041
They knew I was merely

235
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,583
the Tokugawa's messenger,
and still they attacked.

236
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,958
[KEIJI] It's obvious why
they feel that way.

237
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,541
Lord Hideyoshi was the
man who originally united

238
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,833
the nation under one banner,
but after the battle

239
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,500
between the Eastern
and Western armies,

240
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,500
Tokugawa is running the show.

241
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,500
All the Toyotomi are doing
is trying to save face.

242
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,541
Perhaps. But still.

243
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,791
Oh, yeah. I heard
about your brother.

244
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,000
[KEIJI] He was exiled.
But now he's escaped.

245
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,500
I don't know the
details, but apparently,

246
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,708
there was some kinda
trouble up there.

[NOBUYUKI]
Yukimura has broken his exile?

248
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,166
He must be on his way to Osaka.

249
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,875
Right now! I can't let
him reach the castle!

250

Please forgive me, my lady!

For what?

363
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,875
We broke our vow.

364
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,166
We promised we'd
protect the Toyotomi,

fight with Mitsunari.

366
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,500
But at the battle of Sekigahara,
we met as enemies.

[NENE]
Don't worry yourself.

368
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,208
Each one of you boys
was just acting on

369
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,833
what you believed
in your hearts to be

370

the right thing to do.

371
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,916
So no promises were broken.

Lady Nene!

373
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,250
That was quite
a scene back there.

374
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,750
Why all the fighting?

375
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,125
Because we left Edo castle
and the Tokugawa to go to Osaka

376
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,416
and serve Lord Hideyori,
and they were trying to stop us.

377
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,708
I knew you were good boys.

378
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,583
I'm so proud of you.

379
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,291
Now go and help the Toyotomi.

380
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,875
Yes, my lady.

381
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,791
[NOBUYUKI] Yukimura. Why did
you leave Mount Kudo?

382
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,541
[YUKIMURA]
Because it was time.

383
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,000
I took your advice,

384
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:28,000
and finally found the answer
I had been searching for.

385
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,000
Do you remember what
you said to me that day,

386
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,416
before I left for exile?

387
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,541
[NOBUYUKI]
I can't.

388
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,208
You are the only one
with that answer.

389
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,541
Look inside yourself,

390
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,083
and discover what that is.

391
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:42,208
The heart of a righteous warrior
still pounds inside of my chest.

392
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:46,083
As long as I live,
I'll fight for what's right.

393
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,333
So, you're going to Osaka.

394
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,083
[YUKIMURA]
Yes.

395
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,166
And you will never serve

396
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,833
the Tokugawa Shogunate
alongside me.

397
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,791
[YUKIMURA] I swore an oath
with Master Mitsunari

398
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,333
to fight for what I believe in.

399
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,541
He's gone, but my vow remains.

400
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,416
As does my belief
in the Toyotomi.

401
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,250
[NOBUYUKI]
I see.

402
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,458
And I can't change your mind.

403
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,708
You had once said to me

404
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,458
that you wanted to be
the trunk that supports

405
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,083
the Sanada house.

406
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,125
I want to be the warrior
who preserves the Sanada Spirit.

407
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,416
It's a shame that the two of us
cannot come together as one.

408
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,416
[YUKIMURA] But that is
the sad fact we face.

409
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,125
From this moment forward,

410
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,458
I am no longer your brother.

411
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,333
Understood.

412
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:39,000
And if we're fated to
meet again in battle...

413
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,916
If that day comes...

414
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,541
[NOBUYUKI, YUKIMURA]
I will not back down.

415
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,250
[YUKIMURA]
This is farewell.

416
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,833
Best of luck.
