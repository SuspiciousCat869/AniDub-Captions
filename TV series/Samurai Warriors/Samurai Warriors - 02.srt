dared to dream a dream.

It was a dream many

[NARRATION] The unity that had
so recently come to the land,

so torn by generations of war,

74
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,916
was dealt a crippling blow
by Hideyoshi's passing.

Shortly thereafter his
ally Toshiie Maeda,

joined him in the afterlife.

will the peace remain standing?

is no longer here with us?

Lord Uesugi deemed
it necessary to return.

He's on his way to Aizu.

The entire purpose of
our meeting today

83
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,541
is to discuss what the
future holds for Toyotomi

84
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,666
after Master Toshiie's
untimely passing.

85
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,500
Your lord's involvement
in such matters

86
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,416
is crucial to
maintaining the peace.

87
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,625
As you're well aware,
our house has been

88
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,958
transferred from Echigo
to Aizu very recently.

89
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,333
So it is crucial for us to
establish a foothold there.

90
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,166
[IEYASU] Yes, and there is
talk of Master Kagekatsu

91
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,250
building a new
fortress to that end.

"To establish a foothold."

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,125
But some may see it as
a preparation for war.

[BOTH gasp]

these same rumblings.

There are those that say
your lord is planning

98
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,708
a rebellion against
the Toyotomi.

99
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,833
So are the rumors
true or not, Kanetsugu?

100
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,541
They're false. Nothing but
unfounded gossip!

101
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,333
What truly needs clarification

102
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:02,708
is why Master Ieyasu is
gathering up Daimyo in Edo.

103
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,083
One may suspect, that you
are beginning to assemble

104
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,291
your forces to take
over the Toyotomi

105

in the wake of these
recent tragedies.

That's Nonsense.

107
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,333
Lord Hideyoshi himself entrusted
me to preserve his legacy,

108
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,875
and honoring the vow I made
to him is my sacred duty.

109
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,250
Preserve the Toyotomi.

110
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,208
Ensure that my legacy lives on.

111

Hideyori...

112
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,041
I assure you that I am merely
doing my best to see that peace,

113
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,791
which he devoted
his life to establish,

114
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,583
continues to flourish
and grow strong.

115
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:37,250
[MITSUNARI] You seem to forget
that was not your task alone.

116
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,666
We were all entrusted
to preserve that legacy,

117
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,250
were we not?

118
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,291
Such brazen arrogance carries
with it a considerable price.

119
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,458
Odd that you would be the
one to invoke such a term.

120
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,291
You knew Master Kagekatsu
would be absent today,

121
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,083
but chose to keep that
knowledge to yourself, correct?

122
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:54,750
Indeed.

123
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,208
Of course I did.

124
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,583
Because I determined that his
absence was acceptable.

Oh, is that so?

Are you the one to
make such decisions?

than it was before!

I'm beginning to grow rather
weary of your insinuations.

you to go there.

00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,500
If that's the case why
doesn't he say it himself?

164
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,541
Ordering me around like a vassal
is an insult to our friendship.

165
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,583
[MASANORI] All our lives,
we've gotten into fights.

166
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,250
But we never took it as anything
more than letting off steam!

167
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,125
What the hell happened to you?

168
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,708
[MITSUNARI scoffs]

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,666
I have realized that we
are no longer children.

[MASANORI, KIYOMASA grunt]

171
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,125
You're like my brother,
but you are not my master.

172
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,416
This is goodbye Mitsunari.

[MASANORI]
Kiyomasa...

174
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,708
We're gone!

[YUKIMURA]
Please, wait!

Master Kiyomasa!
Master Masanori!

[MASANORI]
Lady Nene,

178
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,000
do you really have to
leave all by yourself?

179
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,666
His spirit will
keep me company,

180
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,916
but there are simply too
many memories lingering here.

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,166
Aww...

182
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,250
You're such good boys.

183
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,125
Part of our family.

184
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,166
Always there for us.

185
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,833
Promise me you won't grow apart.

186
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,916
This peace is his legacy.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,625
But now it is in your hands.

188
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,083
Take care of it.

[ALL]
Yes!

00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,041
What will we do without you?

191
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,375
[MITSUNARI exhales]

192
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,041
[SAKON sighs]

193
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,208
This is troubling.

194
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,166
[NOBUYUKI]
I see.

195
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,000
So Lord Ieyasu
has returned to Edo.

196
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,541
[INA]
Yes.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,583
You seem pensive. Is there
something that's troubling you?

198
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:27,875
My family dutifully supported
the Takeda clan for many years.

199
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,416
But still, the house
fell so quickly

200
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,375
after Lord Shingen's passing.

201
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,958
It left me with a
sense of failure

202
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,250
the likes of which
I'd never experienced.

203
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,458
And I vowed to never forget.

204
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,125
Branches will fall, but no
tree survives without its trunk.

205
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,833
You're worried that the
Toyotomi and the union itself

206
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,750
will suffer the same fate that
befell the house of Takeda.

207
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,291
That it will not
survive this loss.

208
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,500
All I know is I must be
the trunk for the Sanada.

209
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,583
One that will withstand
the axes of war.

210
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,375
One that will not fall.

211
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,208
[YUKIMURA]
You should know, Master Kiyomasa

212
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,916
and Master Masanori
have left the castle.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,291
[KANETSUGU]
I see.

214
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,875
Although he may hide it,

215
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,791
Mitsunari's heart aches after
Lord Hideyoshi's sudden death.

216
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,083
I know.

217
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,416
You know the fate that
befell the Takeda clan.

218
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,833
Without their master they could
neither endure, nor be saved.

219
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,875
Master Mitsunari is painfully
aware that peace in the land

220
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,000
rests solely on the
survival of the Toyotomi.

221
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,666
And he seeks to
carry that burden

222
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,958
squarely on his
own shoulders.

223
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm afraid he
doesn't realize...

224
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,875
...it's too much for
one man to bear alone.

225
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,458
Then it is our duty to see
he doesn't bear it alone.

226
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,291
[KANETSUGU]
Indeed, it is.

227
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,333
[YOSHITSUGU]
Mitsunari.

228
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,458
Work shouldn't keep you from
the necessities of living.

229
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,583
I haven't seen you sleep or
eat a decent meal in days.

Don't you thin- -

231
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,708
Although he's no longer
with us in a physical sense,

232
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,041
my lord needs my
service more than ever.

233
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,708
[SAKON sighs]
So, in other words,

234
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,583
there's no rest for the weary.

235

[YOSHITSUGU] Careful you
don't exhaust yourself.

236
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,416
I appreciate your concern.

So unrefined.

241
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,708
A telltale sign that Sakon
must have made these.

242

[MITSUNARI chuckles]
That, and the saltiness.

[NOBUYUKI] It's time
I returned to Numata.

Please forgive me,

but I've been away from

I understand.

[IEYASU]
I'm sure you're all aware

266
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,916
of Lord Hideyoshi's
tragic passing.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,708
Were he still alive,
I would be in Kanto now.

268
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,541
Establishing a new province
under the Toyotomi banner

269
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,125
in the spirit of unity.

270
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:07,000
Alas, the circumstances
have sadly changed.

271
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,541
Lord Hideyori, his heir,
Is still quite young.

272
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,625
Too young to defend the peace
his father brought to this land.

273
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,041
Thus, We must do
everything in our power

274
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,208
to ensure this peace remains.

275
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,750
Even as we speak, Kagekatsu
Uesugi is rattling his sabers

276
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,875
and plotting against
the Toyotomi

277
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,000
from his stronghold
in the Aizu province.

278
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,916
We shall brook no
threat to peace,

279
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,708
and punish those
who dare disturb it!

War may be over, but our
vigilance must never end!

I ask you, join me to
quell this insurrection!

[ALL]
Aye!

283
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,166
Could it be true?

284
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,916
Have you forgotten the
allegiance Sanada has

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,583
to the house of Uesugi?

286
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,083
They joined forces to fight
against us before, you know?

287
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,750
And I wouldn't put it
past them to do it again!

288
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,416
Please, father!
They were our enemies!

289
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,250
We can't risk their
inevitable betrayal!

290

Master Mitsunari.

291
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,916
Have you reached
your decision?

292
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,125
[MITSUNARI]
Ieyasu plans to attack our lord.

293
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,666
I believe he's trying
to usurp Lord Hideyori

294
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,541
as leader of the Toyotomi.

295
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,541
The man has no honor.

296
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,958
Only blatant ambition.

297
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:39,250
This I swear. I will
strike him down.

298
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,875
Then I shall join you
and face Ieyasu in Aizu

299
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,166
to defend the Uesugi!

300
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,125
The house of Sanada
will repay our debt

301
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,250
and lend our swords to
the battle alongside you!

302
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,458
[MITSUNARI]
It's too late.

[YUKIMURA grunts]

304
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,833
Your brother's already
sided with the Tokugawa.

305
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,375
[YUKIMURA gasps]
That can't be true!

306
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,333
I found it hard
to believe myself,

307
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,708
but I'm afraid it is true.

308
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,291
But why?

309
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,041
Our family would never abandon
an ally in their time of need.

310
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,583
This must be
a misunderstanding

311
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,791
and I will clear it up once I
remind him of our obligation

312
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,125
to the Uesugi.

313
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,833
You need not ask for
my support in this battle,

314
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,750
I pledge it without
any hesitation!

315
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,833
In the battle of Ueda, both of
you willingly risked your lives

316
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,625
to save mine and if I
should happen to die

317
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,000
while repaying that debt
to you, then so be it!

318
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,458
As long as there's breath in my
lungs, I'll fight on your side.

00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,208
[MITSUNARI]
Fools.

320
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,583
Let us swear our oath
of devotion together!

321
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,083
[YUKIMURA]
Yes!

322
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,416
Kanetsugu Naoe!

323
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,666
Yukimura Sanada!

324
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,083
[MITSUNARI exhales]

325
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,083
Mitsunari Ishida.

326
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,708
[KANETSUGU] We three shall
fight together as one.

327
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,291
And share a righteous victory!

328
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,000
[KUNOICHI]
Nobuyuki my lord.

329
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,625
[NOBUYUKI gasps]

330
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,166
[NOBUYUKI]
What is it?

331
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,041
Lord Yukimura would like to
have a word with you in private.

332
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,666
He's waiting for you.

333
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,541
In Inubushi.

334
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,541
[NOBUYUKI sighs]

335
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,416
[NOBUYUKI]
I understand.

336
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,583
[NARRATION] With each
hoping to convince the other

337
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,291
of the proper way forward.
The brothers ride off

338
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,166
to meet in a small village
in the Shimotsuke province.

339
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,291
[NOBUYUKI]
Yukimura, your line's pulling!

340
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,875
[YUKIMURA grunts]
Yes! I got it!

341
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,875
[YOUNG NOBUYUKI]
Let me help you!

342
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,833
Are you ready?

343
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:48,541
Go!

344
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:52,083
[BOTH grunting]

345
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,291
[BOTH gasp]

346
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,708
[BOTH shout, grunt]

347
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:09,291
[BOTH laugh]

348
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,333
[YUKIMURA]
You're here!

349
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,791
[gasps]

350
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,375
[NOBUYUKI]
Yukimura.

351
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,375
[YUKIMURA] I come bearing a
letter from Master Mitsunari.

352
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,833
I ask that you please read it.

353
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,041
[NOBUYUKI]
I already know what it says.

354
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,375
He wants us to join him.

355
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,083
To take up arms against Ieyasu.

356
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,083
I'm afraid I don't
understand your hesitation.

357
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,375
Then I refuse
without hesitation.

358
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,833
You do?

359
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,875
[NOBUYUKI]
Yukimura.

360
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,500
Please listen.

361
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,625
I side with Tokugawa.

362
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,500
[YUKIMURA] Why?!
Explain yourself, brother!

363
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,833
[NOBUYUKI] Because I remember
what happened to the Takeda clan

364
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,250
after Lord Shingen's passing.

365
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,208
History cannot be
allowed to repeat itself.

366
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,625
The stakes are much too high.

367
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,750
[YUKIMURA]
That is exactly why

368
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,541
we have to be on
the right side of it!

369
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,375
Why we need to
fight with Mitsunari!

370
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,083
I understand your feelings,

371
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,041
but Mitsunari is
in no way capable

372
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,750
of holding up the Toyotomi!

373
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,375
He can if we give him the full
support of the Sanada family!

374
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,083
[NOBUYUKI exhales]
You're wrong.

375
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,083
I have thought this through.
And I've come to the conclusion

376
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,833
that only Lord Ieyasu is
capable of keeping the peace.

377
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,291
[YUKIMURA] Peace, maybe.
But what about righteousness?

378
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,583
[NOBUYUKI gasps]

379
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,750
Please join me!

380
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,291
[YUKIMURA gasps]

381
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,250
[YUKIMURA gasps]

382
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,291
[NOBUYUKI] My wish is
to be our family's trunk.

383
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,166
And so I must not
permit myself to bend.

384
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,500
To preserve the
Soul of the Sanada,

385
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,916
I shall wage war
on behalf of peace.

386
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,208
Fighting alongside the Tokugawa.

387
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,250
Let's fight for peace!
As brothers!

388
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,583
I'm sorry, brother.
But I can't do that.

389
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,416
[NOBUYUKI gasps]

390
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,958
[YUKIMURA] Even if it means
that you and I are destined

391
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,708
to part ways, I will honor
my debt to the Uesugi

392
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,041
and throw in my lot
against the Tokugawa.

393
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,083
I shall wage war on
behalf of righteousness

394
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,250
and fight alongside Mitsunari.

395
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,500
[YUKIMURA]
I wish you luck, brother.

[MITSUNARI gasps]

403
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,041
I guess typing isn't
exactly your strong suit?

404
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:11,916
Ah, shut up!

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,291

[NARRATION]
Ueda castle.

409
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,166
The Sanada's home
away from home,

410
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,291
Is no longer a place of refuge.

411
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,375
The cherry blossoms are no
longer a symbol of unity.

412
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,458
They now set the stage
for war between brothers.
