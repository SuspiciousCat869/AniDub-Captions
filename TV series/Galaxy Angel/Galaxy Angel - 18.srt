1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,310
(engines whirring)
(zapping)

2
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,768
(warning bell blaring)
‐ Oops, I did it again!

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,015
‐ What do you mean, oops?

4
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,476
We just installed
the new engine!

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,446
You pushed it too hard
without breaking it in first!

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,699
‐ Come to think of it,

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,410
even the maintenance
crew were complaining

8
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,242
that it wouldn’t
withstand 30 parsecs

9
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,907
with you behind the controls.

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,035
‐ [Normad] That’s
right, look at Vanilla!

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,200
(Forte growling)
Twice around the cave

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,790
without a problem,
that’s a big difference!

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,754
‐ Hey, you can shut up!

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,956
It’s not my style to just
putter around in these things!

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,127
‐ No need to get so upset!
(Forte growls)

16
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,547
So, what are you gonna do now?

17
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,684
‐ Uh, uh, well...

18
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,055
Hey, look at that!

19
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,734
I betcha this station’s got
all the parts I’m gonna need!

20
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,985
(computer beeps)

21
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,988
(engine roars)
(alarm blares)

22
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,081
("Galaxy Bang!
Bang!" by Angel‐tai)

23
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,915
(singing in foreign language)

24
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,699
This is Lieutenant Forte Stollen

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,828
of the Angel Brigade
requesting permission

26
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,835
to use your facility
for repair purposes.

27
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,844
Hello, do you read me?

28
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,634
Are you there?

29
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,837
‐ I’d say it looks like
their shields are down.

30
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,178
‐ I guess we’ll just have
to check it out then.

31
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,805
‐ I am a bit concerned that
there’s been no response yet.

32
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,602
(gears whirring)

33
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,276
‐ [All] Hmm?

34
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:18,777
Huh?
(comical music)

35
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,325
‐ (quivers) What a stinky mess!

36
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,043
‐ This really couldn’t be‐‐
‐ What in the hell

37
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,583
is going on here?
‐ Any more foul!

38
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,338
‐ [Forte] Bah, they should
clean this place up a bit.

39
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,422
No matter, let’s head inside.
‐ Okay, here we go.

40
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,968
(Mint grunting)

41
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,682
(Forte grunts)

42
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,727
‐ [Forte] Hurry up, Vanilla!

43
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,902
(gears whirring)
(all sigh)

44
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,732
‐ Thank goodness that’s over!

45
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,396
‐ Someone was out there.
‐ What?!

46
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,859
‐ Why didn’t you say so before?

47
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:04,948
(Mint and Forte grunt)
(elevator beeps)

48
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,173
‐ What an incredible
mess this place is.

49
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,420
‐ Something’s not quite right.

50
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,715
(grunts) Hey, give
that back to me!

51
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,724
‐ Forte!

52
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,273
‐ These people should keep
their pets on a leash!

53
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,441
(Mint and Forte heavily breathe)

54
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,823
(Mint groaning)

55
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,027
(growls) Oh!

56
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,197
(monkeys chattering)

57
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,512
‐ What’s going on here,
what’s with all these monkeys?

58
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,557
‐ Huh, there are too
many of them to be pets.

59
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,981
Anyway, doesn’t matter,
I’ve gotta get my hat back.

60
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,727
‐ Forte!
‐ This is a much faster

61
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,614
way to deal with them,
and I don’t like chimps.

62
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,481
‐ You mustn’t.
‐ Huh?

63
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,648
‐ They may only be monkeys,

64
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,358
but they are God’s
creatures all the same

65
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,778
and should be
treated accordingly.

66
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,624
‐ Yeah, yeah, okay,
I guess you’re right.

67
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,790
‐ In any case, I
think it would be best

68
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,579
if we got in touch with
Headquarters right away.

69
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,504
‐ Alright.

70
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,788
Hey out of the way, you monkeys!

71
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,297
‐ She’s so crude.

72
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,129
‐ [Normad] An example of a
life form lower than a monkey.

73
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:46,216
(Forte grunts)
(computer beeping)

74
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:47,682
‐ Hmm, yes?

75
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,556
This is the Angel Room.

76
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,693
Oh, it’s Forte,
where are you now?

77
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,151
‐ The Third Space Station of
the Cornelius planetary system.

78
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,271
We were forced to come
here for engine repairs.

79
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,398
‐ [Ranpha] Did you just
say the Third Space Station

80
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,397
of the Cornelius
planetary system?

81
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,199
‐ Yeah?
(Ranpha giggling)

82
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,373
‐ Hmm?
(Ranpha laughing)

83
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,121
‐ What’s so damn funny?

84
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,373
‐ Could there possibly
be a whole lot

85
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,577
of monkeys surrounding you?

86
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,288
‐ Yeah, there is, (groans)
crawling all over the place.

87
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,708
What’s the deal here? (grunts)

88
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,377
‐ They are people,
you know, humans.

89
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,928
‐ Humans?

90
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,391
‐ You see, that station is
a virus research facility.

91
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,273
A new biohazardous virus got
out of control there recently

92
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,062
and unfortunately, most
of the facility personnel

93
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,615
contracted it.
‐ (laughs) And so, they all,

94
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,072
they all turned into
monkeys! (laughs)

95
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,243
‐ Then, don’t tell
me, we’re going to,

96
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,912
we’re going to...

97
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,704
‐ Turn into monkeys!

98
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,829
(Mint quivers)

99
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,036
‐ Monkey, monkey, monkey!

100
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,763
(monkeys squealing
and chattering)

101
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,882
Monkey, monkey, monkey?!

102
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:13,809
Monkey, monkey, monkey?! (yells)

103
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,354
No!

104
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,555
No! (cries)

105
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,437
‐ How is the virus
passed on exactly?

106
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,066
‐ Well, let me just see here.

107
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,071
The virus is contracted
through the air.

108
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,204
(Forte groans)

109
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,451
‐ [Mint] Nooo!

110
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,288
‐ How do you treat it,
isn’t there a vaccine?

111
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,540
‐ A special research
team is in the process

112
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,595
of developing it as we speak.

113
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,709
Oh, but you needn’t
be concerned.

114
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,296
You only turn into monkeys

115
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,472
and there’s no
threat to your lives.

116
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,841
‐ Huh, who’s gonna
turn into a monkey?

117
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,139
‐ (laughs) Huh, where’s Forte?

118
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,103
Hey!

119
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,230
‐ Let’s get out of
here as fast as we can!

120
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,691
(Mint and Forte groan)

121
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,783
‐ Huh?

122
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:21,464
(Mint and Forte scream)
(monkey screaming)

123
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,963
‐ Did he do that?!

124
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:30,046
(comical music)
(buttons beeping)

125
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,770
(Forte crying)
‐ ’Key, monkey, monkey,

126
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,021
monkey, mon...

127
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,854
(alarms blaring)

128
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,733
‐ Wha, what could
it be this time?

129
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,150
What is it, what is it,
what’s going on now?

130
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:50,911
‐ [Normad] The monkeys set off

131
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,371
the self‐destruct mechanism!

132
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,544
(Forte groans)

133
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,539
‐ [Computer] 180 seconds
until self‐destruct.

134
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,711
‐ Let’s get out of here now!

135
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,705
‐ [Normad] But what
about the monkeys?

136
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,126
‐ They’re just
monkeys, forget ’em!

137
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,005
‐ Look, we can’t do that.

138
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,892
They may look like monkeys.
(Forte growling and groaning)

139
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,892
‐ [Computer] 170 seconds
until self‐destruct.

140
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,435
‐ Then what are
we supposed to do?

141
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:23,188
You say we should just die
with the monkeys? (yells)

142
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,031
(Vanilla imitating monkey calls)

143
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,236
(monkeys chattering)
(Mint and Forte quivering)

144
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,747
‐ [Computer] 30 seconds
until self‐destruct.

145
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,923
10 seconds until self‐destruct.

146
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,643
(metal clashing)

147
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,813
Self‐destructing.

148
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,405
(space station explodes)

149
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:20,125
(monkeys chattering)
(Forte and Mint sigh)

150
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:26,878
‐ Whew, we barely made
it outta there. (sighs)

151
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,750
Hmm?

152
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,759
(quivers)

153
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,586
What the hell is this?!

154
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:44,482
(slow, cheerful music)

155
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,652
‐ Yes?

156
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,860
Yes, we have recovered them all.

157
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,862
Yes, well, they’ve all
turned into monkeys,

158
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,075
and I can’t really tell.

159
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,913
Hmm, yes?

160
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,659
I can’t identify who’s who.

161
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,161
I agree, I think we’ll just
have to keep them all together

162
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,835
until the vaccine is ready.

163
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,630
What, feed them bananas
because they have a peel?

164
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,015
(laughs) That’s terrible!

165
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,681
Hmm?
(glass crashes)

166
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,339
(Ranpha screams)
(monkey grunting)

167
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:23,428
(monkeys screaming)
(items crashing)

168
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,650
‐ Oh, my, we still
have time left!

169
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,236
What should I do?!

170
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,867
Shakku!
‐ What is it, Yuri?

171
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,204
‐ [Yuri] Shakku, we
have 15 seconds left!

172
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,578
Could you say something?

173
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,164
‐ Now, can’t the writers
come up with some lines?

174
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,918
Okay, (farts), I’ll tell you
why only corned beef cans

175
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,003
are shaped like
corned beef cans.

176
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,126
Do you like corned
beef, Yuri, hmm?

177
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,301
‐ [Yuri] I love it!

178
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,802
‐ Corned beef is‐‐

179
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,514
‐ [Normad] Now listen,
if you drop your fart,

180
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,014
don’t pick it up yourself.

181
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,505
What are you doing?!

182
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,927
Don’t you realize that we
can’t just sit here like this

183
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,427
and pick all night?

184
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,888
Which is more important, your
life or your cake recipe?

185
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,349
I really don’t think
you understand.

186
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,597
So, I’ll tell you again.

187
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,730
Will you really get me?! (sighs)

188
