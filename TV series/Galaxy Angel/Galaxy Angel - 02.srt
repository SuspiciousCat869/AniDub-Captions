1
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,022
(ship humming)

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,351
‐ [Mint] So it’s just
Vanilla and me this time?

3
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,097
‐ Yes, I’ve been trying
to get ahold of the others

4
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,018
but it seems they’re
both still on vacation.

5
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,897
‐ And so are we after all.

6
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,106
It’s just that when I was told
that somebody new was coming

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,526
I decided I should
stay near the base.

8
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:32,987
Right, Vanilla?

9
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,446
‐ Vanilla doesn’t seem
to be having a problem

10
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,908
with that at all.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,369
‐ You know, Volcott, it’s
always the quiet types

12
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,538
like her that go completely
berserk out of the blue

13
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,709
with no warning.

14
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,215
‐ Really?

15
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,128
Hmm.

16
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,796
‐ Hey, Colonel, don’t you
think it would be good idea

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,505
to have Forte and Ranpha with us

18
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,255
before the new recruit arrives?

19
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,717
‐ I do,

20
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,519
but I have no idea
where they are,

21
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,811
or what they’re doing
with themselves.

22
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,733
‐ [Ranpha] Forte, I don’t
think this is a good idea.

23
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,575
‐ [Forte] Don’t
worry, leave it to me.

24
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,692
‐ But.

25
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,396
(dramatic percussive music)

26
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,821
But, Forte‐‐

27
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,367
‐ Shh, quiet, Ranpha.

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,240
‐ But I.

29
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,408
‐ That’s it!

30
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,117
(ball rattles)

31
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,167
‐ On black, number four.

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,079
‐ Yeah!

33
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,923
‐ That was sweet!

34
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,762
(sirens blaring)

35
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,602
(upbeat music)

36
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,111
(singing in foreign language)

37
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,683
Gamble Milfeulle Sauce.

38
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,676
(ball rattles)

39
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,767
‐ Red, number seven.

40
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,692
‐ Wow, I can’t believe the
winning streak you’re having.

41
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,614
What luck!

42
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,896
It’s incredible.

43
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,986
‐ [Forte] This is nothing.

44
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,529
‐ Huh?

45
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,032
‐ You know, if this keeps
up we could spend the rest

46
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,945
of our lives on
this resort planet

47
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,622
and never have to worry
about anything ever again.

48
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:23,658
‐ Wow.

49
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,749
‐ All right, Ranpha Franboise,

50
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,292
are you ready to go on
a really long vacation?

51
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,536
‐ [Man] I’m impressed.

52
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,879
‐ Huh?

53
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,552
‐ It seems that luck
is on your side.

54
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,342
‐ (giggles) That’s right.

55
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,305
We seem to be on quite
the wild streak of luck.

56
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,386
You look like you just
might be the perfect one

57
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,351
to share it with.

58
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,019
‐ So, just who are you?

59
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,651
‐ My name is Green, and I’m
the owner of this casino.

60
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,399
Now, how would you like
a little excitement,

61
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,151
like some competitive betting?

62
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,741
‐ Hmm.

63
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,373
(patrons chattering)

64
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,819
‐ Well, let’s begin.

65
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,328
Bets, please.

66
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,621
(ball whooshing)

67
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,764
What will it be?

68
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,471
‐ Hmm, I’ll put
everything on red.

69
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,182
‐ Oh no, Forte!

70
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,676
‐ [Green] Well, I do
admire your courage.

71
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,685
(dramatic music)

72
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,387
(wheel whirs)

73
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,227
(dramatic music)

74
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,772
‐ Why thank you.

75
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,109
(Green laughs)

76
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,775
(Mint sighs)

77
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,574
(phone ringing)

78
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,655
(Mint sighs)

79
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,455
‐ Ah, Ms. Mint, come here.

80
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,909
I’ve got Forte and
Ranpha on the line.

81
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,629
‐ Forte, Ranpha, what
are you two up to anyway?

82
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,264
We’ve been looking for you.

83
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,129
‐ [Both] Mint, we’re
having such a blast!

84
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,472
‐ Okay, something’s up.

85
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,184
‐ [Both] You’re on vacation too,

86
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,474
why don’t you come and join us?

87
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,098
‐ I don’t think that’s possible.

88
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,683
The new person will
be starting today

89
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,100
so I can’t leave here.

90
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,346
‐ Come on, spend a
little time with us.

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,400
We really need to
see you face to face

92
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:19,322
and we want to talk to about
something really important.

93
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,822
‐ We won’t take a
lot of your time.

94
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,664
You’ll be back to base
before you know it.

95
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,490
‐ I’m not lending
you money, sorry.

96
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,832
‐ [Both] Well, we tried.

97
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,286
(both gasp)

98
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,384
‐ All right, girls, shall we go?

99
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,634
(bell rings)

100
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,921
(luchador yells)

101
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,795
(kick thuds)

102
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,631
(luchador thuds)

103
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,835
‐ Ranpha!

104
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,507
‐ Yeah, I’m right here.

105
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,716
(Ranpha thuds)

106
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,636
(Forte grunts)

107
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,732
(both grunting)
(bones cracking)

108
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,693
(crowd cheering)

109
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,324
‐ Go get ’em, girls, come on!

110
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,819
That’s it, go get her!

111
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,990
‐ You know, I think this
is more fun than roulette.

112
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,239
‐ I couldn’t agree more,

113
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,913
but at the moment I’m
almost at my limit.

114
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,792
(Forte groaning)

115
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,706
Ranpha.

116
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,331
(bones cracking)
(Ranpha groaning)

117
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,587
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

118
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,553
‐ [Milfeulle] Don’t quit now!

119
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,381
‐ Huh?

120
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,377
‐ Just give him one.

121
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,296
Like this and like this.

122
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,215
‐ Huh?

123
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,894
‐ Come on, you’ve got it in you.

124
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,811
‐ Huh?

125
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,232
‐ [Both] It’s that lucky girl!

126
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,059
(bell rings)

127
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,235
‐ That was amazing to
see a comeback like that.

128
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,395
Wow, and what was that
last move you pulled?

129
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,534
You lifted her up and
dropped her on her head.

130
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,530
I’ve never seen
anything like it.

131
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,532
Honestly, you both are just
so awesome in that ring.

132
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,745
‐ Excuse me.

133
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,696
How much money do you
have with you right now?

134
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,615
‐ Huh?

135
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,165
‐ Okay, my friend, listen,

136
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,956
from your clothes I can see
that you’re in the military.

137
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,672
What would your commander say

138
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,461
if he knew you were out
this late at a casino?

139
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,507
‐ You know, you two sure
don’t look much like

140
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,049
professional wrestlers.

141
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,552
(both groaning)

142
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,894
‐ [Both] We need to know how
much money you have with you!

143
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,349
‐ Here.

144
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,639
I’m sorry, but it’s all I’ve
got left after shopping.

145
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,985
I found this great sale
on the best chocolate

146
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,230
I’ve ever tasted.

147
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,016
‐ Unbelievable.

148
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,108
‐ Okay, girls, time
to for the next match.

149
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,531
‐ Sorry, Green, but we’re
through wrestling for you.

150
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,359
That’s it.

151
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,613
‐ Oh?

152
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,904
Then you’ll be paying
cash for your debts

153
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,908
that you owe the casino?

154
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,450
‐ You bet.

155
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,775
(slot machine dinging)

156
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,080
‐ Forte,

157
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,791
I know that girl’s
got nothing but luck

158
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,331
but do you think we
should be trusting her

159
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,456
with the very last coin we have?

160
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,131
‐ I think we’re out
of options here.

161
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,460
The best thing we can do now

162
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,884
is bet on our friend’s
mysterious good fortune.

163
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,344
‐ Forte.

164
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,255
‐ I mean, do you really
wanna quit the Angel Brigade

165
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,142
and become a
professional wrestler?

166
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,340
‐ Hello.

167
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,800
‐ Will you please shut up?

168
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,100
Look, what I’m saying is
do we want to put our fates

169
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,852
into the hands of
a total stranger?

170
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,806
Our future rests with that coin.

171
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,614
We’ve only got one last
chance to make it or break it.

172
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,809
(lever creaks)
‐ Huh?

173
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,070
(slot machine dinging)

174
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,779
‐ Look, everything’s
going round and round.

175
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,149
This is so much fun.

176
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,317
‐ No wait!
‐ A minute!

177
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,065
(slot machine dining)

178
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,325
Luck or no luck, we
definitely need a miracle.

179
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,659
(slot machine dinging)

180
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,695
(coins clattering)

181
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,870
‐ Oh no!

182
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,248
What’s happening here?

183
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,712
What am I supposed to do?

184
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,344
Oh no, stop, stop!

185
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,960
‐ She is something else.

186
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,627
(upbeat music)

187
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,901
(ball rattles)

188
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,533
‐ Black again, number four.

189
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,858
‐ You won again.

190
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,495
Now we’re really
back in the game.

191
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,740
‐ Good one.

192
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,323
What are you going
to play next, huh?

193
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,196
‐ [Milfeulle] Let’s
see, I’m 17 years old,

194
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,494
so how about 17?

195
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,202
‐ Very impressive.

196
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,365
Have you girls broken even yet?

197
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,919
‐ Hey, back off, Green.

198
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,883
We’ll do a lot better than
that before the day’s out.

199
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,052
‐ Hey, hey!

200
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,462
I just won again!

201
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,298
‐ (laughs) Tell me, girls,

202
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,973
how can we make this
more interesting?

203
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,053
How about a game
of all or nothing?

204
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,760
Of course if you win

205
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,140
we can just forget about the
debt that you still owe me.

206
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,055
(Ranpha gasps)

207
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,485
Fair is fair.
‐ Really?

208
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,441
‐ On the other hand,
if I defeat you,

209
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,073
your beautiful friend
here must join you

210
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,859
in the wrestling ring.

211
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,572
I’m sure she’ll be more popular.

212
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,864
(Ranpha scoffs)

213
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,527
‐ [Forte] Fine, let’s play!

214
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,700
(upbeat music)

215
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,247
‐ Now we begin.

216
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,461
Place your bets.

217
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,127
(ball whooshes)

218
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,092
Well, my friends?

219
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,086
‐ What will you bet on?

220
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,388
‐ Hmm, I know, red
as in strawberries.

221
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,603
‐ Are you sure?

222
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,314
(upbeat music)

223
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,401
(wheel whirs)

224
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,151
Do you realize just
how serious this is?

225
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,985
(Green laughs)

226
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,701
(ball rattles)

227
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,464
(girls trilling)

228
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,750
(ball rattles)

229
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,292
(all gasping)

230
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,956
(Green laughs)

231
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,208
‐ [Green] It seems
like I’ve won, so.

232
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,048
‐ Look!

233
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,473
A shooting star!

234
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,298
(meteor whooshing)

235
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,888
(glass shatters)

236
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,183
‐ What the heck?

237
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,847
What’s going on‐‐
(metal thuds)

238
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,976
(glass shattering)
(wind whooshing)

239
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,574
‐ [Forte] How unbelievable.

240
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,150
‐ Whoa.

241
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:53,986
‐ [Milfeulle] Wow!

242
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,990
‐ [Both] Huh?

243
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,991
‐ Hey, it’s on the red.

244
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,783
Look, look, we’re on the red.

245
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,698
I think that this means that
we win again, doesn’t it?

246
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,159
(girls stammering)

247
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,708
‐ Is this really happening?

248
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,208
What?

249
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,415
She’s joining us?

250
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,463
She’s assigned to Angel Brigade?

251
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,707
‐ Yes, that’s correct.

252
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,720
Apparently she was a
very bright student

253
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,472
at officer training school.

254
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,352
Something about
having good luck.

255
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,929
‐ That’s nice but does
that make her very bright?

256
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,025
‐ Now, now, she’s
in the Brigade,

257
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,192
so you girls are going
to have to work together.

258
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,189
‐ Well, I don’t
approve of this at all.

259
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,363
We can’t rely on
happy accidents.

260
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,361
‐ Ranpha, do you want to go
back to wrestling or what?

261
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,744
After all, she was the one

262
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,821
that got us out of
our gambling debt.

263
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,075
(Ranpha groans)

264
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,368
Welcome to the Brigade.

265
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,200
And what was your name again?

266
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,866
(upbeat music)

267
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,755
Recruit, are you with us here?

268
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,213
‐ My name is Milfeulle Sakuraba.

269
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,714
And I look forward to
working with all of you.

270
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,376
(upbeat music)

271
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,391
‐ [Mint] Close your eyes
and picture a flower garden.

272
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,851
‐ [Forte] Doesn’t sound too bad.

273
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,350
‐ [Milfeulle] I think
that’s wonderful.

274
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,181
‐ [Man] No Kidding.

275
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,056
‐ [Forte] Have I
got a body for you.

276
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,393
‐ [Milfeulle] I think
that’s wonderful.

277
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,059
‐ [Mint] It doesn’t seem to go.

278
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,986
(upbeat pop music)

279
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,171
(singing in foreign language)
