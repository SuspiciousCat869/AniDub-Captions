lead them all to safety here

you hold on for a minute?

‐ What for?

63
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,077
‐ [Mint] Are you sure we should
just abandon our research

64
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,832
into the lost technology?

65

‐ What, now is not the time
to be thinking about work!

‐ Remember how you
charged all that Oden

70
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,926
to your expense account?

71
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,097
‐ [Mint] You could
pay for it easily

72
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,469

you get, don’t you think?

you’re responsible,

your whole bonus.

hang on a minute.

80
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,281
‐ Why, you know, I’m
kind of busy right now.

81
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,741
‐ [Mint] There’s some
birds stranded in a tree

82
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,611
on the other side
of that hill there.

83
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,118
If you don’t save them.

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,120
‐ Are you insane, if I do that,

85
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,622
we’re all gonna drown here.

86
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,665
‐ But I’ve heard that the
feathers of the birds here

87
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,459
are the most powerful
good luck charms anywhere.

88
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,133
‐ Are they really that strong?

89
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,170
‐ [Mint] Yes, they’ll bring
you incredible luck in love.

90
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,416
‐ No way, where are they?

91
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,797
Hey, get back here!

92
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,095
‐ I’m so impressed, Vanilla!

93
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,967
‐ You won’t beat me to them!

94
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:04,894
(grunting)

95
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,851

in front of a donkey,

00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,863

you want, won’t it?

but while you’re here,

102
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,158

have change for 1000?

(screaming)
(gasping)

106
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,918
‐ What’s happening?

107
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,008
‐ The water’s getting higher!

108
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,880
(screaming)

109
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,376
‐ Retreat, retreat!

110
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,678
‐ [Forte] There’s nothing
more important right now

111
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,341
than saving ourselves!

112
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,887
‐ People will change
their behavior

113
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,512
when confronted with
immediate danger.

114
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,518
A change of plan, then.

115
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:54,402
(rhythmic beeping)
(intense music)

116
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,191
‐ Ranpha, this is Mint
here, you got a minute?

117
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,324
‐ No, forget the lucky charms,
I’m trying to save my life!

118
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,572
‐ [Mint] No, that’s not it.

119
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,865
I want to tell you
the shortest route

120
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,856
to the observation deck.

121
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,199
(grunting)

122
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,993
‐ Just turn right
at the next fork

123
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,525
in the path you’re currently on.

124
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,328
There, you’ll see a
statue of a dancer.

125
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,372
‐ A statue of a dancer?

126
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,205
(gasping)

127
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,670
There!

128
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,129
‐ [Mint] Hurry, or the
tide will sweep you away!

129
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,589
(yelling)

130
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,591
Come quickly, I’m right up
here on the observation deck!

131
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,724
‐ I’m on my way!

132
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,551
‐ Forte.

133
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,805
‐ [Forte] Yeah?

134
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,015
‐ Do you see a big
bench of camellias?

135
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,757
‐ Yeah?

136
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,009
‐ [Mint] If you turn
right at that garden,

137
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,308
you’ll find the shortest
route to the platform.

138
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,312
‐ Are you sure?

139
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,643
‐ [Mint] Hurry up!

140
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,018
‐ Right, thanks.

141
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,064
(rhythmic beeping)
‐ Now then,

142
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,767
listen to me closely.

143
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,069
There’s a door at the
top of those stairs.

144
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,902
You’ll have to use
all of your strength

145
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,398
to open that door.

146
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,607
Then you’ll be able to make
it the rest of the way.

147
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,870
‐ All right!

148
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,409
‐ I’ll be at the
observation deck.

149
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,832
And move as fast as you can!

150
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,581
(beeping)

151
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,538
(ominous music)
And now it’s all set up.

152
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,167
(change rattling)

153
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,546
(birds cawing)

00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,763

00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,013
(panting)

156
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,059
(screaming)

157
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,231
(grunting)

158
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,060
‐ It won’t open, why?

159
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,445
Why won’t it open?

160
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,435
(grunting)

161
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,114
‐ What is wrong with this door?

162
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,279
(laughing)

163
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,121
‐ Aren’t they all so
incredibly obedient?

164
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,871
And now.
(beeping)

165
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,293
Hey, watch out, the tide
is closing in on you!

166
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,123
‐ What?

167
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:37,958
‐ No!

168
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,423
(screaming)

169
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,126
‐ Oh my god!

170
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,125
(camera snapping)

171
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,587
(beeping)

172
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:54,468
‐ So farewell then, my
friends of the Angel Brigade.

173
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,849
(laughing)

174
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,733
‐ [Forte And Ranpha]
We can’t die here!

175
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,613
(yelling)

176
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,359
(grunting)

177
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,693
(grunting)

178
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,408
‐ What’s going on down there?

179
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,531
(gasping)

180
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,579
Lady, I need change, change!

181
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,615
Please, can you give
me some change, lady?

182
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,464
‐ Hm?

183
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,172
(traditional Japanese music)

184
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,210
‐ Huh?

185
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,602
Huh?

186
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,524
(scoffing)

187
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,558
What’s this now?

188
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,191
(furious grunting)

189
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,902
(upbeat music)

190
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,980
(splashing)

191
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,488
‐ It’s just a hop, skip,
and a jump to the deck.

192
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,201
We’re almost there, Mint!

193
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,161
‐ Hey, Ranpha, you’re
looking good over there.

194
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,952
‐ Wow, look over
there, little bird!

195
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:57,947
‐ Thank goodness she
showed us the shortcut!

196
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,538
‐ It’s so cute!

197
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,212
‐ No kidding, we owe
our lives to that girl.

198
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,293
‐ Those birds are so sweet!

199
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,546
‐ [Forte] Thank you, Mint!

200
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,384
‐ [Mint Voiceover] Oh, what
incredible survival instincts.

201
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,393
Now it’s only a matter of
time before they see me.

202
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,313
‐ What’s that?

203
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,885
That’s pretty strange.

204
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:21,729
(gasping)

205
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,193
Hold it, lady!

206
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,111
(gasping)

207
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,980
(traditional Japanese music)

208
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,195
‐ But how did you know?

209
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,784
‐ I didn’t say anything.

210
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,071
(yelling)

211
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,992
So you’ve been the one
behind this all along.

212
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,242
This tide is not
rising naturally,

213
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,235
there’s another reason for it.

214
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,536
The water level is
not getting higher,

215
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,830
what’s happening is that
the island is sinking.

216
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,295
It wasn’t until I saw
those birds stranded

217
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,707
in their nest that I
figured everything out.

218
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,626
There’s no way birds
would build their nest

219
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,756
that close to where
the tide comes in.

220
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,221
(ominous music)

221
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,101
Now I realize that all
this has just been a ploy

222
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,931
to keep us from figuring out
that you’re hiding something.

223
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:00,926
‐ Why, you!

224
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:02,945
(yelling)

225
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,899
(glass shattering)

226
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,809
Why, you.

227
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,109
(screaming)

228
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,442
(grunting)

229
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,663
‐ Huh?

230
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,873
(gasping)

231
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,291
It’s come off!

232
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,200
(gasping)

233
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,037
So this remote control
belongs to you?

234
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:24,874
(beeping)

235
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,208
(rumbling)

236
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:30,956
‐ Now what?

237
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,968
(birds chirping)

238
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,970
(machine whirring)

239
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,605
(comical music)

240
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,320
‐ [Forte] Who would
have guessed there was

241
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,401
an illegal weapons
factory down there?

242
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,817
‐ That was pretty good
thinking there, Mint.

243
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,656
‐ That’s for sure, you really
stole the show this time.

244
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,334
(laughing)

245
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,121
‐ [Milfeulle] Hey, look!

246
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,083
‐ Huh?

247
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,333
‐ You know, I haven’t seen one

248
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,205
of these dress‐up
props in years!

249
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,882
I’m gonna try it out!

250
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:08,961
(laughing)

251
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,673
‐ Oh now, come on, Milfeulle.

252
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,463
Don’t be so silly,
all that stuff

253
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,507
is just for kids.

254
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,260
‐ Yeah, that’s for sure.

255
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,131
‐ Hey, look at me!

256
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,548
‐ [Forte] I’ll take a
picture of you, say cheese!

257
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,009
(giggling)

258
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,847
‐ Be careful, it’s easier
than you might think

259
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,314
to get stuck in that.

260
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,940
‐ [Forte] Yeah right,
how’s that gonna happen?

261
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:28,941
(laughing)

262
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,522
‐ [Milfeulle] This is great fun!

263
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,187
(Milfeulle laughing)

264
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,028
(Milfeulle grunting)

265
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,613
I can’t get out, what do I do?

266
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,237
‐ [Mint] I warned you.

267
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,775
‐ [Ranpha] What are
you going to do?

268
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,407
‐ [Mint] You might be
able to free yourself

269
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,365
by falling on top of someone.

270
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,914
‐ [Forte] Oh, come on.
(Forte laughing)

271
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,250
‐ [Milfeulle] I’m
really stuck, help me!

272
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,705
Hey, where are you
going, don’t leave me!

273
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,214

00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,803
Hey, I’m free!

‐ [Vanilla] My futon flew away.

277
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,141
‐ [Milfeulle] What’s
the matter, Vanilla?

278
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,101
‐ [Vanilla] I love sukiyaki.

279
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,852
‐ [Milfeulle] Uh, are you okay?

280
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,222
‐ [Vanilla] The
cat took a catnap.

281
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,430
‐ [Milfeulle] Are you
sure you’re all right?

282
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,979
‐ [Vanilla] Ladybug like right.
