1
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,182
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,808
(woman sighs)

3
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,994
‐ [Forte] Another
coffee, please.

4
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,279
‐ [Ranpha] And a
chili dog for me.

5
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,862
(bell chimes)

6
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,496
Is that actually
your seventh coffee?

7
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,909
‐ [Forte] And how many
chili dogs have you had?

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,578
(Ranpha munching)

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,629
‐ Forte,

10
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,923
exactly what do you
think the real purpose

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,048
of the Galaxy Angel Brigade is?

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,890
‐ Nobody ever told
us when we joined up

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,600
that we’d be picking
up after everyone

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,311
and walking their dogs.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,020
‐ Last time it was babysitting,

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,230
and before that it was
cleaning the pig pen.

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,900
‐ Now we’re looking
for a lost cat.

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,810
We better reassess our goals

19
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,898
or we’ll lose our
focus completely.

20
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,492
‐ [Ranpha] We sure have
been unlucky lately.

21
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,452
‐ What?

22
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,823
You’re still not there yet?

23
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,077
I need to know you current
position right away.

24
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,329
‐ Current position, the Galaxy
Angel Brigade recreation area

25
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,583
in the cafeteria.

26
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,374
‐ Dimwit.

27
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,377
‐ [Captain**] Listen
up everyone, we’ve
got some work to do.

28
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,002
‐ [Both] Yes, sir.

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,707
Angel Brigade reporting.

30
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,758
‐ Forte Stollen.

31
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,342
‐ And Ranpha Franboise.

32
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,756
‐ [Both] Are
deploying immediately.

33
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,515
(siren blaring)

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,730
(ship whooshing)

35
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,400
(upbeat music)

36
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,913
(singing in a foreign language)

37
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:10,016
‐ [Ranpha] Resort‐style
Angel Preparation.

38
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,188
‐ [Forte] What was it again,
this fancy cat’s name?

39
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,688
‐ Baron Fitzgerald III.

40
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,782
He likes sitting in
the lap of beauty.

41
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,704
‐ So this cat likes sitting
in the lap of beauty, huh?

42
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,196
‐ [Woman] Milfeulle, can
you come here, please?

43
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,828
‐ Yes, I’m coming right away.

44
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,254
Now, don’t you go
anywhere, little Rollie.

45
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,586
(cat meows)

46
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,051
‐ Why, why?

47
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,379
What’s taking so long?

48
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,423
What could possibly
be the problem?

49
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,929
Haven’t we heard anything yet?

50
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,390
If we don’t find the Baron
soon I’m in big trouble.

51
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,221
‐ Unfortunately we haven’t
heard anything, sir.

52
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,097
(man uncontrollably weeping)

53
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,024
‐ No, wait, crying
won’t change anything.

54
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,021
I’ve got to think of something.

55
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,392
I’ve got to do something.

56
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,442
I know!

57
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,234
‐ A cat I see and
a cat I’ll find.

58
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,937
Lead us to Baron
Fitzgerald, please.

59
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,068
There!
(cat trills)

60
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,567
Here, little kitty.

61
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,410
Got ya!
(dramatic music)

62
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,334
You’re ours!

63
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,168
(laughs) We’ll that was an
easy job, wasn’t it, Forte?

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,880
(cat purrs)
Huh?

65
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,301
‐ Maybe not, Ranpha.

66
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,591
Take a look around you.

67
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,375
Don’t ask me why, but
you’re surrounded by cats.

68
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,258
‐ And which one is
Baron Fitzgerald?

69
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,005
‐ Ha, easy mission, you say?

70
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,267
Well we can’t let a
single one of these cats

71
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,429
get away from us.

72
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,692
‐ I hope you enjoy
your drinks, guys.

73
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,653
Oh no!

74
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,863
Get down before you
make a big mess.

75
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,190
‐ That’s okay.

76
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,435
Don’t worry about it.

77
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,278
I really like cats
if you wanna know.

78
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,113
‐ Oh, is that right?

79
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,118
This is my cat, Rollie.

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,780
He likes to roll
around in my lap

81
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,157
so I call him Rollie and‐‐

82
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,075
‐ [Customer] So you’re
saying this is your cat?

83
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,332
‐ Yes.

84
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,625
I was sitting on the
bench the other day

85
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,366
and he suddenly jumped
up right into my lap.

86
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,628
(paw whooshes)
(man grunts)

87
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,461
(Milfeulle screams)

88
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,175
(upbeat music)

89
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,550
‐ What can you see?

90
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,932
‐ Cats all over the
place, lots of them.

91
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,259
And another one.

92
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,514
Keep going, don’t stop now.

93
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,808
‐ [Woman] Hey!

94
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:06,929
‐ [Forte] Yes!

95
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,675
(upbeat music)

96
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,809
‐ Huh?

97
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:10,983
There you are.

98
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,522
(cat yowling)
(leaves rustling)

99
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,396
(Forte screams)

100
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,112
(cats meowing)

101
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,609
‐ [Ranpha] One more.

102
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,235
‐ [Forte] Another one!

103
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,782
(upbeat music)

104
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,945
‐ [Ranpha] Hey!

105
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:30,043
(cats mewing)
(Forte huffing)

106
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,833
(both sighing)

107
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,539
(upbeat music)

108
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,460
‐ Oh, Ranpha, we have
to pick up the pace

109
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,167
or we’ll never get ahead.

110
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,088
‐ Yeah, that’s for sure.

111
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,045
Look!

112
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,676
‐ Stop, thief!

113
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,063
‐ Hey, I was going to
win that contest anyway

114
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,470
so what’s the problem?

115
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,137
‐ Well, no matter
who the winner is

116
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,525
we’ve still got an
awful lot of work to do.

117
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,272
(Ranpha cheers)

118
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,728
‐ [Ranpha] Ah, yeah!

119
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,399
(upbeat music)

120
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,746
(engine rumbles)

121
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,959
‐ Well, Ranpha, now
we’re zookeepers.

122
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,217
‐ You’re right.

123
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,669
I’ll bet we’ve got,
like, 40 of them.

124
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,088
Huh?

125
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,178
Oh, and hey, look, Forte,
here’s another one.

126
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,142
‐ Rollie!

127
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,221
‐ Who are you?

128
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,677
‐ This is my cat.

129
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,885
I want my Rollie back.

130
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,177
‐ Rollie?

131
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,728
This one likes to
curl up in my lap.

132
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,726
I wonder if he’s
Baron Fitzgerald.

133
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,774
‐ No, he’s Rollie!

134
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:39,609
‐ You.

135
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,443
I’ll take you.

136
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,527
‐ Ow, you’re hurting me.

137
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,070
Ow, stop.
‐ Don’t pull so hard.

138
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,864
‐ It’s not your cat.
‐ Let go of him.

139
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,066
‐ I said it’s not your cat.

140
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,776
(metal thuds)
(Milfeulle screams)

141
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,659
(laser blasts)
(Ranpha screams)

142
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,913
‐ Get down!

143
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,204
(tires screech)

144
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,617
‐ Ah, damn.

145
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,907
Assassination attempt failed.

146
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:55,998
Let’s go to plan B.

147
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:56,832
‐ [Man] Roger.

148
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,077
‐ Hey, what’s your name?

149
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,628
‐ Milfeulle, and I’m 17.

150
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,765
Oh, and I really like to cook.

151
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,589
‐ I’m not asking that.

152
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,804
I want to know who that
was shooting at you.

153
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,467
‐ Well, I don’t have any idea.

154
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,475
‐ Oh, Ranpha.

155
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,426
‐ Huh?

156
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,683
‐ [Forte] What’s going on?

157
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,435
You haven’t been toying
with some boy, have you?

158
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,386
You’ve got that look.

159
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,846
‐ Well,

160
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,556
maybe I should ask you the
same question, Forte Stollen.

161
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,730
Why so quiet all
of a sudden, huh?

162
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,198
(car bangs)
(girls scream)

163
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,199
(tires screech)

164
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,160
(metal clanging)

165
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,043
(girls grunting)

166
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,499
‐ Are you guys okay?

167
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,793
‐ I think so.

168
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,876
‐ We’re okay.

169
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,289
‐ I wouldn’t be so sure.

170
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,127
Don’t any of you make a move.

171
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,552
‐ Hey, it’s the cat lover.

172
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,721
‐ So, Milfeulle, you’re
the one he’s after.

173
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,380
‐ Told ya, it’s boy trouble.

174
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,298
‐ Be quiet.

175
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,757
We’re in charge here, okay?

176
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,636
‐ [Milfeulle] I
want my Rollie back.

177
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,020
‐ Sorry, to disappoint you

178
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,653
but that cat’s name is
Baron Fitzgerald III.

179
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,311
Now that we have what we want,

180
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,318
we just need to deal
with the three of you.

181
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,111
‐ Well, if you’ve
got what you want

182
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,363
what do you care about us?

183
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,986
‐ Hey, we can’t let
them keep Baron.

184
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,411
‐ Well, we could but,

185
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,989
as far as I can tell
we’re still on assignment.

186
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,367
(Ranpha gasps)
(thug grunts)

187
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,543
‐ Run for it!

188
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:16,996
‐ Get them!

189
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,082
(guns blasting)

190
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,004
‐ Don’t stop!

191
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,674
These guys are really scary!

192
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,293
(gun fires)

193
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,248
(metal clangs)

194
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,797
‐ Are you guys okay?

195
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,130
‐ I think so.

196
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,085
Hey, you, still alive?

197
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,931
‐ Yeah, I’m okay.

198
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,473
Wow, I’m alive.

199
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,806
(men grunting)

200
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,560
‐ Hey, do you always
take chances like that?

201
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,485
‐ I just happen to
have very good luck.

202
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,562
Wait, you’ll see.

203
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,808
‐ What are you talking about?

204
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,267
You and your good
luck have gotten us

205
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,777
within an inch of our lives.

206
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,069
Are you listening to me?

207
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,776
‐ Looks like all of
our luck just ran out.

208
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,374
‐ You could have made it
easier on yourselves, you know?

209
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,661
But have it your way.

210
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,623
We’re taking the cat
and you’re through.

211
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,673
(trigger clicks)
(bazooka booms)

212
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,749
(missile whooshing)

213
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,047
(missile pops)

214
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,217
(metal clanks)
‐ Huh?

215
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,390
‐ You see?

216
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,059
Luck is on our side.

217
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:24,977
‐ Huh?

218
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,817
No way, it’s a dud.

219
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,072
I think this is yours!
(men screaming)

220
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,117
(missile booms)

221
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,780
(rocks cracking)

222
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,079
(water splashes)

223
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,872
(women chuckling anxiously)

224
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:44,632
Hey,

225
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,705
could this be that luck
you were talking about?

226
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,668
‐ Well, maybe.

227
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,298
(speaking in a foreign language)

228
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,296
(cat meowing)

229
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,718
Rollie?

230
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,145
You mean you were
a girl all along?

231
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,975
(Rollie meows)

232
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:02,942
Rollie!

233
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,519
What’s the matter with you?

234
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,404
(dramatic music)
Rollie, don’t go!

235
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,153
Please!

236
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,114
Rollie!

237
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,782
‐ [Man] Are you telling
me then, Baron is dead?

238
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,454
‐ [Ludwig] Yes,
I’ve had everything
completely checked out.

239
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,414
I have gathered you
all here to inform you

240
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,754
that the family cat, Baron
Fitzgerald III is dead.

241
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,961
And according to father’s
last will and testament,

242
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,001
as the heir I am to
receive all company assets.

243
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,208
‐ [Angel Brigade] Excuse us.

244
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,835
‐ Angel Brigade reporting.

245
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,344
‐ Baron Fitzgerald
did not pass on

246
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,085
without leaving
something for you.

247
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,295
‐ Who are you and
why are you here?

248
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,757
‐ Your cat’s name lives on.

249
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,506
Presenting Baron Fitzgerald
IV, and his sisters.

250
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,020
‐ You’re not interfering
here in any way.

251
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,444
‐ We Angels finish what
we start, Mr. Ludwig.

252
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,901
And you can be
sure that it’s you

253
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,731
who won’t be interfering now.

254
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,686
‐ Huh?

255
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,277
‐ Wait, Ludwig, there’s more.

256
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,070
Your father’s will also says
that if Baron Fitzgerald III

257
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,825
were to have offspring,

258
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,616
they would become
the rightful heirs.

259
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,120
‐ (sobs) No, no, that can’t be.

260
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,714
‐ Wow, aren’t you
the lucky kittens?

261
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,212
Huh?

262
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,843
And you assassins, I can see
you’ve been well taken care of.

263
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,340
‐ Hey, I don’t know anything.

264
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,684
‐ [Forte] I’ll leave
the rest to you, okay?

265
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,838
(upbeat piano music)

266
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,353
Sorry to drag you into all this.

267
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,184
‐ [Milfeulle] It’s okay.

268
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,518
It’s all for Rollie.

269
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,019
But are you sure I’m to
have some of the money?

270
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,766
‐ Yeah, don’t worry about it.

271
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:32,688
‐ She’s right about that.

272
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,187
We got some of that money too.

273
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,781
‐ I see.

274
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,823
‐ [Forte] Maybe this has all
been thanks to your luck.

275
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,078
‐ I sure hope so.

276
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,200
I guess I’ll be on my way then.

277
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,419
(money flutters)

278
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,330
Hey!

279
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,166
‐ Huh?
‐ What?

280
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,381
‐ Isn’t that a
little bit dangerous?

281
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,303
‐ [Forte] Uh‐oh.

282
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,130
(Ranpha screams)

283
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,971
‐ [Ranpha] I don’t think
this is a good idea, Forte.

284
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,223
‐ [Forte] Don’t worry
about it, leave it to me.

285
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,046
‐ But‐‐
‐ Quiet!

286
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,258
‐ [Ranpha] But.

287
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,719
‐ [Forte] Bring it
on, come on, come on!

288
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,642
(light midi music)

289
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,437
‐ [Woman] Forte, Ranpha,
where are you right now?

290
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,574
(upbeat music)

291
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,670
(singing in foreign language)
