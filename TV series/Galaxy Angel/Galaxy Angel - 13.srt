1
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,684
‐ Ahem, listen
up, some bad news.

2
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,096
I’ve just received

3
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,564
a communique telling me...
‐ I don’t feel good.

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,015
‐ [Volcott] That if we want
to save Ranpha and Mint,

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,613
we have to come up
with 100000000 GCs

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,069
within the hour.
‐ You can shut up!

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,741
I can do whatever I
want on my day off.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,700
‐ Here, try this!

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,319
It’s some chamomile tea!

10
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,865
It’ll help you relax a little.

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,830
‐ [Volcott] Ahem,
are you listening?

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,789
‐ Yeah, it’s gotta
be some kinda prank.

13
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,292
‐ [Nomad] Those two are carrying
military secrets with them.

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,635
They should be top priority!

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,550
‐ I’m sure they’ll
be getting back soon!

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,840
‐ If only they would.

17
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,134
(alarm sounds)

18
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,258
Yes, this is the Angel Brigade.

19
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,427
‐ Oh, hello there,
Colonel Volcott.

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,136
‐ [Forte] See, she’s just fine.

21
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,234
‐ [Nomad] We don’t have
to worry after all!

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,389
‐ [Volcott] Did you deliver

23
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,349
the secret documents
successfully?

24
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,067
‐ Well, I’m sorry
to have to say this,

25
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,188
but we’ve been kidnapped!

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,400
(Forte groans)

27
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,908
(machinery hums)

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,450
(alarm sounds)

29
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,906
(ship blasts off)

30
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,585
(upbeat music)

31
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,590
(foreign language)

32
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,831
‐ [Narrator] The Great
Kidnapping Spectacle.

33
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,174
‐ The kidnappers are
demanding that you deliver

34
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,922
100000000 GCs
within the next hour

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,506
to the First District
Bank downtown.

36
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,342
‐ No way, is she serious?

37
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,806
‐ Mint, are you all right?

38
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,349
Where’s Ranpha?

39
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,522
‐ Both Ranpha and
I are doing fine.

40
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,523
Here she is right now.

41
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,193
‐ Hello, Milfeulle.

42
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,731
‐ Ranpha, are you okay?

43
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,566
‐ I can’t take it anymore.

44
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,742
But whatever you do,
you must save Mint!

45
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,030
Ow!

46
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,742
No, please, I beg you,
not that, please, no!

47
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,204
Please don’t hurt
Mint, no, stop!

48
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:24,043
Don’t hurt her!
‐ [Milfeulle] Ranpha, Ranpha!

49
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,251
‐ I’m afraid that’s it,
they’ve been cut off.

50
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,923
‐ Good grief, they get kidnapped

51
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,381
right in the middle
of the mission?

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,590
‐ Oh, Ranpha, poor Mint.

53
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,383
We’ll think of something!

54
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,876
‐ [Ranpha] No, please, no!

55
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,547
‐ [Mint] It’s okay now, Ranpha.

56
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,885
‐ It’s over already?

57
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,724
I was just getting into it.

58
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:44,847
So, what do you think?

59
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,313
Wasn’t my performance
just stellar?

60
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,024
‐ Yes, very good.

61
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,444
‐ Wasn’t it, though?

62
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,944
‐ But if you overdo it,
they’re going to know.

63
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,026
‐ Oh, come on, don’t worry.

64
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,740
They’ll never figure this out!

65
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,285
It really bugs me,
though, that Volcott

66
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,657
thinks I’d give
in under pressure!

67
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,453
Darn that bastard!

68
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,925
(Mint makes plane noises)

69
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,249
‐ "Hey, if you’re
gonna fly that thing,

70
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,088
"you better watch out
where you’re going!

71
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:19,972
"That’s a vintage machine,
and it cost me 100000000 GCs!"

72
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,013
"No way!

73
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,757
(makes towing noises)

74
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,967
"Oh!"

75
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,598
"Now, you’re gonna
have to pay for it.

76
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,483
"You better be back
here with 100000000 GCs

77
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,773
"by three o’clock, or else,

78
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,806
"I’ll turn your ship
into scrap, too!"

79
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,769
"No way!"

80
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,193
Oh, no, Ranpha, we forgot
the documents in the ship!

81
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,648
(gasps)

82
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,110
‐ Hey, Mint, you’re

83
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,118
a pretty good actress
yourself, you know.

84
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,871
‐ Well, nothing to write
home about, really.

85
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,542
‐ That really pisses me off!

86
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,705
I’ll bet he faked
that whole accident!

87
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,091
That much for that
wreck, my ass!

88
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,129
‐ But we don’t
really have a choice.

89
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,463
Besides, or have you forgotten?

90
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,800
You’re the one that didn’t
want to take some pay advances

91
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,296
or a bank loan to pay him back.

92
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,587
Now, this is our only hope.

93
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,468
‐ Of course, I didn’t!

94
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,805
Do you think I want to
be 100000000 in debt?

95
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,313
Never!

96
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,194
‐ Let’s do our best to get
that ransom money, then.

97
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,351
I think it’s the only solution.

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,650
‐ I agree!

99
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,651
Besides, we’ve
already come this far.

100
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,823
Let’s go!

101
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,443
All right!

102
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,198
(evil laughter)

103
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,367
‐ This Angel Brigade
is so easy to fool.

104
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,043
I couldn’t be having more fun
setting up these accidents!

105
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,833
(evil laughter)

106
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,629
‐ I’m so sorry!

107
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,804
Forgive me, the only
reason I’m doing this

108
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,803
is for Ranpha and Mint!

109
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,348
‐ Okay, stop it now.

110
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,386
‐ But what’s gonna happen
to Ranpha and Mint, then?

111
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,523
‐ Look, Milfeulle, I
know how you’re feeling.

112
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,897
But that’s not gonna
be near enough.

113
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,112
And I don’t think
that’s gonna work

114
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,364
in this day and age, Colonel.

115
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,528
‐ Oh, what, have
these expired already?

116
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,198
‐ Good grief!

117
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,005
So then, what have
you found out?

118
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,209
‐ [Nomad] Let’s see.

119
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,790
In the event of
your death, Forte,

120
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,174
your beneficiary gets...
‐ Hey!

121
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,671
My insurance is none
of your business!

122
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,553
‐ [Nomad] Did you know
you owe over 100000 GCs

123
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,761
in insurance premiums?

124
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,554
And the contract says
that you can claim

125
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,047
if you’re hospitalized,
but the beneficiary

126
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,638
cannot claim anything
upon your death.

127
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,064
How selfish of you to think

128
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,272
that it wouldn’t matter
when you’re gone.

129
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,024
What about the funeral expenses?

130
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,234
‐ Just shut up!

131
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,114
I think maybe I
should sell you off

132
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,112
and put that money aside
to pay for my funeral!

133
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,605
Oh.

134
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,317
‐ [Nomad] Oh, Vanilla, if
you were ever kidnapped,

135
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,195
I’d be happy to be sold off,

136
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,282
if it meant you would be saved.

137
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,039
‐ Bleh, whatever.

138
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:56,119
‐ Hey, Forte, what exactly
are we going to do now?

139
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,214
‐ I guess it’s time to
be upfront about this

140
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,594
with the top brass and get
their full cooperation.

141
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,342
‐ [Forte] You can’t
be serious, Colonel.

142
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,804
You know that Ranpha
and Mint still have some

143
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,217
very secret military
documents with them.

144
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,264
‐ Yes, that may be so, but...

145
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,558
‐ If the brass ever found out

146
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,231
they were kidnapped
during a mission,

147
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,309
they Angel Brigade’s
reputation would be shit,

148
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,806
and that’ll affect
my pay, right?

149
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,398
‐ [Nomad] Forte only
thinks of herself.

150
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,276
‐ We’ve got to act, and act now.

151
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,111
I’ve got a wonderful idea

152
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,856
that will not only
save Ranpha and Mint,

153
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,947
but also make almost
everyone here very happy.

154
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,375
‐ [Nomad] And what’s that?

155
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,951
‐ Yes, tell us!

156
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:33,908
‐ Yes, what’s...

157
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,285
(yelps)

158
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,583
No, no, Forte.

159
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,828
‐ [General] Is this true?

160
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,550
Colonel Volcott was kidnapped
during his vacation?

161
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,304
‐ Yes, the kidnappers want
100100000 GCs in 40 minutes.

162
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,585
‐ [General] What’s
the extra 100000 for?

163
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,678
‐ Well, who knows, but they
want the transaction made

164
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,478
at the Second District
Bank Unit Two downtown.

165
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,152
‐ What an embarrassment.

166
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,229
The Colonel gets kidnapped,
and on his vacation.

167
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,361
‐ You know, General, if we can
deal with this internally...

168
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,068
‐ Now, wait.

169
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,816
If I’m recalling correctly,

170
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,330
you come from a rich
downtown family, don’t you?

171
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,331
‐ Yes, I do.

172
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,503
Your point?

173
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,371
‐ Haha, I have a secret plan.

174
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,499
‐ Please tell us.

175
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,625
‐ What’s that?

176
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,460
‐ What’s...

177
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,254
(yelps)

178
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,257
‐ We’ll do the
transaction at Unit Three

179
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,589
at the Third District Bank
downtown within the hour!

180
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,388
‐ Yeah, what do you want?

181
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,676
100100000 GCs?

182
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,025
‐ Okay, are you all ready?

183
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,778
Come on, Vanilla, get
yourself together.

184
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,069
‐ As today is the Sabbath,

185
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,693
I cannot be directly involved

186
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,160
in any transactions
related to money.

187
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,819
‐ [Nomad] I know what
you’re up to, Forte.

188
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,907
You’re adding an extra
100000 GCs to the ransom

189
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,495
to pay off your life insurance!

190
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,408
‐ Ha, what are
you talking about?

191
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,408
Milfeulle, get
yourself prepared.

192
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,380
You are taking Vanilla’s place.

193
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,289
‐ Okay!

194
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,706
I’ve got a great look in mind

195
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,554
for what I think the
kidnappers should look like,

196
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,341
but a bit more unique.

197
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,973
‐ Whatever, just hurry
it up and keep it simple.

198
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,973
‐ Hand over the cache!

199
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,775
‐ Ranpha, you truly are totally
convincing as a kidnapper!

200
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,892
‐ I guess my time
as a child performer

201
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,057
in the Tulip Theater Group
is finally paying off!

202
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,362
‐ It’s just about that time.

203
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,239
‐ It’s almost time.

204
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,453
‐ Here we go!

205
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,121
‐ I think it’s about time.

206
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,163
You know, you’ve got
a wonderful father.

207
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,210
‐ Where the hell
are those people?

208
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,592
Time is running out!

209
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,918
Hurry up!

210
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,175
‐ Where are they?

211
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,884
‐ Where are they?

212
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,974
‐ Still no sign?

213
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,091
‐ They’re late!

214
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,757
‐ Damn, what are they doing?

215
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,899
(phone rings)

216
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,770
What do you want now, Mom?

217
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,779
Don’t you know
I’m working today?

218
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,401
What, did you just say
you’ve been kidnapped?

219
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:17,487
100100000 GCs, in one minute?

220
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,164
‐ Ugh, I can’t
believe that everyone

221
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,579
has just abandoned us like this!

222
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,997
‐ Huh, yes?

223
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,537
What’s that?

224
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,128
What, excuse me?

225
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,175
What?

226
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,297
‐ What the hell?

227
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,723
More ransom money?

228
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,011
What do they think they’re
doing pulling a stunt like this?

229
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,427
Agh!

230
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,063
‐ What’s going on, now?

231
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,430
‐ They’ve pushed
the ransom again!

232
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,347
‐ How much more?

233
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,730
‐ Well, about...

234
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,984
‐ 300200000?

235
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,693
‐ 400200000?

236
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,651
‐ 500200000 GCs?

237
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,947
‐ I said 500300000 GCs!

238
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,833
‐ You won’t believe the
price of this cleaner.

239
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,041
This amazing product
can take off any stain.

240
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,174
Yours for an unbeatable price!

241
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,831
‐ I want 600300000!

242
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,250
‐ Right now, I’m offering
two for the price of one!

243
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,507
There’s nothing the SuperClean
formula can’t remove!

244
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,721
Act now!

245
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,511
‐ 700300000?

246
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,345
‐ You really drive
a tough bargain.

247
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,850
All right, then, let’s see.

248
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,272
I’ll throw in another
bottle for the same price.

249
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,769
Special for you!

250
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,771
‐ [Man] 800300000!

251
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,699
‐ I thank you for keeping
me from any involvement

252
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,033
in the dirty and
sinful business today,

253
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,907
and I ask that
many on this planet

254
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,786
be set free from their
insatiable lust for money.

255
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,213
‐ [Forte] I want 1.2
billion and 600000 GCs!

256
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,708
Nooooo!

257
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,552
‐ [Vanilla] Oh, Lord,
please guide them.

258
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,220
(calm music)

259
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,192
(happy music)

260
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,834
(foreign language)
