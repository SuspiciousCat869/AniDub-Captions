1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,814
(sirens blaring)

2
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,226
(upbeat music)

3
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,439
‐ [Girl] Roast Beef
of Lost Technology.

4
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,153
‐ What’s your feeling
on this Forte?

5
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,530
Do you think it’s
possible that we’re

6
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,245
gonna find the lost
technology this time?

7
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,366
‐ Oh I don’t know
and I’m not sure we

8
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,453
can rely too much on
what Colonel Volcott

9
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,118
has to say about it.

10
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,366
‐ Excuse me, Ranpha?

11
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,578
‐ Yeah what is it?

12
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,167
‐ I need your help.

13
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,424
I can’t seem to find
the key to the gym room.

14
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,264
‐ [Ranpha] You don’t need it.

15
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,799
I left it open.

16
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,722
‐ Really?

17
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,929
That’s great!

18
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:14,839
‐ [Ranpha] You’re
free to use the room,

19
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,548
but don’t make a mess okay?

20
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,467
‐ I’ll do my best.

21
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,138
‐ What was that all about?

22
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,148
‐ She wants to exercise to
get herself into better shape.

23
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,359
I mean, she’s been
going on about

24
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,691
how her uniform was starting to

25
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,725
feel and look tighter
around her waist.

26
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,652
And that’s no
surprise considering

27
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,409
how many sweets she eats.

28
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,029
‐ Well you’re one to talk.

29
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,117
You know, you’ve been looking a

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,290
little pudgy yourself lately.

31
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,449
(girl yells)

32
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,116
‐ What are you talking about?

33
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,335
Pudgy?

34
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,706
I’m 161 centimeters
tall and 43 kilos.

35
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,963
That’s just right
for me, just perfect.

36
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,214
‐ Oh Lord, please save
these wretched souls.

37
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,089
‐ What did you say Vanilla?

38
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,514
‐ Ranpha look, you’ve
got a meat bun.

39
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,724
‐ What are you talking about?

40
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,974
This isn’t a meat bun,

41
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,184
it’s an imitation
bun, not a real one.

42
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,851
‐ Brigade, I think I’m
beginning to see it.

43
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,190
‐ [Robot] I see.

44
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,824
We didn’t discover it ’til now

45
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,189
because it was hidden above
these smaller planets.

46
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,026
‐ [Ranpha] It’s
really a ghost ship.

47
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,663
‐ That’s strange.

48
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,914
There are no hatches anywhere.

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,960
‐ [Robot] That light, and
there’s no mistaking it.

50
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,093
This spaceship was
definitely created

51
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,382
using the lost technology.

52
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,929
‐ [Ranpha] Looks
like the entrance.

53
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:40,893
Should we go in?

54
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,889
(robot yelling)

55
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,097
‐ Well it looks
safe enough to me.

56
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,058
Let’s go.

57
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,147
‐ [Robot] My memory’s
been shaken up and fried.

58
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,105
‐ Oh no!

59
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,316
The entrance!

60
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,534
‐ It’s closed.

61
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,453
‐ Duh!

62
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,413
As if I didn’t know that!

63
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,240
‐ Oh relax.

64
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,156
Don’t worry.

65
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,702
We’ve got lots of air.

66
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,575
Let’s just figure this out,
and if worst comes to worst,

67
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,253
we can use this
ultra miniature bomb

68
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,211
to blow the spaceship
to smithereens.

69
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,753
‐ But if you use that bomb,

70
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,746
we’ll be blown to bits too.

71
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,258
‐ [Forte] Boy, you’re no fun.

72
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,342
(ghost laughing)

73
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,587
(girls screaming)

74
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,548
‐ What was that, what
was that, what was that?

75
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,348
‐ Wait, I think we forgot Forte!

76
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,393
‐ [Girl] Forte,
we’ll make sure that

77
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,937
your death was not in vain.

78
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,232
‐ Were those proper respects?

79
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,865
‐ No, not even close!

80
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,281
(girls yelling)

81
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,152
‐ Get out evil spirit,
get out evil spirit,

82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,199
get out evil spirit!

83
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,081
I’ll give you all
the money you want!

84
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,869
‐ Hey, do you think
he’ll take a credit card?

85
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,702
‐ [Ranpha] No!

86
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,617
(girl screaming)

87
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,294
‐ Don’t worry Ranpha.

88
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,882
I’ll be just as happy when
you’re gone and forgotten.

89
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,789
‐ [Ranpha] Out of the way!

90
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,049
Get out of the way!

91
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,379
(girls yelling)

92
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,265
‐ There are more of them!

93
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,183
Maybe we’ll just
blow them all up.

94
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,973
‐ I thought I told you already,

95
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,966
if you use that, we’ll
all be obliterated.

96
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,678
‐ How do you suppose
we deal with this

97
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,639
ridiculously insane situation?

98
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,058
‐ You think I could answer an

99
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,316
impossible question like
that any better than you?

100
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,320
(girl gasps)

101
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,691
I dropped them!

102
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,780
‐ I will haunt you
forever Ranpha.

103
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,777
‐ I’m sorry Vanilla, Mint.

104
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,366
I promise I’ll overcome my
dislike for stinky soybeans

105
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,165
and live life to the
fullest to make up

106
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,828
for how I’ve let you down.

107
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,707
‐ And you don’t like
pickled plum either, do you?

108
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,246
‐ [Girls] Hey, let’s just
blow ourselves to bits.

109
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,009
(girls yelling)

110
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,434
‐ It looks like we made it
and all still in one piece.

111
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,725
‐ Are we in heaven?

112
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,680
‐ If we are, I’ll
have one of those

113
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,310
heaven style spicy
bouillabaisses.

114
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,516
‐ [Robot] Hey,
there’s no such thing.

115
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,778
‐ Oh boy.

116
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,953
Looks like heaven to me.

117
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,200
‐ Then I want potato chips.

118
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,034
‐ Stew here.

119
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,198
‐ Stir fry.

120
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,872
‐ Boy, I sure can’t
get enough of this

121
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,789
tasty stewed daikon radish.

122
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,036
‐ Yum.

123
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,457
This spicy flavor sure
gets my appetite going.

124
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,257
‐ [Robot] How is it Vanilla?

125
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,632
‐ So how do you
think we’re going

126
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,927
to escape from this
spaceship you guys?

127
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,052
‐ [Girls] You mean
we’re not in heaven?

128
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,928
‐ [Mint] You really
thought we were?

129
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,733
(girls screaming)

130
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,228
‐ I’ve got some
good news Milfeulle.

131
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,397
‐ Wait!

132
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,566
You’re going to
tell me how well I’m

133
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,074
doing with my fitness
program, right?

134
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,235
‐ [Man] No.

135
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,453
I’ve come to inform
you that your

136
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,663
probationary period
is finally over.

137
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,032
‐ Really?

138
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,538
‐ Yes.

139
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,330
I’ve just now received the
word from headquarters.

140
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,923
There will be an official
announcement shortly.

141
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,209
‐ Alright!

142
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,252
This means that today
I’m part of the team

143
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,087
that will fight for justice!

144
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,013
‐ There’s more to it than that.

145
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,510
‐ There is?

146
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,012
‐ Please help me!

147
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,143
‐ I can’t take this!

148
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,641
I can’t take this!

149
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,473
‐ And because of this, we
request an emergency rescue.

150
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,387
‐ Listen Volcott,
they’re calling for help.

151
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,147
If I’m on the team now,
then I should deploy.

152
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,481
‐ Alright then.

153
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,766
Let’s just say that
you are now deployed.

154
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,938
‐ Alright!

155
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,108
‐ And Milfeulle.

156
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,065
‐ Yes?

157
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,613
‐ This means that you are now an

158
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,278
official member of the
Galaxy Angel Brigade.

159
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,196
Do your very best.

160
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,124
‐ Yes.

161
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,873
I promise to give it my all.

162
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,964
(upbeat music)

163
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,291
(sirens blaring)

164
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,286
‐ Lost technology’s mysterious.

165
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,298
I can’t be sure
what will happen.

166
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,721
You must be very, very careful.

167
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,629
‐ Roger that.

168
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,392
Now lucky star, begin
deployment immediately

169
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,810
for the Angel Brigade
rescue mission.

170
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,481
(upbeat music)

171
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:57,982
‐ [Milfeulle Voiceover]
I don’t know how this is

172
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,153
going to turn out,

173
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,400
but hang in there Angels
’til I get to you.

174
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,744
‐ Hey.

175
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,952
There’s a meat bun
flying around up here.

176
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,162
‐ Oh come on now Forte.

177
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,833
Can’t you see,
that’s no meat bun.

178
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,660
That’s a fake meat
bun that just happens

179
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,955
to look like a real
meat bun, you see.

180
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,329
‐ Oh it is?

181
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,667
Well now I’m thinking,

182
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,590
maybe it’s really
a bean bun that’s

183
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,709
pretending to be a meat bun.

184
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,628
‐ [Robot] They sure
seem to be having fun.

185
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,466
(girls giggling)

186
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,514
‐ What do you think
this could be?

187
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,519
‐ [Robot] It looks like
some numbers to me.

188
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,679
‐ You don’t really know, do you?

189
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,440
‐ [Robot] How dare you
suggest that I don’t know?

190
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,321
I swear by my 10,000
gigahertz CPU that this.

191
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,534
‐ What is that?

192
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,362
It looks like an
image on the outside.

193
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,857
That’s one of ours.

194
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,738
It’s Milfeulle.

195
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,406
She’s come to rescue us.

196
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,369
‐ I don’t like this!

197
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,624
Somebody help!

198
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,585
‐ Calm yourself down Milfeulle.

199
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,787
(girl yelling)

200
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,795
According to data we’ve
received from Forte,

201
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,247
it seems that the
spaceship has the

202
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,258
power to read
people’s intentions.

203
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,880
It’s my guess that
the spaceship has

204
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,797
intercepted your
thoughts and is now

205
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,514
acting to interfere
with the rescue mission.

206
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,055
‐ Well okay then.

207
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,760
I know!

208
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,312
‐ [Robot] Now what are those?

209
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,067
‐ Those meat buns
are scary looking.

210
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,362
‐ What are you talking about?

211
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,903
Those aren’t spicy
meat buns at all!

212
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,582
‐ I’m sorry for taking so long.

213
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,504
Look!

214
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,752
I brought you some apple pie.

215
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,135
‐ Now look you, what
are you doing here?

216
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,752
‐ What are you saying Ranpha?

217
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,759
I thought you liked apple pie.

218
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,129
‐ Why are you always
pulling this cute act

219
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,258
and trying to make yourself out
to be some kind of big star?

220
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,756
‐ [Milfeulle] What do you mean?

221
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,266
‐ [Robot] You think we should
just let them have it out?

222
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,810
‐ [Mint] I think we
should be thinking about

223
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,064
how we’re going to
get out of this place.

224
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,735
It looks like another column of

225
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,865
numbers is showing
on this monitor.

226
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,109
And they’re getting bigger too.

227
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,315
‐ [Ranpha] How’s this?

228
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,868
And that?

229
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,290
‐ Now Ranpha, you know if
you keep eating like that,

230
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,330
you’re going to turn into a pig.

231
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,584
‐ [Robot] Or a cow maybe.

232
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,914
(girl yells)

233
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,628
‐ Ranpha’s turning into a pig!

234
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,500
‐ Now they’ve stopped.

235
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,797
‐ [Ranpha] I’m gonna get you!

236
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,169
And you.

237
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,177
‐ Now they’re going back up.
‐ And get you again!

238
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,641
‐ [Robot] My 10,000
gigahertz CPU!

239
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,470
‐ Now they’ve stopped.

240
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,429
And now they’re going up again.

241
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,312
Could this possibly mean?

242
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,824
(clock ticking)

243
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,490
I’ve got it!

244
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,029
‐ Hey, wait a minute.

245
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,914
This number is my
exact desired weight.

246
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,240
I’ve got an idea.

247
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,584
Do you think this
spaceship could

248
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,079
actually be some kind of giant

249
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,501
diet, fitness, and
training machine?

250
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,331
‐ My moment of brilliant
realization ruined.

251
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,327
‐ What?

252
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,577
Then are you saying that those

253
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,628
ghost monsters were
only chasing us around

254
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,712
to make us run and exercise
so much that we’d lose wight?

255
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,920
Now I get it!

256
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,508
(girl laughs)

257
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,434
Wait a minute!

258
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,641
Are you trying to tell us that

259
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,101
this means we can’t
get out of here

260
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,971
until we reach our ideal
physical fitness condition?

261
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,017
‐ I think that’s
what this means.

262
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,231
‐ If that’s what you mean,

263
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,732
then considering
I just gorged out

264
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,524
on several giant meat buns,
I’m in big trouble, hear?

265
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,610
‐ Alright then, let’s
blow ourselves to bits!

266
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,445
‐ No!

267
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,359
Forte stop!

268
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,448
Don’t you dare use that bomb!

269
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,242
(girls yelling)

270
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,488
‐ I guess that
we’ll have to just

271
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,868
keep running until
we see an exit.

272
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,826
It’s our only choice.

273
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,175
‐ I can’t believe
that I’m losing weight

274
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,209
just trying to stay alive.

275
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,713
‐ Alright then, let’s just
all blow ourselves to bits.

276
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,415
‐ [Ranpha] But
that’s even worse.

277
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,219
‐ [Mint] This isn’t good.

278
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,550
We received a box
from a courier.

279
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,805
‐ [Ranpha] I don’t
know, what is it?

280
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,886
‐ [Mint] We opened
the box and there’s

281
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,432
a mysterious object inside.

282
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,715
‐ [Ranpha] What is it?

283
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,216
‐ [Mint] The mysterious
object suddenly grows.

284
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,728
It grows until it takes
the form of a human.

285
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,062
‐ [Ranpha] Wait a minute.

286
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,095
‐ [Mint] And it’s
completely naked.

287
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,860
(girl screams)

288
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,531
(upbeat music)
