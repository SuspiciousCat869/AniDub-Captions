1
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:18,182
(dark piano music)
(gun cocks)

2
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,695
‐ [Woman] Alright
dinner’s ready.

3
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,865
‐ [Children] Okay.

4
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,494
‐ [Woman] Honey,
what is the matter?

5
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,359
‐ Uh, oh it’s nothing, (laughs).

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,868
Okay let’s eat.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,950
‐ [All] Bless this food.

8
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,661
(electronic buzz)

9
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,865
(family gasps in unison)

10
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:42,416
(three alarm rings)
‐ It’s another order.

11
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,962
(engine charging)

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,007
(sign alarm beeps)

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,880
(electronic zoom)

14
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,798
(lively electronic pop music)

15
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,017
(singing in foreign language)

16
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,681
‐ [Narrator] Pitch
black laughing pepper.

17
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,187
‐ I thought that show
was quite funny actually.

18
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,021
‐ Me too.

19
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,975
I was laughing so hard.

20
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,565
‐ There’s nothing like
a good comedy film.

21
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,280
I can stand sappy, pathetic
romances, makes my ass itchy.

22
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,032
‐ I don’t know how
many times I laughed.

23
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,945
‐ Forte laughed 34 times.

24
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,452
Ronfa, 25.

25
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,413
‐ Why were you counting
how many times we laughed?

26
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,156
‐ Because I was really bored.

27
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,369
‐ Oh

28
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,879
‐ You know, I don’t
think I’ve ever

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,960
seen you laugh before, Vanilla.

30
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,304
‐ The devil lives in the
mouth of a forced laugh.

31
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,761
Very wise words.

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,220
‐ Vanilla, we are not saying

33
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,182
you should force
yourself to laugh.

34
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,013
‐ Hey, are you Vanilla Ash?

35
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,468
‐ No. Hold on!
(Gun cocks)

36
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,517
‐ Assassins?

37
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,190
‐ Hi, so how are you doing?

38
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,310
‐ That’s a phone!

39
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,647
‐ [Two Girls] Oh!
(crash)

40
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,521
‐ Well, we got their attention.

41
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,318
‐ Let’s do it.

42
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,362
(silly synthesizer music)

43
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,605
‐ Just the other day,

44
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,027
I was shopping at the
local department store

45
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,986
and happened to lose
something very important.

46
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,785
‐ [Woman] Oh really?
What was that?

47
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,038
‐ [Man] I lost a child.

48
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,831
He’s wearing a white
shirt and blue pants

49
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,043
and...
‐ [Woman] Careful,

50
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,173
or you’ll start losing
your friends too.

51
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,039
‐ Could this be...

52
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,496
‐ A comedy act?

53
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,875
‐ Yes, The Hurricane
of Laughter,

54
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,053
The husband and wife comedy duo,

55
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,262
Patrick and Patricia Wohatta.

56
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,554
and everyone who
sees their routine

57
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,888
ends up getting sucked
into a giant tidal wave.

58
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,723
(Forte laughs)

59
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,138
(waves crashing)

60
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,144
‐ [Man] Really?

61
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:50,225
(laughing)
(waves crashing)

62
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,609
(surprised gasp)

63
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,859
‐ I can’t believe there’s anyone

64
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,028
who doesn’t find
our routine funny.

65
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,617
‐ Time for the works.

66
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,914
‐ [Couple] Ha!

67
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,121
(cascading water)

68
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,418
‐ Did they?

69
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,629
‐ No, not yet.

70
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,086
(crash)

71
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,301
‐ No, we failed.

72
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,972
(thundering crash of boulders)

73
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,800
‐ Ah!
‐ Are our gags

74
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,264
really that bad?

75
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,255
‐ [Couple] Oh.

76
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,059
‐ It seems you just
don’t have what it takes.

77
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,062
‐ Oh, ah, Mr. God.

78
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,064
Please gives us
both another chance.

79
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,517
‐ No.

80
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,937
I know you will not be able
to make this girl laugh.

81
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,107
‐ Hey, what’s going
on around here?

82
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,526
And why are you trying
to make Vanilla laugh?

83
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,954
‐ Yeah, just who
are you guys anyway?

84
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,374
‐ Hello, my name is Mr. God.

85
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,458
I am known in the business
as the king of laughter.

86
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,583
‐ You’re the king of laughter?

87
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,298
‐ [Mr. God] Yes, but I am
no longer able to stand

88
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,459
upon a stage.

89
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,627
‐ [Girls] Why not?

90
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,757
‐ Something happened
to me three months ago.

91
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,643
That was the last
time I was on a stage.

92
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,854
‐ Welcome ladies and gentleman.

93
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,814
The act you’ve been
waiting to see.

94
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,735
The king of laughter, Mr. God!

95
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,653
(audience applause and cheers)

96
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,234
‐ [Mr. God] As usual the
audience was watching my antics

97
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,778
and having a wonderful time.

98
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,492
However, there was one
who wasn’t laughing.

99
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,702
No!

100
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,947
It couldn’t be.

101
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,036
Was there something
wrong with my routine?

102
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,003
Why?

103
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,121
Why won’t she laugh?

104
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,538
Ah, (cracking sound) my foot!

105
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,498
Ah!

106
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,377
(crashes with thud)
‐ (gasps) Father!

107
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,336
Father!

108
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,684
‐ I get it.

109
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,934
Vanilla was the one

110
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,853
who wouldn’t laugh at
your comedy that night.

111
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,642
‐ Yeah, I remember cause
I was at that show.

112
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:56,186
‐ That very day I retired
and made a resolution

113
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,363
that anyone who makes
Vanilla laugh or smile

114
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,904
should take my place.

115
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,817
‐ Father, I’m the one who
should take over for you.

116
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,985
What’s wrong with me.

117
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,203
(loud whip)
Ah!

118
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,704
‐ You don’t have
what it takes yet.

119
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,786
It’ll be years before
you can honor my name.

120
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,200
‐ Wow!

121
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,039
I didn’t know that
you’re fame was so‐‐

122
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,874
‐ Hey, are you kidding?

123
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,088
Mr. God is the
biggest act in comedy.

124
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,540
Whoever carries on his name,

125
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,878
will be considered the
greatest comic in space.

126
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,796
Mr. God is the absolute
master of the comic arts.

127
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,054
‐ True, Mr. God can make
you chuckle, giggle and howl

128
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,008
in ways thought not possible.

129
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,847
The world has never
seen anyone like him.

130
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,943
That’s why they call him

131
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,812
‐ [Couple] The king of laughter.

132
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,358
‐ That’s enough.

133
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,571
You guys really need to do
some work on your routine.

134
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,204
Maybe you need a booking
at the Tiger’s Den.

135
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,160
‐ [Couple] Ah, never!

136
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,780
‐ Please not that!

137
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,239
‐ The Tiger’s Den,
so what’s that?

138
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,699
‐ [Mr. God] The Tiger’s
Den is a tiger’s den.

139
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,118
‐ [Blonde Girl] But why?

140
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,788
‐ [Mr. God] It’s a comedy
club where comedians

141
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,627
risk their lives to
improve their skills.

142
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,424
(dramatic orchestral music)

143
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,336
‐ What, you don’t get it?

144
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,177
(low buzzer)

145
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,101
Ah!

146
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,433
‐ Thank you, thank
you very much.

147
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,274
(low buzzer)
Ah!

148
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,680
(water splashes)

149
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,267
‐ Hey, hey, how bout this one?
(low buzzer)

150
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,233
Ah!

151
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,491
‐ [Couple] No please don’t,
you can’t, you can’t, please!

152
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,951
‐ Comedy can be deadly.

153
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,909
Bad jokes can be as dangerous
as a laughter assassin.

154
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,620
But failing is not all bad.

155
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,372
People are real only when
they can laugh honestly.

156
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,213
You can become honest,
only after you fail.

157
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,829
(cat meows)

158
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,288
‐ [Girl] Wow, that
really is interesting.

159
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,627
‐ Yes it is.

160
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,801
I heard about all this Forte.

161
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,630
‐ And did she happen to tell you

162
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,085
what a laughter assassin
is supposed to be?

163
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,846
‐ Why, you’re Vanilla
Ash, aren’t you?

164
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:51,971
‐ [Girls] Hmm?

165
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,257
‐ A challenge!

166
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,808
‐ Multi‐ventriloquist,
Mr. Megaton T. Gasto.

167
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,148
Everyone who sees his
performance is overcome

168
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,941
with the sensation of
being carpet bombed.

169
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,284
(loud explosion)

170
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:09,359
(girls laughing)
(loud explosions)

171
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,408
‐ Don, we blew it.

172
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,918
That was a dud.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,340
This can’t be.
(crying)

174
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,261
‐ Now, it’s my turn dude.

175
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,170
(ukulele music)

176
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,589
The Mount Vesuvius of comedy,

177
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,967
dawn of the Me‐har‐a.

178
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,684
‐ [Mr. God] A man who
can cause volcanic

179
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,926
eruptions of laughter

180
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,017
(booming explosion)

181
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:52,873
‐ [Man] No, I didn’t dig
my jokes for that dormant.

182
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,539
‐ [Mr. God] Even these comics
couldn’t make her laugh.

183
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,540
‐ Father, please let me try.

184
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,752
I can do it.

185
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:01,584
Ow!

186
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,578
‐ Don’t be a fool!

187
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,089
You’re not funny.

188
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,130
Now that it’s come to this.

189
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,672
I’ll have to take up my
mantel one last time,

190
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,837
and give it another shot myself.

191
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,216
[Woman] What da ya have there?

192
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,224
‐ Mr. God’s revenge performance.

193
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,596
‐ That’s right.

194
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:21,194
It was delivered to
Vanilla a little while ago.

195
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,726
(bass drum roll)

196
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,154
‐ [Son] Ladies and gentleman,
thank you for coming.

197
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:32,113
And now the return to the
stage of the great Mr. God.

198
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,238
(audience applause)

199
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,576
‐ I just flew in
from Tokyo and boy,

200
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,752
are my arms tired.

201
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:46,173
(playful circus music)
(audience giggling)

202
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,002
My arms tired.

203
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:47,837
Are my arms tired?

204
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:48,671
Are my arms tired.

205
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,555
Are my arms tired.

206
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,632
(audience laughing)

207
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,053
Why?

208
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,047
Why won’t she laugh?

209
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:57,888
Why?

210
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,102
She’s the only one.

211
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,315
Why?

212
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,694
Why?

213
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,599
Why?

214
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,229
Oh, (cracking sound) my foot!

215
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,154
No!

216
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,442
‐ Father!

217
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,948
(bell dings)

218
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,565
I’ll do it.

219
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,987
I’m going to make her laugh.

220
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,252
(bass drum roll)

221
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,786
What do you call a
fly with no wings?

222
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,706
It’s a wok.

223
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,876
A wok, get it?

224
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,964
No wings.

225
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,378
So it’s a wok.

226
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,626
It can’t why fly

227
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,007
so it has to walk.
‐ This is pathetic.

228
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,346
‐ Come quickly,
please it’s Mr. God.

229
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,482
(heavy, labored breathing)

230
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,231
‐ [Mr. God] I think
I’m almost done.

231
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,772
I want you to hear
my last words.

232
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:54,818
(somber keyboard music)
‐ [Woman] Ah, Vanilla?

233
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,913
(Mr. God mumbles)

234
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,411
‐ (gasps) She smiled.

235
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,372
‐ Ah, she did?

236
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,664
‐ I don’t believe it.

237
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,827
‐ [Group] Ah!

238
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,881
‐ [Mr. God] Alright,
all together now.

239
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,092
‐ Are our arms tired.

240
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,921
(audience laughing)

241
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,166
Are our arms tired.

242
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,179
‐ Well, I guess we got a
happy ending after all.

243
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,341
It seems that Mr. God’s
got his health back

244
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,849
because Vanilla finally smiled.

245
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,260
‐ That was real special.

246
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,018
Seeing Vanilla’s first grin.

247
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,852
‐ I really wanna
know what it was

248
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,847
that Mr. God said
to her, don’t you?

249
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,810
‐ Yes.

250
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:35,438
Oh, Vanilla, please tell
us all what made you smile.

251
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,278
‐ Sure.

252
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,112
‐ [Girls] Yeah?

253
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,157
‐ Are our arms tired.

254
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,530
‐ Can’t be serious.

255
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,238
‐ You must be kidding us.

256
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,908
‐ Really?

257
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,197
‐ [Vanilla] It’s true.

258
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,538
‐ [Girls] Oh no!

259
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,334
‐ Yes, our arms were tired.

260
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,456
The flies arms were tired too.

261
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,753
I mean it didn’t have
wings either, now.

262
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,050
(playful circus music)
(cat meows)

263
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,894
‐ [Narrator] What do you
say before you have a meal?

264
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,851
‐ [Girls] Thank you for the
meal we’re about to eat.

265
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,930
‐ [Narrator] What do you say
to someone when you part ways?

266
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,217
‐ [Girls] Have a nice day.

267
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,520
‐ [Narrator] When you apologize?

268
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,441
‐ [Girls] I’m sorry.

269
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
‐ [Narrator] And again.

270
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,896
‐ [Girls] I’m really sorry.

271
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,027
(playful happy music)

272
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:32,004
(singing in foreign language)
