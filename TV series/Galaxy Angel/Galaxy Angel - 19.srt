1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:13,967
(whirring and whooshing)

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,016
(alarm blaring)

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,311
(beeping)

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,522
(whooshing)

5
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,613
(dynamic pop music)

6
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,075
(singing in Japanese)

7
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,810
‐ Uh!

8
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,282
Hot!

9
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,698
But so very, very
delicious. (laughing)

10
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,622
‐ Oh.

11
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,999
So then I guess
Milfeuille is off today,

12
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,501
which can only mean that
the girl I saw this morning,

13
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,254
who was dressed to kill

14
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,424
must have been none other
than our fellow angel.

15
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,802
‐ Huh?

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,670
You mean you saw
her out on a date?

17
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,468
‐ You could say that.
‐ Uh.

18
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,218
‐ Well, she was
just with Normad.

19
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,814
‐ All dressed up?
‐ Yeah,

20
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,350
she won a couple of free coupons

21
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,644
for dinner at Marlo’s Restaurant

22
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,855
and she decided to
take Normad along,

23
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,847
so he could teach
her table manners.

24
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,859
‐ Dinner at Marlo’s?

25
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,111
Uh!

26
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,821
Darn, that girl
has all the luck.

27
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,492
‐ She may only be
going out with Normad,

28
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,491
but it’s still a
classy restaurant.

29
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,494
I’m envious too.

30
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,497
(light melodic music)

31
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,513
‐ [Normad] Now listen,
if you drop your fork,

32
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,889
don’t pick it up yourself.

33
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,020
‐ What happens if I drop
both forks? (laughing)

34
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,944
Should I eat with my hands?

35
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,941
‐ [Normad] No, you
call the waiter over

36
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,983
and ask him to
bring you a new set.

37
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,527
‐ Oh, you can get
seconds for silverware?

38
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,163
‐ [Normad] You might say that.

39
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,278
‐ Huh?

40
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,581
‐ [Normad] What’s the matter?

41
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,576
Hello?

42
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,705
(dynamic upbeat music)

43
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,132
What is it, what’s going on?

44
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,378
‐ Need some help?

45
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,722
‐ (laughing) I’d
like this and that

46
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,556
and that and this and that

47
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,312
and that there too, wow!

48
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,312
‐ [Normad] What are you doing?

49
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,814
‐ [Vendor] Here you go.

50
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,606
‐ [Normad] We can’t
just sit here like this

51
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,732
eating cake all night.

52
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,819
‐ But they’re so sweet!

53
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,242
Can’t you appreciate
just how wonderful

54
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,411
all these beautiful
confections taste?

55
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,410
The flavor of the butter, the
milk and the vanilla essence

56
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,335
meld together so deliciously,

57
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,872
it’s not just any cake shop,

58
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,455
that can pull this
off, you know.

59
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,922
‐ [Normad] What shop can then?

60
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,041
‐ Only a very special
cake shop can.

61
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,628
Mm, mm!
‐ Thanks for clarifying.

62
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,586
‐ Oh!

63
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,185
(gasping)

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,300
Oh my goodness!
(gasping)

65
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,548
This is a Grande Asche!

66
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,968
Well, isn’t it?

67
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,478
‐ Ah, ah, I‐‐

68
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,391
‐ There is no mistaking it,

69
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,558
it’s a legendary sweet pastry,

70
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,356
this recipe was thought
to have been lost

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
over 200 years ago!

72
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,645
Tell me, how on Earth
did you get this recipe?

73
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,149
‐ Ah, I, hm.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,530
‐ [Pastry Robot] Quiet!

75
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,745
‐ Oh.
‐ Huh?

76
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,784
‐ [Pastry Robot] That’s
not a Grande Asche.

77
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,156
‐ Who are you?

78
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,707
‐ [Pastry Robot]
No one important.

79
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,577
‐ Oh, are you the one
who baked this cake then?

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,125
If you know that it’s not
really a Grande Asche,

81
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,015
you must know the real thing.

82
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,973
‐ [Pastry Robot] Perhaps.

83
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,432
‐ Wow!

84
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,012
This is incredible!

85
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,849
Will you teach me how
to make this cake?

86
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,234
Please, please, please,
please, please, please,

87
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,350
please, please, please,
please, please, please,

88
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,479
‐ Quiet!
‐ please, please,

89
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,693
‐ Be quiet!
‐ please, but you?

90
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,325
‐ [Pastry Robot] I’ll
show you how to make it.

91
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,282
‐ Yay!

92
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,815
So I’ll be your apprentice
for the day then?

93
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,448
‐ Apprentice?
‐ Yeah,

94
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,165
I want to learn by
practicing with you, master.

95
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,616
‐ [Pastry Robot] No.

96
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,955
‐ Oh, but why not?

97
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,463
‐ [Normad] Somebody’s
after you, am I correct?

98
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,416
‐ [Pastry Robot] You are.
(gasping)

99
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,336
‐ Oh!

100
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,295
(light suspenseful music)

101
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,224
Oh!

102
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,508
Argh!

103
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,645
‐ Oh.

104
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,845
‐ Argh!

105
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:51,639
Argh!

106
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,484
‐ Argh!

107
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,438
(dynamic music)

108
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,324
‐ [Pastry Robot]
Don’t follow me.

109
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,071
‐ But master, I want the recipe.

110
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,534
‐ [Normad] What’s
more important, a
recipe or your life?

111
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,374
‐ Argh!

112
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,568
My life!

113
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,580
‐ [Normad] Good choice.

114
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,202
(heavy breathing)

115
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,119
‐ [Pastry Robot] Why are
you still following me?

116
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,627
‐ I have to have that recipe.

117
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,255
Ooh!

118
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,669
(laughing)

119
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,426
(dynamic music)

120
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,885
‐ They’re gone.
‐ Where’d they go?

121
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,062
‐ Damn!

122
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,191
‐ I think we’re safe now.
‐ Shh!

123
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,399
‐ [Assassin Captain] Let’s
split up, we have to find them.

124
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,112
‐ [Assassins] Yes, sir!

125
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,112
‐ That was awesome!

126
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,995
(light suspenseful music)

127
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,740
‐ [Assassin Boss]
Who’s the girl?

128
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:50,835
‐ I don’t know, it’s possible
she’s just a tourist.

129
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,411
‐ Eliminate anyone
who gets in your way,

130
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,998
along with the target.

131
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,711
‐ Unfortunately quite a
few of the local residents

132
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,922
have spotted us
searching the area.

133
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,265
‐ I’ll report that there has
been a terrorist incident.

134
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,880
Getting rid of him
is our top priority.

135
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,797
‐ Roger, sir, we’ll expand
our assault immediately.

136
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,179
‐ [Assassin Boss] You do that,
I’ll join up with you later.

137
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,265
‐ Right.

138
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,274
‐ Hm.

139
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,282
‐ Having some
difficulty, are we?

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,780
‐ I’m very sorry, sir.

141
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,110
‐ [Mr. President] You
must do everything you can

142
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,447
to keep him from talking.

143
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,331
‐ I understand, this time I
will take care of it myself.

144
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,792
Just a few more
hours, Mr. President.

145
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,711
‐ Hm.

146
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,254
‐ That’s a convenient trick.

147
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,134
‐ [Normad] Now I understand
what you’re all about,

148
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,053
you’re a J2 model, aren’t you?

149
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,970
An ultra high‐level,
self‐functioning culinary robot.

150
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,051
‐ So master, should
I call you Mr. J2?

151
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,256
‐ [Normad] I heard it on
the news two weeks ago,

152
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,477
something about the robot cook
in the President’s mansion

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,520
escaping with stolen
secret documents.

154
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,694
‐ [Pastry Robot] I tell
you, I didn’t do it.

155
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,733
‐ [Normad] Then why
are they after you?

156
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,742
‐ [Pastry Robot] Because
I’ve come to learn

157
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,070
about the President’s
deep, dark secret.

158
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,026
(suspenseful music)

159
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,163
‐ Tonight we have a
report, that there’s been

160
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,039
a violent, armed terrorist
assault in District 14.

161
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,747
The government is taking
this very seriously,

162
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,837
imposing a curfew in the area
and deploying military forces.

163
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,466
We have heard that
the government

164
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,511
has just recently
regained control,

165
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,644
but as the damage caused by
the incident is considerable,

166
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,063
it will take some
time to stabilize.

167
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:40,943
‐ Uh!

168
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,730
We almost died.

169
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,068
‐ [Normad] We should have died.

170
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,783
It must be quite the
deep, dark secret.

171
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,704
‐ Oh,

172
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,372
oh, I’m hurt.

173
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,537
(light melancholic music)

174
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,546
‐ [Pastry Robot] How
about we have a rest here?

175
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,717
(gasping)

176
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,513
‐ [Normad] So this is where
dinner was supposed to be.

177
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,058
‐ Well, I guess dinner’s
canceled tonight.

178
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,807
‐ A restaurant?
‐ Someone saw them go in.

179
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,899
‐ [Normad] I’m not
sure if you understand,

180
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,776
but I don’t think this
is the time for this.

181
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,656
‐ Well, with cooking,
it’s much easier

182
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,411
to remember everything, when
you’re actually doing it.

183
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,124
‐ [Pastry Robot] We’re
almost done anyway.

184
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,035
Let’s just finish it off.

185
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,462
‐ Oh, thank you so much.

186
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,332
‐ [Pastry Robot] I’m
turning myself in now.

187
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,877
‐ Huh?
‐ Oh, nothing.

188
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,000
Let’s finish the cake.

189
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:48,918
‐ Right.

190
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,260
(light melodic music)

191
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,729
‐ [Pastry Robot] Good,
now the finishing touches.

192
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,525
‐ [Assassin Boss] Freeze!

193
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,937
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

194
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,445
‐ I have no idea how you
managed to survive our assault,

195
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,617
but your good luck is over now.

196
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,124
‐ Argh!

197
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,084
‐ Fire!

198
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,790
‐ Master, no!

199
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,721
Master!

200
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,430
(thudding crunch)

201
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,353
Master?

202
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,482
Master?

203
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,729
Master?

204
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,640
Master?

205
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,152
Master?

206
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,320
(crying)

207
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,991
(beeping)

208
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,076
‐ All the data is just fine.

209
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,255
‐ [Milfeuille] Really?

210
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,285
‐ Yes, it was all recovered.

211
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,588
‐ [Mr. President] What?

212
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,671
How did this happen?

213
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,636
‐ I guess the J2
memory survived intact.

214
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,679
They want 100
million GCs for them.

215
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,853
‐ Well, what are you looking at?

216
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,683
‐ Huh.
‐ So what

217
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,808
if we like to dress
up for a bit of fun?

218
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,195
Got a problem with that?

219
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,611
Well, answer me!

220
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,017
Wait, don’t go!

221
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,610
Can you believe that?
‐ Oh.

222
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,404
(crowd chattering)

223
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,199
‐ Oh, I’m sorry, there’ll
be a little bit of a wait,

224
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,874
because it’s such a
popular item, okay.

225
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,831
‐ [Hostess] Chef, how is the
Grande Asche coming along?

226
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,167
‐ [Pastry Robot] I told you
to refer to me as master.

227
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,880
‐ [Hostess] Yes, master.

228
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,840
‐ [Pastry Robot]
(sighing) It’s done.

229
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,547
(light melodic music)

230
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,835
‐ [Milfeuille] Ta da!

231
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,887
Here’s the scoop on
the next episode.

232
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,598
A guy that Forte and Ranpha
met on an uninhabited island.

233
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,925
(electricity buzzing)

234
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,190
What?

235
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,149
It must be some
sort of radio jammer

236
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,060
and a really strong one.

237
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,245
(dynamic pop music)

238
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,750
(singing in Japanese)
