1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,177
(spaceship whooshing)

2
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,558
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,620
(singing in foreign language)

4
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,065
‐ [Ranpha] Fun Park Specialties
with Chicken Mint Compote.

5
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,034
‐ Yahoo! Ha ha!

6
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,025
Ah!

7
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,613
Hey there, Vanilla,

8
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,580
this assignment sure is a
lot of fun, don’t you think?

9
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,450
Yay!

10
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,291
Woo! Hey, Mint!

11
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,132
This patrol is so
exciting! Yeah!

12
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,496
(Mint sighs)

13
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,300
Ah, wow, that was great.

14
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,472
Which ride do we patrol next?

15
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,971
‐ Well, um, so, Milfeulle.

16
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,095
‐ Huh, what is it?

17
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,560
‐ This time around,

18
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,770
our assignment is to prevent
any further occurrences

19
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,810
of the recent multiple
child kidnappings

20
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,064
that have been happening here

21
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,975
at the Cockadoodledoowopdo
Fun Park,

22
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,515
and to apprehend the kidnapper,

23
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,819
I think that you understand
our mission very well.

24
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,992
Don’t you?

25
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,200
‐ Yes.

26
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,661
‐ Judging from what
I can see, Milfeulle,

27
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,371
it seems like you’ve been
having way too much fun here.

28
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,662
‐ Oh, but that’s not true,

29
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,913
because I’m on patrol
here, so this is work.

30
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,705
(children laughing)

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,910
‐ Well, if you were on patrol,

32
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,168
you’d be watching
those kids over there,

33
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,629
who aren’t with their parents.

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,339
(shimmering bells)

35
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,341
(children laughing)

36
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,843
‐ Watch the kids?

37
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,765
‐ (clears throat) Yes, you
are to observe the kids

38
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,223
and protect them from
the evil kidnappers.

39
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,216
That’s our mission.

40
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,178
In order to carry
out this operation,

41
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,676
we must maintain
our self control

42
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,768
and take the job seriously.

43
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,313
And I say evil kidnappers,

44
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,687
but there are all kinds
of people out there.

45
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,074
The Angel Brigade has been
called upon to do this work,

46
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,823
and we’ve got to be
able to recognize

47
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,323
different kinds of criminals.

48
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,745
So I don’t think it’s helpful

49
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,704
if we narrow our
activities so much

50
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,625
that we’re not able to do that.

51
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,754
‐ Ha ha, I’m not sure
I understand here.

52
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,331
Hey, Vanilla, do you know what
Mint’s trying to get at, huh?

53
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,366
Do you, huh?

54
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,049
‐ [Group] Did you say
mascot patrol strategy?

55
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,880
‐ Yes, that’s correct.

56
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,843
Now, most of these
multiple kidnappings

57
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,347
that have been happening

58
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,219
have occurred right here
where the children gather,

59
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,885
which is in the
Cockadoodledoowopdo
area of the fun park.

60
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,766
‐ [Blonde Man] Yes, and
that’s why we’ve asked

61
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,404
that you focus your patrol’s
activities in that area.

62
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,021
‐ I’m well aware of that,

63
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,568
but I don’t think that it’s
going to be enough for us

64
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,904
to just routinely
patrol this large area.

65
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,859
We need to focus our efforts.

66
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,158
‐ (clears throat) But there
are still plenty of other rides

67
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,662
that we haven’t gone on yet.

68
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,288
‐ And so, the objective is
to draw the children together

69
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,085
into a smaller area.

70
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,207
‐ But how?

71
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,593
‐ That’s easy.

72
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,051
If we dress up as the
park mascot, Mr. Rooster,

73
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,300
who is, of course, very
popular with the children,

74
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,434
they will naturally
gather around us and
be easier to watch.

75
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,390
‐ I see.

76
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,800
‐ Ah.

77
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,059
‐ And, if we’re all dressed
up in these costumes,

78
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,100
then the kidnappers
won’t have any idea

79
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,604
that we’re patrolling the area.

80
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,307
‐ [Milfeulle] Ha ha, wow,
that sounds like fun, huh?

81
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,058
‐ [Dark Haired Man] I
see, that’s brilliant.

82
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,768
‐ [Woman] Yes, great idea.

83
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,780
‐ Okay then, I’ll go and get
the costumes ready right away.

84
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,491
‐ I sure would appreciate that.

85
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,533
(Milfeulle giggles)

86
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,955
‐ Well, here we go, Mint.

87
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,451
‐ [Group] Good luck
to you, be careful.

88
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,331
‐ Um, do you only have
two of those costumes?

89
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,917
‐ No, we have lots.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,460
‐ Then I’ll wear one too.

91
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,885
‐ That wouldn’t be right.

92
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,591
I can’t have Miss Mint
Blancmanche wear one of those.

93
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,972
‐ And why is that?

94
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,720
‐ Cockadoodle Planet operates
under the sponsorship

95
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,092
of the Blancmanche foundation,

96
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,138
and I can’t have
the estate’s heir

97
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,682
wear something so crass
as a mascot costume.

98
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,478
It just wouldn’t be the
proper thing for you to do.

99
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,230
‐ Oh, you don’t have
to worry about that,

100
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,562
after all, part of our
assignment this time around

101
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,438
is to wear those crass costumes.

102
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,035
‐ I just can’t allow it.

103
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,151
However, if you wish,
you can have a seat here

104
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,568
in the giant monitor room

105
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,415
and oversee the activities
in the theme park.

106
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,741
‐ [Milfeulle] Hello, Mint!

107
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,616
Are you watching us?

108
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,411
(children laughing)

109
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,917
‐ [Girl] This rooster
isn’t moving at all!

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,460
‐ [Boy] The rooster died!

111
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,384
‐ [Milfeulle] Vanilla?

112
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,503
Vanilla, are you alright?

113
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,300
‐ [Vanilla] It’s
time for prayer.

114
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,092
‐ [Milfeulle] Oh, right.

115
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,884
But you scared me.

116
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,719
‐ [Group] What,
there’s a problem?

117
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,305
‐ Yes, there is.

118
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,428
The problem now with
the mascot strategy

119
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,685
is that the patrol range
has gotten too narrow

120
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:51,679
to be effective.

121
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,888
‐ [Blonde Man] Really?

122
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,189
I thought you were
doing a good job

123
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,692
of bringing the
children together.

124
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,444
‐ No, it simply isn’t working.

125
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,984
Just think about it.

126
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,527
Look at all the
rides and attractions

127
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,990
spread out across the park.

128
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,910
What I’m saying is that
the children have come here

129
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,490
for more than just to be close
to their favorite mascot.

130
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,196
Haven’t you noticed that
they’re just wandering all over,

131
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,867
and not listening to what
their parents are telling them?

132
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,918
They’re also getting
bored very easily

133
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,921
and are quickly going from
one attraction to the other.

134
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,384
Am I right?

135
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,844
‐ Uh huh.
‐ Yes, that’s right.

136
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,302
‐ You see, so at this point,

137
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,803
we should be patrolling
completely different areas

138
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,216
of the park.

139
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,345
Quiet, out of the way places
where the perpetrators

140
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,521
of these crimes are more
likely to be operating

141
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,770
and able to avoid
being detected.

142
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,484
Huh, unfortunately,
with these new tactics,

143
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,573
I think we’re all going to
have to work separately now.

144
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,029
And in that case,

145
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,029
how about Milfeulle works
the botanical gardens?

146
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,992
The dark, shady
corners of the gardens

147
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,202
may be a perfect setting
for these crimes.

148
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,293
And, to tell the truth,

149
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,751
I can’t think of
anyone in all of space

150
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,000
besides you, Milfeulle,

151
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,081
who would look as good
in a flower costume.

152
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,878
‐ (giggles) No way, really?

153
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,462
Hey, everybody right this way!

154
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,762
Now, over here we
have the lily pads.

155
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,854
These amazing pads
can grow as large

156
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,390
as six meters in diameter,

157
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,643
and the flowers are
really, really cute.

158
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,597
What about me?

159
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,436
Does this flower suit suit me?

160
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,269
Do I look as cute as a flower?

161
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,476
‐ And, I think Vanilla
would work best

162
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,777
at one of the park’s
most popular attractions,

163
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,281
and that is Space World.

164
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,612
You’ll have to wear a
rather strange costume,

165
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,868
but that might be just
the thing for you.

166
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,619
You won’t have to
move around very much,

167
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,790
so I think you’ll
find it pretty easy.

168
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,371
Of course, we’ll have
to continue patrolling

169
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,786
the plaza areas,

170
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,092
so I will wear a
Mr. Rooster costume

171
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,249
and be the one to
patrol those areas.

172
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,798
‐ But we just can’t
have you wear a costume.

173
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,132
‐ Please, stop.

174
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,838
I think you’re all
forgetting something

175
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,389
awfully important here.

176
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,970
‐ Something important?

177
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,217
‐ Yes, it’s true,

178
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,476
I am a daughter of the
Blancmanche family.

179
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,023
Even more important than that,

180
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,404
I belong to the Angel Brigade!

181
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,520
‐ Ah, but, Miss Mint.

182
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,569
‐ Actually, I should tell you.

183
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,191
I once lost two dear friends

184
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,649
in a mission very
similar to this one.

185
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,318
‐ Huh?
(dramatic music)

186
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,577
Ranpha Framboise,

187
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,155
and Forte Stollen.

188
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,502
On that day as well,

189
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,843
I was forbidden to go with
them to the front line,

190
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,961
just because I was a daughter
of the Blancmanche family,

191
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,627
but the two of them,

192
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,086
yes, even those two,

193
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,465
never treated me any differently
than they had before.

194
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,264
They left me with
their brave smiles,

195
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,348
and charged off into a
sheet of raining bullets.

196
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,146
And neither of
them ever returned.

197
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,361
But I can still feel both of
them living within my soul,

198
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,994
this is something that
I can never let fade,

199
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,160
and they are two whom I
will never, ever forget.

200
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,450
Since I’ve taken the oath
of the Angel Brigade,

201
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,204
which is we finish every
assignment that we accept,

202
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,868
I will finish the
mission no matter what.

203
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,206
(crowd crying and cheering)

204
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,713
So I, Mint Blancmanche,

205
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,876
will now dutifully
wear a rooster costume

206
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,423
and go on safety patrol.

207
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,048
‐ [Group] Of course, yes,
as you wish, Miss Mint.

208
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,851
(Ranpha and Forte laughing)

209
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,438

like a beautiful flower, ♪

210
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,566

00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,285
‐ How wonderful, the comfort.

217
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,793
It would appear that my taste

218
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,925
is truly superlative after all.

219
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,829
(phone beeping)

220
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,587
Oh, this is delicious.

221
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,169
‐ Mint, I saw the kidnapper
running right by me,

222
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,255
just a minute ago!

223
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,801
‐ What, the kidnapper?

224
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,305
‐ Let go of me!

225
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:53,836
‐ [Milfeulle] Vanilla and
I are right on his tail!

226
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,337
Hang on!

227
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,138
Hang on there, little kid,
we’re right behind you!

228
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,675
‐ [Mint] Milfeulle,
where are the crooks?

229
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,437
‐ Huh, what?

230
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,639
A bird talking to me?

231
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,100
‐ Hey, come on, it’s me.

232
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,808
‐ Oh, hi, Mint.

233
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,400
Look, there they are!

234
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,363
(boy moans)

235
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,782
(men panting)

236
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,690
Hold it right there!
‐ [Mint] Alright, you guys,

237
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,108
You better stop in your tracks!

238
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,608
Hold it, you, I said, hold it!

239
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,277
‐ You’ll never be
able to escape us!

240
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,369
‐ [Men] Ah!

241
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,122
(suspenseful music)

242
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,624
(men panting)

243
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,918
‐ [Milfeulle] Alright, you
guys, you’re chicken scratch!

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,920
(crowd chattering)

245
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,344
‐ [Mint] You’ll be sorry!

246
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,797
‐ [Milfeulle] You’re
in big trouble now!

247
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,217
(men groaning)

248
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,513
‐ [Mint] I said, stop!

249
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,808
‐ [Milfeulle] Release the kid!

250
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,392
(men groaning)

251
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,475
‐ [Mint] Hold it, I say!

252
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,150
‐ [Milfeulle] This
assignment sure is fun.

253
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,943
‐ [Mint] Surrender, or else!
(Milfeulle laughing)

254
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,447
(men moaning)

255
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,030
‐ [Mint] We’ve got you now.

256
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,777
‐ So how would you boys
like another round of tag?

257
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,157
‐ [Men] We’re sorry.

258
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,001
(crowd cheering)

259
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,348
(Mint humming)

260
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,601
‐ [Volcott] Well, Mint,
you’re in a cheerful mood.

261
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,563
‐ Indeed, I am.

262
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,515
‐ As it turns out, the
kidnappers at the fun park

263
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,646
had apparently stolen
mascot costumes

264
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,192
for themselves as well.

265
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,437
They deny it,

266
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,356
but there seems to be
one Mr. Rooster costume

267
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,655
that can’t be accounted for.

268
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,408
‐ Oh my, oh my. (giggles)

269
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,708
(Mint humming)

270
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,222
Ha!

271
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,724
‐ [Normad] No matter
how you try to hide it,

272
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,724
I am indeed the apple tart.

273
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,474
‐ [Milfeulle] Come to think
of it, I’m really hungry.

274
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,926
‐ [Normad] No matter
how you try to hide it,

275
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,058
I am indeed the sweet
delicious jellybeans.

276
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,893
‐ [Milfeulle] Wow,
it sounds delicious.

277
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,148
‐ [Normad] Now, stop that.

278
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,940
‐ [Milfeulle] It’s
so sweet and tasty.

279
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,902
(soft cheerful music)

280
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,504
(singing in foreign language)
