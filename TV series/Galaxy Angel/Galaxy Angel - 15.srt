1
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,812
‐ What’s the matter?

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,140
Vanilla!

3
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,565
Do you feel any pain?

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,144
Can you hear me!

5
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,598
Come on, get up!

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,897
‐ [Robot] Oh no, if this
keeps up, Vanilla will die!

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,395
‐ [Girl] What should I do?

8
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,487
What am I supposed to do?

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,370
‐ Please forgive me for being
the foolish girl that I am.

10
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,199
I repent for this
crime I’ve committed

11
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,786
with all my heart and soul.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,910
Please forgive me, I humbly ask.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,710
‐ [Girl] Please, Vanilla!

14
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,553
(sirens blaring)

15
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,681
(upbeat music)

16
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,723
‐ [Girl] Lost Item.

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,636
‐ [Group] What?

18
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,889
‐ [Robot] Why did you shoot me?

19
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,143
‐ [Forte] I’m sorry.

20
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,394
Sometimes my arm has
a life of its own.

21
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,637
‐ [Robot] You nutcase.

22
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,308
‐ [Forte] What were you
just saying Milfeulle?

23
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,766
‐ If something doesn’t change
soon, Vanilla’s gonna die!

24
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,114
‐ What’s happening?

25
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,864
‐ [Robot] She hasn’t eaten
anything in two weeks.

26
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,778
‐ [Girls] What?

27
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,954
‐ But why’s that?

28
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,582
‐ [Robot] She’s
fasting in repentance.

29
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,159
‐ [Girls] Fasting?

30
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,540
‐ [Robot] It happened
two weeks ago

31
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,333
when Vanilla and I were
patrolling the city.

32
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,219
Vanilla lost something that
was very precious to her.

33
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,512
‐ And what exactly was that?

34
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,256
‐ [Robot] Like I said,
something very precious to her.

35
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,847
Something that
Vanilla held tightly

36
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,852
in her hand wherever she went.

37
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,064
‐ I don’t remember
ever seeing it.

38
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,096
‐ [Robot] You
weren’t aware of it?

39
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,898
Vanilla always had
it right in her hand.

40
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,895
Then, then, and then.

41
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,237
‐ So tell me, what was it?

42
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,703
‐ [Robot] I can’t.

43
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,413
I’ve never seen it or even
know what it’s called.

44
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,373
‐ Wait a minute,

45
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,541
you’ve been talking
the whole time

46
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,749
as if you know
everything about it!

47
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,711
‐ [Robot] All I
said was that she

48
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,209
held something in her hand.

49
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,920
I never said that
I knew what it was.

50
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,423
‐ So she’s sworn
that she’s going to

51
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,635
continue this fast until she
recovers this mysterious item?

52
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,635
‐ [Robot] That’s right,

53
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,836
but if she doesn’t break her

54
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,425
fast pretty soon., Vanilla will.

55
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,683
‐ What we’re saying is,

56
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,603
unless we find
this thing quickly,

57
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,644
Vanilla is going to die!

58
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,938
‐ So that’s how it is.

59
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,435
‐ Yes,

60
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,027
but in practice this is
going to be very difficult

61
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,912
no matter how determined
we are to help her find it.

62
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,781
Unless we know exactly what
it is we’re looking for,

63
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,079
there’s really
not a lot of hope.

64
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:05,952
‐ Don’t worry.

65
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,792
We’ll just have to
ask Mother Milky Way.

66
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,575
‐ [Girls] Mother Milky Way?

67
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,879
‐ Who’s that?

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,250
‐ I’ll introduce you.

69
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,379
This is Mother Milky Way.

70
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,765
‐ That’s just Ranpha!

71
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,223
‐ No it’s not.

72
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,473
She looks like her,

73
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,266
but this is the fortune
teller Mother Milky Way.

74
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,520
‐ Hey Ranpha!

75
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,269
Mother Milky Way.

76
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,903
‐ Yes?

77
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,360
‐ See?

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,900
She didn’t answer you when
you called her Ranpha,

79
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,283
but she did when you called
her Mother Milky Way, right?

80
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,242
It’s proof that
she isn’t Ranpha.

81
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,781
‐ You call that proof?

82
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,244
Ranpha, wake up!

83
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,534
‐ I see something.

84
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,327
There’s a young
person sitting looking

85
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,792
sadly to the northwest.

86
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,332
In the distance, is an
ocean where a whale lives.

87
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,576
Beyond that, you will find
what it is you are looking for.

88
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,127
‐ [Forte] What are
you talking about?

89
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,171
‐ The northwest, a whale,
a sculpture in a fountain,

90
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,378
a sad looking young person.

91
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,221
The Thinker.

92
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,142
District A of Whaletown.

93
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,641
That’s one area which
we’ve often patrolled.

94
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,395
Maybe that’s where it is.

95
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,766
(girls gasp)

96
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,483
This all depends
on whether or not

97
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,775
we can believe Ranpha’s
fortune telling.

98
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,067
‐ Thank you Mint.

99
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,153
I’m going to take
charge of the search.

100
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,778
I’m the lost item’s
search party of one.

101
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,374
(girl giggles)

102
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,741
Let’s go!

103
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,446
(upbeat music)

104
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,706
You hang in there Vanilla!

105
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,082
(dog growling)
Oh no, a dog!

106
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,626
It looks scary!

107
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,089
(girl yelling)

108
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,630
That was frightening.

109
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,668
Excuse me,

110
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
do you know where I could
find the whale fountain?

111
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,006
Why am I talking to you?

112
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,136
You’re a whale.

113
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,854
(girl gasps)

114
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:49,894
Hey, wait!

115
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,806
This must be the place!

116
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,813
Let’s see now.

117
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,015
(girl gasps)

118
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:55,976
Here it is!

119
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,775
Vanilla, did you lose this?

120
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,529
‐ What is that?

121
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,490
‐ [Forte] A lottery ticket?

122
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,701
‐ Now hang on.

123
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,537
(man gasps)

124
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,501
It’s a winning ticket.

125
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,909
First prize is 15 million GC’s.

126
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,209
(girls yell)

127
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,542
‐ Milfeulle, this
is unbelievable!

128
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,285
This ticket has to
be what Vanilla lost!

129
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,008
‐ I’ve got to say,
your luck is amazing.

130
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,419
‐ Thank goodness this
was solved so quickly.

131
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,887
(group gasps)

132
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:27,932
‐ It wasn’t.

133
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,314
‐ What did you do that for?

134
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,019
That was 15 million GC’s!
‐ Not much time.

135
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,930
‐ What?

136
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,229
What did you say Vanilla?

137
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,062
‐ That wasn’t it.

138
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,396
‐ I see.

139
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,233
It really won’t
make any difference

140
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,357
if it’s not what you’ve lost.

141
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,614
Well, I was just
so excited that I

142
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,408
brought back the wrong thing.

143
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,909
You fool!

144
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,542
(girl giggles)

145
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,410
I’m going to keep searching.

146
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,158
Mother Milky Way!

147
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,918
‐ Yeah right, the
fortune telling.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,580
(girl humming)

149
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,668
I see a picture
of a crab swimming

150
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,264
in a turbulent frothy river.

151
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,341
‐ [Mint] She must be
talking about downtown.

152
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,255
There’s a space crab
restaurant there.

153
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,425
‐ [Ranpha] And nearby,

154
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,683
there’s something
that’s giving off light.

155
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,514
‐ Alright!

156
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,558
Yeah!

157
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,061
I’m off!

158
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,102
I’ll find it this time.

159
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,597
Oh no, a bully!

160
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,979
Oh please don’t hurt me!

161
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,895
(girl yelling)

162
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,993
That was scary.

163
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,940
This is it!

164
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,613
Box.

165
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,120
(girl gasps)

166
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,081
Found it!

167
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,617
This is it, right Vanilla?

168
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,585
‐ Whoa!

169
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,462
You sure found something
amazing this time!

170
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,131
‐ I’m sure this is the 27 set

171
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,751
jeweled crown worn by King
Makearichbucks The Third

172
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,877
who ruled space during
the Gold Dynasty.

173
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,845
Each of these rubies must be
worth about 800 million GC’s.

174
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,469
‐ No wonder he
wouldn’t part with it!

175
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,846
‐ Vanilla.

176
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,973
I’m sorry I took so long.

177
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,930
Here.

178
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,150
(group yells)

179
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,651
‐ What could you
possibly be thinking?

180
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,653
‐ We all could’ve
finally been rich.

181
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,360
‐ [Mint] Milfeulle?

182
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,700
‐ I guess that wasn’t it.

183
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,697
I still didn’t get it right.

184
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,750
I’ll try again!

185
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,752
This time, I’ll be
sure to find it.

186
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,834
See you later!

187
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,302
‐ But she didn’t
even wait to listen

188
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,682
to my fortune telling this time.

189
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,351
(upbeat music)

190
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,139
‐ This’ll be third time lucky.

191
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,768
(girl yells)

192
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,361
Here it is!

193
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,403
I guess I left without hearing
about where it might be,

194
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,856
so I just picked up the first
thing that I could find.

195
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,317
(girl gasps)

196
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,865
‐ That’s the legendary
German pottery danke schoen.

197
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,740
It’s so ancient it’s believed
it doesn’t exist anymore!

198
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,788
‐ What’s it worth?

199
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,039
‐ I don’t know,

200
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,870
but once the collectors
learn that it exists,

201
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,117
I’m sure it could be assessed
at several billion GC’s.

202
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,628
‐ [Ranpha] Several billion?

203
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,210
(group yells)

204
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,880
(group breathing heavily)

205
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,969
‐ Was I wrong again?

206
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,059
‐ Vanilla, aren’t you
being a bit cruel?

207
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,564
‐ Mint, be quiet.

208
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,057
It’s okay.

209
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,309
‐ It’s not okay.

210
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,148
You’ve got a bad
attitude Vanilla.

211
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,403
Milfeulle is doing
the very best she can

212
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,357
to get you back
what you’ve lost.

213
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,566
‐ [Ranpha] That’s right.

214
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,615
Just because she brought
back the wrong thing

215
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,581
doesn’t mean you can just
throw it away like that.

216
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,290
‐ And it’s just not
very fair to the

217
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,162
one who’s working so hard
here to help you out.

218
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,118
‐ No, wait!

219
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:43,959
It’s okay.

220
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,424
I don’t mind.

221
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,093
‐ I think you’re being
quite unfair to Milfeulle.

222
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,212
‐ [Ranpha] It’s too much.

223
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,416
‐ But no!

224
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,716
‐ [Mint] I think you
should say you’re sorry.

225
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,839
‐ That’s right Vanilla.

226
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,055
You ought to apologize
to Milfeulle.

227
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,138
(girl crying)

228
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,926
Milfeulle, don’t cry.

229
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,107
‐ But it’s not Vanilla’s fault!

230
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,019
Be nice!

231
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,935
Stop picking on her!

232
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:12,822
‐ Okay.

233
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,066
We understand.

234
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,735
Please don’t cry
anymore Milfeulle.

235
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,164
It’s going to be alright.

236
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,783
‐ [Forte] We won’t
say anything bad

237
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,410
about Vanilla anymore, okay?

238
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,755
‐ [Man Voiceover] In the
midst of all this trouble,

239
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,921
I’m here vacuuming the floor.

240
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,054
Perhaps they think I’m a
cruel and mean spirited man,

241
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,301
but they’d be wrong.

242
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,973
Right now I’m so upset
that all I can do is

243
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,225
pick up this vacuum
and clean the floor.

244
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,096
I’m sorry girls.

245
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,816
‐ Vanilla was just
acting that way

246
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,613
because she lost
her precious thing!

247
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,068
‐ [Forte] Yes, that’s right.

248
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,659
‐ [Man Voiceover] Something’s
stuck in the vacuum.

249
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,171
‐ [Ranpha] Look at you.

250
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,831
You’ve got a runny nose and all.

251
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,339
Now blow your nose.

252
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,630
‐ I’m sorry.
‐ Come on.

253
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,708
‐ [Milfeulle] I’m sorry.

254
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,669
I’ll be okay.

255
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,256
Let me try one more time.

256
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,339
‐ [Vanilla] No.

257
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,891
‐ [Ranpha] So, what
is that anyway?

258
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,441
‐ [Robot] It’s an amulet that
all believers carry with them.

259
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,188
‐ Well thank goodness
it’s been found.

260
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,373
Anyway, you did well Milfeulle.

261
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,200
Milfeulle?

262
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,205
Milfeulle’s fast asleep.

263
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:47,921
‐ I’m so happy.

264
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,671
Thank goodness for Vanilla.

265
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,634
‐ [Vanilla Voiceover] Thank you.

266
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,085
‐ [Robot] Forte’s
such a kind person.

267
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,600
‐ [Mint] She watches
over everyone.

268
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,021
‐ [Milfeulle] And she loves
apple pie that’s not too sweet.

269
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,389
‐ [Vanilla] She’s
practically a saint.

270
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,557
‐ [Ranpha] A space hero.

271
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,226
‐ [Man] She’ll be getting
the medal of honor.

272
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,065
(girl squeals)

273
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,569
(girl chuckles)

274
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,230
(upbeat music)
