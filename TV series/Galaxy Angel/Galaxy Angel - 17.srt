All we are is a bunch
of amateurs, really.

6

Don’t think about it!

swore we’d forget it?

Now, our top story:

‐ Oh no, oh my god!

29
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,617
An advanced, state‐of‐the‐art
tank has been stolen

30
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,622
from a research facility
in Somewheretown!

The situation is
extremely dangerous.

Galaxy Angels, we
need your help!

33
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,713
‐ (sighs) Why does
this have to happen

34
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,165
on our day off, anyway?

35
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,093
‐ That’s really weird.

36

Who’d wanna steal a tank?

37
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,971
Something Forte
would probably do.

38
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,720
(gasps) Think about it:
she’s got enough weapons,

39
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,554
it would be easy for
her, and after all,

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,890
she’s the type!

Hang on, here we go!

51

get serious, will you?

52
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,702
This isn’t the time to be
quite so light‐hearted.

‐ Hey, I’m not
being light‐hearted!

54
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,748
I’m just enjoying my work!

55
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,174
‐ Okay, then how about
working on this problem of it?

56
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,423

57
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,166

00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,683
Hmm?

00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,929
Hmm.

62
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,552
Should I be happy about this?

63
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,427

you talking about?

64
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,466

seem to be anyone inside.

65
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,388
‐ Huh?

66
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,555
(gasps) Oh my, it’s true.

67
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,057
‐ [Normad] Hello,
this is Normad,

68
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,978
Normad calling my
lovely Vanilla.

69
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,685
Do you read me,
my sweet Vanilla?

70
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,235
I repeat, do you read me, over.

71
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,901
‐ Electrocute him.

72
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:58,909
‐ Aye, aye.

73
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,573
‐ [Normad] (groans)
Hey, I was kidding!

74
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,488
Just kidding, really!

75
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,906
I can see the tank from here!

76
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,945
It’s running out‐of‐control
south‐southwest

77
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,249
along Next Avenue.

78
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,542
And my mind is about run
out out‐of‐control too!

79
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,294
Help, Vanilla!

80
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,088
‐ [Forte] Sorry! I forgot
to turn off the switch.

81
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,462
‐ [Normad] Oh, no, Vanilla!

82
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,919
Mint and Milfeulle are
just barely hanging on

83
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,089
to the side of the runaway tank!

84
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,468
It always seemed like
Mint was just a little kid

85
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,096
and Milfeulle was a dimwit.

86
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,221
For the life of me, I can’t
imagine how they managed

87
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,138
to pull off a heist this major.

88
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,098
(screams)

89
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,596
‐ [Forte] Enough fooling around!

90
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,357
I’m apologizing to you and
you’re just going on and on,

91
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,939
talking to yourself!

92
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,114
(gasps)

93
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,443
‐ Forte, I can’t believe
they’re behind this!

94
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,950
‐ I guess we’ve just got
to find out for ourselves.

95
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,162
‐ Now wait a minute!

96
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,992
There’s no need for
you to use that!

97
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,367
‐ [Mint] For
goodness sake, stop!

98
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,203
(laughing)

99
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,458
This isn’t good.

100
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,869
Neither the brakes
nor the steering

101
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,377
seem to be
functioning at at all.

102
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,709
‐ [Milfeulle] Mint, Mint!

103
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,746
‐ Is something the matter?

104
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,167
‐ [Milfeulle] I’ve
got a question!

105
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,167
Which of the following
is lying directly

106
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,799
in the path of this tank?

107
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,144
One: a gremlin?

108
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,849
Two: a goblin?

109
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,600
Or three: a monster?

110
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,731
‐ [Mint] Number one?

111
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,439
‐ Sorry, incorrect!

112
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,019
It’s number four: a
bridge under construction!

113
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,646
‐ How was I supposed
to answer that?

114
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,034
(roars)

115
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:18,991
‐ Mint, can you believe that?

116
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,069
A monster, a real monster!

117
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,034
Don’t you think
that’s really lucky?

118
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,776
‐ It’s not my idea
of really good luck.

119
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,617
(gasps) I have an idea!

120
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,082
‐ (laughs) Woo!

121
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,003
Huh?

122
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,168
It’s not as easy to work
as a microwave, is it?

123
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,843
‐ Don’t worry so much.

124
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,381
Just try to figure
out the controls.

125
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,376
Give it a shot!

126
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,917
‐ Are you sure?

127
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,758
Then maybe I’ll just
see if, there! (groans)

128
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,216
Hey, it moved!

129
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,717
‐ [Mint Voiceover] I can
only count on Milfeulle

130
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,519
to get us out of this
crazy situation alive.

131
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,141
All we’ve got going for us now

132
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,608
are her amazing
streaks of good luck.

133
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,315
‐ What’s going on now?

134
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,360
‐ Beats me.

135
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,147
‐ Warp.

136
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,778
‐ [Mint] Why is
the tank warping?

137
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,535
‐ [Milfeulle] I don’t
know, but it’s not

138
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,736
that bad (laughing).
‐ Why is this happening?

139
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:08,988
(laughing)

140
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,207
(electronic warping)

141
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,625
(laughing)

142
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,093
‐ [Mint] (sighs)
This isn’t good.

143
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,795
To think the tank won’t stop,

144
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,434
even with all of
Milfeulle’s luck.

145
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,893
At this rate, it looks
like we’re totally doomed.

146
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,814
Heading for the ocean
into oblivion, too young.

147
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,102
‐ Ocean, I didn’t even
bring my bathing suit!

148
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,232
Huh?
‐ Have we stopped?

149
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,687
‐ It seems like we have.

150
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,936
‐ Free at last!

151
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,069
‐ Now I can go get
that bathing suit!

152
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,705
‐ Don’t come any closer!

153
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,165
(laughing)

154
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,622
‐ Mint, Milfeulle!

155
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,584
You really fell for my ingenious
trap this time, didn’t you?

156
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,503
‐ [Milfeulle] Hey, Fart‐e!

157
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,422
‐ Huh?

158
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,831
‐ Just what are you doing?

159
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,458
You should be ashamed,
leaving this tank lying around

160
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,507
after risking your
life to steal it.

161
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,669
I mean, I know you like
your firearms and missiles

162
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,508
and everything,
but don’t you think

163
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,723
stealing this tank is
overdoing it a bit?

164
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,643
Are you a gun lover or
a total weapons freak?

165
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,565
‐ (laughs) I don’t
know what you mean!

166
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,693
Let go, let go of me right now!

167
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,310
I’m innocent!

168
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,688
‐ Et tu, Brute?

169
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,399
‐ I don’t think so.

170
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,784
‐ Now listen here.

171
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,280
Just because the
ringleader has been caught

172
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,742
doesn’t mean that
you accomplices

173
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,281
are gonna get away with
this, do you understand me?

174
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,197
Now, lay down your weapons
and give yourselves up!

175
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,035
‐ All this is getting way
too complicated for me.

176
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,541
Why don’t we just
get off of the tank?

177
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,964
(pattering)

178
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,334
‐ It’s going to be alright.

179
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,210
If you just own
up to your crime,

180
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,205
the judge is willing
to show you some mercy.

181
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,468
‐ [Mint And Milfeulle]
Well, alright.

182
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,433
‐ You fools!

183
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,261
This isn’t some cartoon!

184
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,515
That could’ve hit us!

185
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,638
‐ Yeah, that’s right!

186
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,394
I haven’t yet
fulfilled my destiny!

187
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,814
I’m not ready to die!

188
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,312
‐ Who are you?

189
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,654
‐ You will have to direct all
your questions to my lawyer.

190
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,982
(grunts)
(groans)

191
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,856
‐ You shouldn’t have
done that, Mint!

192
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,245
No matter how unfair
Ranpha’s being,

193
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,609
it’s just not right
firing at her!

194
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,277
‐ Trust me, I didn’t shoot.

195
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,665
The tank fired that
shot all on its own.

196
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,912
‐ What, do you mean to
tell me that it’s the tank

197
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,545
that doesn’t like Ranpha?

198
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,833
‐ Not so!

199
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,504
In reality, I’m the one
the tank doesn’t like!

200
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,285
‐ Who are you, already?

201
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,457
‐ (cackles) Well, it’s
about time I told you.

202
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,047
I’ve been working in the
tank field for 60 years.

203
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,014
I’m the professor you’ve
heard of, Minami Asagaya!

204
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,434
‐ [Milfeulle] Woo‐hoo, ha ha!

205
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,352
I’m going to fall!

206
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,180
‐ [Mint] Don’t fall!

207
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,264
You’ll kill yourself!

208
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,018
(crashing)

209
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,771
‐ You can’t keep running away!

210
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,563
Get back to the research lab!

211
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,808
‐ [Milfeulle and
Mint] (pattering)

212
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,067
‐ [Minami] It’s not
you I’m talking about!

213
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,230
It’s the tank!

214
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,278
‐ Huh?
‐ What’s this all about, sir?

215
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,705
‐ Well, let me take
you back 12 hours,

216
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,200
five minutes, and
30 seconds in time.

217
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,044
‐ [Minami voiceover] I was
having my beef rice bowl dinner

218
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,161
during my routine
day at the tank lab.

219
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,746
Then, right in the
middle of my meal,

220
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,083
a fairy suddenly
appeared and spoke to me.

221
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,799
‐ Professor, because
you are so marvelous,

222
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,209
I’m going to grant you
one very marvelous wish.

223
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,168
What is your desire?

224
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,378
‐ [Minami Voiceover]
When I heard those words,

225
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,589
I didn’t hesitate for a minute.

226
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,179
I made my wish!

227
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,472
‐ I wish this tank were living!

228
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,136
‐ [Minami voiceover] And
then I couldn’t believe it!

229
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,854
It was the most incredible
thing I’d ever seen!

230
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,685
I realized the tank was eating
my beef rice bowl lunch!

231
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,233
‐ That’s right, it’s true!

232
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,107
There my tank was‐‐

233
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,733
(clang)
(groan)

234
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,528
‐ I think your stories
are ridiculous!

235
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,902
‐ They’re not!

236
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,368
These weapons program
developments are state secrets!

237
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,239
If they knew what
I was telling you,

238
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,407
I’d be in big trouble!

239
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,004
‐ So that’s how it is.

240
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,449
‐ Yes, yes!

241
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,620
‐ What do you mean?

242
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,328
Are you telling me
that all of our efforts

243
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,706
have been totally wasted?

244
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,745
‐ One might say.

245
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,586
‐ It would be fun
to meet a fairy.

246
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,222
‐ (sighs) We finally
managed to solve the case.

247
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,590
We’ve finished our work now.

248
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,889
‐ Huh, huh uh?

249
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,060
‐ What’s the matter, Mr. Tank?

250
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,890
Does your tummy
hurt or something?

251
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,055
‐ Tanks don’t have
tummies, silly.

252
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:03,984
‐ Hmm?

253
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,944
(tank whirring)

254
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,943
(melancholy music)

255
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,620
‐ The tank doesn’t
wanna go anymore.

256
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,956
‐ Huh?

257
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,789
‐ Hmm.

258
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,253
‐ But what can we do?

259
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,633
We can’t have a stray tank
wandering around town.

260
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,632
It’s not‐‐
‐ But he’s finally free!

261
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,007
I’m sure he wants to
do lots of fun things!

262
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,303
And eat lots of good
food, like any tank!

263
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,886
And, well, let’s see, I mean!

264
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,392
‐ Oh, Milfeulle.

265
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,313
‐ Hey, Ranpha, Vanilla!

266
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,393
Please tell me:

267
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,136
Am I being really weird?

268
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,688
‐ [Minami] Yes.

269
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,483
‐ [Ranpha] You’re
not being weird.

270
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,648
It’s just that tough
calls are part of our job.

271
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,895
‐ [Milfeulle] Does that
mean we should just

272
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,397
accept whatever happens?

273
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,908
(gasps)

274
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,320
I mean, I mean, maybe
it’s not too much to think

275
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,658
that we can really be
friends with this tank!

276
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,325
(melancholy music)

277
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,495
(missile shooting)

278
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,836
‐ [Normad] That does it.

279
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,590
The little kid and
the total dimwit

280
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,342
shall become my hostages.

281
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,466
‐ Wha?
‐ Huh?

282
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,550
‐ Hey, hold it right there, you!

283
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,929
‐ If you move, I’ll
kill the hostages.

284
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,275
‐ Hey, kid, that’s pretty good.

285
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,689
You’re quite the ventriloquist.

286
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,520
‐ (laughs) Wow,
Mint, we’re hostages!

287
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,865
Hostages, hostages, ha!

288
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,690
‐ [Mint] (sighs) Wasn’t
this a touching drama?

289
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,363
(laughs)

290
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,857
(laughs)

291
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,779
(upbeat energetic music)

292
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,248
(deep thud)

293
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,540
‐ I’m gonna tell you one
more time, I didn’t do it!

294
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,874
‐ Do you want a cutlet bowl?

295
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,538
‐ Don’t mess with me!

296
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,918
‐ How about tempura?

297
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,005
‐ You even listening?

298
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,917
‐ Some sushi, maybe?

299
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,128
‐ [Anchor] This is crazy, meow!

300
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,377
