1
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,025
(engine revving)

2
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,943
(upbeat cheerful music)

3
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:34,082
(singing in a foreign language)

4
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,484
‐ [Narrator] Forte’s ruinous
stew and a dash of trouble.

5
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,276
‐ [Milfeulle] You really
think the Lost Technology

6
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,954
is here in a place like this?

7
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,833
‐ [Forte] That’s what
we came to check out.

8
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,082
‐ It’s really
creepy around here.

9
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,623
‐ [Forte] Yeah, it’s like
some kind of graveyard.

10
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,341
‐ [Normad] What are
you both so afraid off?

11
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,961
This civilization died out
thousands of years ago.

12
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,799
There’s not a living thing
left of it that I can see.

13
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,184
I’m sure there’s
nobody here but us.

14
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,473
‐ Oh, Forte, if we start
digging around here

15
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,098
we could be stirring
up ghosts and things.

16
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,984
Don’t you see?

17
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,772
‐ I’ve come to take you.

18
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,314
(Milfeulle screaming)

19
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,727
‐ Hey, come on, Forte.

20
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,935
Don’t ever scare me
like that again, okay?

21
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,987
‐ Mummies, Dracula, whatever.

22
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,242
Bring’em on.

23
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,702
This is gonna be a
lot more interesting

24
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,583
than your average
run‐of‐the‐mill excavation.

25
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,490
(Forte laughing)

26
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,250
‐ [Normad] What is
it with these people?

27
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,170
‐ Did you just say
something, Normad?

28
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,170
‐ [Normad] Come
on, think about it.

29
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,502
We’re standing here before
an enormous monument

30
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,418
that probably goes back
several thousands years.

31
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,916
This is big.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,177
Don’t you fill
moved by it at all?

33
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,091
A sense of wonder perhaps?

34
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,388
Don’t you think it’s
awesome being here?

35
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,524
‐ I can make a wonderfully
awesome creme brulee.

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,060
(Normad sighing)

37
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,685
‐ [Normad] I guess it was a
mistake for me to come here

38
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,650
with such insensitive,
uneducated,
unintelligent people.

39
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,032
I’m very sure Vanilla would
relate to how I’m feeling.

40
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,201
(Normad sighing)

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,360
How I wish Vanilla were
here right now with.

42
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,409
Hm, what do you think
you’re doing, Forte?

43
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,623
‐ Hey, that’s dangerous.

44
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,412
‐ Well, alright, if
you really don’t like

45
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,867
being here with us so much,

46
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,545
how about I tie you to a missile
and launch you right back

47
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,794
to where your good
friend Vanilla is?

48
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,546
‐ Ah, I’ll pass on that, thanks.

49
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,132
‐ Normad, you’d better
start being more careful

50
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,126
with that big trap of yours.

51
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,508
Now, then.

52
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,724
Let’s get on with our
assignment and be done with it.

53
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,231
(Forte groaning)

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,430
‐ Huh?

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Forte, I think I
hit something again.

56
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,686
‐ You know, you sure have
an amazing amount of luck.

57
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,864
‐ [Normad] But none of it
is getting us any closer

58
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,493
to the Lost Technology.

59
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,661
‐ I wonder what I
found this time.

60
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,450
Huh, what’s this?

61
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,585
Looks like an egg.

62
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,118
Huh, it won’t crack.

63
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,918
‐ [Normad] You plan
on eating that?

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,960
(Milfeulle groaning)

65
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,052
You still want to eat it?

66
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,632
‐ Nope, it’s so hard.

67
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,299
‐ That’s cause it’s petrified.

68
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,097
(egg cracking)

69
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,562
‐ Huh?
‐ What’s this?

70
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,105
‐ Wow!
‐ Ah, a mouse!

71
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,523
‐ He’s so cute!

72
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,438
Come here!

73
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,947
(giggling)

74
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,279
Look, Forte, isn’t he cute?

75
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,775
‐ What’s so cute about it?

76
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,239
It’s a wretched mouse.

77
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,623
(Forte screaming)

78
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,906
Beast!

79
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,577
You see that, it gave
a really nasty glare.

80
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,036
‐ Forte, what on Earth
are you talking about?

81
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,587
‐ I just saw it.

82
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,130
‐ I think that you’ve just
started imagining things.

83
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,376
Right, little darling?

84
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,755
See?

85
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,093
How could a cute little
creature like this

86
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,468
give you such a mean look?

87
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,929
Besides, Forte, he’s so
friendly with people.

88
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,516
Do you wanna hold him a while?

89
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,648
‐ No, I think I’ll
pass for today.

90
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,732
‐ It’s really no
problem, you know.

91
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:16,726
See, here.

92
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,107
(Forte screaming)

93
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,114
‐ I said that I’ll pass!

94
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,196
‐ Gee, Forte, what’s
the matter with you?

95
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,873
It’s looks like you’re
sweating buckets right now.

96
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,833
(Forte screaming)

97
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,826
‐ Stay away from me!

98
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,799
‐ Oh, are you okay?

99
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,472
Poor little thing.

100
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,971
Exactly what do you think
you’re doing anyway?

101
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,353
I just can’t believe this!

102
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,509
‐ [Normad] I see now.

103
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,927
I guess there are
things about you, Forte,

104
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,186
that nobody would ever
guess in a million years

105
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,150
by the way you usually carry on.

106
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,359
‐ What do you mean?

107
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,110
‐ [Normad] I mean who
would ever have thought

108
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,530
that you, Forte, were
afraid of anything?

109
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,029
And to think that she’s actually
afraid of cute little mice.

110
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,863
(Normad laughing)

111
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,068
‐ Really?

112
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,539
Are you not just an
itchy‐bit fond of him?

113
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,039
He’s such a sweetie.

114
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,212
I mean he’s so harmless.

115
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,461
‐ Look, whatever.

116
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,291
Just go and get rid
of that little mouse.

117
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,087
‐ I know, I’m going to
call him my little Chibita.

118
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,134
Well, do you like that?

119
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,344
‐ Enough with your
silly giggles.

120
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,008
I want you to get rid
of that mouse right now.

121
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,387
‐ [Normad] Is there any reason

122
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,393
why you don’t get
rid of it, Forte?

123
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,646
Then it’s settled.

124
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,229
‐ Well, um.

125
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,895
You see, um.

126
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,192
‐ [Normad] You mean you
can’t even touch it?

127
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,236
Oh, my goodness,
think of how shocked

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,110
everyone in Angel
Brigade will be

129
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,868
to hear that you’re
afraid a little mouse.

130
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,989
Well, they’re definitely gonna
get a huge laugh out of that.

131
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,157
(Normad laughing)

132
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,366
That’ll be a good story
to take back home.

133
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,003
‐ Why you, Normad.

134
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,089
‐ [Normad] Or would you like
us to keep quiet about it?

135
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,882
‐ Are you suggesting
you make a deal with me?

136
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,336
‐ If you promise that you
aren’t gonna hurt Chibita

137
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,597
in any way, I promise not to
tell anyone else about this.

138
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,720
‐ [Normad] And also,
you have to promise

139
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,267
never to treat me so
rudely ever ever again.

140
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,942
‐ Okay, fine.

141
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:19,984
‐ Oh, yay!

142
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,106
Isn’t that wonderful, Chibita?

143
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,532
‐ [Normad] All right, I finally
found a weakness in Forte.

144
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,032
Now I can live in
comfort for a while.

145
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,784
(Normad laughing)

146
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:30,908
‐ Here, ah.

147
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,294
Hey Forte, why
don’t you come over

148
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,082
and join us for a
little bit of lunch?

149
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,165
I’ve even got some hot soup.

150
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,752
‐ It’s all right, I’m
not hungry anyway.

151
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,336
‐ [Normad] How very unusual
that you don’t have an appetite.

152
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,375
(Normad laughing)

153
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,061
(screaming)

154
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,771
‐ Ah, Milfeulle, I’m
just going to carry on

155
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,232
and investigate the ruins.

156
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,316
(panting)

157
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,989
Well, my allergy’s cleared
up, but I can’t believe

158
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,913
that I could have let those
two insult me like that?

159
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,951
And it’s all because of
that damned awful mouse.

160
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,078
Why am I still so itchy?

161
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,333
Don’t tell me.

162
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,616
It’s that rat.

163
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,998
The beast is
following me around.

164
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,175
Now, stop hiding and come out.

165
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,804
I know you’re around
here somewhere,

166
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,300
you stinking little rodent.

167
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,842
I’m just going to have to
kill you with my bare hands.

168
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,798
Come on out, you little beast.

169
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,522
(Forte screaming)

170
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,103
How dare you, you
disgusting runt.

171
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,648
Now, I’m gonna show
you just what happens

172
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,533
when I really go berzerk.

173
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,365
Ha, prepare to die.

174
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,544
You’re history.

175
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,077
What?

176
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,038
What the?

177
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,001
You’re not just any mouse.

178
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,047
‐ Chibita?

179
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,643
Where are you, Chibita?

180
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,179
What are you doing here?

181
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,972
Thank goodness you’re safe.

182
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,676
Is that Forte treat
you badly again?

183
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,137
‐ Milfeulle, get away
from that beast right now.

184
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,938
‐ I wish you
wouldn’t be so mean.

185
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,574
He does have a name, you know!

186
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,608
It’s Chibita!

187
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,783
‐ Chibita, my foot!

188
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,611
Look, just listen to me.

189
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,696
He fired a light
ray from his mouth

190
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,570
and blew a hole through this
bazooka in a split‐second.

191
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,409
Have you ever seen
a mouse do that?

192
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,584
He’s a monster wearing
the hide of a mouse.

193
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,292
‐ How could you call
him a monster, Forte?

194
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,538
Chibita!

195
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,245
Just look, little Chibita’s
all frightened now

196
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,089
and all because you
were so mean to him.

197
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,264
‐ It’s not the mouse
that’s frightened here.

198
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,094
(Milfeulle screaming)

199
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,008
Huh?

200
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,346
What happened, Milfeulle?

201
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,470
‐ Chibita’s.

202
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:03,598
Chibita’s become enormous.

203
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,444
Oh, what happened to
my cute little Chibita?

204
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,952
‐ [Normad] Animals
can be cute and cuddly

205
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,320
when they’re small,
but when they grown up,

206
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,829
it’s a bit of a disappointment.

207
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,951
‐ I think we have a
bigger problem here.

208
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,463
‐ [Nomrad] I remember now.

209
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,962
This is the biotech weapon
that was responsible

210
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,135
for the destruction of
the Muska civilization.

211
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,924
‐ Chibita’s a weapon?

212
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,255
‐ How could you have forgotten

213
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,800
something as important as that?

214
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,893
‐ [Normad] It just
slipped my mind.

215
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,679
It happens to everyone.

216
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,264
‐ Just slipped your mind?

217
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,097
And you have the call to
call yourself a computer?

218
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,896
So he is a monster, after all.

219
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,270
A horrendous, evil omen.

220
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,489
‐ Hang on.

221
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,150
No matter how big he’s gotten,
Chibita is still Chibita!

222
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,488
‐ What are you, an idiot?

223
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,824
Chibita’s a biotech weapon.

224
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,870
(screaming)
(suspenseful music)

225
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,458
All right!

226
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,884
‐ [Normad] There’s a problem.

227
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,344
He can travel through space,

228
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,802
so he could go someplace
else and run amok.

229
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,094
‐ Can you believe
that thing’s for real?

230
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,258
Milfeulle, you’re the one
that cracked that egg,

231
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,426
you do something about it.

232
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,135
‐ What, me?

233
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,515
But how can I?

234
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,896
‐ [Nomrad] Don’t worry.

235
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,191
I’ve got a great idea.

236
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,113
(Normad laughing)

237
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,108
What do you think?

238
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,988
We can do this because
this planet’s uninhabited.

239
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,544
‐ So, you’re utilizing the
mouse’s natural instinct?

240
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,410
‐ [Normad] I bet he keeps
going round and round

241
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,208
all his life.

242
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,962
‐ Thank goodness!

243
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,632
Chibita looks like he’s
having a lot of fun.

244
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,225
‐ [Narrator] Ranpha
framboise and Forte stollen.

245
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,222
They charged into the raining
sheets of bullets that day.

246
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,062
And the two of them
never returned.

247
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,574
(girls laughing)

248
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,646
(soft playful music)

249
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:32,081
(singing in a foreign language)
