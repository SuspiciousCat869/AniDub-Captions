1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,140
(thrusters activating,
alarm blaring)

2
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,269
‐ [Narrator] Grilled
girl in a box.

3
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,859
(yawns)

4
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,953
‐ When you’re out on
a week‐long mission

5
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,860
the thing you really
start to miss the most

6
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,027
is the comfort of your own bed.

7
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,116
Huh, Ranpha?

8
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,405
‐ Thank you for all the
hard work you’ve been doing.

9
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,245
Ranpha Franboise
here to welcome home

10
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,371
my good friend, Forte Stollen.

11
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,128
‐ "Welcome home,
my good friend?"

12
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,961
That’s a bit unusual.

13
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,805
‐ Actually, I’ve
really been wanting

14
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,801
to see you for a
while now, Forte!

15
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,632
‐ Hm?

16
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,378
‐ I have!

17
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,467
(Ranpha laughs)

18
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,182
‐ [Waitress] Here you go.

19
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,434
Enjoy your coffee!

20
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,314
‐ Do you take sugar, Forte?

21
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,231
‐ No.

22
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,477
‐ Milk?
‐ No.

23
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,943
‐ Doesn’t this smell great?

24
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:26,811
‐ Yeah.

25
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,107
‐ Will you drop dead?

26
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,861
‐ What did you say?!

27
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,737
‐ I’m so sorry.

28
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,033
‐ [Forte] You want
me to drop dead?!

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,159
‐ [Ranpha] Relax, there
is a reason for all this.

30
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,416
‐ Yeah, well it
better be really good.

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
‐ [Forte] Who is this guy?

32
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,045
‐ Roddy Leifman, that’s his
name, you would like him.

33
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,342
I decided that I’d really
like to go out with him,

34
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,006
he’s such a dream!

35
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,224
‐ Ohh.

36
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,434
‐ We’ve liked each
other for a while now,

37
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,222
and after giving him
the hint the other day,

38
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,347
he finally asked me out.

39
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,024
But, I slept in and
missed our date.

40
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,603
‐ This is why you want me dead?

41
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,608
‐ I didn’t have an excuse
for not showing up,

42
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,320
so I just made up
the story that...

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,280
‐ What?!

44
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,989
You told him that I died?!

45
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,659
‐ Well it seemed easier than
saying it was a family member!

46
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,869
Oh, I just don’t want
Roddy to dislike me,

47
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,831
I’m serious about him.

48
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:27,043
‐ Okay okay, maybe I’ll go
along with you just this time,

49
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,365
but what’s the point of fooling

50
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,538
the rest of the Angel
Brigade about this?

51
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,379
‐ Well you know, the
funny thing about it is,

52
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,054
Roddy’s family has a
long‐standing relationship with

53
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,052
the military, and this
information somehow got back

54
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,805
to the Angel Brigade.

55
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,886
You know, these rumors
have a life of their own.

56
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,562
Forte, please, I beg you!

57
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,564
Will you play along
and be dead for me?

58
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,306
‐ You’re being
completely ridiculous,

59
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,568
why should I have to play dead

60
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,941
for this stupid reason
you’re giving me?

61
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,818
Now you go back and tell
everyone the real truth!

62
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,534
And that settles that, alright?

63
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,368
‐ Have you ever wanted a
Brander Bass flintlock pistol?

64
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:08,333
(Forte gasps excitedly)

65
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,585
‐ Is it real?

66
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,748
‐ [Ranpha] How do
you feel, Forte?

67
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,457
‐ I’m not sure, really.

68
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,547
‐ You know, there have been
a few of my clients lately

69
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,301
who’ve faked their
deaths in order

70
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,135
to start lives over again.

71
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,350
‐ That’s definitely not
what I’m trying to do‐‐

72
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,099
‐ I know, relax, you’ll be fine.

73
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,273
‐ But this undertaker
doesn’t seem to understand.

74
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,601
‐ No, I do understand.

75
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,187
After all, I’m a professional.

76
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,569
‐ You really understand?

77
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,952
‐ It’ll be a great funeral.

78
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,873
‐ [Undertaker, echoing]
It’ll be a great funeral...

79
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,739
funeral... funeral...

80
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,792
‐ Forte!

81
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,079
Oh, Forte!

82
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,126
‐ Milfeulle.

83
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,586
‐ I never thought
Forte would go so soon.

84
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,343
‐ I still can’t believe it.

85
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,677
‐ I always thought that even
if all humanity became extinct,

86
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,474
Forte would still be around.

87
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,467
‐ [Ranpha] By the
way, where’s Vanilla?

88
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,437
‐ [Normad] She’s in prayer
for Forte right now.

89
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,809
She said it was a ceremony
to resurrect life.

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,440
Vanilla is such a kind person.

91
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,317
‐ [Man] Ranpha!

92
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,645
‐ [Ranpha] Roddy!

93
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,698
‐ I just don’t know what to say.

94
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,994
‐ I’m sorry that I
broke my promise to you.

95
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,538
‐ What in the world
are you saying?

96
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,752
Look at what you’re
dealing with here.

97
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,791
I was told that she died
while saving a child.

98
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,166
‐ That’s right, without
even thinking twice

99
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,515
she jumped right in front
of a car to save a child

100
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,802
that was about to be hit.

101
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,433
She held that child
until the very end.

102
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,352
She was smiling
even as her life was

103
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,020
slipping away asking the
child, "Are you alright?"

104
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,811
Those were Forte’s last words.

105
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,055
‐ [Forte Voiceover]
She’s overdoing it.

106
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,899
‐ What self‐sacrifice.

107
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,194
I’d say she’s
practically a saint.

108
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,907
‐ Forte was always so
kind to us as well.

109
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,530
‐ [Normad] There were
times she was, I guess.

110
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,408
‐ She watched over us.

111
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,295
‐ We’ve lost someone
so very important.

112
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,212
‐ [Forte Voiceover] Hey, it
feels kinda nice to be dead.

113
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,632
‐ Ranpha, I’d be honored
to participate in

114
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,341
the funeral service if I may.

115
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,261
When is her cremation?

116
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,974
‐ Cremation‐‐ Ow!

117
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,430
‐ Huh?

118
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,302
Maybe it’s wishful thinking,
but did you hear Forte?

119
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,597
‐ Yes, we will
have the cremation

120
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,233
after a simple funeral tomorrow.

121
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,559
‐ I understand, I’ll
join you tomorrow then.

122
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,647
‐ How kind and generous of you.

123
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,242
‐ [Forte Voiceover] Hey,
hey, hang on a minute!

124
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,689
‐ [Undetaker] That
was good work.

125
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,568
‐ Are you out of your mind?!

126
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,735
Cremation?!

127
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,835
‐ Well it just
came out that way!

128
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,949
‐ I can’t play dead very well
if I’ve been cremated, can I?!

129
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,868
‐ You don’t have a
thing to worry about.

130
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,325
This casket is specially
designed to withstand

131
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,876
temperatures in excess of
1,000 degrees centigrade.

132
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,751
‐ And you’re positive
it won’t fail?!

133
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,458
‐ It’s certified to comply with

134
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,720
Space Funeral
Association standards,

135
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,340
but in the case of an emergency,

136
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,387
there is always
this button here.

137
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,931
‐ I see, so by
pressing that button,

138
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,347
you could escape
from the casket.

139
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,983
‐ No, it releases cyanide
allowing for a painless death.

140
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,573
‐ Then maybe you’d like
to test it out for us!

141
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,030
‐ Quick, someone’s coming!

142
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,740
‐ Hello, I baked
Forte’s favorite pie,

143
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,281
the unsweetened kind.

144
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,816
What’re you doing?

145
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,330
‐ Well, we’re...

146
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,451
‐ Yes, we’re just testing
the casket’s durability.

147
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,459
‐ [Reporter] Mister Leifman.

148
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,291
A comment please
about the present

149
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,585
low morale in the military?

150
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,248
‐ "Low morale in the military?"

151
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,126
Haven’t you heard
about the accident

152
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,093
involving the Angel
Brigade member?

153
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,133
‐ I’m getting lonely.

154
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:52,047
I don’t think one classic gun
is enough to make up for this.

155
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,718
‐ One lousy gun‐‐

156
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,967
‐ [Ranpha] Doesn’t fire.

157
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,600
‐ [Forte] Come in.

158
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,647
‐ Listen, about this cremation,

159
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,941
we’ve changed it to a
burial out of respect

160
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,403
for your family’s
long‐held tradition.

161
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,824
‐ And you call that
an improvement?

162
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,155
‐ There’s one more thing.

163
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,659
‐ [Forte] What?

164
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,491
‐ Your funeral tomorrow will
be sponsored by the military.

165
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,327
‐ Huh?

166
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,206
‐ Countless people everywhere
have been deeply touched by

167
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,790
the story of Forte Stollen,

168
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,503
the courageous Angel Brigade
trooper who sacrificed herself

169
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,634
while saving the
life of a child.

170
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,423
The military commander
has also announced

171
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,296
that she’ll be awarded the
Medal of Honor, posthumously.

172
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,355
‐ Did he say the commander?!

173
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,640
I think this is getting
way out of hand!

174
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,234
‐ It seems that Roddy has taken

175
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,730
the liberty of speaking
to the reporters.

176
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,693
Oh, what a silly
troublemaker, that Roddy.

177
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,652
‐ And what am I supposed to do?!

178
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,033
As far as the world is
concerned, I’m completely dead!

179
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,203
‐ Don’t you worry!

180
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,950
Just leave all this to me.

181
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,371
I’m switching from
the fake funeral plan

182
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,540
to the complete
self‐vanishing plan!

183
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,038
‐ Complete self‐vanishing plan?

184
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,213
‐ You’ll be able to live
out the rest of your life

185
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,540
on an uninhabited planet
and no‐one will ever know.

186
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,707
‐ These are gifts for Forte,

187
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,838
from several of
the local citizens.

188
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,795
They’re all guns she liked.

189
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,216
‐ Guns?!

190
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,595
[Forte Voiceover] Oh no,
I’ve gotta stay calm.

191
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,563
‐ Everyone has been so moved
by Forte’s act of bravery.

192
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,055
There’ll be a lot more gifts.

193
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,146
‐ [Forte Voiceover] More gifts?!

194
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,901
‐ [Mint] I’m sure
Forte is happy.

195
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,285
After all, she’s
a space hero now.

196
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,953
‐ [Forte Voiceover] Space hero!

197
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,533
‐ Er...

198
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,737
‐ Mhm?

199
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,826
‐ I’m really sorry,
it’s not fair

200
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,252
that I’ve caused all of
this trouble for you.

201
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,791
‐ "Dear Miss Forte, I
am sending you my gun,

202
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,958
please use it in Heaven."

203
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,009
Having come this far,
it almost feels like

204
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,800
I could just go ahead
and die now anyway.

205
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,756
I never thought
I’d be so missed.

206
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,926
Even if this is all fake.

207
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,143
‐ Forte...

208
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,104
‐ You could come visit
me on my barren planet.

209
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,726
‐ Forte, I’ll go with you too!

210
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:04,982
‐ Huh?

211
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,025
‐ Well this is all
my fault, really.

212
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,357
There’s no way I can just

213
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,481
leave you by
yourself after this.

214
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,690
‐ Now stop that!

215
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,608
Watch it!

216
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,069
Whoa!

217
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,291
‐ Hm...

218
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,043
This is good for the
military’s image.

219
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,674
(officer whispering)

220
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,502
What?!

221
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,166
(bell ringing)

222
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,839
‐ What’s this?

223
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,837
What’s happening to us?

224
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,348
‐ Where are we?

225
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,811
‐ [Normad] What the?!

226
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,812
She’s really come back to life!

227
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,394
Vanilla, you’re incredible!

228
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,058
But why is Ranpha here?

229
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,938
‐ Is this where the funeral is?

230
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,145
‐ [Normad] Hm, oh,
right, Forte’s funeral!

231
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,909
Well, some military
big shot passed away

232
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,450
so your funerals got switched!

233
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:04,004
Mint and Milfeulle were sent
to take part those ceremonies,

234
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,500
and our kind‐hearted Vanilla
has been persistently

235
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,463
carrying out the
resurrection ritual,

236
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,633
and fervently praying
on your behalf.

237
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,513
‐ Oh Lord...

238
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,510
‐ Okay, so tell
me, what’s the deal

239
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,512
with this crummy graveyard then?

240
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,104
‐ Well, because the commander
was a high‐ranking official,

241
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,930
he took precedence and most of

242
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,935
the budget went to cover
his funeral expenses,

243
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,688
and your insurance policy
doesn’t pay for your funeral.

244
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,323
(gusts of wind blowing)

245
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,399
They say the value
of the person’s life

246
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,146
becomes apparent when they die.

247
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,406
I guess this is what
your life was worth!

248
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,951
‐ Normad, you...!

249
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,413
(Normad laughs)

250
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,043
‐ Moving right along.

251
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,295
‐ Now look you!

252
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,214
I’m gonna live for 100 years,

253
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,673
or maybe even 1,000
years or more!

254
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,054
Do you hear me?!

255
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,426
(Ranpha gasps)

256
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,880
‐ [Milfeulle] Here’s a question,

257
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,470
what do you think will
happen to the Angel Brigade?

258
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,973
One, new members will be added,
and there’ll be 10 of us.

259
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,716
Two, a sister
organization called

260
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,557
the Cupid Brigade
will be formed.

261
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,443
Three, a new sub‐group
will be created.

262
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,901
‐ [Ranpha] One.

263
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,021
‐ [Milfeulle] Sorry, The
correct answer is number four!

264
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:11,855
‐ [Ranpha] No?

265
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,230
‐ [Milfeulle] No!
