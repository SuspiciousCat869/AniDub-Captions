1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,517
(trumpet fanfare music)

2
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,521
‐ Three.

3
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:21,476
Four.

4
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,153
(Mint scoffs)

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,403
‐ [Robot Players] Hey pitcher,

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,236
you couldn’t hit
the side of a bus.

7
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,072
(ball whooshes)

8
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,026
‐ Strike!

9
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:31,913
‐ Wow, so close.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,372
‐ Come on, you can do it.

11
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,372
Give it your best shot.

12
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,704
‐ [Umpire] Strike.

13
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,908
‐ (laughs) Yeah.

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,168
Yeah, two more, that’s
it, just two more.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,580
‐ Don’t worry about it, Mint.

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,049
‐ [Colonel Roger] Hey,
hey, hey, who’s gonna wear?

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,920
‐ What’s with him?

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,506
What a creep.

19
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,919
‐ Yeah, he’s got some
pretty strange tastes.

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,220
‐ What?

21
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,683
Is he going to put
on that lingerie?

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,390
‐ My beautiful moo‐moo.

23
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,314
‐ Okay, stop that.

24
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,483
Hey, colonel, do these Space
Navy guys really get off on

25
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,733
this kind of baseball game?

26
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,555
(colonel stammers)

27
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,900
‐ Yeah, they do.

28
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,783
But us, we’re not
into this at all.

29
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,281
‐ [Forte] And this
score is ridiculous.

30
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,824
(ball whooshes)
‐ Strike!

31
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,405
‐ [Ranpha] And the four of
us don’t even play baseball,

32
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,041
and we’ve got three
robots on our team,

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,539
‐ [Forte] And one stuffed toy.

34
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,331
‐ [Mint] Will somebody tell
me why we’re in this game?

35
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,536
(colonel stammering)

36
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,587
‐ (gulps) Well, well, I.

37
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,433
(sirens blaring)

38
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:38,935
("Galaxy Bang!
Bang!" by Angel‐tai)

39
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,361
(singing in foreign language)

40
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,008
‐ [Milfeulle] Glazed
Baseball and Negligee.

41
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,563
‐ [All] What?

42
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,024
‐ You mean if we lose this game,

43
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,313
we’ve all got to go out
drinking with that sleazeball?

44
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,186
‐ [Ranpha] Dressed in nothing
but those skimpy nighties?

45
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,315
(Colonel Roger singing)

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,730
‐ Forgive me,

47
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,029
I made a stupid promise to him
in a moment of carelessness.

48
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,783
‐ And if the Angel Brigade
wins against the Space Navy,

49
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,526
then what, colonel?

50
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,788
‐ Well, if we win,

51
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,249
then Colonel Roger will
dance naked for us.

52
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,542
(girls groan)

53
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,923
‐ As if we’d ever
want to see that.

54
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,211
‐ [Normad] Why don’t
you just tell him

55
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,542
he was drunk at the time,

56
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,549
and it’s all a misunderstanding?

57
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,709
‐ Yeah!

58
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,049
‐ Hey, that’s a great
idea, let’s do it.

59
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,842
‐ No, actually, he and I
have a written contract.

60
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,467
(girls groaning)

61
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,894
(Colonel Roger snickering)

62
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,602
If I break the promise,

63
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,394
then I will have to
retire from the military.

64
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,847
(groans)

65
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,517
Oh, right, if we lose the game,

66
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,356
the Angel Brigade will
also be consolidated

67
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,242
into the Space Navy.

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,740
‐ You mean, that screwball
would become our leader?

69
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,374
‐ That’s just gross.

70
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,409
‐ Oh, please forgive me.

71
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,585
‐ Hey, hey, where’s
the next batter?

72
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,584
Hurry it up!

73
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,669
Come on girls, who’s?

74
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,751
‐ Well then, we don’t have
a choice, we’ve got to win!

75
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,047
‐ [Forte] It’s 100 to nothing,

76
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,590
and we’ve only got
one chance at bat.

77
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,216
One shot left.

78
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,051
‐ We must win.

79
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,935
We absolutely must.

80
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:26,773
Otherwise, we’ll be wearing
those stupid negligees.

81
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,098
We will!

82
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,647
‐ Never!

83
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,901
‐ I’ve never worn
a negligee before.

84
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,731
I’d like too.

85
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,765
‐ [Mint] Milfeulle.

86
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,480
‐ Yes?

87
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,740
‐ By the time that happens,

88
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,949
we will no longer be
the Angel Brigade.

89
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,531
(Milfeulle groans)

90
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,116
‐ Let’s win this!

91
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,451
‐ [Normad] But it’s
100 to nothing,

92
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,285
one more out and it’s over.

93
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,452
We’ve all but lost this.

94
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,290
(bullet whooshes)

95
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,462
That’s my mouth.

96
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,170
‐ Enough of your useless talk,

97
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,292
think of some way
we can win this.

98
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,997
‐ [Normad] Come on,
that’s impossible.

99
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,049
Even with my 10,000
gigahertz CPU.

100
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,432
‐ Hey, wait.
‐ Huh?

101
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,139
I’m thinking, I’ve got an idea.

102
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,216
‐ Okay, why are
we wearing these?

103
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,346
‐ We might as well be
wearing the lingerie.

104
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,476
‐ That’s the whole idea.

105
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,103
Take a look over there.

106
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,568
Those Space Navy guys
are all distracted now,

107
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,779
they aren’t thinking
much about baseball.

108
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,609
I bargained for a 30 point
handicap for each run,

109
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,775
so we can win this
with four runs.

110
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,624
‐ Hey, good thinking.

111
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,619
‐ However, in exchange
for the handicap,

112
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,371
if we do lose the
game in the end,

113
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,505
you two have to give
them special service‐‐

114
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,002
‐ Huh?
‐ As part of the deal I made,

115
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,833
if you know what I mean.

116
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,339
‐ [Both] Special service?

117
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,000
‐ So, let’s all give
it our very best.

118
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,208
‐ Hey!
‐ Angel Brigade.

119
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,339
‐ [Forte and Ranpha]
What special service?

120
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,384
‐ [Normad] Come on.

121
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,510
‐ Normad, you get on base
even if it kills you.

122
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,306
‐ If you go out, I’ll get
you with a machine gun.

123
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,521
‐ [Normad] How rude.

124
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,350
I’ve got a perfect
record at bat.

125
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,597
Well, never mind those two,

126
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,607
I’m more worried about
my precious Vanilla.

127
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,150
What an undignified
position she’s been put in.

128
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,696
But if I strike out,

129
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,701
she’ll be put into a more
undignified situation.

130
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,702
Ooh, I’d like to see that.

131
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,445
Wait, I didn’t say that.

132
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,367
This hit, I dedicate
this one to you, Vanilla.

133
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,078
‐ So how are you
going to hit the ball,

134
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,828
if you can’t even swing the bat?

135
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,378
‐ [Normad] You don’t
understand, Ranpha,

136
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,963
batting is not so
much about power,

137
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,296
as it is about timing.

138
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,261
(ball thuds)

139
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,802
‐ [Umpire] Ball!

140
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,094
‐ [Normad] The moment the
pitcher releases the ball,

141
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,678
I shift my weight
to my pivot leg.

142
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,511
(ball thuds)

143
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,756
‐ [Umpire] Ball!

144
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,309
‐ [Normad] And the bat
will strike the ball.

145
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,560
(ball thuds)
(Normad grunts)

146
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,771
(Normad thuds)

147
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,905
‐ [Umpire] Dead ball!

148
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,398
‐ [Milfeulle] Normad,
that was incredible!

149
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,435
‐ [Mint] Four fouls,
and one dead ball,

150
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,899
that does give him a
perfect record at bat.

151
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,160
‐ [Girls] All right!

152
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,739
‐ Hey, don’t you worry,

153
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,084
this time we’re gonna
finish them off.

154
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,200
‐ Well, bring it on,

155
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,156
you’ll never strike me out!

156
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,206
Let’s see your best pitch!

157
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,290
‐ Okay!

158
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,916
‐ Come on, come on, come on!

159
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,174
I hit it.

160
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,093
Here I go!

161
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,428
‐ [Normad] Ranpha,
I can’t run my base!

162
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,508
‐ I’ll take care of you.

163
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,886
(Ranpha yells)

164
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,693
(Normad whooshes)
(player grunts)

165
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,889
‐ [Normad] Safe!

166
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,098
‐ Good work, Ranpha!

167
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,559
That was great!

168
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,018
‐ Now you all can see
the stuff I’m made of.

169
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,608
What are you looking at?

170
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,406
‐ A minor setback,
let’s finish this.

171
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,033
‐ Okay, it’s time
to get serious here.

172
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,743
Come on!

173
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,617
‐ Okay!

174
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,955
(ball whizzes)

175
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,288
‐ Bam!
(bat cracks)

176
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:41,383
(ball thuds)
(player groaning)

177
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,133
Sorry!

178
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,205
‐ [Normad] Oh no!

179
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,628
‐ I’m the new relief pitcher.

180
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,336
Time to get serious
about this too.

181
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,139
Special service, coming
right up. (laughs)

182
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,394
(girls screaming)

183
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,484
‐ Milfeulle, you
better hit this ball!

184
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,849
‐ Now let’s see some
of that luck of yours.

185
00:07:58,979 --> 00:07:59,689
Come on!

186
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,653
‐ Roger.

187
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,898
What if I strike out?

188
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,444
‐ [Umpire] Strike!

189
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,277
‐ [Milfeulle] Oh,
if we lose here,

190
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,242
the Angel Brigade
will be through.

191
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,822
We can’t! (sobs internally)

192
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,330
‐ [Umpire] Strike two!

193
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,491
‐ Timeout!

194
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,249
Here, I’ve got a
little secret for you,

195
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,249
this chant will enable
you to hit the ball,

196
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,831
if you repeat it over and over.

197
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,587
‐ Hey, hurry it up!

198
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,629
‐ Okay, I’m almost ready.

199
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,723
‐ [Normad] Milfeulle, you
only have one pitch left.

200
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,131
I hope she hits it.

201
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,138
(Milfeulle chanting gibberish)

202
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,520
‐ I don’t know what that
was, but you are out.

203
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,984
(speaking gibberish)
(bat cracks)

204
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,475
(ball whizzes)

205
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,568
‐ [Normad] Wow, pop fly!

206
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,951
‐ No!
‐ Yes!

207
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,281
‐ [Player] Got it, got it!

208
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,865
‐ It’s in God’s hands.

209
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,032
‐ I got it, I got it.
‐ No, I got it!

210
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,450
‐ Oh no, I got it!
‐ I got it!

211
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,286
(players thud)

212
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,500
‐ Am I safe?

213
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,870
Does this mean
I’m gonna be safe?

214
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,578
‐ [Normad] Milfeulle,
you’ve got to run!

215
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,669
‐ Okay!

216
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,462
‐ All right!

217
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,955
Let’s go, Normad.

218
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:07,877
‐ [Normad] All right!

219
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,724
‐ Not so fast.(grunts)

220
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,300
‐ Here’s my lightning kick!

221
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,676
‐ Uh‐oh.

222
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,393
(kick thuds)
(player groans)

223
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,694
(Ranpha whooshes)

224
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,939
‐ That gives our team 60 points.

225
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,563
‐ That’s interference
with an infielder.

226
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,899
‐ What do you mean?

227
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,484
You want to make
something of it?

228
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,937
‐ Hang on a minute here,

229
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,569
I’m cutting you a lot of
slack ’cause you’re a girl!

230
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,824
‐ [Ranpha] Like hell you are!

231
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,366
How dare you!

232
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,989
‐ [Colonel Roger] You can
take this up with Volcott.

233
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,577
(ground rumbles)
(Ranpha screams)

234
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,541
‐ What the?

235
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,661
‐ A missile?

236
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,167
(missile beeps)

237
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,749
‐ [Normad] Is that you, grandpa?

238
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,995
(missile beeps)

239
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,377
‐ Grandpa?

240
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,423
‐ [Normad] Yes, the
NX 1855 Type Missile,

241
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:55,389
it’s an attack missile two
generations older than me.

242
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,430
‐ So, this is your grandfather?

243
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,715
‐ [Normad] Yes.

244
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,427
‐ I’d say it’s more
like your grand dud.

245
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,137
(missile beeps)

246
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,308
What’s that?

247
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,096
‐ [Normad] He saying,
"I am not a dud.

248
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,110
"I am an active NX
1855 Type Missile.

249
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,111
"A sleeping lion who’s time
of awakening has come."

250
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,244
(metal rattles)
(thrusters whooshing)

251
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,281
‐ No! Wait!

252
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,698
‐ [Normad] Oh, I forgot
to mention something,

253
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,283
my grandfather has
an attack system

254
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,789
that can identify key
commanders in the field.

255
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,200
Simply put,

256
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,788
it goes after the most
important officer in range.

257
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,576
In other words, you.

258
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,997
‐ What?

259
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:29,839
No!

260
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,093
No!

261
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,382
‐ [Normad] Oh, yes,
Commander Volcott,

262
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,465
since you are also a
colonel like Roger,

263
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,141
you will be targeted as well.

264
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,051
‐ Huh?

265
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,297
Oh no!

266
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,888
(Roger groaning)
(missile whooshes)

267
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,313
‐ [Forte] There.

268
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,812
‐ I’m home!

269
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,564
(colonels yelling)
(missile whooshing)

270
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,395
Yay!

271
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,649
This means we win!

272
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,322
‐ Now this crazy game is over,

273
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,859
let’s get out of here.

274
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,404
‐ Yeah, let’s.

275
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,395
‐ [Mint] I wonder how long
those two are going to last.

276
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,407
‐ [Vanilla] They’ll
reap what they’ve sown.

277
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,449
‐ [Milfeulle] Uh oh.

278
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,162
(missile booms)

279
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:09,132
‐ [Normad] Grandfather,
that was a glorious ending.

280
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,420
(ground rumbles)

281
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,253
Huh?

282
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,457
What?

283
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,007
(ground rumbles)
(colonels groaning)

284
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,761
‐ I thought I was going to die.

285
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,934
‐ Me too.

286
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,682
(thrusters whooshing)
(colonels gasp)

287
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,933
(thrusters whooshing)

288
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,143
‐ [Normad] What?

289
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,307
A TMAX 5000 Special?

290
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,516
That’s little Tama,

291
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,226
my childhood sweetheart.

292
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,897
Who’d have thought
I’d find her here?

293
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,028
(thrusters whooshing)

294
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,205
(missiles whoosh)

295
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,703
Run for cover everyone!

296
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,874
‐ [Forte] Why?

297
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,242
‐ [Normad] Little
Tama’s the jealous type.

298
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,448
She’s angry that I’m
around other women.

299
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,367
(girls screaming)

300
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,884
The moral of the story is,

301
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,590
it’s very dangerous
for good kids

302
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,422
to hang around training grounds

303
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,007
where grown‐ups play baseball.

304
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,434
‐ [Forte] What’s taking so long?

305
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,052
‐ [Mint] Sure is late.

306
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,427
‐ [Ranpha] Very late.

307
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,555
‐ [Milfeulle] Yes, it is.

308
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,892
‐ [Normad] Really late.

309
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,555
