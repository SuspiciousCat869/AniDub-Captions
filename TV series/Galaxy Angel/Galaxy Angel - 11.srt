1
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,984
(heavy rain and thunder)

2
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,309
(lighting cracking)

3
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:26,147
‐ I have odds that
Forte is actually evil.

4
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,995
Consider the mission
we’re on now.

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,530
If she hadn’t
disappeared like this,

6
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,373
I’ll bet we would’ve
been finished already!

7
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,699
She’s always acting like
she’s the leader or something.

8
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,746
She probably didn’t like this
mission and just took off!

9
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,292
What do you think?

10
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,384
(heavy rain)

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,790
You’re great, Vanilla.

12
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,298
You’d never lower
yourself and talk

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,510
about someone behind their back.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,550
I’m sure she can learn
a thing or two from you!

15
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,676
Hey, this might be a good place!

16
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,644
I’ve got a hunch that Forte is
yet to show her true colors.

17
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,386
You’d better be careful!

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,730
(heavy rain)

19
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,073
Oh, excuse me, we’d like
to spend the night here.

20
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,279
("Galaxy Bang! Bang!")

21
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,996
(singing in foreign language)

22
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,374
‐ [Narrator] Gun Shot
Bandage Roll Sushi Bowl!

23
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,158
(gun clicking)

24
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,667
(gun firing)

25
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,838
(gasping)

26
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,303
‐ Wonderful, wonderful,
bravo, bravo!

27
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,184
You have quite amazing skills!

28
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,932
‐ Yes I do.

29
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,892
The Colt Artillery Civilian.

30
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,845
Not a replica, but
a real one from

31
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,975
when the Wild West
was being won.

32
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:06,941
‐ Uh‐huh.

33
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,810
If you’d like, you can have it.

34
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,857
‐ What?

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,860
No way!

36
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,032
You’re gonna give me this?

37
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,740
‐ Sure, it’s yours!

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,450
May it be a symbol of
our new found friendship!

39
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,490
‐ Right on!

40
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,532
Thanks!

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,620
(gasping)

42
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,793
‐ If you’d like to come
with me to visit my hospital

43
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,371
in town, I’d love
to show you the rest

44
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,538
of my gun collection.

45
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,575
‐ Really?

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,590
Let’s go now!

47
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,551
‐ Well, alright!

48
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,419
Shall we then, Chief?

49
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,418
‐ Huh?

50
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,336
(laughing)

51
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,178
‐ What?

52
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,722
Chief?

53
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,895
(lighthearted music)

54
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,815
‐ [Old Lady] No, no!

55
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,274
You’re still quite
young, you know!

56
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,939
‐ [Angry Man] You
must be joking!

57
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,320
‐ Ma’am, this way.

58
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,861
‐ Huh?

59
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,154
‐ This is the
hospital I spoke of.

60
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,656
‐ Ah.

61
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,951
Very impressive!

62
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,914
(groaning)

63
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,496
‐ Okay, turn around.

64
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,215
(birds chirping)

65
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,379
Alright, that’s good.

66
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,842
‐ [Worried Mother]
How is he, Doctor?

67
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,426
‐ It’s nothing to worry
about, just a head cold.

68
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,974
Well, hang on, let me
get him some medicine.

69
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,388
‐ Oh, thank you very much.

70
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,016
‐ Give him this three times
a day after his meals.

71
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,023
‐ Sure.

72
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,444
‐ Alright, next!

73
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,316
(peaceful music)

74
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,456
‐ Oh!

75
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,789
Oh!

76
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,746
Oh, oh!

77
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,959
(cheering)

78
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,959
I can move!

79
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,088
My arthritis has been cured!

80
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,474
I can move it, I can move it!

81
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,261
My leg, it’s been healed!

82
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,055
Oh, come dance with me!

83
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,144
‐ It’s a miracle!

84
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,394
‐ It truly is!

85
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,636
‐ Thank you, Miss!

86
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,227
Oh, thank you!

87
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,322
‐ Oh, Vanilla truly is an angel!

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,690
(laughing)

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,490
(sighing)

90
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,948
‐ It’s very strange
that you don’t have

91
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,453
any patients here at all.

92
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,085
Are you closed down?

93
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,161
‐ Well, no, not exactly!

94
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,998
Hey, let’s go see my
gun collection, okay?

95
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,923
‐ Yeah!

96
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,839
‐ The former chief here was
quite the gun collector,

97
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,265
specializing in
the Federal Period.

98
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,387
‐ The Browning High
Powered Competition Model!

99
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,525
The Tokarev
Semi‐Automatic Rifle!

100
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,311
The Kalashnikov Carbine AMP69!

101
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,861
(gasping)

102
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,074
‐ Wow!

103
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,453
The Sterm Rooker
Percussion Revolver!

104
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,029
Absolutely beautiful lines!

105
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,625
Oh, it’s gorgeous!

106
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,241
I’d give anything
to own this one.

107
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,620
‐ So, whatta think?

108
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,545
‐ It’s fantastic!

109
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,883
This collection is incredible!

110
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,291
‐ If there’s anything you
want, you can have it.

111
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,798
‐ Are you serious?

112
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,010
‐ Under the condition that
you accept a particular job.

113
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,551
‐ A job?

114
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,934
Yeah, sure!

115
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,722
I’ll do anything!

116
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,176
(mysterious music)

117
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,275
‐ Thanks to that little
clinic over there,

118
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,482
we never get any patients here!

119
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,851
(laughing)

120
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,903
‐ Maybe that’s not
really the problem.

121
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,244
(laughing)

122
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,236
‐ We have the best facilities
available anywhere,

123
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,115
right here at this hospital.

124
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,622
‐ That ramshackle
clinic doesn’t even‐‐

125
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,755
(cheering)

126
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,132
‐ I’m thinking your
problem lies elsewhere.

127
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,000
(groaning)

128
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,916
‐ Well, to put it
bluntly, the job

129
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,635
that I have suggested you
carry out for me is this,

130
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,588
I would like you to do
whatever you can to throw

131
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,258
that doctor across the
street out of this town.

132
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,604
If you can do that
for me, you may take

133
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,432
what you like from
the collection.

134
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,233
‐ Alright then, leave it to me!

135
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,025
‐ Thank you so much!

136
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,438
(screaming)

137
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,162
(whacking)

138
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,865
(crying)

139
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:35,795
‐ Chief?

140
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,456
(gun firing)

141
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,173
‐ Just a test firing to see if
this gun is working properly.

142
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,337
‐ Test firing?

143
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,965
Yes, of course.

144
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,300
(grinding)

145
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,271
Uh, do you really
have to have us hold

146
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,726
these like this for you?

147
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,032
‐ The enemy won’t
be standing still.

148
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,152
Unless those targets
are kept moving,

149
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,279
this test will be
far from realistic.

150
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,625
‐ Uh, right.

151
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,121
‐ Okay, here we go!

152
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,202
Get a move on!

153
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,708
(gun firing)

154
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,178
(laughing)

155
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,684
(gun firing)

156
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,687
(crying)

157
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,443
Not too bad.

158
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,858
‐ Is that okay?

159
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,408
Did we do alright?

160
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,371
‐ Yeah, sure!

161
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,200
(dramatic music)

162
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,417
‐ What do you people want?

163
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,634
‐ Listen, Doc, I have nothing
against you personally,

164
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,423
but in light of the
present situation,

165
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,378
I’m gonna have to ask you
to leave town immediately.

166
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,259
‐ So that greedy hospital’s
putting you up to this, huh?

167
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,219
‐ What?

168
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,267
What do you mean, greedy?

169
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,271
That’s it!

170
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,852
See, we’ve heard enough!

171
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,055
Just blow him away already!

172
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,516
‐ Huh, you sure?

173
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,902
Okay, look you’ll have to
do as we say and leave now

174
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,994
or I’m gonna have to shoot you.

175
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,610
And these bullets
are gonna hurt.

176
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,569
‐ Forte!

177
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,579
‐ Huh, Normad?

178
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,543
And Vanilla?

179
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,451
‐ What are you doing?

180
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,410
‐ Who me?

181
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,415
Well now that you’re
asking, I’d like to know

182
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,041
what you two are doing here.

183
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,797
‐ Do you want Vanilla
to just get up

184
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,211
and abandon these sick
and injured people?

185
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,428
Unlike you, she’s a
kind and gentle soul!

186
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,509
‐ Now wait a minute!

187
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,183
I have my own considerations,

188
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,221
I’m helping out these
people here as well!

189
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,595
‐ Take one look and you can
tell who the evil ones are.

190
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,731
(mysterious music)

191
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,568
This isn’t something
you have to think about!

192
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,331
(gun firing)

193
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,623
‐ You betrayed us!

194
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,964
You get nothing from
the gun collection!

195
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,790
‐ Well, I could have
guessed as much.

196
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,130
‐ Stop!

197
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,133
Don’t do it!

198
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,004
Are you mad?

199
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,840
You’ll blow us all up!

200
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,185
(laughing)

201
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,642
‐ This is just the moment
I’ve been waiting for!

202
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,394
No doctor can help you now!

203
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,193
(window breaking)

204
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,356
(dynamite going off)

205
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,835
(peaceful music)

206
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,248
‐ You really helped.

207
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,500
‐ I don’t think we’ll
be seeing much of

208
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,333
those three around here again.

209
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,628
(screaming and crying)

210
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,011
‐ Y’all take care of yourselves.

211
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,841
(peaceful music)

212
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,317
(humming)

213
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,946
‐ So, do you think that’s
the lost technology

214
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,415
we’ve been looking for?

215
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,866
‐ [Normad] Well, that’s
what we’re here to find out.

216
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,455
You know, if you had
your act together,

217
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,710
Forte, we would’ve
been done here already!

218
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,884
‐ [Forte] Wow, this
is a nice piece!

219
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,678
‐ [Narrators] What’s
the special service?

220
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,222
‐ [Narrator] Angel
Brigade, fight!

221
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,065
‐ [Narrators] What’s
the special service?

222
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,730
‐ [Narrator] We should
all work hard together!

223
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,440
‐ [Narrators] What’s
the special service?

224
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,730
‐ [Narrator] Hey, hey, pitcher,

225
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,351
you couldn’t hit
the side of a bus.

226
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,898
Or the side of a barn.

227
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,608
("Horoscope Rhapsody")

228
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,078
(singing in foreign language)
