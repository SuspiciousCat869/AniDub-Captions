1
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:18,175
(engines roaring)
(alarm blaring)

2
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:23,985
("Galaxy Bang!
Bang!" by Angel‐tai)

3
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,777
(singing in foreign language)

4
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,941
‐ [Forte] Downtown
Soul food Oden.

5
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:53,361
(sirens blaring)
(melancholy music)

6
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,237
There’s a neighborhood,
about 10 kilometers south

7
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,665
of the center of town.

8
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,084
It’s called the Miles
district, Highland.

9
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,460
(sirens blaring)
But being overrun with crime,

10
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,463
the district has come
to be known as Deadtown.

11
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,050
‐ [Woman] Welcome.

12
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,300
‐ Hello, there.

13
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,685
‐ [Woman] Hello, again.

14
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,431
(slow, Japanese music)

15
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,683
You really are a night owl.

16
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,017
(Forte chuckles)
Coming to a rowdy spot

17
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,023
like this, almost
every night you can?

18
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,186
‐ I find it relaxes me.

19
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,993
‐ [Woman] You shouldn’t
be drinking so much.

20
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,695
No man’s going to
wanna marry you

21
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,325
if you’re a lush, you know.

22
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,120
(Forte chuckles)
‐ Can I have some oden

23
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,625
with some fish cake and potato?

24
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,417
‐ You pay first, Milly.

25
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,921
‐ What are you so worried about?

26
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,802
I’ve got lots of money.

27
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,259
‐ You pay me first.

28
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,549
‐ I have it, okay?

29
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,934
‐ (sighs) And how many
times have I fallen

30
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,509
for that story now?

31
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,386
You can’t pull that again.

32
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,023
‐ (growls) Just
never mind, then.

33
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,811
‐ My goodness!
‐ Hang on a second.

34
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,354
(Woman gasps)
‐ Hmm?

35
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,403
‐ Oden with fish
cake and potato.

36
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,276
‐ Hmm?
‐ You’re buying me dinner?

37
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,821
Wow, that’s great!

38
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,744
‐ Huh?

39
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,029
Alright, here you go.

40
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,198
‐ Yum, thanks a lot. (sighs)

41
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,254
Mmm, this smells great.

42
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,842
‐ 45 caliber, huh?

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,880
This is too big for a kid.

44
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:38,465
‐ (munches) Hmm, hmm? (gasps)

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,010
‐ Hmm?
‐ I’m not a kid!

46
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,268
‐ Milly!
‐ You do that again,

47
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,272
you’ll pay with your life.
‐ Hmm?

48
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,024
‐ And don’t forget it! (munches)

49
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,029
‐ Hey, wait!

50
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,399
Aren’t you even
gonna thank the lady

51
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,067
who paid for your meal?

52
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:57,994
Milly!

53
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,987
‐ (chuckles) She’s
from around here?

54
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,245
‐ (sighs) She’s not really
a bad kid, you know.

55
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,293
Her father was a big
shot in organized crime.

56
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,336
He’s in prison now
serving a life sentence.

57
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,759
Her mother is with another
man and has lost interest.

58
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,172
‐ It must be tough.

59
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,218
(melancholy music)

60
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,642
(sirens blaring)

61
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,154
(communication device beeping)

62
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,106
Yes?

63
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,028
Roger, I’ll return to base now.

64
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,874
‐ Hold it!
‐ Huh?

65
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,871
(Milly panting)
(Forte gasps)

66
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,916
(tires screeching)
(horn blares)

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,630
(Milly grunts)

68
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:05,894
‐ Oh, (pants) did you just
see a little girl run by here?

69
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,937
Ah!

70
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,520
M‐Milly, Milly!

71
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,363
(Milly sighs and giggles)

72
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,819
‐ Hey, you.
(Milly squeals)

73
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,988
‐ What do you want?

74
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,826
‐ You’re gonna return
what you stole.

75
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,581
‐ But I just ate it.

76
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,083
‐ Then, you’ll pay for it.

77
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,834
‐ I’ve got no money!

78
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,708
‐ Then, we’ll go to the police.

79
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,715
‐ (growls) You don’t understand!

80
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,337
Everyone who lives around
here is doing the same thing.

81
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,972
‐ So, you think
that makes it okay?

82
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,340
(Milly grunts)
(Forte yells)

83
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,468
Why you...

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,730
(groans) That,
that punk. (laughs)

85
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,194
Hmm?

86
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,067
Is this hers?

87
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,278
‐ There you are!

88
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,538
(grunts) I want you
to give me my gun!

89
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,332
‐ You’re back.
‐ It’s mine, give it back.

90
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,215
‐ Don’t you mean, may I please?

91
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,382
‐ What?!

92
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,589
I’m calling the cops!

93
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,461
‐ Go ahead, you’re the
one who’ll be arrested.

94
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,877
(Milly growling)

95
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,089
I’ll have the bill, please.
‐ Right away.

96
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,894
I want you to take me
and show me your home.

97
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,433
‐ Huh?

98
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,018
‐ If you want your gun back,

99
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,021
you’re gonna have
to do as I tell you.

100
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,689
‐ [Milly] But you’re
not coming in!

101
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,606
‐ [Forte] Milly, do you
like this neighborhood?

102
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,567
‐ [Milly] I don’t
know how anyone

103
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,244
could like this rotten place.

104
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,121
Well, here it is, my gun please?

105
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,413
‐ [Forte] One second inside.

106
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,826
‐ [Milly] I said I’m
not letting you in.

107
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,674
(grunts) Hey, you
can’t go in there!

108
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,251
(Forte gasps)

109
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,813
‐ What an untidy
room you’ve got here.

110
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,471
‐ Where’s my gun?

111
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,889
‐ You could at least
offer tea to your guest.

112
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,936
‐ (growls) Give me a break.

113
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,600
‐ Okay, I’ll leave.

114
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,270
‐ (growls) Alright,
alright, tea then!

115
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,320
What’s her problem anyway?

116
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,784
Why do I have to serve her tea‐‐

117
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,862
(Forte chuckles)
‐ In my home? (grunts)

118
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,778
‐ Hmm.

119
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,043
Hmm. (chuckles)

120
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,832
‐ (gasps) Hey, you get
out of there right now!

121
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,959
‐ This outfit is so cute.

122
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,296
‐ [Milly] Put that away!

123
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,256
‐ Please try it on?

124
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,969
‐ No way!
‐ You don’t wear

125
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,221
these clothes?
‐ No!

126
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,341
‐ [Forte] You never wear them?

127
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,850
‐ I told you, I don’t!

128
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,262
‐ Really, you don’t?

129
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,516
(Milly growling)
Wow!

130
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,057
You look pretty in that!

131
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,738
If you’d dress like that more
often, boys would notice you.

132
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,783
(sips) What?

133
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,525
‐ You promised me I
could have my gun back.

134
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,540
‐ Oh, yeah.

135
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,214
Here you go.
‐ But this is...

136
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,714
(Milly quivers)

137
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,257
‐ Your gun.
(Milly gasps)

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,840
Don’t you want it?

139
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,966
‐ Just shut up!

140
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:37,595
(door slams)
(footsteps pounding)

141
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,694
(Forte heavily breathes)

142
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,736
(gunshots banging)

143
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,447
‐ [Forte] I understand.

144
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,120
(footsteps tapping)

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,660
Milly.
(gun clicks)

146
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,866
I understand your feelings.

147
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,785
I know exactly what
you’re going through.

148
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,798
(melancholy music)

149
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:46,997
(Milly munching)

150
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,747
‐ Any good?
‐ Not really.

151
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,550
‐ Then, don’t eat it.

152
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,592
‐ But I’m hungry, though.

153
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,467
(Forte chuckles)

154
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,017
What is this?

155
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,602
‐ Just open it up.

156
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,272
(Milly gasps)

157
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,658
‐ But why, why are
you doing this?

158
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,531
You don’t know
anything about me.

159
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,448
‐ Afraid?

160
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,905
‐ [Milly] What’s this for?

161
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,380
‐ You can’t trust anyone
or anything, can you?

162
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,635
Hmm, can you?

163
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,836
‐ You only think
that you understand!

164
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,850
‐ Oh, yes I do, very well.

165
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,603
I’ve been through
the same thing.

166
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,143
‐ Huh?

167
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,096
‐ I was alone.

168
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,896
There was nobody there
who knew how to reach me.

169
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,614
When you live in that
kind of environment,

170
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,153
you just stop trusting people.

171
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,989
And then, you begin to believe
that you are so different

172
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,825
that no one will like you.

173
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,488
But, there are many ways out.

174
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,791
So sometimes, when you
hear a knock at the door,

175
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,667
take a chance and look.

176
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,927
(chuckles) This kind, old
man told me that years ago.

177
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,679
(Volcott sneezes)
Here then.

178
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,932
You can have this back, bye.

179
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,016
‐ [Woman] Thank you.

180
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,099
‐ Wait!
‐ Thank you for the tea.

181
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,477
It was very good.
‐ Huh?

182
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,357
(Milly giggles)

183
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:39,485
Hey, thank you, Forte! (laughs)

184
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,038
(Milly giggles)

185
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,959
(sirens blaring)

186
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,341
‐ [Milefeulle] W‐w‐wait!

187
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,757
At this rate, Vanilla will‐‐
(gunshot explodes)

188
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,887
‐ [Forte] So why?

189
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,393
‐ [Normad] It’s been two weeks!

190
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,394
‐ What?
‐ But why?

191
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,386
‐ [Normad] It seems
Vanilla has lost

192
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,306
something very important.

193
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,564
‐ [Forte and Raphna] What?!

194
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,557
‐ [Raphna] Well, let’s
ask the fortune‐teller,

195
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,057
Mother Milky Way, about it.

196
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,065
("Horoscope Rhapsody")

197
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,921
(singing in foreign language)
