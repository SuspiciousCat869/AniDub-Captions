1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:14,854
‐ Hello there?

2
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,308
You’ve got customers.

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,766
I know it’s late, but
could you open up, please?

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,687
Hello?

5
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,857
We know you’re in there.

6
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,946
‐ Let’s take a rain check,
I wanna go home now.

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,042
‐ But this is the only place
that’s open late around here,

8
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,871
besides their pizza
is absolutely amazing.

9
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,417
‐ Look, we’ve been
here for two hours.

10
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,212
Maybe it’s time
to call it quites

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,303
‐ [Mint] Excuse me,
could you please open up

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,629
for just a bit?
(sighing)

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,593
I know it’s after hours,
but we’re really hungry.

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,875
‐ Now I’m starting
to get hungry,

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,299
I should just go home.

16
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,136
Huh?

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,600
Hi‐ya‐ya‐ya!

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,061
Argh!

19
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,391
‐ Ah!

20
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,144
‐ Wow, he’s cute!

21
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,596
Hey, gorgeous!
‐ Huh?

22
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,228
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’ll
get you the money soon.

23
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,896
Please don’t hurt me, I beg you.

24
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:08,941
‐ Money?

25
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,235
What?

26
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,253
(dynamic upbeat music)

27
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,424
(singing in Japanese)

28
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,414
(light melodic music)

29
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,706
‐ [Mint] Deco Pizza.

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,880
‐ Ever since we opened,

31
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,171
we haven’t been able to
sell nearly enough pizza,

32
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,128
our debts keep piling
up and the repo men

33
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,765
are starting to come around
and take things away.

34
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,012
We can’t even make
deliveries anymore,

35
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,596
soon we won’t even
be able to stay open.

36
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,312
(sighing)

37
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,142
Just what could be so wrong
with our pizza anyway?

38
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,687
‐ There’s nothing
wrong with it at all,

39
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,523
you’re doing
everything just right.

40
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,106
‐ [Pizza Guy] Huh, I
just created a new pizza,

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,112
would you like to give it a try?

42
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,704
‐ [All] We’d love to.

43
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,235
‐ Well, here goes.

44
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:20,947
Mm,

45
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,661
I can’t see anything
wrong with this,

46
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,616
it’s wonderful as usual.

47
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,837
‐ That’s right, I’ll bet every
pizza you make is delicious.

48
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,337
Uh, gross!

49
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,262
(shouting angrily)

50
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,011
‐ [Repo Man] Hey, come on,

51
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,301
open this door, come on!

52
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,515
‐ Argh!

53
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,064
Those guys are gonna
kill me, please help me.

54
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,390
‐ Ah, well.
‐ Help me!

55
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,853
‐ I‐‐
‐ Help me!

56
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,643
‐ You mean those guys
are your debt collectors?

57
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:48,693
‐ Alright!

58
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,733
Yeah!

59
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,524
I will do what I have
to in the name of love.

60
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,781
Okay, first of all, we
have to work on your pizza

61
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,615
or we’re doomed from the start.

62
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,201
‐ Since when did you
become a cook, Ranpha?

63
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,455
‐ Hey, what do you mean?

64
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,159
I’m actually better than
Milfeuille, you know,

65
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,708
in fact I could show
her a thing or two.

66
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,582
Ah, uh.

67
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,133
Hi‐ya‐ya‐ya‐ya‐ya‐ya‐ya‐ya!

68
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,756
Hi‐ya‐ya‐ya‐ya‐ya!

69
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,257
Hi‐ya!

70
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,505
That’s the finishing touch!

71
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,056
Presto!

72
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,679
♪ Mamma mia ♪

73
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:30,056
And there you have it, Ranpha’s
special 100 spice pizza.

74
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,605
Here, have a piece.

75
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,060
‐ Here goes.

76
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:35,945
Ah, ah,

77
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,147
argh!

78
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,317
It’s really delicious, wow,

79
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,276
I’ve never tasted
anything quite like it.

80
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,624
(laughing)

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,370
‐ It’s so good,
it’ll make you cry.

82
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,203
‐ Yeah?

83
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,447
I guess I’ll try it too.

84
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,708
Ah, ah!

85
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,543
Oh, my God!

86
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,497
(shouting)

87
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,959
Help me!
‐ My mouth is on fire.

88
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,458
‐ [Ranpha] Alright, let’s
open up, I’ll make the pizzas,

89
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,470
Mint, you take the orders,
‐ Right.

90
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,220
‐ [Ranpha] and
Vanilla, let’s see,

91
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,972
you arrange the deliveries.

92
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:04,965
‐ [Vanilla] Right.

93
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,597
(singing in Japanese)

94
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,484
450,000 GCs.

95
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,984
‐ [Computer Voice]
Your current balance

96
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,645
is 145,000 GC,

97
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,613
thank you for using this ATM.

98
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,397
‐ Too much.

99
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,198
‐ [Hitchhiker] Stop, please!

100
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,449
‐ [Driver] How about a lift?

101
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,997
‐ [Hitchhiker] Thanks a lot.

102
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,711
‐ [Mint] Okay, thank you.

103
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,715
Yes?

104
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,416
West City, District three?

105
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,264
Okay, we’ll be there shortly.

106
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,798
‐ Why are there so many

107
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,595
orders all of a sudden?

108
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,509
‐ Hey, why are we getting
all of these requests

109
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,808
for pizzas that
nobody’s tried yet?

110
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,392
What kind of
advertising did you do?

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,600
(laughing)

112
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,398
‐ Please.

113
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,522
(horns blaring)

114
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,529
Excuse me, please stop,
could you please stop?

115
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,526
‐ Hey there, babe.

116
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,866
So where ya going?

117
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,779
‐ Do you think it
would be possible

118
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,618
for me to borrow your car?

119
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,833
‐ [Driver] What a nut.

120
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:14,754
‐ What?
‐ What?

121
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,045
‐ 10 minute,
‐ 10 minute,

122
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,496
‐ planetary delivery?
‐ planetary delivery?

123
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,746
‐ Yes.

124
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,549
If we don’t deliver the
pizzas within that time,

125
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,882
we take a loss.

126
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,435
‐ Ah.
‐ Like the pizza’s free?

127
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,051
‐ Yeah, well, that’s standard,

128
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,966
but we’re actually going to
give them something extra.

129
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,765
If we don’t offer our
customers something special,

130
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,102
it’s next to impossible
to get orders,

131
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,017
for example, if we’re
five minutes late,

132
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,614
we give the customer
100 kilos of gold

133
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,112
and if the pizza
is 10 minutes late,

134
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,323
the customer gets
a space cruiser

135
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,322
and if we exceed 20
minutes on orders

136
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,954
for 100,000 pizzas or more,

137
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,822
they get an entire
resort planet.

138
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,238
Unless you take some risks,

139
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,197
you’re not going to
survive in this business.

140
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,406
‐ You’ve gotta be kidding.
‐ You’ve gotta be kidding.

141
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,996
‐ Let’s do it! (laughing)

142
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,501
‐ Do it, are you kidding?

143
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,673
Even if Vanilla manages to
find a delivery vehicle,

144
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,763
how are we going to deliver
all of these pizzas on time?

145
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:03,971
Tell me that!

146
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,556
‐ Excuse me, please,
please, please stop.

147
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,681
Stop, will you, please?

148
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,557
‐ You’re not gonna
get anywhere that way.

149
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,865
We’re quickly
running out of time,

150
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,019
we can’t deliver all our pizzas
with an ordinary air car.

151
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,608
I’ll help you out here.

152
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,540
(horn blaring)

153
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,461
‐ Hey, what’s the
matter, Ranpha?

154
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,960
Argh!

155
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,714
‐ No one ever seems to be here,

156
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,054
so we thought we’d
let ourselves in.

157
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,709
You don’t pay up and
you’re hanging around

158
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,878
with your girl here
like it’s nothing?

159
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,587
You’ve sure got nerve.

160
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,717
‐ It’s not like
he’s my boyfriend,

161
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,604
we haven’t even
done anything yet.

162
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,931
‐ Are you lovesick or what?

163
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,385
Have you ever seen
one of these before?

164
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,936
‐ Stop it!

165
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,559
This has nothing to do with
her, so leave her out of it!

166
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,067
‐ Ah, you’re so sweet.

167
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,229
‐ I’ll use this.
‐ Huh?

168
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,687
‐ Huh?

169
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,899
(screaming)

170
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,657
‐ If you’re gonna kill
us, take me first.

171
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,869
‐ Hey, you, what are you doing?

172
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,453
Trying to kill yourself?

173
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,746
‐ Oh, Mint.

174
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,329
‐ What are you pulling here?

175
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,964
Are you looking for
trouble or what?

176
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,710
Well?
‐ Well?

177
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,214
‐ I just tripped and
fell, that’s all.

178
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,836
‐ You tripped and fell?

179
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,013
‐ So tell me, why are
you just lying there

180
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,512
with your eyes closed like
you’re praying, you idiot?

181
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,885
‐ All our creditors

182
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,182
have been constantly
threatening us with violence,

183
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,968
we’ve suffered so much

184
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,978
that well, my sister
and I thought we’d just.

185
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,361
‐ Easy, sis.

186
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,530
‐ Well, what about
your Mom and Dad, huh?

187
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,028
(light melancholic music)

188
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,363
‐ Some 10 years ago,
they passed away.

189
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,238
Ever since then, we’ve
been making pizza.

190
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,447
(crying)

191
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,040
‐ The boss!
‐ The boss!

192
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,750
(crying)

193
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,045
I know, I know how you feel.

194
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,210
‐ We’re really thankful
for your compassion.

195
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,218
Would you help us
deliver our pizzas?

196
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,680
(crying)

197
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,891
I know that we’ll
be interrupting your
normal work schedule,

198
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,894
so I promise that
we’ll repay you.

199
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,387
Will this be alright?

200
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,440
And then there’s the problem
of our living expenses,

201
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,114
there’s the power bill
and the water bill,

202
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,573
we’ll also need
some new clothes,

203
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,823
we’ve been wearing what we have
on for five years, you know

204
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,865
and it would be nice
to eat something

205
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,578
other than pizza
once in a while,

206
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,578
when was the last
time we had cake?

207
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,951
I can’t even remember

208
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,170
and we’d really like a
proper grave for our parents.

209
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,749
‐ A grave!
(crying)

210
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,174
‐ and we need to fix
the hole in the roof.

211
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,053
‐ Hey, boss, these kids
are hurting so much,

212
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,301
they can’t even cry anymore.

213
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,715
(crying)

214
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,473
‐ [Boss] We’ll do
it all for nothing.

215
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,806
‐ Really?
‐ Of course,

216
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,061
how could we take
anything from you?

217
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,845
‐ So what are you planning
to do with us then?

218
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,977
‐ Well, if you’ve got no money,

219
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,359
maybe you’ve got
something else to offer?

220
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,235
‐ [Trucker] Stop right there!

221
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,451
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

222
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,332
‐ [Repo Man] Who
the hell are you?

223
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,490
‐ Just some truckers, who
happened to be passing this way.

224
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,950
We heard that some friends here

225
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,460
needed our help
delivering some pizzas.

226
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,211
Alright, you guys, get on
with your work, pronto!

227
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,883
‐ Right!
‐ Right!

228
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,252
‐ Oh, he’s so cool.

229
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,548
‐ [Trucker] Ah‐huh.

230
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,467
Alright, I’ll take District A.

231
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,721
‐ [Trucker] I’m
off to District D.

232
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,722
‐ [Trucker] Unit 101
delivery completed.

233
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,314
‐ [Trucker] Units
53 to 72, completed.

234
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,969
‐ [Trucker] Here we go!

235
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,099
‐ Ah!
‐ Whoa!

236
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,557
‐ Ah, wow, that was a
lot of pizza we moved.

237
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,278
Have we made enough to
cover your debts yet?

238
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,649
‐ Yes, I was able
to pay them all back

239
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,066
with today’s receipts.

240
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,705
‐ Do people like the pizza?

241
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,453
‐ They do, it’s a huge hit,

242
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,533
we’ve got a ton of
orders for tomorrow.

243
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,160
‐ Here, Ranpha’s special
1000 spice pizza!

244
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,634
It’s delicious.

245
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,963
(screaming)

246
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,337
Was it really that spicy?

247
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,975
(screaming)

248
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,352
Hurry up, oh, it’s my
turn, that’s enough!

249
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,180
Let me in there, my
mouth is on fire!

250
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,855
‐ [Mint] But you’re the
one who made this pizza.

251
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,024
‐ Just get out of my way!

252
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,151
‐ Ah, my mouth!
‐ Uh!

253
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,690
‐ There’s another tap.

254
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,145
‐ Argh!

255
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,153
Huh?

256
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,574
But that one is

257
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,534
gas!

258
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,029
‐ Argh!

259
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,826
(explosive booming)

260
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,029
(light melancholic music)

261
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,200
‐ Oh, my pizzeria.

262
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,249
‐ You always reap what you sow.

263
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,503
‐ Just shut up!

264
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,503
‐ [Pizza Guy] I’m
back in debt again.

265
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,005
‐ Oh, right, it’s
my fault, is it?

266
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,717
Well, it’s your problem
now, I’m out of here!

267
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,224
‐ The Incident on
the Resort Island.

268
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,183
‐ Is this a cutlet on a stick?
‐ Major trouble coming.

269
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,393
‐ [Mint] You didn’t
pay for that, Oden.

270
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,854
‐ [Vanilla] An
unpredictable event.

271
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:06,814
‐ [Ranpha] The most
powerful good luck charm.

272
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,313
‐ [Vanilla] Who was responsible?

273
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,194
‐ [Ranpha] The fried
cutlets were the culprits.

274
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,401
‐ Only God knows.
‐ No way!

275
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,571
No way!

276
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,570
(melodic pop music)

277
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,210
(singing in Japanese)

278
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,429
(melodic pop music)
