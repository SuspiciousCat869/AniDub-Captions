1
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,677
‐ [Forte] Normad!

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,019
(Forte growling)
‐ Forte, relax!

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,692
‐ Why you little!
‐ You gotta settle down!

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,689
Come on!
‐ I dare you to say

5
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,941
that again.

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,731
‐ [Normad] You just love
to fly off the handle.

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,016
‐ [Forte] I’m gonna...

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,609
‐ Hey, what’s the matter?!

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,362
Why is everybody fighting?

10
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,534
Aren’t you happy with
the recreation I planned?

11
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,535
It’s really a lot of
fun, the talking dice!

12
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,196
‐ [Forte] That’s
not the problem!

13
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,704
Normad said there’s no
way there’d be any talk

14
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,247
of love in my life,
the little jerk!

15
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,503
‐ [Normad] That’s
not true, I said‐‐

16
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,672
‐ Yes, I understand‐‐
‐ I said there’s no talk

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,710
for love in your life.
‐ That’s right.

18
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:43,544
Could you tell me what‐‐
‐ The nerve!

19
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,707
‐ Type of object it is?

20
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,296
Mm, sorry, could you
say that one more time?

21
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,971
‐ You don’t know anything!

22
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,719
It’s not like I was
the least popular girl

23
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:51,971
in school, you know!

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,342
(Forte growling)
‐ Whatever you say.

25
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,058
‐ Everyone, an
unidentified flying object

26
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,811
has been spotted
in the Law Sector.

27
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,231
Deploy immediately!

28
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,639
‐ What, that’s too bad!

29
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,227
’Cause I was just
gonna straighten out

30
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,022
the irritating know‐it‐all
about my love life.

31
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:08,567
But, work is work, I guess,
so, we better get going.

32
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,072
‐ [Normad] You’ve
never had a love life.

33
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,855
‐ [Forte] And you have?

34
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,567
(coughs) What are
we looking for?

35
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,327
‐ It’s kind of strange,
we’re looking for dice.

36
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,911
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

37
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:25,998
(engines roaring)
(alarm blares)

38
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:32,126
("Galaxy Bang!
Bang!" by Angel‐tai)

39
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,813
(singing in foreign language)

40
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,918
‐ [Milefeulle] Tear‐flavored
Missile Rice Bowl.

41
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,144
‐ It really is a dice.

42
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,851
Alright, fire!

43
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,102
(zapping)

44
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,846
(beeping)

45
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,575
(computer blares)

46
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,406
(dramatic music)

47
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,794
(Forte grunts)
(zapping)

48
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,052
(Ranpha and Milfeulle gasp)
(hands clap)

49
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,894
(computer beeps)
(Mint gulps)

50
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,561
(Mint gasps)
‐ Huh?

51
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,310
(Milfeulle gasps and yells)

52
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:53,148
(Vanilla and Normad grunt)
(crash)

53
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,403
(electricity zapping)

54
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,239
‐ We didn’t even
put a dent in it.

55
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,964
How’s Vanilla doing?

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,290
‐ [Mint] She’s stable
now, miraculously,

57
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,666
she got away with
minor injuries.

58
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,592
‐ [Forte] I see.

59
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,958
‐ Is the object still
on the same track?

60
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,759
‐ [Mint] It looks that way.

61
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:22,263
It’s coming toward us.
(computer beeping)

62
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,305
‐ I wish we could do
something, but I have no ideas.

63
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,443
All we can do is wait
and hope for the best.

64
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,059
‐ Wrong!
‐ Huh?

65
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,936
‐ There is a way to
defeat the Q‐Cube.

66
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,274
‐ [All] What?!

67
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,819
‐ How exactly?
‐ Oh!

68
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,322
‐ Wait a minute!

69
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,074
Hey, Normad, how do you know
that thing’s name anyway?!

70
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,316
‐ That thing is a Q‐Cube,

71
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,910
I guess you don’t
remember too well, do you?

72
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,414
‐ You knew that
and said nothing?!

73
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,167
‐ [Normad] One thing I knew
was you’d pull that gun again.

74
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,591
‐ Oh.
‐ That’s 2,071 times now.

75
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,959
(Normad laughs)
(Forte grunts)

76
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,008
It’s about time you knew
what I’m about to tell you.

77
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,096
Q‐Cubes have been roaming
the universe for ages

78
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,929
with one ultimate purpose.

79
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,064
You could say they’re the human
species’ ultimate nemesis.

80
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,942
Long before mankind
came into existence,

81
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,690
the Q‐Cubes anticipated
your civilization

82
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,115
reaching outer space,

83
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,281
and they became
determined to destroy it.

84
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,492
All I can pick up from it

85
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,490
is its complete
hatred of humanity.

86
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,526
You guys don’t realize

87
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,948
that you’re just not
welcome in space.

88
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,325
It’s an indication that
the will of the cosmos

89
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,504
is to exist without you.

90
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,713
The weapon designed to
destroy the Q‐Cube was made,

91
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,345
a T2R2000 missile.

92
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,881
My artificial intelligence
will not register

93
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,506
with the Q‐Cube as human.

94
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,431
Therefore, I can get close to it

95
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,140
without being noticed
and attack it.

96
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,101
So, you must return
me to my missile.

97
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,524
There’s no other
way to deal with it.

98
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,150
(laughs) What’s the matter?

99
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,614
‐ But what’s gonna
happen to you then?

100
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,442
‐ Oh, that’s not a big deal.

101
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,647
You’ll just be firing
me off with my missile.

102
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,527
Standard procedure, that’s all!

103
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,034
‐ [Forte] I don’t like it.

104
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,326
‐ Forte.
(Forte growls)

105
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,620
‐ What is the matter with
the people who built you?!

106
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,045
They made you able to talk to us

107
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,754
and understand our feelings,
but then, when the time comes,

108
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,706
you can become
completely emotionless

109
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,554
and just go out and
blow yourself up?!

110
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,881
It’s awful!

111
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,474
I don’t care what anyone thinks!

112
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,719
There’s no way I’ll‐‐

113
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,552
‐ You humans aren’t
very smart, are you?

114
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,806
‐ What?
‐ This is the only way

115
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,099
you’re gonna save your lives
and it’s quick and easy.

116
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,774
Why would you even think
of trying to stop me?

117
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,940
Don’t you people
wanna save yourselves?

118
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,035
Your foolishness is
really hard to understand.

119
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:47,115
(Milfeulle cries)
(melancholy music)

120
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:55,754
You will return me to
my missile, won’t you?

121
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,258
What is everyone so sad about?

122
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,971
Things will just return to
the way they were before.

123
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,393
I’m simply going to take
care of the problem,

124
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:15,352
so, you can all sit
back and take it easy.

125
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,849
There’s no relying
on the abilities

126
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,308
of low‐intelligent
life forms like you.

127
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,940
Just watch me deal with
this once and for all.

128
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,874
(computer beeping and blaring)

129
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,329
‐ The missile has been launched.

130
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,121
Trajectory is good,
it will make contact

131
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,794
with the target in five
minutes and 46 seconds.

132
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:42,884
(Mint sighs)
(Ranpha sighs)

133
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,547
(doors whirring)

134
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,273
‐ Oh, Vanilla.
(Ranpha gasps)

135
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,278
(gunshots banging)

136
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,204
(gun clicking)

137
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:24,092
(computer beeping)
(lens whirring)

138
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,761
(bells chime)

139
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,265
‐ The target’s been hit.
(Ranpha gasps)

140
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,524
It’s been completely destroyed.

141
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,067
(door whirring)
‐ Is it over yet?

142
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,280
‐ Yes, we were successful.

143
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,239
The Q‐Cube has been destroyed.

144
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,861
‐ We were successful, you say?

145
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,871
Our friend, Normad,
has been sacrificed

146
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,869
and you call that a success?

147
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,413
‐ It’s a success to
preserve and protect

148
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,667
what is most important, to the
point of giving up his life.

149
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,749
Well, Normad was
originally designed

150
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,206
to fulfill that very
mission, wasn’t he?

151
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,555
After all, he was just
a T2R2000 missile.

152
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,472
‐ Oh, Forte.
‐ Weren’t you, Normad?

153
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,302
Weren’t you?

154
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,604
‐ [Normad] What
sentimental bullshit.

155
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,055
‐ (all gasp and scream)
‐ Who was that?

156
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,766
‐ No, that couldn’t
possibly have been him!

157
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,899
‐ You heard me.
(Ranpha and Forte scream)

158
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,364
I said, what
sentimental bullshit.

159
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,415
‐ Wait a second, how
could you still be alive?!

160
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,530
‐ Huh?
‐ Didn’t you blow yourself up

161
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,947
along with the missile?!

162
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,077
‐ [Ranpha] How did
you get back here?!

163
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,752
‐ [Normad] What, didn’t
Colonel Volcott tell you?

164
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,541
‐ Oh, but I, I thought
I told you. (laughs)

165
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,917
I just made a copy of
the piloting system

166
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,756
and installed that
in the missile.

167
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,381
Then, I re‐installed
Normad back into his body.

168
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,427
I thought everybody
knew. (laughs)

169
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,675
Come on, didn’t I tell you all?

170
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,636
Well, I meant to tell you.

171
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,388
Didn’t you, let’s see...

172
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,768
‐ Think, if all you have to
do is navigate the missile

173
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,398
to its target, there’s
really no reason

174
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,653
why I should have to
go along for the ride.

175
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,408
It can be controlled
remotely with a program.

176
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,619
‐ Remote control?

177
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,530
‐ Well, it was quite
tricky, actually.

178
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,948
I’ve never piloted anything
by remote control before.

179
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,787
And since there’s so much
digital information focused

180
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,505
on that task, there’s nothing
left for my speech circuit.

181
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,786
I’m not used to being
speechless, you know.

182
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,550
When I think about it, it
might have been much easier

183
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,722
for me to out in a blaze
of glory with my missile.

184
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,063
Hmm, what’s the matter?

185
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,019
Why are you all staring
at me like that?

186
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,142
‐ You’re contemptible!

187
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,647
You don’t care about
all the grieving

188
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,310
we did for you, do you?!

189
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,727
‐ To tell you the truth,

190
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,985
all that noise you were making

191
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,686
only made it harder
to concentrate.

192
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,898
I wanted to say something,
but if I told you, I‐‐

193
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,317
(gunshots explode)

194
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,825
Why are you so angry?

195
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,236
I keep you telling you
that it’s not a big deal!

196
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,325
‐ Just shut up and you can
stop sucking up to us now!

197
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,163
‐ Normad, more Q‐Cubes are
heading in our direction.

198
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,460
‐ [Forte And Ranpha] What?!

199
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,921
‐ [Volcott] This time,
there’s 16 of them!

200
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,002
‐ [All] Oh no!

201
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,548
‐ You sure look worried.

202
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,671
They don’t have a chance
against a machine like me.

203
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,878
‐ They don’t?
‐ Copy more programs

204
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,089
into some missiles
and let ’em have it.

205
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,598
‐ Right.
(doorbell rings)

206
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,641
(missiles whistle)

207
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,814
‐ You can tell how much
they hate humanity.

208
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,148
They haven’t changed
a bit over the ages.

209
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,363
These Q‐Cubes can
show up anywhere.

210
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,775
They’re such pests.

211
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,032
(Forte and Ranpha quiver)
I knew it was the

212
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,035
time of the year when
we’d see more of them.

213
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,525
‐ [Forte] Like insects?

214
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,028
‐ [Volcott] I finished
copying the data.

215
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,948
‐ [Normad] Thank you, can
you make a dozen more?

216
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,118
‐ [Volcott] Certainly.

217
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,496
‐ [Forte and Ranpha]
A dozen more?!

218
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,213
‐ Well, thank goodness our
Normad is safe and sound!

219
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,134
‐ Yeah, right!

220
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,052
What’s with this stupid story?!

221
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,342
(Milfeulle laughs)

222
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,843
‐ [Milfeulle] A stupid story.

223
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,431
‐ [Ranpha] What’s the
matter, all of a sudden?

224
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,682
‐ [Mint] Something’s
wrong with me?

225
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,102
‐ [Forte] Do you have a fever?

226
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,562
‐ Yes!
‐ Did you eat something

227
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,140
at lunch?
‐ I did!

228
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,445
‐ Does it hurt anywhere?
‐ Yes, it hurts!

229
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,150
‐ [Ranpha] I see you
overdid yourself.

230
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,899
‐ It’s not good.
‐ I can do it.

231
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,730
‐ Are you sure?
‐ Uh‐huh!

232
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,065
("Horoscope Rhapsody")
