1
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,521
(Galaxy Angel Theme)

2
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,398
‐ Angel Dark Space Chazuke

3
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:53,487
‐ I can’t think
like this! (yelling)

4
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,164
‐ That’s the seventh time
you’ve said that now.

5
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,703
‐ Oh, is that right?

6
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,294
‐ Yes and it’s only been 14
minutes and seven seconds

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,410
since you began.
You sure lack focus.

8
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,339
This air smells great.

9
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,961
‐ I had no idea we were so
behind in updating our database

10
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,378
‐ Just get on it!

11
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,466
‐ It’s no surprise.

12
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,970
We were out on missions
for a long time.

13
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,972
‐ Investigative reports.
Expense receipts.

14
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,435
Maintenance reports.

15
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,564
Processing for the
lost technology.

16
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,892
What?

17
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,886
Details of reception
party for new member.

18
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,808
From when Milfeulle
first joined us.

19
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,437
Who forgot this?

20
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,943
‐ Sorry. That was my fault.

21
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,075
‐ And you’re still gonna
bill the brigade for that?

22
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,152
‐ Hi, Everyone!

23
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,646
‐ Huh?

24
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,698
‐ I’ve just made some tea. How
would you like a break now?

25
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,084
‐ Well, aren’t you carefree?

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,580
‐ Is your report been
taking care of yet? If we

27
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,212
don’t all sort this business
out today. It will have

28
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,581
to come off our pay.
Do you understand me?

29
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,416
‐ Oh, I’ve already
submitted my expense report.

30
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,343
‐ What?

31
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,668
(tea pouring)

32
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,468
‐ You can’t just throw
it together like that!

33
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,511
Any mistakes and it will

34
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,006
be sent back to you!

35
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,427
‐ Hmm, well it looks to me
like everything’s in order.

36
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,025
I don’t see any problems here.

37
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,814
‐ Really?

38
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,395
(laughing)

39
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,692
‐ I can help you with
yours afterwards. How about

40
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,776
we stop for some tea now?

41
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,782
‐ What’s with you
all of a sudden?

42
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,533
‐ Could you be getting a fever?

43
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,195
‐ Or maybe you’ve
eaten some bad food?

44
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,123
‐ What is it?

45
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,661
‐ Something strange is going on!

46
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,874
‐ Are you feeling any pain?
Something’s just not right.

47
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,125
‐ Are you sure you’re okay?

48
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,666
‐ It seems to me
you’re not yourself.

49
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,170
‐ [Crew] What?

50
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,922
‐ You’re nothing but a fake.
You’re just pretending to

51
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,756
be Milfeulle.

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,800
Aren’t you?

53
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,304
‐ Oh, right! That
explains it then.

54
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,846
‐ Of course, that’s what
it is! A fake. That’s what

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,720
you are (laughs)

56
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,404
‐ And since that’s the
case, I hereby put you under

57
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,572
arrest. (snaps)

58
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,401
‐ Okay!

59
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,615
(marching footsteps)

60
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,658
‐ But Colonel, isn’t
this going a bit too far?

61
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,455
‐ No, the Angel Brigade
is part of the military.

62
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,080
For security reasons, we
must guard ourselves against

63
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,577
all imposters.

64
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,589
‐ I’m not so sure I understand
where you’re coming from.

65
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,879
‐ Tell us! Who were those guys

66
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,172
and where did they take her?

67
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,755
‐ So that Milfeulle
was an imposter?

68
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,222
‐ I’ll show you.

69
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,224
‐ What?

70
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,814
‐ Believe it or not,
this is the real

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,640
Milfeulle Sakuraba.

72
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,846
‐ [Crew] She’s so different!

73
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,063
‐ Her visual imaging
data was somehow

74
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,444
mistakenly sent to

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,690
another department

76
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,272
and only arrived at our
headquarters yesterday.

77
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,937
‐ But do you think you can
say, based on this data alone

78
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,067
that the Milfeulle that’s
been with us all along

79
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,204
is a phony?

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,610
‐ Yeah! That’s right!

81
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,028
Maybe she just got a
little thinner in the face.

82
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,526
‐ Or had surgery.

83
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,158
‐ Quite doubtful. The DNA
tests show conclusively that

84
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,498
she can’t possibly
be the same person.

85
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,964
(crew gasps)

86
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,883
‐ Does that mean we’ve
been working with a fraud

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,550
in our midst all this time?

88
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,709
‐ [Colonel] That’s
what it means.

89
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,798
‐ [Mint] I’d like to know
where the real Milfeulle is.

90
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:01,724
Right now.

91
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,761
‐ [Colonel] Her
location is unknown

92
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,636
but we are doing our best

93
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,604
to find her.

94
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,811
‐ [Mint] Accepting a new member

95
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,021
without her proper documents?

96
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,982
That’s a dereliction of duty.

97
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,151
‐ [Colonel] I’m sorry. I never
imagined that a fellow Angel

98
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,571
could have been an imposter.

99
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,479
‐ [Mint] You know, I
understand how you feel but...

100
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,648
‐ [Normad] The totality
of her empty headiness

101
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,029
was definitely not natural.

102
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,539
(soft music playing)

103
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,626
‐ What do you think
will happen to her?

104
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,420
‐ Who knows?

105
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,634
‐ Spying is a serious crime.
She’d be lucky to get a

106
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,755
life sentence.

107
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,342
‐ But that’s too harsh!

108
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,096
Milfeulle isn’t a trouble
maker in any sense of the word.

109
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,059
‐ The moment she joined
the military under false

110
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,731
pretenses she committed
a grave offense.

111
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,231
‐ Those who break the
law must pay for it.

112
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,363
‐ Vanilla’s absolutely right!

113
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,070
She is accountable.

114
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,532
‐ She could get
the death penalty.

115
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,032
‐ [Crew] What?

116
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,032
‐ Why you! Can’t you just
keep your mouth shut?

117
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,315
(Yelling)

118
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,789
What’s the matter? I
said answer me you!

119
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:22,047
(heavy breathing)

120
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,223
(crying)

121
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,559
‐ [Guard] Huh? What do you want?

122
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,765
(alarms sounding)

123
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,230
‐ There’s a small shuttle
craft on deck D‐22.

124
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,238
We’re gonna head
straight for it.

125
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,740
‐ Why are you helping me escape?

126
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,412
‐ Hey, over here!

127
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,488
‐ Don’t ask me anything.

128
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,835
It will be better that way!

129
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,080
‐ What do you mean?

130
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,661
‐ If I start thinking
about this too much

131
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,366
I might regret it later.

132
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,206
‐ Huh?

133
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,040
‐ And...

134
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,544
‐ Yes?

135
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,286
‐ Don’t ask me what my name
is or where I’ve come from

136
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,129
okay?

137
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,253
‐ Ah, okay!

138
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,629
‐ [Guard] Stop!

139
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,135
Now, slowly put your
hands on the wall

140
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,099
and I mean slowly

141
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,471
‐ So this is it.

142
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,479
‐ [Forte] Ah, I see you!
That’s it. You’re finished now!

143
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,562
Ha! Come here you
retched rodent!

144
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,806
‐ What the?

145
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,939
‐ You can’t run anyway
that I can’t find you!

146
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:25,324
Don’t think you can get away
from me, you little rat!

147
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,235
Oops, he stopped.

148
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,452
(windup toy cranks)

149
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,911
Alright! You’re
still in my sights.

150
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,162
I see you!

151
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,695
‐ That’s Forte!

152
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,287
‐ No it isn’t. She’s just a
mouse hunter doing her job.

153
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,213
‐ Stop!

154
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,133
What the hell?

155
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,301
Get out of here!

156
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,300
‐ Was that Vanilla?

157
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,684
‐ That was just a seeker
on her spiritual path.

158
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,644
‐ Stop!

159
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,643
(Chicken clucking)

160
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,057
‐ Who was that?

161
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,978
‐ Don’t ask me. I
don’t have a clue!

162
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,695
‐ I guess I’ll have to
submit a report for this too.

163
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,535
‐ Hurry!

164
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,369
‐ Alright

165
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,418
‐ What’s the hold up?
Just get out of here now!

166
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,132
‐ But I want to
say thanks, Ranpha.

167
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,223
‐ Mmmm. Hey, I’m just a
mysterious mask‐wearing soldier

168
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,762
who saw you needed some help.

169
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,885
‐ Is she gone?

170
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,139
‐ Yeah.

171
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,478
‐ Well, that girl sure
is quite the character.

172
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,654
‐ It was quite tricky
getting her on her way.

173
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,193
‐ I’ve always wished I could
figure out what makes her

174
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,738
tick.

175
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,992
‐ Even a computer
couldn’t figure her out.

176
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:55,952
‐ [Milfeulle] Oh, my goodness.
What in space are all of you

177
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,246
doing here?

178
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,960
‐ [Crew] Ahhhhhhhh!!!

179
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,999
‐ [Ranpha] I’m
confused! What are you?

180
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,882
Where did you? What
the? I don’t get it.

181
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,379
‐ I thought she was
on the shuttle craft.

182
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,384
‐ I’m absolutely
sure she got on it.

183
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,054
What are you doing here?

184
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,302
‐ Just listen to my
story! When I went to the

185
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,014
grocery store this
morning to do the shopping

186
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,264
for the Brigade

187
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,177
some weird people
started chasing me.

188
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,354
It was scary!

189
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,722
And then I got totally lost!

190
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,560
‐ What are you saying?

191
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,765
‐ Well, I did get some
shopping done before

192
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,186
I went on duty.

193
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,732
So we have enough
supplies to tide us over.

194
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,527
Please don’t be angry with me.

195
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,069
We’ve got food for the week.

196
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,402
‐ That’s not what I mean!

197
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,818
You were working on the database

198
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,325
with us this morning, right?

199
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,616
‐ Oh? Was I really?

200
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,701
‐ Yes you were!

201
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,584
‐ Oh, I see.

202
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,831
‐ So, do you get it?

203
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,081
‐ But who was the one
doing the shopping then?

204
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,545
‐ Well, not anyone I know!

205
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,713
‐ What? Not anyone
that you know?

206
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,592
‐ That’s not what I meant!

207
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,038
‐ What’s happening here?

208
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,748
‐ It might sound crazy,
but I believe she’s telling

209
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,668
the truth.

210
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,721
‐ Then you’re saying that
this is the real Milfeulle?

211
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,511
‐ No, to be accurate the
other one wasn’t Milfeulle.

212
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,101
‐ Beauty! I Vanilla Ash
of the Angel Brigade shall

213
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,147
hereby perform a DNA
test match on the subject

214
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,271
in question.

215
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,148
‐ [Computer Voice] DNA
match. It is confirmed that

216
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,027
the subject is
Milfeulle Sakuraba.

217
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,453
‐ What? That test can’t
possibly prove it!

218
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,333
‐ But what about her picture?

219
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,450
‐ Oh, my picture? What
a hassle that was!

220
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,827
I was in such a rush that
morning to get it taken

221
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,286
but the machine in the
studio was so old that

222
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,876
it almost took 30 minutes to

223
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,170
scan my face.

224
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,004
‐ You mean this is actually you?

225
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,510
‐ That’s right.

226
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,131
‐ Then tell us, why doesn’t
your photo look like you?

227
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,007
‐ Oh, they said they wanted
a very recent picture.

228
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,807
So I thought I’d just
leave it until that day.

229
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,432
‐ And what happened? Did
you suddenly get sick?

230
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,808
‐ Yes, it might
look a little funny.

231
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:46,897
But it is me.

232
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,650
I promise. It really is.

233
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,781
‐ Do you have the slightest
idea how much trouble

234
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,979
we went through today

235
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,108
because of our concern for you

236
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,494
and this mix up?

237
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,495
‐ Then who did we let out?

238
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,616
‐ The genuine fake is the
one you helped to escape.

239
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,873
‐ That’s what I
want to talk about.

240
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,497
‐ Colonel!

241
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,752
‐ Haha.

242
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,883
‐ So this girl here is
definitely the real one?

243
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,462
‐ Yes, your’re right. I know.

244
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,215
But we’ve also learned
that an extremely

245
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,838
important component
of the lost technology

246
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,265
was stolen from
the storage area.

247
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,761
‐ What? Don’ tell me she.....

248
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,143
‐ Listen, Angel Brigade!

249
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,813
‐ Hey, you’re the
"fake" Milfeulle!

250
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,983
‐ To think that you
fools were actually dumb

251
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,521
enough to help me
escape when I’m

252
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,266
the one you wanted in that cell.

253
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,316
(laughing)

254
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,190
[Crew] (surprised crying)

255
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,527
‐ And this is just a small
taste of things to come.

256
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,034
Next time you’re going to
see a lot more of the fake

257
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,326
Angel Brigade. So
I’m warning you now.

258
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,830
You better be prepared.

259
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,212
(laughing)

260
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,719
‐ But this is the last episode.

261
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,550
‐ It is?

262
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,844
‐ That’s right!

263
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,006
‐ [Forte] Hey, is
it really over?

264
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,553
‐ [Ranpha] No way!

265
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,097
‐ [Vanilla] Oh, come on.
We can’t end it like that.

266
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,222
‐ [Milfeulle] Oh, I can’t
wait for the next episode.

267
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,718
I wonder what’s going to happen.

268
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,559
Maybe there will be some
ancient robots or something.

269
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,603
‐ [Crew] We just told you!

270
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,437
This is the last one!

271
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,070
(theme song)
