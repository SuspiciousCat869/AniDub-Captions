1
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,682
‐ [Ranpha] Why do we
always get jobs like this?

2
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,638
Hey, are you listening, Vanilla?

3
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,686
(metal clangs)
(robotic arm whirs)

4
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,686
It must be God’s calling.

5
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,067
(robotic arm whirs)

6
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,165
Maybe I’ll find a diamond
ring or something.

7
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,323
‐ Hey, is this trash burnable?

8
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,658
Do you have any idea, Ranpha?

9
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,004
‐ Don’t ask me, I don’t know.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,290
‐ But it’s very important
to separate your trash.

11
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,135
(trash whooshes)
(Ranpha groans)

12
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,051
‐ What are you doing?

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,710
I can’t take this anymore.

14
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:47,797
(Milfeulle yells)

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,761
Shut up!

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,382
‐ [Milfeulle] No, please don’t.

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,679
(trash whooshing)

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,800
‐ [Ranpha] I’ve
had enough of you!

19
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,636
‐ [Milfeulle] Stop it!

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,470
No!

21
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,565
(Ranpha groans)

22
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,969
Hey, that’s not very nice.

23
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:57,847
Stop it!

24
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,143
Oh, ah, Ranpha!

25
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,067
(sirens blaring)

26
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,529
(ship whooshing)

27
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,150
(upbeat music)

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,460
(singing in foreign language)

29
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,397
‐ [Ranpha] Vanilla Flavored
Asteroid Trash Stir‐Fry.

30
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,577
‐ [Forte] To think
that the secret mission

31
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,619
of the Angel Brigade of
the Transbaal Empire Force

32
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,043
is separating trash.

33
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,173
‐ No kidding, some mission.

34
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,328
‐ [Mint] Hard to believe
the lost technology

35
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,839
is in this dump.

36
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,459
‐ According to the
intelligence department report

37
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,666
that’s the case.

38
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,218
‐ [Mint] But they’re
always messing up.

39
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,631
You think they’re right?

40
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,637
‐ Well, now, I can’t say.

41
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,219
‐ If we don’t find anything here

42
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,176
we’ll just pack all this
trash into a missile

43
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,346
and send it to them.

44
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,604
‐ [Ranpha] Forte,

45
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,854
I think I’ve got the
perfect thing for that.

46
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,146
‐ Hmm?

47
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,519
‐ [Ranpha] Vanilla just
found it with the trash.

48
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,691
‐ It’s not even listed
in the weapons catalog.

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,699
‐ Huh, I’ve never seen a
missile like this before either.

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,370
‐ Maybe this is it,
the lost technology.

51
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,369
‐ Really?

52
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,332
This thing?

53
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,246
‐ No way, it’s just
a dud, garbage.

54
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,712
Let’s get rid of it.

55
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,670
‐ Do you wanna take it apart?

56
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,880
‐ Okay.

57
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,381
‐ [Dud Missile] You
people are awful.

58
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,421
Maybe I’ll just blow
myself up right here.

59
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,627
‐ Who’s that?

60
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,635
‐ [Dud Missile]
It’s me, right here!

61
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,682
‐ Who’s there?

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,050
Come out from where
you’re hiding.

63
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,178
‐ You just don’t get it, do you?

64
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,730
Allow me to introduce myself.

65
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:50,399
I am MA347612890GT4078579132RF24

Normad.

70
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,959
That’s me.

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,120
It’s a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

72
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,668
‐ And you too, Mr. Missile.

73
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,672
‐ I am not a missile.

74
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,924
I am MA34761‐‐

75
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,919
‐ We got that.

76
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:17,967
What’s your outfit?

77
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,971
Where are you from?

78
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,472
And why are you in this dump?

79
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,804
Answer me!

80
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,885
Well?

81
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,137
‐ I miss the old days.

82
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,190
Women back then were
so reserved and sweet

83
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,690
and warm and gentle,
they really cared.

84
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,905
‐ What’s that?

85
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,324
‐ I don’t know if
I can go on living.

86
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,915
Maybe I should just blow up.

87
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,529
(all yelling)

88
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,446
(Volcott stammers)

89
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,286
‐ Stop and think if you can!

90
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,251
‐ You think I can’t?

91
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,449
I can!

92
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,580
‐ Mr. Missile, I
mean, Mr. Normad,

93
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,285
how about we just
talk this over?

94
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,959
I apologize for my
insolent subordinates.

95
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,798
‐ Well then, are you
the one in charge here?

96
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:00,765
‐ [Volcott] I am.

97
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,432
‐ I think we can get along.

98
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,891
These subordinates
must frustrate you.

99
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,311
‐ Well, you know.

100
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,101
‐ No need to hide it.

101
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:08,933
I can tell.

102
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:09,767
‐ Just wait a minute.

103
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,231
‐ Ranpha.

104
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,271
‐ [Normad] Think twice before
you talk to me like that.

105
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,146
‐ Forgive me, I’m sorry.

106
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,404
‐ You need to understand,

107
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,284
as a women you should
make a point of learning

108
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,991
a few things from Vanilla.

109
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:21,901
‐ [Forte] Why Vanilla?

110
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,108
‐ [Normad] Can’t you tell?

111
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,738
She’s quiet, restrained,
a wonderful lady.

112
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,656
‐ [Forte] She’s
just a kid, a kid!

113
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,914
‐ [Normad] Sounds
like envy to me.

114
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,825
‐ [Forte] Yeah, well,
you’re just a missile.

115
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,616
‐ [Normad] I am MA3476‐‐

116
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,037
(Volcott coughs)

117
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,337
‐ I think we should
continue this discussion.

118
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,422
So, Normad, how did
you end up in the dump?

119
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,928
‐ [Normad] I was picked up
while having myself a sleep

120
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,601
during a long voyage.

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,390
‐ A voyage?

122
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,644
‐ Yes.

123
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,183
I wasn’t happy in
the military anymore

124
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,097
so I set off on my own.

125
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,685
All by myself.

126
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,230
‐ (scoffs) Quite a story.

127
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,355
So in other words, you’re AWOL?

128
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,030
What a coward.

129
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,149
‐ [Normad] I had a hard
time coming to grips with it

130
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,776
and understanding who I am.

131
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,073
‐ Huh, what’s that?

132
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,617
What do you mean by that?

133
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,369
‐ [Normad] I suppose a crude
and violent person like you

134
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,543
wouldn’t understand.

135
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,791
‐ What you say?

136
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,331
‐ [Normad] I’m a missile.

137
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,004
When I hit my target I
blow up, that means I die.

138
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,592
‐ But a missile’s destiny
is to hit the enemy

139
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,634
and go up in a blaze of glory.

140
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,216
‐ [Normad] You think
it’s that easy?

141
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,052
I’ve worked hard and
learned many things.

142
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,177
I thought there was a
bright future for me,

143
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,184
but in the end all I
could look forward to

144
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,136
is a violent explosion.

145
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,846
Don’t you think that’s cruel?

146
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,187
‐ Yeah, that’s what missiles
are for, aren’t they?

147
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,653
‐ [Normad] But I
don’t want that.

148
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,033
I don’t want to die
in an explosion.

149
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,989
There must be a better
purpose for me in life.

150
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,780
That’s what I wanna find.

151
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,076
‐ Oh, Mr. Normad,
that’s beautiful.

152
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,580
‐ [Normad] Thank you.

153
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,870
How’d you like to get together
later and talk about life?

154
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,084
‐ I’d love to, but I’m
not good at conversation.

155
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,996
‐ [Normad] I hate you.

156
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,964
‐ He talks enough for two.

157
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,206
‐ What now?

158
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,956
We can’t put him
back in the dump.

159
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,719
‐ Maybe not, but he is an
AWOL missile after all.

160
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,090
The military might
have something to say.

161
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,219
‐ This is an issue best
left to a higher command.

162
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,846
‐ [Normad] This is so cruel.

163
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,723
So cruel!

164
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,928
I miss the old days,

165
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,728
everyone was so
sincere and gentle.

166
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,111
I should self destruct!
(lid pops)

167
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,730
(all gasping)

168
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,283
Just kidding, it was a joke.

169
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,111
Just a little joke.

170
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,245
(all sighing)

171
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,111
I have a lot of
knowhow and experience.

172
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,619
You might find me
useful to have around.

173
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,832
‐ That might be very true, but.

174
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,453
‐ This thing’s just
way too dangerous

175
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,037
for us to have lying around.

176
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,417
‐ Wait a minute.

177
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,959
(machine beeps)

178
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,467
‐ [Forte] I get it.

179
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,928
Take him apart and just keep
the computer chip, right?

180
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,259
‐ [Ranpha] We’ll put the
rest of him back in the trash

181
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,225
and there won’t be any evidence.

182
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,805
‐ Oh, Milfeulle.
‐ Huh?

183
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,312
‐ Do you see that big
button in front of you?

184
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,943
‐ Big button.

185
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,019
Button.

186
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,145
Ah, there it is.

187
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,149
‐ Did you push it?

188
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,574
‐ Yes, what now?

189
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,822
(missile beeps)

190
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,203
‐ [Normad] Switching
to self destruct mode.

191
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,781
Self destructing in one minute.

192
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,334
(all screaming)

193
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,660
‐ Why would a missile have a
self destruct device anyway?

194
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,117
‐ [Normad] My name
is not missile.

195
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,285
It is MA347‐‐

196
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,535
‐ Yes, we know!

197
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,287
Can we disconnect this thing?

198
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,957
‐ We should be able to stop
the self destruct mechanism

199
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,916
by cutting either the
red or blue lines.

200
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,047
They’re shown on the monitor
that’s attached to Normad.

201
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,796
(monitor beeping)

202
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,676
‐ This is your fault Milfeulle.

203
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,265
You’d better do something.

204
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,098
‐ But, what if I
cut the wrong one?

205
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:38,984
‐ It’ll explode.

206
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,520
‐ No, I can’t do it!

207
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,734
I’d only be guessing.

208
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,186
‐ Our lives are at stake.

209
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,185
You have no choice but to try.

210
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,399
‐ But I, oh!

211
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,569
(girls grunting)

212
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,408
All right, I’ll try.

213
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,663
‐ [Normad] 30 seconds
to self destruct.

214
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,045
(Milfeulle whimpers)

215
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,834
(intense music)

216
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,631
20 seconds.

217
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,966
‐ Do it, luck’s on your side.

218
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,759
(Milfeulle whimpers)

219
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:11,634
‐ What are you doing?

220
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,548
Hurry!

221
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,548
‐ Okay.

222
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,099
(monitor beeping)

223
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,894
‐ Once you choose just
click with the trackball.

224
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,807
(Milfeulle whimpers)

225
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,687
(intense music)

226
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,984
‐ [Normad] 10 seconds.

227
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:27,777
‐ Come on!

228
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,941
Hurry up and press it.

229
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:33,989
‐ Right, but, I
can’t move my finger.

230
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,829
‐ What?

231
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,329
‐ Five.
‐ What are you doing?

232
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,580
‐ If you don’t push it now.
‐ Listen to me, Milfeulle.

233
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,793
‐ [Normad] Four.

234
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,213
‐ Close your eyes and
picture a flower‐‐

235
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,079
‐ [Ranpha And Forte]
Don’t be afraid.

236
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,585
(monitor beeps)
‐ Three.

237
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,746
‐ What are the chance?

238
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,586
‐ [Normad] Two.

239
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,590
‐ Come on.

240
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,589
(girls gasp)

241
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,422
‐ [Normad] One.

242
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,126
Just do it, push it!

243
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:55,256
(monitor beeps)
(energy whooshes)

244
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,971
‐ What happened?

245
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,940
(monitor beeping)

246
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,771
(Milfeulle gasps)

247
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:07,728
Vanilla.

248
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,158
(all sighing)

249
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,410
‐ [Normad] The self destruct
device has been stopped.

250
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,492
(light piano music)

251
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,076
Thank you, Vanilla.

252
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,051
Checkmate.

253
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,549
‐ 137 losses in a row.

254
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,887
‐ No point in playing again.

255
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,469
How many times you wanna lose?

256
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,348
I’m sorry for taking away
your only joy in life.

257
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,269
(chip whooshes)

258
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,482
‐ I’ve got a body for you.

259
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,522
Much better than doing
nothing, isn’t it?

260
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,395
(Ranpha grunts)

261
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,944
‐ [Normad] Workouts?

262
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,107
‐ Would you just
stop complaining?

263
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,406
(chip whooshes)

264
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,490
‐ Yeah, you’re lucky,
this’ll make it easier.

265
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,827
(Normad rattles)

266
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,715
‐ [Normad] I hate menial work.

267
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,922
(Mint laughs)

268
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,212
(chip whooshes)

269
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,918
‐ Have I got a body for you!

270
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,337
‐ [Normad] I’ll
pass on that one.

271
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,517
‐ [Forte] Well,
what do you think?

272
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,562
These are the only two body
types we have left for you.

273
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,977
‐ Although they’re
stuffed animals.

274
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:29,903
‐ [Forte] Well?

275
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,145
‐ [Normad] All
right, I’ve decided.

276
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,407
Thank you, Vanilla.

277
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,994
I really like this new body.

278
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,701
I knew right away
when we first met

279
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,247
that we could definitely
become good friends.

280
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,581
I hope we have a long
and happy friend.

281
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,707
(Normad grunts)

282
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,923
Oh, my, my.

283
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,383
Don’t worry that
didn’t hurt at all.

284
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,553
You truly are
wonderful, Vanilla.

285
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,802
You’re like Venus herself.

286
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,642
‐ [Milfeulle] I’ve
made some tea.

287
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,890
‐ [Ranpha] So you’re
telling us that your life‐‐

288
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,141
‐ [Milfeulle] I’ve
made some tea.

289
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,393
‐ [Ranpha] Oh no, they
slipped him poison.

290
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,644
‐ [Milfeulle] I’ve
made some tea.

291
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,385
‐ [Ranpha] It can only
be a test from God.

292
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,848
‐ I’ve made some tea.
‐ A rich husband!

293
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,571
(upbeat music)

294
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,754
(singing in foreign language)
