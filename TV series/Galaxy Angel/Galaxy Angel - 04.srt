1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,097
(engine revving)

2
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,193
(upbeat cheerful music)

3
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:34,195
(singing in a foreign language)

4
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,477
‐ [Narrator] Assorted angel
fruits shipped direct.

5
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,529
‐ [Ranpha] Yahoo!

6
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,740
Wooho.

7
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,992
Yahoo.

8
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,115
‐ Ranpha’s sure having
an awful lot of fun.

9
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,542
‐ Well, I’m not surprised.

10
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,789
‐ You know, the Kincaid Company

11
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,371
is one of the biggest
construction firms

12
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,335
in the entire Milky Way galaxy.

13
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,037
‐ And to think they’ve got
such a young president too.

14
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,206
‐ Hi, handsome!

15
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,054
(smooching)

16
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,720
‐ But why would the president
of a large construction firm

17
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,299
have someone threaten his life?

18
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,142
‐ Well, I’m sure there
much be a good reason.

19
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,311
‐ It can only be
a test from God.

20
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,642
(smooching)

21
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,939
‐ Well, whatever.

22
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,307
The most important thing here

23
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,147
is that we have been assigned
as his bodyguards, right?

24
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,985
‐ Oh, but if I could
just catch his eye

25
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,530
I know a great romance would
blossom, and maybe marriage!

26
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,410
Oh, my!

27
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,620
‐ So what’s the problem?

28
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,502
I got something on my face?

29
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,041
(gasping)

30
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,245
‐ You’re not the president of
the Kincaid Company, are you?

31
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,385
‐ Yes, Jim Kincaid, president
of the Kincaid Company.

32
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,089
‐ But, what about this?

33
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,094
‐ Oh, that’s a picture
from my younger days.

34
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,598
Hope, did you send
them the wrong picture?

35
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,811
‐ I’m very sorry
sir, my mistake.

36
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,104
‐ So much for that idea.

37
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,016
‐ Fallen out of love now?

38
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,525
‐ You’ve gotta be kidding.

39
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,356
I’m still an innocent young
girl with a very bright future.

40
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,744
‐ So, Mr. Kincaid,
you’re telling us

41
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,701
that your life has
been threatened?

42
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,032
‐ Aha, I got a very
disturbing letter

43
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,196
that said that they
were going to kill me.

44
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,413
‐ Oh no, they slipped
him some poison.

45
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,959
‐ Hope!

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,040
You’ve gone and put salt in
my coffee instead of sugar!

47
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,417
‐ I’m very sorry
sir, my mistake.

48
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,956
‐ So you really are
being threatened, sir?

49
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,132
‐ [Allan] Aha.

50
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,348
The Angel Brigade of the
Transvaal Imperial Forces, huh?

51
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,272
‐ [Jim] What do you think?

52
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,061
Isn’t it a beautiful planet?

53
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,104
‐ [Milfeulle] Yes, I’d love
to live in a place like this!

54
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,309
‐ [Ranpha] You
couldn’t afford to

55
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,227
on your meager Angel
Brigade salary.

56
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,897
‐ [Jim] I guess not.

57
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,315
(Jim laughing)

58
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,992
This planet is being
developed as a giant resort.

59
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,741
The construction should be
complete in about one month.

60
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,736
I’ve just come to
take a look around.

61
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,919
‐ [Forte] Any idea who may
be attempting to kill you?

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,420
‐ [Jim] None at all, really.

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,590
And what reason would
they have to do that?

64
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,967
‐ Does anyone hate you for
personal reasons perhaps?

65
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,050
‐ Hm, I can’t think of anyone.

66
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,725
‐ Well, let’s not worry
about that right now.

67
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,813
We just need to do our job
and make sure he’s protected.

68
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,061
‐ [Hope] What?

69
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,484
‐ What’s going on, Hope?

70
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,023
‐ I’m losing control here.

71
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,944
‐ What?

72
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,938
Oh, Hope, stop the launch.

73
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,567
‐ It’s too late.

74
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,282
‐ Aren’t you my bodyguards?

75
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,912
You’ve got to do something.

76
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,159
‐ Yes but what.

77
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,537
(Hope groaning)

78
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,170
‐ [Hope] We’ve leveled off.

79
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,745
‐ Well, it looks like someone

80
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,298
has been tampering
with the computer.

81
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,972
‐ [Forte] It seems that
these threats on your life

82
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,472
are real after all.

83
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,973
‐ Mr. Kincaid, are you sure

84
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,269
you can’t think
of anyone at all?

85
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,982
‐ [Jim] No, not at all.

86
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,265
‐ [Ranpha] What is it this time?

87
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,517
‐ [Milfeulle] It looks
like we’ve stopped.

88
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,940
‐ I think we know that much.

89
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,237
‐ At times like this, all
it takes is one good whack!

90
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,118
‐ [Milfeulle] Oh,
no, you broke it!

91
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,160
‐ [Ranpha] What were
you thinking, Forte?

92
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,195
‐ Well, I think that we want
to open these doors, don’t we?

93
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,170
(gasping)

94
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,130
‐ [Milfeulle] All
right, they’re opening.

95
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,840
‐ [Mint] Well, Forte is strong.

96
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,339
‐ Huh, this walkway is probably
going to break down next.

97
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,635
‐ At least we’d be
able to walk from here.

98
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,009
What’s up, Mint?

99
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,716
‐ I feel as though
somebody’s been watching us.

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,730
‐ What?
‐ What’s the matter?

101
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,904
‐ [Milfeulle] That
chandelier’s moving.

102
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,811
It looks a bit dangerous to me.

103
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,531
‐ You think it’s gonna fall?

104
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,491
No way!

105
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,863
(screaming)

106
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,699
Oh, look, it really
did come down.

107
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,240
‐ [Milfeulle] Oh no, we
could get electrocuted.

108
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,710
‐ I’m awfully sorry
about all this.

109
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,541
‐ [Ranpha] Hey,
it’s not your fault.

110
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,205
‐ Oh no, another one!

111
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,634
(screaming)

112
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,221
‐ Why is this happening?

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,390
‐ [Forte] Sir, maybe we
should go back to the offices.

114
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,135
‐ Yeah, this is dangerous.

115
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,805
‐ No, I’ve got to
make my inspections.

116
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,405
Hope, where are we going next?

117
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,271
‐ We will be heading
to the atmosphere plant

118
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,268
in 30 minutes, Mr. Kincaid.

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,860
‐ But sir, what if there’s
more trouble up ahead?

120
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,664
‐ I hired you precisely in
case something were to happen.

121
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,414
‐ Excuse me.

122
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,084
I’ve made us all some nice tea.

123
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,252
‐ [Hope] My, my.

124
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,040
‐ Hey, what do you
think we’re doing here?

125
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,252
‐ I’ve got orange pekoe
from Planet Monde,

126
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,129
and homemade cake
for you all to enjoy!

127
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,422
‐ I’ll try some.

128
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,008
Mm, delicious!

129
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,919
‐ My pleasure.

130
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,259
‐ Too much.

131
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,934
What’s this?

132
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,722
‐ [Ranpha] This
looks like trouble.

133
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,429
‐ Hey, there, robot.

134
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,436
That’s fantastic work
you’re doing over there.

135
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,401
‐ Look out.

136
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,146
‐ Argh, darn.

137
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,202
‐ Milfeulle, what are you doing?

138
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,485
‐ My tea set from Planet Guinea.

139
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,870
‐ Just get over here!

140
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,504
‐ It was expensive.

141
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,764
(screaming)

142
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,760
‐ Look out.

143
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,932
(screaming)

144
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,466
‐ [Ranpha] Why are
they coming after us?

145
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,807
Shouldn’t they be
going after Kincaid?

146
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,313
‐ Ranpha, I can barely keep up.

147
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,516
My feet are hurting right now.

148
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,727
‐ Just shut up and
don’t stop running.

149
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,655
‐ [Man] Target A
has entered Area 23.

150
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,903
Target B is headed
toward Area 18.

151
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,860
‐ [Allan] All right,
I’m going, too!

152
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,989
(panting)

153
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,879
‐ [Milfeulle] Maybe we can
escape by getting on that.

154
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,003
‐ [Ranpha] That sounds
like a good idea!

155
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,006
‐ Do you know how
to drive this thing?

156
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,972
‐ Oh, I think I can
probably figure it out.

157
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,392
(screaming)

158
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,193
‐ Hey, what’s happening?

159
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,312
We’re nothing but sitting
ducks in this thing.

160
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,398
Is there a weapon onboard?

161
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,565
‐ This looks like
it could be one.

162
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,534
‐ Give it to me!

163
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,204
(Ranpha groaning)

164
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,988
(screaming)

165
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,578
No, there’s a million of them.

166
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,078
‐ Look, a button, that’s it.

167
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,723
‐ The atmosphere
transformation plant.

168
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,803
‐ Oh, no, it’s Allan.

169
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,595
‐ Don’t you move!

170
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,603
‐ Look out, they’re
still after us.

171
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,395
‐ Don’t you think it’s
strange that the culprit

172
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,227
always seems to know exactly
where we’re going to go next?

173
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,733
‐ What are you getting at?

174
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,074
‐ Mr. Hope, aren’t you the
one who’s been managing

175
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,190
every aspect of Mr.
Kincaid’s schedule?

176
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,147
‐ Well, yes, of course.

177
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,407
(laughing)

178
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,239
‐ Hope has nothing
to do with this.

179
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,414
The culprit is up in that ship.

180
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,245
‐ [Girls] What?

181
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,084
‐ What is going on, here?

182
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,550
‐ Meet my grandson, Allan.

183
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,919
‐ The one in the picture?

184
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,455
‐ Actually, I was lying to you

185
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,840
when I said that someone
was threatening my life.

186
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,716
‐ Lied?

187
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,682
‐ I wanted to test you.

188
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,802
‐ Test us?

189
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,260
‐ That’s right.

190
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,848
To find the most suitable bride
I could for my Allan here.

191
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,144
‐ [Milfeulle] Suitable bride?

192
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,558
‐ There are many dangers
in this line of work.

193
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,726
We’ve been searching out

194
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,074
as many strong we women
like you as we can

195
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,149
to find Allan the best match.

196
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,276
‐ So, you’re gonna pick a bride
from among the five of us?

197
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,073
‐ Have you chosen
any other candidates

198
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,946
for this marriage to
Allan, besides us?

199
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:21,163
‐ Yes, about 500 have passed
the first phase of the test.

200
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,457
‐ Huh?

201
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,119
‐ So then, Allan,
what do you think

202
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,079
about the first
phase of the testing?

203
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,957
‐ Well, upon reviewing
the results of the test,

204
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,546
in terms of physical
and mental power,

205
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,512
I regret to say that one
of you did not qualify.

206
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,335
‐ Huh?

207
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,799
Just one didn’t make it?

208
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,637
‐ [Allan] As for the
ones who passed‐‐

209
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,434
‐ Now, just you wait a minute!

210
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:42,846
‐ Huh?

211
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,306
‐ We’ve all been listening
to you go on and on

212
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,515
about exactly what
it is that you want.

213
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,646
We have every bit as much
a choice in the matter

214
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,321
as you do, you know.

215
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,940
Now, I feel confident that I
have passed this first test.

216
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,028
But I’m sorry, I’m
turning you down.

217
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,200
‐ I believe I’ve passed as
well, but I’m passing on you.

218
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,619
‐ Excuse me.

219
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,286
‐ Well, I’m gonna go home now.

220
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,585
‐ That really pisses me off.

221
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,506
‐ Ranpha, you only
said that what you did

222
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,855
because you didn’t
want to find out

223
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,141
that you’d failed the test.

224
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,352
‐ And that goes for you, too.

225
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,523
(chuckling)

226
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,062
‐ How could you possibly
think that I failed?

227
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,516
‐ Or that I did.

228
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,305
(laughing)

229
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,187
‐ You know, Mint, I
can’t help but wonder

230
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,824
who it was that failed.

231
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,191
‐ Well, I guess
we’ll never know.

232
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,028
‐ Only God knows.

233
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,123
‐ Oh, who cares, anyway?

234
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,739
How about a race
back to the base?

235
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,077
The last one pays
for dinner, let’s go.

236
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,584
‐ That’s not fair, Ranpha.

237
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,415
‐ Here we go, Milfeulle,
hang on tight!

238
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,251
‐ Huh?

239
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,535
What?

240
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,047
Gee, I hope I’m not
the one that lost out.

241
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,601
You put the oil in after taking
the frying pan off the heat.

242
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,434
‐ [Ranpha] Milfeulle!

243
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,058
Get a grip, Milfeulle!

244
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,193
No, this can’t be.

245
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,729
Don’t die, don’t you die.

246
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,072
(soft playful music)

247
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:32,081
(singing in a foreign language)
