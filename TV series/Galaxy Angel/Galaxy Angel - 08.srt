1
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:13,932
(oven dings)

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,184
(playful music)

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,347
‐ First of all,

4
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,847
the most important
thing in making treats

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,767
is single‐minded devotion
during preparation.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,356
‐ Listen to me ladies.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,031
We do not have very
much time left here.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,780
Now, tell use where
the lost technology is!

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,163
‐ I’m really sorry
but I have absolutely

10
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,201
no idea where it is.

11
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,705
But, you know,

12
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,576
we might find it if we look
around the base one more time.

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,044
‐ Forget it.

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,582
We’re goin’ around and
around to places we’ve been.

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,827
What’s the point?

16
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,497
‐ I’m sure if we look
again we’ll find it.

17
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,955
Maybe we missed something?

18
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,085
‐ We did come her just
to mess around, you know.

19
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,054
‐ I may not look like
much, but don’t worry.

20
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,393
I happen to be a
very lucky girl.

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,639
(hand thuds))
(man grunts)

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,180
‐ But it’s not really
a question of luck.

23
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,564
‐ Well then maybe we an
all look for it together.

24
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,103
This lost whatchamacallit.

25
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,806
‐ Technology?

26
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,944
Come on then, it’s here
somewhere isn’t it?

27
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,404
‐ I’m rally sorry but I
have no idea where it is.

28
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,816
But ya know,

29
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,072
we might find it if
we look around the‐‐

30
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,525
‐ What’s wrong with you?

31
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,993
You’re repeating yourself!

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,953
Just tell me, why is
everything spinning?!

33
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,906
What’s going on?!

34
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,215
‐ [Vanilla] Healing
Holography: Chapter 12352.

35
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,880
‐ Being irritated is not
good for your health.

36
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,629
‐ God teaches us
that we must always

37
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,882
try to remain peaceful
in our hearts.

38
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,463
‐ [Normad] You guys
are kind of impatient.

39
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,590
(laser buzzes)
(Normad thuds)

40
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,757
‐ That’s one.

41
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,846
(sirens blaring)

42
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,768
(Galaxy Bang!
Bang!" by Angel‐tai)

43
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,618
(singing in foreign language)

44
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:09,023
‐ Milfeulle’s All‐Natural
Syrupy Inspection.

45
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,017
The next thing we
will be preparing

46
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,529
is the crust for the tart.

47
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,191
‐ And of course we
always use processed

48
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,107
artificial flavors
to give our rich,

49
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,856
tempting, and tantalizing taste.

50
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,159
This is an important
key as everyone

51
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,492
is easily fooled by
artificial flavors.

52
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,407
Sorry, my subordinate
did a terrible thing.

53
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,369
Please forgive him.

54
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,826
‐ Oh, it’s alright.

55
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,126
‐ But we do have a mission
we have to accomplish.

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,550
Officially this
really top secret.

57
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,422
But I feel it’s
necessary to give

58
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,379
you some of this
information anyway.

59
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,217
We are carrying on the struggle

60
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,552
to achieve universal
peace in space.

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,720
There are countless
conflicts in outer space.

62
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,479
Wars of planetary
domination, religious wars,

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,020
ethnic wars, lovers’ spats,
kids fighting over treats.

64
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,405
We are acting in secret
with the noblest of motives

65
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,495
to eliminate these conflicts.

66
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,279
And so in order to achieve
lasting peace in space,

67
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,946
it’s imperative that we
have the lost technology!

68
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,906
‐ Yes, great show, boss, yeah!

69
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,415
‐ Ahh!

70
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,248
‐ That went so well, it’s
never gone better actually.

71
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,582
(laughs)

72
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,839
So easy to fool
these little girls.

73
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,300
Do you understand?

74
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,172
‐ Unless we act quickly our
company is going to go bankrupt.

75
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,968
‐ So, let’s work
together for space peace!

76
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,514
‐ Roger!

77
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,056
I wonder though, how I can
make myself really useful.

78
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,271
Oh, I have a question.

79
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,483
‐ What is it?

80
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,233
‐ What exactly is
this lost technology?

81
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,444
‐ You mean you don’t know?

82
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,937
‐ No, I don’t.

83
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,607
‐ Excuse me, but isn’t the
search for the lost technology

84
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,568
part of the Angel
Brigade’s mission?

85
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,946
‐ Yes, I guess that’s true,

86
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,623
but I really don’t
know what it is.

87
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,624
‐ Now, look, if your mission
is to find the lost technology

88
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,785
wouldn’t you need to know
what the lost technology is?

89
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,715
‐ Sorry.

90
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,503
I just don’t know what it is.

91
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,508
But I wanna be able to
explain it to others though.

92
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,722
So, please tell us what
the lost technology is.

93
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,182
‐ Stop playing with us!

94
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,973
What do you mean by insulting
your superiors like this?

95
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,520
‐ Don’t get mad at me!

96
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,232
I told you I don’t know
what the lost technology is.

97
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,521
I really don’t.

98
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,606
‐ Oh, what next?

99
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,819
‐ We must never lie.

100
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,609
Remember that is
what God teaches us.

101
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,532
‐ (laughs) Okay, I
think I’ve got it now.

102
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,785
I think I’m finally beginning‐‐

103
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,244
‐ Is she for real?

104
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,784
Maybe these girls really
don’t know what it is.

105
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,618
We may have to search
for it all by ourselves.

106
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,960
‐ You mean we have to work?

107
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,630
‐ Oh, hey, Colonel Volcott
might know something about it.

108
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,749
‐ [Commander] But he’s away
at a conference, isn’t he?

109
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,207
‐ Yes, I know that.

110
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,758
But maybe you can come back
again when the colonel returns.

111
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,671
‐ [Jonathan] Why?

112
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,680
We’re here now because he’s not!

113
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,351
‐ Oh.

114
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,603
Ah‐ha!

115
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,015
I wonder what this one knows.

116
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,982
And now to top it all
off is syrupy sauce.

117
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,024
‐ [Normad] I hope you’re
going to do better

118
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,439
than the sneaky, robust
taste he was talking about.

119
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,527
‐ [Jonathan] This one, huh?

120
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,532
‐ [Milfeulle] Yes, you’d be
amazed by how much he knows.

121
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,538
‐ All right, then
let me ask you this,

122
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,539
do you know where the
lost technology is?

123
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,501
‐ [Normad] Yes.

124
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,501
‐ So, where is it then?

125
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,333
‐ [Normad] Well.

126
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,377
‐ [Both] Well what?

127
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,711
‐ [Normad] Well.

128
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,714
‐ [All] Well what?

129
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,415
‐ [Normad] It’s right here.

130
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,337
(all gasping)

131
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,884
‐ Tell us exactly where it is.

132
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,388
‐ [Normad] I said
it’s right here.

133
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,549
‐ [All] Huh?

134
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,429
‐ [Normad] I am indeed
the lost (grunts).

135
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,598
‐ That is two.

136
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,556
‐ Why are you such a liar?

137
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,694
‐ Where is it?

138
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,610
Where is the lost technology?

139
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,401
‐ [Normad] I’m
saying that it’s me.

140
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,154
(both screaming)

141
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,494
I’m telling you the truth.

142
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,910
(Normad thuds)

143
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,201
‐ How dare you make
a fool out of us.

144
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,083
I’m going to destroy you!

145
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,581
‐ [Normad] No,
please, please don’t.

146
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,752
‐ [Jonathan] Hey,
where are you going?

147
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,586
‐ Maybe she’s the one who knows

148
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,089
where the lost technology is.

149
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,212
Come on, let’s see
where she’s going.

150
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,718
‐ [Jonathan] Right.

151
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,339
‐ [Normad] I’m glad I
could count on Vanilla.

152
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,256
She’s made herself into
a decoy just to save me.

153
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,716
Vanilla, you’re a true angel.

154
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:16,686
(machinery squeaking)
(light piano music)

155
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,862
‐ Is this the lost technology?

156
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,111
‐ It feels like we’re
getting so much closer.

157
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,783
‐ Oh, wow.

158
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,281
I didn’t know your room
was like this, Vanilla.

159
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,494
It’s amazing.

160
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,785
‐ What do you mean?

161
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,326
Are there other rooms
that you can show us?

162
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,541
‐ Oh yes.

163
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,329
But all of the rest
are just our own rooms.

164
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,004
‐ This is for peace in
space, so let’s see them all.

165
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,923
‐ Okay.

166
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,379
(upbeat music)

167
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,670
So, first of all,
this is my room.

168
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,257
Let me tell you about
everything in it.

169
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,644
This is the oven where
I bake all my cakes

170
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,761
and make all my treats.

171
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,516
People tell me they
taste really great.

172
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,311
I may not know much
about lost technologies

173
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,725
but I sure know about
roast technology. (laughs)

174
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,230
‐ [Normad] Very funny.

175
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,148
‐ Next, allow me to
show you Ranpha’s room.

176
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,369
‐ Why would one person need
this much gym equipment?

177
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,161
‐ Maybe to gain back
her lost physiology.

178
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,664
Is this the lost technology?

179
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,666
‐ (laughs) Hey, that
was a funny one.

180
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,580
‐ Ya think?

181
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,167
‐ Now let’s go to the next room.

182
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,837
And here we have Forte’s room.

183
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:32,347
‐ I know she’s a soldier but
this all she has in her room?

184
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,509
‐ If you were find a to

185
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,598
or a description
for this collection.

186
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,352
‐ What would that be?

187
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,024
‐ High

188
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,064
caliber.
(all laughing)

189
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,267
‐ [Normad] Good grief.

190
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,030
‐ Continuing on, now
we’re in Mint’s room.

191
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,700
‐ Oh, this safe is
incredibly solid.

192
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,951
I’ve got a strong
suspicion that this must be

193
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,702
where the lost
technology is kept.

194
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,295
‐ [Jonathan] This has been
worth all the hard work.

195
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,000
‐ So now we’ll need you to
open the safe for us, please.

196
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,462
‐ I’m very sorry,

197
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,342
but to tell you the truth I
don’t know how to open the safe.

198
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,840
I know, I bet this
one can open it.

199
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,223
‐ [Normad] You’re kidding.

200
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,050
‐ Oh, really?

201
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,264
Is that so?

202
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,715
So then you can
open it, can you?

203
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,603
‐ Ha, what makes you think
you can actually do it?

204
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,934
‐ [Normad] How rude of you.

205
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,059
There is nothing I can’t do.

206
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,314
This is a piece of cake.

207
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,976
(stomach growls)

208
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,025
‐ I’m starting to
get really hungry.

209
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,528
‐ [Normad] You shouldn’t
judge me by my looks.

210
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,190
‐ [Commander] Oh, yeah, sorry.

211
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,988
We’ve been mistaken
about you all this time.

212
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,033
Perhaps it’s true that
you can do anything.

213
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,736
‐ [Normad] Of course I can.

214
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,236
‐ [Commander] Then
open it for us, please.

215
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,039
‐ [Normad] I don’t need
a key to open this.

216
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,126
It won’t open.

217
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,380
‐ [Commander] You can’t open it?

218
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,630
‐ Useless piece of.
‐ Wow, how pretty.

219
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,423
These look tasty.

220
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,425
‐ [Normad] Stop it!

221
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,086
Help me, Milfeulle!

222
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,472
‐ Disappear and die!

223
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:56,849
What?

224
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,930
(dramatic music)

225
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,885
‐ Not a third time.

226
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,685
‐ [Normad] Oh, Vanilla,
you are an angel.

227
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,440
‐ Take us for fools!

228
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,940
‐ These are so tasty.

229
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,949
I like jellybeans.
(safe beeps)

230
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,200
(Jonathan yelps)

231
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,411
(Jonathan thuds)

232
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,241
‐ That hurt.

233
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,746
Damn, what the hell happened?

234
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,369
‐ [Commander] Jonathan,
look behind you.

235
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,205
‐ [Jonathan] What?

236
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,959
Hey, it’s open!

237
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,131
‐ Jonathan!

238
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,959
‐ [Both] We did it!

239
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,054
‐ Yes, at last we’ve
come face to face

240
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,340
with the lost
technologies. (laughs)

241
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,264
‐ Yes.
(both laughing)

242
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,553
‐ [Milfeulle] Hey,
what’s happening here?

243
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,007
‐ Good work, ladies.

244
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,469
You’ve served us very well.

245
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,807
‐ [Milfeulle] Huh,
what do you mean?

246
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,192
‐ Let’s just say you’re
no longer employed here.

247
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,812
‐ Let’s go, Jonathan.

248
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,317
‐ As you wish, boss.

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,820
(both laughing)

250
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,942
(Milfeulle whimpers)

251
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,238
(door slams)

252
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,991
‐ [Milfeulle] Uh‐oh.

253
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,664
(men shouting)

254
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,542
‐ [Commander] Hey, help us!

255
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,581
Help!

256
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,462
(men screaming)

257
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,039
‐ Then, once you
finish the syrupy sauce

258
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,787
you cover the tart with
it and heat it all up.

259
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,758
And finally, you want to
enjoy it while it’s still hot.

260
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,889
‐ So the investigators from
headquarters told you this?

261
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,761
‐ Yes. (whimpers)

262
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,177
He said we were fired.

263
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,065
‐ You have nothing
to worry about.

264
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,694
You’re not going
to lose your jobs

265
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,190
because I’m going to speak to
them about this personally,

266
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,021
all right, girls?

267
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,977
‐ Oh my, thank you.

268
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,435
Thank you, sir.

269
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,605
‐ My goodness.

270
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,904
Besides, how could I
let someone like you,

271
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,030
who can make such
wonderful treats, go?

272
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,155
This apple tart is one of
the best I’ve ever tasted.

273
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,623
‐ Thank you very much, sir.

274
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,373
But the real reason
it tastes so good

275
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,866
is the quality of
the ingredients,

276
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,248
not because of me.

277
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,334
‐ Really?

278
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,247
What kind of
ingredients did you use?

279
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,547
‐ The best, all natural,
sweet and nutty.

280
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,006
‐ [Normad] Just like you.

281
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,552
There’s no mistake,
this spaceship was
made from apple pie.

282
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,058
‐ [Forte] What are
you talking about?

283
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,679
This is fake apple pie that
just looks like real apple pie.

284
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,307
‐ [Milfeulle] You’re
talking about apple pie?

285
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,983
‐ [Normad] You don’t trust me.

286
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,732
‐ [Volcott] Well, why don’t
we just leave it at that?
