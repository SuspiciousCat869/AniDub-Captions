1
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,684
‐ I’d like you to tell me about

2
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,148
my future prospects
for love and romance.

3
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,688
‐ I will now look
into the future.

4
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,285
(woman chanting)

5
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:38,753
Yes, yes!

6
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,212
I see something incredible.

7
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,170
‐ Really?

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,000
What?

9
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,254
What is it?

10
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,047
‐ A bright vision of
a man in your life.

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,960
‐ That’s exciting!

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:47,877
‐ Yes, yes.

13
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,256
I can see it clearly.

14
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,763
Before long,

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,304
you will encounter an
unbelievably beautiful man

16
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,886
and you will then
fall in love and

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,721
live a life brimming with
pure bliss and happiness.

18
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,558
(woman yelps)

19
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:58,643
‐ That’s great!

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,055
I feel so lucky!

21
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,725
(woman groans)

22
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,114
I’m cold.

23
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,735
(sirens blaring)

24
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,867
(upbeat music)

25
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,525
‐ [Girl] Rouge Flavored
Spring Rolls of Love.

26
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,004
‐ [Girl] What is it Forte?

27
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,961
‐ Please, could you
take this file over

28
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,421
to the colonel for me?

29
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,631
‐ Sure.

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,540
Come to think of it,

31
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,590
isn’t today Ranpha’s day off?

32
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,762
‐ I guess so.

33
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,719
‐ Isn’t she supposed to go out?

34
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,091
‐ I don’t think so.

35
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,586
Why do you ask?

36
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,428
‐ It’s just that
she usually goes out

37
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,513
somewhere interesting
on her day off.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,230
‐ Maybe she’s just
not feeling very well.

39
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,101
‐ [Robot] A guy broke her heart.

40
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,726
‐ [Girl] Broke her heart?

41
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,274
‐ [Forte] She had a boyfriend?

42
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,776
‐ [Robot] Yes, but I think it
was more of an infatuation.

43
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,189
‐ [Forte] Infatuation?

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,489
With who?

45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,950
‐ [Robot] Do you know
who Melty Diamond is?

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,110
‐ Yes!

47
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,318
I know him!

48
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,158
You mean Melty of the
Milky Way Jerseys.

49
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,214
He’s incredibly
popular these days but,

50
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,041
I’m quite sure I read yesterday

51
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,175
that he’s moved in with a
supermodel, Lovely Crystal.

52
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,546
‐ [Robot] That’s right.

53
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,470
‐ Goodbye my sweet Melty.

54
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,718
‐ I get it.

55
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,428
So Ranpha fell in love
with a pop idol, did she?

56
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,979
‐ She can be such a juvenile.

57
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,654
‐ [Girl] And how do you
know about this anyway?

58
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,193
‐ [Robot] Ranpha’s
been writing about it

59
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,946
on the Angel Brigade homepage
ever since she first met him.

60
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,740
She’s written over 30,000
words on him already.

61
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,585
‐ What the heck could
she have been thinking?

62
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,331
‐ Excuse me, has Ranpha
gone out already?

63
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,207
♪ You love no one but yourself ♪

64
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,711
♪ And you’ll have no
one when you die ♪

65
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,884
(girl humming)

66
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,094
‐ Ranpha, do you
mind if I come in?

67
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,256
‐ What is it Mint?

68
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,885
‐ I’ve got a package
here for you!

69
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:24,722
‐ What?

70
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,216
A package for me?

71
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,102
From the Full Monty Company?

72
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,397
What could it be?

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,900
(girl sighs)

74
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,615
‐ [Ranpha Voiceover] What the?

75
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,657
(girl yells)

76
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,294
‐ Hello there sweetie.

77
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,292
I am your darling.

78
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,464
I need to see you sweetie!

79
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,507
‐ Sweetie?

80
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,341
What do you mean?

81
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,175
Don’t!

82
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,009
‐ [Man] Come on!

83
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,723
(girl yelling)

84
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,471
‐ [Girl] Ranpha!

85
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,385
What’s going on?

86
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,603
‐ [Forte] Are you alright?

87
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,314
‐ It’s nothing, nothing.

88
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,234
‐ What do you mean by nothing?

89
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,943
‐ [Ranpha] I’m just watching
a horror film on video

90
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:16,984
and it’s really scary.

91
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,148
Sorry about the fuss.

92
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,896
‐ Are you sure that’s all?

93
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,066
‐ You gave us quite a fright.

94
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,235
‐ I’m okay.

95
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,123
That’s all it was, really.

96
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,910
‐ [Man] What’s the
matter sweetie?

97
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,753
(girl yells)

98
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,749
‐ [Girl] What was that?

99
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,160
‐ That’s the video.

100
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,619
Yeah, the video.

101
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,497
It’s like a love
romance horror film.

102
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,844
It’s really good.

103
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,171
(girl chuckles nervously)

104
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,464
Bye.

105
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,837
‐ What’s a love
romance horror film?

106
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,384
‐ [Group] Who knows.

107
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,719
‐ [Man] Sweetie, what
are you doing to me?

108
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,183
‐ About time.
‐ Thank you for calling.

109
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,516
‐ You have reached
the head office

110
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,729
of the Full Monty Company.

111
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,691
‐ I got a package
delivered from you today

112
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,019
that I didn’t order.

113
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,484
‐ I’m so sorry,

114
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,024
but the person you
want to speak to is

115
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,778
away from his desk right now.

116
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,109
Could you please call
back in a little while?

117
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,163
‐ Oh sweetie, how do I look?

118
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,409
‐ That’s one of my best dresses.

119
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,907
At least now he’s not naked.

120
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,369
‐ Now sweetie.

121
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,792
Oh my precious sweetie.

122
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,628
(girl yells)

123
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,172
Please don’t be afraid.

124
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,595
You must’ve been so
lonely all this time.

125
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,046
(girl growls)

126
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,515
Hey, what’s the matter sweetie?

127
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,006
‐ Now I’ve had enough!

128
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,228
‐ A little play fight, huh?

129
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,519
Okay, come and get me.

130
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,113
‐ You’re going to
regret saying that.

131
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,439
You jerk.

132
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,278
Do you take me for a fool?

133
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,695
Take this, the lightning kick!

134
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,661
(girl groaning)

135
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,452
‐ [Man] Are you alright sweetie?

136
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,368
My dear, you’re hurt.

137
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,295
‐ Ouch!

138
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,715
What do you think you’re doing?

139
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,581
Just stop that.

140
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,787
Stop it darling!

141
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,459
‐ Ranpha!
‐ Let go of me!

142
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,957
‐ I baked a cake for you today!

143
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,298
It’s a strawberry tart!

144
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,303
I’m sorry!

145
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,344
I gotta go!

146
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,426
‐ No!

147
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,260
Wait!

148
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,185
‐ I’m sorry, I’m sorry!

149
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,102
I didn’t mean to disturb you!

150
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,471
I thought you were all alone!

151
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,428
‐ No, please!

152
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,515
There’s a good reason for this!

153
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,810
‐ Hey, it’s okay!

154
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,645
I won’t tell anyone
you snuck your

155
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,980
new boyfriend into
your room and you

156
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,274
were having a
little dress‐up date

157
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,066
getting all lovey
dovey and kissy kissy!

158
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,439
I swear I won’t tell!

159
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,027
‐ Please, listen to my story!

160
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,529
‐ My sweet sweetie.

161
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,204
‐ Sorry I disturbed you!

162
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,872
‐ Milfeuille, you better
keep this all to yourself!

163
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:32,952
I’m counting on you!

164
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,538
‐ [Group] What?

165
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,792
Are you serious?

166
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,713
‐ No!

167
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,167
‐ Ranpha, I wanna
talk to you right now!

168
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,627
Let me in!

169
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,177
‐ Tell me Ranpha, what
exactly is all this about?

170
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,641
A dress‐up date?

171
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,931
‐ I’m sorry, I’m sorry!

172
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,562
I didn’t mean for
them to find out!

173
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,469
‐ And when did you
bring him here?

174
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,891
You sneaky little devil.

175
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,936
‐ You should never hide things.

176
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,349
‐ Looks like they’ve got me.

177
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,109
What am I going to do now?

178
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,823
I know.

179
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,736
‐ [Forte] Now what?

180
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,490
‐ [Robot] Let’s
break the door down.

181
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,623
‐ It’s not right to cause a
stir on the base like this.

182
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,240
(group sighs)

183
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,196
‐ [Man] Brigade!

184
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,617
‐ Sorry.

185
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,084
We’re having an important
meeting right now.

186
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,173
‐ Terrorists have
attacked Sub Zero Area.

187
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,000
Prepare to deploy at once.

188
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:22,883
‐ [Group] Roger!

189
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,339
‐ Looks like my decoy
strategy worked.

190
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,469
‐ Good grief.

191
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,680
Look at this scribble.

192
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,683
What a mess.

193
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,685
‐ [Girl] Darling!

194
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,524
Punch!

195
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,968
‐ Darling?

196
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,098
(kids giggling)

197
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,016
‐ I don’t see any terrorists.

198
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:42,945
What went wrong?

199
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,573
‐ This has been no mistake.

200
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,191
Someone planned this.

201
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,026
‐ We fell right smack
into her little plan.

202
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:49,994
How could we?

203
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,375
‐ [Girl] Who do you mean by her?

204
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,621
‐ [Robot] Ranpha of course.

205
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,791
Who do you think?

206
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,869
‐ Angel Brigade!

207
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:58,868
‐ [Ranpha] What?

208
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,995
You didn’t send it to me.

209
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,251
‐ No, I’m sorry.

210
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,544
There’s no one at
all by the name of

211
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,125
Franboise showing up on
our dispatcher’s list.

212
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,801
‐ Well I don’t
get it ’cause this

213
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,050
darling is here
with me right now.

214
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,382
‐ What else can I tell you?

215
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,628
‐ Whatever!

216
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,178
I’m bringing him
back immediately!

217
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,601
‐ But we never shipped him.

218
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,812
(girl growls)

219
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,680
‐ Oh sweetie, what
do you think of this?

220
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,518
‐ Well that looks
pretty good actually.

221
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,354
‐ [Forte] Damn!

222
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,268
That Ranpha.

223
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,517
‐ She’s probably with her date.

224
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,778
Lucky girl.

225
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,941
‐ Screw her!

226
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,239
‐ Sour grapes maybe?

227
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,361
‐ [Forte] What’s that?

228
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,196
‐ Sorry.

229
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,740
Did you hear that?

230
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,705
‐ Ranpha’s problem is that she’s

231
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,704
a hopeless romantic dreamer.

232
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,946
‐ [Girl] Wow, they look great.

233
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,499
‐ [Man] You think
they’re famous?

234
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,250
‐ [Forte] Just about every
guy she falls in love with

235
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,333
is someone she
can’t possibly have.

236
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,248
‐ But it still must be so nice

237
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,087
just to be close to someone.

238
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,724
They’re probably going
everywhere together.

239
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,801
And I bet they’re sharing
the sweetest kisses.

240
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,430
‐ No, I don’t think Ranpha’s
having that easy a time of it.

241
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,810
Ranpha can get cold
feet all of a sudden.

242
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,398
Relationships scare her.

243
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,528
It’s as if she loses
her usual cheeriness.

244
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,624
She needs to let her
hair down a little.

245
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,953
(man giggles)

246
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,709
‐ Desire can devastate the body.

247
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,630
‐ [Robot] I think you’re
all just jealous of her.

248
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,040
‐ Now for the latest news.

249
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,627
We bring you a follow‐up report

250
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,631
on the recent doll bomb
delivery package incidents.

251
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,467
(girl yells)

252
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,642
‐ So this is the
Full Monty Company?

253
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,271
Now it’s game over I guess.

254
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,479
‐ Are you saying
this is the end?

255
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,980
‐ Yes I am.

256
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,649
‐ Oh my sweetie.

257
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,856
‐ [Ranpha Voiceover]
He’s just a doll.

258
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,780
But.

259
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,213
But.

260
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,838
(big explosion)

261
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,347
(police sirens)

262
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,892
‐ [Girl] It looks like
they caught the culprit

263
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,477
that delivered that android.

264
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:29,807
‐ [Girl] Apparently
it’s designed to

265
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,568
go off when you kiss it.

266
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,031
‐ [Forte] It seems
that he’s driven to

267
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,691
commit crimes out
of anger because

268
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,607
he was once told by
a girl who he loved

269
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,526
that he was a lousy kisser.

270
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,989
‐ [Robot] There have
been 15 other women

271
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,155
who have had the same
thing happen to them.

272
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,374
Every one of them was looking
for love on the internet!

273
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,827
He got her good.

274
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,208
(girl yelling)

275
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,666
‐ [Ranpha] How could you play
with a girl’s heart like that?

276
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,717
You bastard!

277
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,645
‐ [Girl] What do you think?

278
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,549
‐ [Robot] No, no.

279
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,137
Nothing to worry about.

280
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,682
‐ [Forte] High power
competition model.

281
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,605
‐ [Man] I’ll give
you a prescription.

282
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,814
‐ [Girl] Thank you.

283
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,182
‐ [Robot] Give him
some essence of vanilla

284
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,308
three times a day after meals.

285
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,475
‐ [Girl] Alright!

286
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,273
‐ [Robot] Okay, next!

287
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,114
(upbeat music)
