1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:17,733
‐ [Chef] Then we pour the
oil onto the hot frying pan.

2
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,191
‐ What?

3
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,899
You take the pan off the
heat and then put the oil in.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,862
‐ Shut up!

5
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,741
Why do you even watch
these cooking shows anyway?

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,700
And who’s fault do you
think this whole thing is

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,239
in the first place, Milfeulle?

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,204
‐ Who’s fault?

9
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:33,698
‐ [Ranpha] Yours!

10
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:34,704
It’s your fault!

11
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:36,793
‐ Hmm.

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,672
(sirens blaring)

13
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:49,093
("Galaxy Bang!
Bang!" by Angel‐tai)

14
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:59,182
(singing in a foreign language)

15
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,922
‐ [Milfeulle] Pirate‐style
School Memory Terrine.

16
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,013
‐ [Duke Crizeman] Hello,
everyone, nice to meet you.

17
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,425
I’m Reiger Crizeman.

18
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,312
‐ Welcome, Marquis Crizeman.

19
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,182
And what do you need the
Angel Brigade to do for you?

20
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,863
A student ID card?

21
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,110
‐ Yes.

22
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,480
Normally something all
students must return

23
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,649
to the elementary school
when they graduate.

24
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,316
But I’d completely
forgotten about it,

25
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,366
and so I’ve been carrying
it with me all this time.

26
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,333
‐ And so, you would like
us to return this card

27
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,451
to the Memorial
Elementary School.

28
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,658
‐ Yes, that’s what I’d like.

29
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,830
‐ But why don’t you
just return it yourself?

30
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,417
‐ Hey, you know we
need the work, Ranpha.

31
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:53,513
So where is this whatchamacallit
elementary school anyway?

32
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,342
‐ In Area Enigma.

33
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,797
‐ [Forte] No!

34
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,045
‐ Hmm?

35
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,468
Don’t worry, I will
pay for everything.

36
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,845
‐ That’s not the problem.

37
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,980
‐ Is this Area, whatever,
a really dangerous place?

38
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,022
‐ It’s a pirate breeding ground.

39
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,266
‐ A breeding ground?

40
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,687
‐ I am very sorry about
this Marquis Crizeman,

41
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,696
but we can’t operate in
such a dangerous area.

42
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,911
‐ I see then.

43
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,701
Not having returned
my student card

44
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,663
has been nagging at
my soul all this time,

45
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,004
and at this rate I’m not sure
I can find the peace I need.

46
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,211
(Crizeman sobs)

47
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,173
(melancholy orchestral music)

48
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,593
‐ [Milfeulle] Marquis
Crizeman, don’t you worry.

49
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,718
‐ Hmm?

50
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,434
‐ We will do everything
in our in power

51
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,724
to make sure that your
student card is returned

52
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,226
to Memorial Elementary
School for you.

53
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,850
‐ Will you really?

54
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,185
Oh, I am so grateful.

55
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,361
(Milfeulle giggles)

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,940
‐ I’m not so sure about this.

57
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,487
We’re really vulnerable
to enemy fire.

58
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,070
(communicator buzzes)
(Ranpha gasps)

59
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,447
‐ I’ve got some
bad news for you.

60
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,414
Marquis Reiger Crizeman
has just passed away.

61
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,705
‐ He’s just died?

62
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,406
‐ Marquis Crizeman is dead?

63
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,541
‐ So, since our
client has passed away

64
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,877
the mission is invalidated,

65
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,962
and both of you
can return to base.

66
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,169
‐ Oh, right.

67
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,967
This is such a rough
place so let’s go home.

68
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,893
‐ But I want to keep going.

69
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,350
Besides Marquis Crizeman
he just seemed so sad.

70
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,893
‐ Then would you go alone?

71
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,766
‐ No, because you’re the only
one who can pilot this thing,

72
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,984
aren’t you?

73
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,435
‐ And, Ranpha, it was
you who suddenly decided

74
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,436
you wanted to go when
you say the tears

75
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,568
in Mr. Crizeman’s eyes.

76
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,453
‐ Yes, well, I suppose.

77
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,913
But I really think that.

78
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,291
Oh, darn I guess
we have to do this.

79
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,790
Let’s get it over with.

80
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,464
‐ [Milfeulle] Oh, maybe
we should go home.

81
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,293
‐ [Ranpha] You’re the one that
said you wanted to do this.

82
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,297
‐ But this is such a
scary and deserted place.

83
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,801
‐ So then, do you have any idea
where the school is located?

84
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,217
‐ I thought that you knew
where the school was, Ranpha.

85
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,765
‐ And why do you think I’m
the one who would know that?

86
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,770
♪ And reach into space ♪

87
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,733
‐ What could that be?

88
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,483
♪ Memorial ♪

89
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,775
♪ Memorial ♪

90
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,279
♪ Elementary school ♪

91
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,161
‐ Wow, look, the school looks
like it’s going to collapse,

92
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,109
doesn’t it?

93
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,618
‐ Let’s be careful.

94
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,949
This place could very well be
a pirate hideout, you know?

95
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,825
‐ What?

96
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,331
‐ That school song,

97
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,464
it might be some kind of code
calling the pirates together.

98
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,881
‐ Oh, I’m not worried.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,380
That song’s no code.

100
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,502
After all, that song
is what guided us here

101
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,129
to the school, isn’t it?

102
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,304
‐ But why?

103
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,842
‐ Well, precisely
because we were looking

104
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,797
for the school in
the first place.

105
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,298
‐ What kind of world exists

106
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,268
in that head of yours
anyway, Milfeulle?

107
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,269
And how would a school
building ever be able

108
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,351
to do something like that, huh?

109
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,856
Anyhow, we’ve come this
far so we might as well

110
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,021
go right in.

111
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,227
‐ Wait for me, Ranpha.

112
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,778
(footsteps echoing)

113
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,035
Is anyone here?

114
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,368
Wow, it’s even worse inside.

115
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,382
(wall crumbling)
(Milfeulle screams)

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,300
(lasers blasting)
(Milfeulle screaming)

117
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,050
(Ranpha shouts)

118
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,761
(staff thuds)

119
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,297
(Ranpha grunts)

120
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,018
(laser blasts)

121
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,733
‐ Oh, Ranpha.

122
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,230
(rocks cracking)
(Milfeulle screams)

123
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,613
(laser blasts)

124
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,941
Ranpha, help, help me!

125
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,725
Ranpha, help!

126
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,979
‐ I’ve got my hands full here.

127
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,068
You’ve gotta fend for yourself.

128
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,605
(laser blasts)
(Ranpha grunts)

129
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,739
(robot thuds)

130
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,914
‐ Well, what am I
gonna do, Ranpha?

131
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,744
I just don’t know
what to do. (screams)

132
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:56,368
‐ Milfeulle! (grunts)

133
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,918
(robot thuds)

134
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,751
Come on, now’s our chance
to get out of this place.

135
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,836
Let’s go.

136
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,461
‐ I’m so hurt I can’t move.

137
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,299
‐ Oh no!

138
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,383
You’ve hurt yourself?

139
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,376
Let’s have a look.

140
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,013
Oh come on!

141
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,264
It’s just a little scratch.

142
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,466
‐ But it hurts so much!

143
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,517
‐ Well, I’m sure you can run.

144
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,599
‐ But it hurts, I can’t run!

145
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,854
(dramatic music)

146
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,016
(girls scream)

147
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,773
There’s another one!

148
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,565
(Milfeulle screaming)

149
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,439
‐ See, Milfeulle, I told
you that you could run.

150
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,396
‐ Yeah, so I can. (giggles)

151
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,407
‐ Good god, you’re annoying.

152
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,779
Can’t you run faster?

153
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,945
(Milfeulle screaming)

154
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,455
Come on!

155
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,914
‐ [Milfeulle] That’s it, just
carry me and I’ll be fine.

156
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,618
(both screaming)

157
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,458
‐ Hang on, it’s okay.

158
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,923
(Ranpha grunts)

159
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,633
How much do you weigh anyway?

160
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,178
‐ That’s mean!

161
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,894
I’m not fat at all.

162
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,643
‐ Stop crying, you’re
driving me nuts!

163
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,267
(button beeps)

164
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,312
(energetic music)

165
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,568
‐ Oh no!

166
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,900
(Ranpha shouts)

167
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,696
(robot thuds)

168
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,321
(Ranpha grunts)

169
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,158
(energetic music)

170
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,164
‐ This is so exhausting.

171
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,579
‐ I thought I was going to die.

172
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,497
I think I might have
just lost some weight.

173
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,708
‐ Oh brother.

174
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,168
(rocks rumbling)
(upbeat music)

175
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,007
No!

176
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,552
‐ Another one! (screams)

177
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,024
(card clatters)

178
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,314
‐ Milfeulle!

179
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,557
No, Milfeulle!

180
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,694
Oh no!

181
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,775
Oh please!

182
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,990
This can’t be.

183
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,355
Don’t die, Milfeulle.

184
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,068
Please, don’t you die!

185
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,372
(robots rumbling)

186
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,214
(Ranpha sobbing)

187
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:01,869
‐ Yay!

188
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,458
Did you see that?

189
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,343
I got the enemy way
before anyone else did.

190
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,011
That means I win.

191
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,129
‐ Darn, and I lost.

192
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,716
‐ You’re kids?

193
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,591
‐ Aw, what a drag.

194
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,180
‐ Yeah, I was so
close to winning.

195
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,354
‐ But who are you guys?

196
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,353
And what’s this
all about anyway?

197
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,485
‐ [Kid] It’s a game.

198
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,731
‐ Game?

199
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,062
‐ People who come into
this school are targets.

200
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,780
‐ The one who gets the
intruder first wins.

201
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,401
‐ A game.

202
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,946
This is how you play?

203
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,412
‐ Yeah, and that was
an excellent one.

204
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,742
‐ Let’s do it again.

205
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,655
‐ Cut it out!

206
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,696
Don’t you know that
there are things

207
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,037
you should and shouldn’t do

208
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,791
even when all you’re
doing is playing around?

209
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,254
How could you kill
somebody in cold blood

210
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,456
and call it a game?

211
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,417
‐ [Kid] But that’s
just a paint pellet.

212
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,261
‐ Paint pellet?

213
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,879
It’s true.

214
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,298
‐ Milfeulle, what are
you trying to do to me?

215
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,309
‐ But, Ranpha, I truly believed
that I was actually dead.

216
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,098
Look over there.

217
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,687
Those kids have no shadows.

218
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,822
You can see right
through their legs.

219
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,231
‐ [Ranpha] What?

220
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,607
‐ Are you kids, are you?

221
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:19,367
Mr. Crizeman’s ID card,
it’s disappearing.

222
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:27,751
(both gasp)

223
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:28,996
Mr. Crizeman!

224
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,261
‐ Hello, I sure
kept you waiting.

225
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,841
(light music)

226
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,135
‐ Reiger, welcome back.

227
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,144
What took you?

228
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,275
‐ I’m home.

229
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,771
Now can we play together?

230
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,690
Thanks a lot, girls.

231
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,615
Goodbye now.

232
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:56,663
(light music)
(cards clatter)

233
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,833
(light music)

234
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,001
‐ Do you think that those
kids could have been?

235
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,417
(ship whooshing)

236
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,344
‐ Ghosts?

237
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,343
‐ Yes, ghosts of the children.

238
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,125
‐ I’m sure that it was
just a hallucination.

239
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,178
And you and Ranpha both
saw the same thing?

240
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,846
‐ Well, maybe we did.

241
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,525
‐ Ranpha, I’m sure that
what we saw was real.

242
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,024
‐ [Ranpha] Mission
accomplished, returning to base.

243
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,437
‐ All right then.

244
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,823
‐ Ranpha!

245
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,860
But why?

246
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,322
‐ Just leave it.

247
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,862
Marquis Crizeman’s student
card was successfully returned

248
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,858
to his old school, wasn’t it?

249
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,988
Our mission’s complete.

250
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,954
‐ I guess so.

251
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,205
I guess you’re right.

252
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,906
I’m sure the spirits of
those kids are still playing

253
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
at their old school.

254
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,668
(children laughing)

255
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,684
‐ [Milfeulle] Look,
Forte, isn’t he cute?

256
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,301
‐ [Forte] What’s
so cute about him?

257
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,507
‐ [Milfeulle] You
wanna hold him, Forte?

258
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,268
It’s really no
problem, you know?

259
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,231
See, here.

260
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,691
‐ [Forte] I said I’ll pass.

261
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,019
‐ [Milfeulle] Forte,
what’s the matter with you?

262
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,733
You’re sweating
buckets right now.

263
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,573
(Milfeulle screams)
