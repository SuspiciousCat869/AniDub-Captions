1
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,934
‐ Well, isn’t this a great day.

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,225
The sun is so bright.

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,651
I haven’t enjoyed a day this
one for a long, long time.

4
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,899
‐ Yeah, neither have I.

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,192
(Forte inhales deeply)

6
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,737
‐ And the air is so fresh.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,530
The lapping waves,
a great looking guy.

8
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,866
‐ [Mint] You don’t
really seem that excited.

9
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,745
(Forte yawns)

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,462
‐ Sometimes it’s nice
to just do nothing.

11
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,082
‐ Yeah, I agree.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,460
It’d be even nicer if
we weren’t stranded.

13
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,417
‐ [Forte] I guess.

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,051
(sirens blaring)

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,345
("Galaxy Bang!
Bang!" by Angel‐tai)

16
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:08,782
(singing in foreign language)

17
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,465
‐ [Mint] Special Survival Combo.

18
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,141
‐ [Forte] That’s what happens

19
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,359
when you use military
transportation.

20
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,481
‐ [Mint] We were really unlucky.

21
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,402
‐ Oh well, if we
had made it home

22
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,907
we’d just have lots
of boring work to do.

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,489
I’ve been thinking that I’ve
need a break for awhile now,

24
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,487
so, why don’t we
just take it easy.

25
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,080
‐ I suppose we could.

26
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,341
(both gasp)

27
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,671
‐ [Both] Oh no, don’t tell
me that’s the last of.

28
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,507
(boxes thudding)

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,350
(both sighing)

30
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,139
‐ I’m really glad you’re on
this island with me, Forte.

31
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,524
I know you have a lot
of survival skills.

32
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,853
‐ Well, as you know, Mint,

33
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,806
survival is all about
being young. (laughs)

34
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,187
(Mint laughs)

35
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,476
We’ve gotta find
ourselves some food

36
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,358
and we need to be
able to send signals

37
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,025
to any rescue parties.

38
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,365
‐ You’re thinking of everything.

39
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,159
I’d be a nervous wreck if
I were stuck here alone.

40
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,664
‐ I’m not as strong as
you might think I am.

41
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,326
‐ Oh, come on, the thing
that I admire the most

42
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,036
about you is your strength.

43
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,554
(both sighing)

44
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,435
‐ [Both] Huh?

45
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,051
‐ Is someone there?

46
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,046
‐ [Man] I don’t
mean you any harm,

47
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,048
I’m a policeman.

48
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,309
‐ [Both] Police?

49
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,679
(policeman crying)

50
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,516
‐ And you say that
you’re a cop, huh?

51
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,231
‐ So what’s an
officer of the peace

52
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,941
doing in a place like this?

53
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:50,983
Answer!

54
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,074
‐ Well, it’s a long story.

55
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,150
But, I’m Max and I got
stranded here on this island

56
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,565
six months ago while pursuing
a dangerous criminal.

57
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,316
‐ That story wasn’t too long.

58
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,406
‐ Yeah, I’d say it
was pretty short.

59
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,831
‐ Six months?

60
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,371
Nobody’s come around
here in all that time?

61
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,666
‐ It’s been half a year now.

62
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,290
‐ That’s really unfortunate.

63
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,588
‐ You don’t need
to worry though,

64
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,919
I managed to make
a radio transmitter

65
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,256
out of some salvaged parts.

66
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,421
I’ve been sending S.O.S.
signals continuously

67
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,128
over the last month.

68
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,390
‐ Have you really?

69
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,640
‐ Yes.

70
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,599
(transmitter thuds)

71
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,433
This is it.

72
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,937
‐ [Mint] Whoa.

73
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,600
‐ [Max] Here they come.

74
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,017
‐ [Mint] Wow, a rescue party.

75
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,476
‐ All right, time to put
this thing to work. (laughs)

76
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,570
I’m sending them a
signal to rescue us.

77
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,574
(button clicks)
(transmitter rumbles loudly)

78
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,486
(girls screaming)

79
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,122
(water splashes)

80
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,294
‐ Are you sure that’s
an S. O. S. you sent?

81
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,502
‐ I wonder.

82
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,174
‐ You know, that’s
kind of strange

83
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,582
because it was just yesterday

84
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,208
that another plane crashed here.

85
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,455
(Forte groans)

86
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,706
‐ That must be some
sort of radio jammer,

87
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,128
quite a powerful one.

88
00:04:59,257 --> 00:04:59,967
‐ Huh?

89
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,591
‐ So that must mean,

90
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,256
you’re causing the crashes!

91
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,926
(Max screams)

92
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,725
(upbeat music)

93
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,310
‐ Hey, I got you some
more equipment, Forte.

94
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,515
‐ Wow, there’s a
lot of stuff here.

95
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,068
Oh, check all the toys too,

96
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,479
’cause sometimes they’ve got
little transmitters in them.

97
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,490
‐ Yeah, I’ve already
thought of that.

98
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,740
‐ [Max] Hey.

99
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,282
Let’s work together to
call a rescue party.

100
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,076
‐ You’re on your own, pal.

101
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,449
‐ Come on.

102
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,616
I can tell you everything
there is to know

103
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,873
about this island.

104
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,366
‐ Not interested.

105
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,078
‐ [Max] Why would you want
to make your own transmitter

106
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,876
when we can just use mine?

107
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,341
‐ Yours doesn’t work.

108
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,879
‐ But don’t you think
that fate has brought

109
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,134
us all together here
for some reason?

110
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,305
(Forte groans)

111
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,514
Don’t you?

112
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,225
‐ [Forte] Fate’s got
nothing to do with this!

113
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,005
This has all been your fault!

114
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,677
(Max screams)

115
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,018
(Forte groans)

116
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,692
‐ Aren’t you overdoing it a bit?

117
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,862
‐ Look, it’s because of
him that we’re stuck here,

118
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,361
don’t forget that!

119
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,072
Damn, I’m just
wasting my energy.

120
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,573
Boy, am I thirsty.

121
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,365
‐ And I’m starting
to get really hungry.

122
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,117
‐ I’ve got lots of
emergency food rations.

123
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,540
I’d say probably
about 10 years worth.

124
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,909
‐ [Both] Did you
say 10 years worth?

125
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,286
‐ Hey, Max, maybe
it really was fate

126
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,708
that brought us together.

127
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,418
‐ Thank goodness
you’re on this island

128
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,878
to take care of us.

129
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,378
‐ You see?

130
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,055
‐ That was terrible
luck that Forte and Mint

131
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,890
had when that military
transport crashed.

132
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,565
‐ [Volcott] I’m starting
to get quite worried.

133
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,266
We haven’t heard anything
from the search party yet.

134
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,108
‐ Don’t worry.

135
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,033
They’re the least likely
of the Angel Brigade

136
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,190
to die like that.

137
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,528
I’m sure they’re
doing just fine.

138
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,864
By the way,

139
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,028
did you know that the
area where they crashed

140
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,537
is called the Sea of Demons?

141
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,619
‐ Not the.

142
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,295
‐ Sea of Demons?

143
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,463
‐ They say a lot of accidents
happen in that area.

144
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,383
Rumor has it that
the haunting spirit

145
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,921
of a violent criminal
who escaped to the island

146
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,425
and then died there as
been causing plane crashes

147
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,589
and the like ever since.
(laughs maniacally)

148
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,679
(Milfeulle whimpers)

149
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,892
Hey, I’m joking.

150
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,681
It is true though that
a felon on the run

151
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,605
did go missing in the area
a few short months ago.

152
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,596
But I doubt very much
he’s the rumored ghost.

153
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,320
(Max laughing)

154
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,947
‐ I haven’t felt this
way in a very long time.

155
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,029
(buttons clicking)

156
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,038
‐ [Forte] Let’s see,
this attaches to this,

157
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,250
and then this and
this go, well‐‐

158
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,462
(transmitter rings)

159
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,003
‐ You’ve got the
transmitter sounding

160
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,496
just like a phone ringing.

161
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,338
You’re a genius, Forte.

162
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,473
‐ Now if only
somebody would answer.

163
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,340
(transmitter clicks)

164
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,926
(jubilant music)

165
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,639
‐ [Announcer] Congratulations,
you’re our 10,000th caller.

166
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,760
You’ve won a summer
vacation package

167
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,637
on an uninhabited island.

168
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,564
Lucky you.

169
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,982
How do you feel right now?

170
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,810
(both groaning)

171
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,975
‐ This is so annoying!

172
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,364
Who is it this time?

173
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,192
‐ [Woman] Hello, this
is Shop by Phone.

174
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,777
‐ Look, believe it or not

175
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,030
I am stuck on an uninhabited
island right now.

176
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,655
‐ [Woman] We’ll get your
address in a moment.

177
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,820
(Forte groaning)

178
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,240
First, please enter
the codes for the items

179
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,576
you wish to order.

180
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,331
‐ Listen, I don’t
wanna order anything!

181
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,004
‐ [Woman] Thank you,
please call again soon.

182
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,254
(Forte sighs)

183
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,174
‐ [Woman] Hi there.

184
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,843
Welcome to Miko’s Room.

185
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,170
I wonder what kind of new
friends I’m going to meet today.

186
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,339
‐ [Operator] The number
you are trying to reach

187
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:34,097
is either out of range,
disconnected, or unassigned.

188
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,850
‐ [Man] Maybe you could
tell me some more about

189
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,977
these problems you’re having.

190
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,363
What was that?

191
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,191
(girls sighing)

192
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,685
I’ll tell you what.

193
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,275
‐ It seems we’re not able
to transmit anything.

194
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,321
‐ To think that my
life is going to end

195
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,825
in a place like this.

196
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,616
‐ I would have liked to have
fallen in love at least once.

197
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,121
‐ Well, you never know.

198
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,292
Maybe Max has some potential.

199
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,711
‐ Oh, give me a break.

200
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,419
‐ Love has a funny way
of sneaking up on you.

201
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,172
Give it time and you
might really fall for him.

202
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,053
‐ Oh, come on, we
can’t give up now.

203
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,421
Let’s give this contraption
another try, okay?

204
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,720
‐ [Forte] Maybe we should
call the undertaker.

205
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,474
‐ Listen, we just might
succeed if we use this machine

206
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,095
as a radio jammer again.

207
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,063
If it causes more and more
planes to crash in the area

208
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,405
at some point somebody’s
going to want to know

209
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,899
what’s going on.

210
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,940
Hey, Forte, could you go
and ask Max if he has any

211
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,937
extra batteries?

212
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,359
‐ Sure.

213
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,245
Oh, Max.

214
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,363
Are you here?

215
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,906
Not a bad lifestyle
for a castaway I’d say.

216
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,584
I’m taking some water.

217
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,000
What the?

218
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,712
‐ See, I got stranded
while chasing a crook.

219
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,211
‐ Don’t tell me he’s the.

220
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,918
(Max huffing)
(gun clicks)

221
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,257
(Max huffing creepily)

222
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:11,865
(dramatic music)
(gun blasting)

223
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,575
What’s going on, Max?

224
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,665
(Max laughs)

225
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,743
‐ I’ve been so happy ever
since you came to this island.

226
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,458
I was so bored by myself but
now things are different.

227
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,921
‐ There, it’s finally rewired.

228
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,961
Forte sure is taking
her sweet time though.

229
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,378
In the meantime I’ll test it.

230
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,295
(dramatic music)
(Max laughing creepily)

231
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,846
(Forte grunts)

232
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,562
‐ You’re not going anywhere.

233
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,101
(dramatic music)

234
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,805
(Max laughing)

235
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,815
(ship rumbling)

236
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,281
‐ Oh no!

237
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,821
(Max screams)

238
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,606
‐ Hey, what’s going on here?

239
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,868
‐ [Volcott] We’ve lost control
because of radio jamming

240
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,242
from an unknown source.

241
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,696
We’re about to crash.
(Ranpha screams)

242
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,459
(ship rumbling)

243
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,789
(screaming)

244
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,417
(water drips)

245
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,721
‐ [Forte] I don’t know how
we managed but we’re alive.

246
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,264
‐ It’s just not fair.

247
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,505
To think I was so close

248
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,057
to getting you to
give me a whipping,

249
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,852
you really are my
fantasy, you know?

250
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,643
Oh, come on, Forte, please?

251
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,687
(fist thuds)
‐ You idiot!

252
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,520
‐ [Max] Oh I love it.

253
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,106
‐ This sun is so nice.

254
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,535
‐ It sure is.

255
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,244
‐ You know, to think
that that Max guy

256
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,584
was such an extreme
sado‐masochistic freak.

257
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,331
Maybe he was just the
right type for you, Forte.

258
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,832
‐ [Forte] Shut up.

259
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,578
‐ By the way, exactly is the
rescue party getting here?

260
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,210
‐ [All] Who knows.

261
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,671
‐ [Volcott] Good lord.

262
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,842
‐ [Woman] The debt collectors
have been threatening us.

263
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,718
With all this suffering my
sister and I thought we’d just.

264
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,718
‐ [Sister] Sis?

265
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,019
‐ [Woman] Oh my. (sobs)

266
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,311
‐ [Sister] Please, stop.

267
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,194
‐ [Ranpha] Don’t worry
about pizza delivery.

268
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,480
‐ Please, stop.
‐ Yes.

269
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,313
‐ [Mint] It’s a story
about pizza delivery.

270
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,897
‐ [Sister] Please, stop.
