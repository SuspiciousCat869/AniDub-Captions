1
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,931
(sirens blaring)

2
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,018
(upbeat music)

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,270
‐ [Girl] Five
Sukiyaki Lunch Boxes.

4
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,950
‐ [Girl Voiceover] As
far as missions go,

5
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,288
this one was turning
out to be pretty easy.

6
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,633
All we had to do was get a
certain man to a specific place

7
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,051
and that was just about
all there was to it.

8
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,644
‐ Do you have business
in Kalua City?

9
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,390
‐ Begin by very gently
mixing the eggs together

10
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,103
and then add salt and pepper.

11
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,024
Place some butter into a
well heated frying pan.

12
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,396
Pour in the eggs
and stir quickly.

13
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,862
Use the whisk briskly
and rhythmically,

14
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,404
bu be sure not to
overdo it or the

15
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,606
eggs will lose their form.
‐ Oh I see!

16
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,656
‐ You’re talking about
how to make an omelet.

17
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,660
‐ When the eggs
start to get firm,

18
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,161
draw them to one
side of the pan.

19
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,622
‐ So tell me, are you a
chef or something Johnny?

20
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,412
‐ The main thing is to
achieve the right texture.

21
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,915
(girl breathing heavily)

22
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,675
‐ Why do they need
all five of us

23
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,510
for such a simple mission?

24
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,007
‐ You knew all about this,

25
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,887
so why didn’t you
just turn it down?

26
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,715
‐ What?

27
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,639
Why not?

28
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,355
That’s because I was the one who

29
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,859
first heard about this mission
from the colonel, that’s why.

30
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,401
How come you didn’t
decide to turn it down?

31
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,950
‐ I don’t think this mission
is quite what it seems.

32
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,490
I think there’s something
more important going on.

33
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,334
‐ Okay.

34
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,779
So if that’s the case,

35
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,538
this Johnny is
probably a lot more

36
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,252
important than we think he is.

37
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,832
‐ If they only needed a driver,

38
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,415
they wouldn’t have brought
in the whole Angle Brigade.

39
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,843
‐ I’ll bet he’s rich,

40
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,799
so rich that he’s
employed the Angel Brigade

41
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,509
because he needs
the extra security

42
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,379
and he’s probably
traveling incognito.

43
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,719
‐ So you think a rich guy
would travel by truck?

44
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,224
‐ Traveling in secret.

45
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,847
Keeping it low pro.

46
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,231
(alarm beeps)

47
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,062
Good.

48
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,405
Time to switch drivers.

49
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,688
‐ [Girl] Rock, paper.

50
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,607
‐ [Girls] Scissors.

51
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,027
‐ [Girl] Rock, paper, scissors.

52
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,753
‐ So then, Johnny, I’d be
interested to know what line of

53
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,087
work you’re involved in.

54
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,431
Johnny?

55
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,934
‐ Well my good little children,
the chicken man is here.

56
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,516
‐ Excuse me?

57
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,114
(man laughs)

58
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,941
‐ Now, now, you
mustn’t pull on the

59
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,356
chicken man’s head like that.

60
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,404
‐ Pull on the
chicken man’s head?

61
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,448
Are you possibly
referring to a costume?

62
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,661
‐ Now, now.

63
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,203
You should never
stick your fingers

64
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,954
into his beak like that.

65
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:47,945
‐ Wow.

66
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,249
That’s really exciting.

67
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,631
‐ Johnny might look alright,

68
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,303
but if he’s into young girls,

69
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,299
(girl growls)

70
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,632
that would be a problem.

71
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,797
‐ [Girl] How would
that be a problem?

72
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,470
‐ Hey, did Johnny
say anything to you?

73
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,178
What he does for work?

74
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,520
Whether he’s married?

75
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,865
You know, that sort
of thing Milfeulle.

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,190
‐ Johnny works as a
professional chef.

77
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,146
‐ Are you sure?

78
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,075
‐ I’m positive.

79
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,068
(girl growls)

80
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,656
‐ Your brain only works when
it comes to food and cooking

81
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,204
so I can’t be sure
of your take on him.

82
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,662
‐ [Milfeulle Voiceover]
But it’s true.

83
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,376
‐ Okay, rock, paper, scissors!

84
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,718
(girl growling)

85
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,225
(girl yells)

86
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,322
‐ I’m sorry if I’m mistaken,

87
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,163
but aren’t you a sniper?

88
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,499
(girl chuckles)

89
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,289
I guess a real pro would
never readily admit to that.

90
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,208
‐ That’s a good observation.

91
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,714
(girl gasps)

92
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,131
‐ Now tell me exactly
what you two talked about.

93
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,047
‐ Listen.

94
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,886
It was really no big deal.

95
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,552
‐ If there was no big deal,

96
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,220
then I wanna hear about
everything he said!

97
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,348
‐ Like dressing up as a chicken?

98
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,771
‐ What did you just say?

99
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,476
‐ Yes.

100
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,858
That was it.

101
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,901
Seriously.

102
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,701
(girl chuckles)

103
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,910
‐ Look at you making like you’re

104
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,742
just some kind of
innocent little girl,

105
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,248
but you’re not
fooling me one bit.

106
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,909
I happen to know very well how

107
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,869
cunning and sneaky you
can be Mint Blancmanche.

108
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,130
I want to know everything
you talked about with Johnny.

109
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,215
‐ You know, one of
your biggest weaknesses

110
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,049
is that you lose your
sense of judgment

111
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,264
when a man you like
enters the picture.

112
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,434
Perhaps you just have a
weakness for men Ranpha.

113
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,017
‐ [Ranpha] Why you!

114
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,930
‐ Honestly.

115
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,115
‐ [Girl] Hey!

116
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,439
Anyone for tea?

117
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,693
‐ [Mint] I’d love some.

118
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,248
‐ [Ranpha] What are
you going to do?

119
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,791
‐ I don’t know yet.

120
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,580
‐ Oh come on.

121
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,958
What do you mean you don’t know?

122
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,844
I’m sure you must be
thinking of something by now.

123
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:44,964
‐ No, nothing.

124
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,724
‐ Are you leaving
it all up to God?

125
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,722
Alright, rock, paper, scissors!

126
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,644
Rock, paper, scissors!

127
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,814
Rock, scissors!

128
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,640
Paper!

129
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,436
(girl growling)

130
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,661
‐ Sorry I’m not more talkative.

131
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,327
I’m a pilgrim observing silence.

132
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,836
‐ May God protect us.

133
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,841
(girl yelling)

134
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,968
‐ Now with all this rain,

135
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,932
it’s getting impossibly
muggy in here!

136
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:33,933
‐ Stop it.

137
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,724
You’ll just steam it up more.

138
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,269
And you absolutely
stink of perfume too.

139
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,607
You’re making me feel
sick so just sit still.

140
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,523
‐ Well at least it’s better than

141
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,857
smelling like gun powder.

142
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,532
How dare you take that attitude

143
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,862
just because you’re a
little older than me.

144
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,818
Who do you think you are?
(girl growls)

145
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,577
(girls gasping)

146
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,577
Look, I was just telling
you how I feel, alright.

147
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,576
And now you wanna shoot me?

148
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,208
‐ Yeah you bet you
face painted tramp.

149
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,592
‐ You know, you’re always
resorting to violence.

150
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,845
You big, crazy,
gun toting bully.

151
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,064
(alarm beeps)

152
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,059
‐ Yay!

153
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,220
It’s time to switch!

154
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,728
Now it’s my turn!

155
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:20,981
Yoohoo!

156
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:21,981
Johnny.

157
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,489
If you don’t mind,

158
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,609
I’d be very
interested in knowing

159
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,818
the purpose of your trip.

160
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:34,907
‐ Oh sure.

161
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,081
Business.

162
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,161
I’m spending 80 billion GC’s to

163
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,414
convert the atmosphere on an
inhabitable planet nearby.

164
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,747
‐ That’s amazing!

165
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,883
You’re starting
life on a planet?

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,420
‐ While I’m there,

167
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,884
I’ll be getting quotes on
interplanetary spaceships.

168
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,505
Of course, they’re very big.

169
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,803
‐ That’s great.

170
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,598
It’s just as I
thought all along.

171
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,772
You really are a rich man.

172
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,852
‐ [Robot] Johnny’s a
professional character actor

173
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,557
in theater productions?

174
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,017
‐ Yes.

175
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,437
Apparently whenever Johnny
gets into any vehicle,

176
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,567
he just falls to sleep and
nothing will wake him up.

177
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,368
Then while he’s sleeping,
he recites his lines.

178
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,205
‐ [Robot] Well it seems you
move in many different circles.

179
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,707
(man chuckles)

180
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,960
‐ [Man] Yes.

181
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,463
‐ [Robot] This play he’s
in now, what’s it about?

182
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,964
‐ [Man] It’s about
a man who wears a

183
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,837
chicken suit for a living, but
wants to become a master chef

184
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,015
and ends up becoming
an apprentice

185
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,514
to a sniper when he
discovers a long lost

186
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,096
twin brother who’s
a wealthy tycoon.

187
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,640
It’s a heartwarming
success story.

188
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,926
‐ [Robot] Sounds horrible.

189
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,978
‐ Johnny, what do you find
attractive in a woman?

190
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,323
(screaming)

191
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,121
(groaning)

192
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,166
‐ I slept well.

193
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,263
For me, nothing at all
beats sleeping in a truck.

194
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,809
‐ Hey you!

195
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,194
I hope you’re feeling guilty!

196
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,152
Hear me?

197
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,315
‐ Well yeah, it was my mistake.

198
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,186
‐ It’s all about correct
timing with the butter.

199
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,408
Making omelets can be
very tricky, you know?

200
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,241
(girl giggles)

201
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,525
‐ Is that right?

202
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,657
Wow, you sure do know a
lot about good cuisine.

203
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,083
‐ [Girl Voiceover] After that,

204
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,505
we continued on
safely with Johnny

205
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,371
until we got to Kalua City.

206
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,998
Even with the problems
we had, in the end,

207
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,495
this mission turned
out to be pretty easy.

208
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,386
‐ [Girl] All of our missions
have been completed.

209
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,550
‐ [Girl] There you have it.

210
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,888
‐ [Girl] Thank you everyone.

211
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,354
‐ [Girl] I guess
everything worked out then.

212
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,732
‐ [Girl] How about we
all go to Sealth Island.

213
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,021
‐ [Man] Sorry folks.

214
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,482
There’s a job that’s
just come up suddenly.

215
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,022
Do you think you can
take this one on?

216
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,765
‐ [Girls] What?

217
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,439
(upbeat music)
