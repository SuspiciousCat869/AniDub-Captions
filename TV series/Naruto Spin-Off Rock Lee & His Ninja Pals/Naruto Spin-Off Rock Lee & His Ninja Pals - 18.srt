1
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:58,578
<i>We're still in the dog</i>
<i>days of summer, so how does</i>
<i>a nice, refreshing fireworks</i>
<i>show sound?</i>

2
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:00,312
So a fireworks show?

3
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:04,612
That's right, it's
going to be part of the
festival. Now here's
where you come in...

4
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:07,945
What we'd like is for
each team to create their
own unique fireworks

5
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,145
display using chakra
and fire-style jutsu!

6
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:17,145
Oooh!

7
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,145
We're making it a
contest and every team
will participate.

8
00:02:20,178 --> 00:02:22,678
The most spectacular
display will win.

9
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:27,845
Lee, I'll be honest,
your inability to use
ninjutsu will put you at
a huge disadvantage.

10
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,012
But it's just another trial
to overcome. So go and
win this thing!

11
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:33,445
Yes, sir!

12
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:42,878
Boom! The Shinobi
Fireworks Show.

13
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:47,778
Holy cow!

14
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:53,912
Everyone's really pushing
themselves. It's gonna be
tough to beat all of them,
that's for sure.

15
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:56,478
So what is our best shot
at winning?

16
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:59,445
We need to come up with
something that will leave
everyone speechless,

17
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:01,678
otherwise we have no
chance of winning.

18
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:05,445
Right, something that
will leave them
speechless.

19
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:06,745
How about this?

20
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,678
You're joking--A
sparkler?

21
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:14,878
<i>Striking a pose and</i>
<i>letting the sparks fly</i>
<i>would definitely do the</i>
<i>trick, I think.</i>

22
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:18,545
Oh, it'll leave them
speechless all right.
Out of boredom.

23
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:20,412
All right.

24
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:24,445
How about this--what if I
strap a bunch of fireworks
to my body and become a
living spinner?

25
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:26,978
That will shock
them!

26
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:30,445
The only one guaranteed
to be shocked is you, you
bonehead!

27
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,212
Fine!

28
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:36,112
I will become a human
rocket and launch myself
into the sky--that will
blow them all away!

29
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:41,778
Lee! You're going to
blow everyone, including
yourself, UP!!

30
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:43,878
Boom!

31
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:48,845
Boy... I guess this is
going to be tougher than
I thought.

32
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:49,678
<i>Lee!</i>

33
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:50,545
Huh?

34
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:56,778
Wow, Sakura, you look
beautiful in your yukata!

35
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:58,578
Haha, why thank you!

36
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:01,945
S-so, Sakura, w-what kind
of fireworks do you like?

37
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:03,512
Um, Lee...

38
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:05,712
The kind that really
knocks your socks off,
right?

39
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,778
What in the blue blazes
are we wearing?!

40
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:09,878
Or maybe the really
extravagant variety?!

41
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:12,512
How'd I get dragged
into all of this?!

42
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,145
Oops, I lit it.

43
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:15,745
Put it out, you idiot!

44
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:16,978
Would if I could!

45
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:19,812
Hey! Kakashi Sensei!

46
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:23,878
It's okay having a little
fun, but remember, fire
isn't a toy.

47
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:28,778
<i>And that goes for you</i>
<i>folks watching, too!</i>
<i>Use your fireworks</i>
<i>responsibly!</i>

48
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:30,145
Oink, oink.

49
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:32,978
Are you going to enter
the contest, too, Sensei?

50
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:38,112
Not a chance. I'm just
here in case of any fire
emergencies. Just shout
if you need me.

51
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:43,045
I want to come up with a
display that will really
wow the audience, but I
can't seem to figure

52
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:44,712
anything out.

53
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:47,978
Fancier fireworks are
definitely fun, but I
think I like the simpler
ones best.

54
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:48,978
Huh?

55
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:51,645
All right, let's all do
our best you guys!

56
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:55,612
So something simpler,
huh? That settles it!

57
00:04:55,645 --> 00:05:00,412
Okay! We will do something
simple. Like launching a
human firework into deep
space!

58
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:02,178
You know what
simple means, right?

59
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:05,045
What the hell's going
on, you guys?

60
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:05,912
Ehh--

61
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,845
[laughing and cheering]
I love fireworks!

62
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:10,945
All right!

63
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,112
This is it, guys and
gals! The time has
finally come!

64
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:16,545
For the Leaf Village
Fireworks Show!

65
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:18,912
Leading off is Team
Seven!

66
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,878
Let's launch this bad boy
already!

67
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:23,945
[grunting]

68
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:25,645
He threw it!

69
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:30,645
Whoa! Team Seven used a
wind-style jutsu to make
a giant windmill
firework!

70
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:33,778
Color commentator Lady
Tsunade, what's your
take?

71
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:36,178
It looks like an enormous
roulette wheel.

72
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,845
There you have it,
folks!

73
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:40,012
Man! That's pretty
awesome!

74
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:41,978
Great job, Naruto!

75
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:44,778
Big deal. I could do
that!

76
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,478
Leaf Whirlwind!

77
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,478
Lee! You don't need to
spin yourself!!

78
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:50,478
[squealing]

79
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:52,678
Suh-Sakura!!

80
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:59,078
Oh no! It looks like
Naruto's arsenal went off
right where it counts!

81
00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:02,612
So tell us, what did you
think of the windmill
display, m'lady?

82
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,912
Looked just like a slot
machine jackpot.

83
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:06,078
And there you have it.

84
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:11,778
They're only halfway through
their entire set, but it's
gonna be hard to outdo
Naruto's fireworks display.

85
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:13,145
I know, Tenten.

86
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:13,845
Neji!

87
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:15,112
Forget it, Lee!

88
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:17,845
Next up, Team Eight!

89
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:24,845
Bankrolled by the Hyuga
clan's ample wealth, Team
Eight has constructed a
massive and extravagant

90
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:26,045
array of fireworks!

91
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:28,045
Well, care to weigh in,
Lady Tsunade?

92
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:31,012
I feel like I'm
watching someone else
hit the jackpot.

93
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,878
There you have it.

94
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,845
[gasping in awe]

95
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:42,012
Whoaaa, that is awesome,
Hinata!

96
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:45,445
N-Naruto's watching,
gotta do my best!

97
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,945
We can't compete with
fireworks this fancy!
What do we do, Lee?

98
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:53,845
Do not worry, if you act
now, I will throw in an
extra firework for free!

99
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,845
Uch! This isn't the
shopping network!

100
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:58,412
So you two are really
still at it, huh?

101
00:06:59,112 --> 00:07:00,878
[grunting]

102
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:01,645
Huh?

103
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:03,578
[grunting]

104
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:05,412
Oh my gosh, Hinata!

105
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:08,112
[lightly groaning]

106
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:11,578
N-N-N-N...

107
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,978
Not again!

108
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:19,678
Lady Hinata!

109
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:24,778
Ohh, it looks like the
fire burning in
Hinata's heart set off
the rest of the fireworks

110
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,778
early! Care to give a
comment, Lady Tsunade?!

111
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:32,112
Trust me, I feel for her.
You gotta have that fire in
your heart before every roll
of the dice.

112
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:33,912
And there you have it.

113
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:37,778
If we really wanna beat
them, we're gonna have
to come up with something
fancier than a human

114
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:41,178
sparkler. But we just
don't have that kind of
money to spend.

115
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,912
<i>It is cool, Tenten.</i>

116
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:43,712
Huh?

117
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:47,878
We have still got plenty of
time. Let us do a fundraiser.

118
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:50,045
Wait a minute, are you
selling yakisoba?

119
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:52,078
Oh no, we have got more
than that.

120
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:55,912
Okonomiyaki, takoyaki,
and chocolate bananas!

121
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,678
What kind of crazy menu
is that?!

122
00:07:57,712 --> 00:08:02,412
Besides---This is
supposed to be serious
contest, no one's gonna
stop to eat, you weirdos!

123
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:03,978
Oh look, a customer.

124
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:06,612
[gobbling]

125
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:08,545
Will you stop eating!?

126
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:10,878
All right! Team Ten
is on deck!

127
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,978
Ah man what a drag.

128
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:16,978
<i>Ooh!</i>

129
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:21,612
Shikamaru's expert Shadow
Pull gives us a masterful
display of timed fireworks
this evening.

130
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:23,178
Don't you think, Lady
Tsunade?

131
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:26,145
A masterful display of
cheating is more like it.

132
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:30,512
Can we please get away
from the gambling
analogies for five
seconds?!

133
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:31,378
Whoa.

134
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,512
Shikamaru's team did
pretty well, too!

135
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:35,678
Okay, that does it!

136
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:38,545
I will go myself
if I have to.

137
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:40,578
It's time for the
finale, Choji.

138
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:41,378
[gobbling]

139
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:42,712
What the heck are you
eating?!

140
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:44,478
Takoyaki.

141
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:48,078
Seriously, dude, do you
really have to do that
right now? What is the
matter with you?

142
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,578
Hey when I'm hungry, I
eat.

143
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,178
[gasping]

144
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:52,445
[screaming]

145
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:53,678
Uh oh!

146
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:56,912
It appears Choji has
accidentally eaten a ball
of fireworks!

147
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:57,578
Huh??

148
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:59,978
Aaagh! Don't come over
here!

149
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:04,812
Ugh, what else could go
wrong tonight?

150
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,512
<i>I've been waiting for</i>
<i>this chance!</i>

151
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,445
Huh?!

152
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:09,878
That's-!!

153
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:11,078
Orochimaru!

154
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:15,378
I'll use all the
confusion to light my
giant black snake!

155
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:17,712
Whaaaaat?!

156
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:21,645
Ugh, darnit! I can barely
move a muscle in this
outfit!

157
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:23,512
Hey, Naruto!

158
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:24,978
<i>He's down for the count!</i>

159
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,412
Maybe Guy Sensei
can help!

160
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:31,612
It's no good, the heat
from the takoyaki KO-ed
him!

161
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:33,945
Well I suppose it's all
up to me, then.

162
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:34,612
Ulgh, it's you.

163
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:37,445
The Leaf's airhead
funny man.

164
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,745
Uh! An airhead?!

165
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:44,612
I'm not the airhead
funnyman!

166
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,678
Where do you think
you're going?!

167
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,645
Fine, I'll handle
you myself.

168
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:51,912
Ah... The resident
straightman, eh?

169
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:56,845
Resident straightman..?!

170
00:09:56,878 --> 00:10:00,878
It's not like I enjoy it,
okay?! I don't know what
I'm doing with my life!

171
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:02,545
Not you, too!

172
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,478
Welp, that is it for
Neji and Tenten.

173
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:09,612
Alright, buckle in,
everyone.

174
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:10,845
That is it!

175
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,978
I need to wake Kakashi
Sensei!

176
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:15,878
Sakura!

177
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:17,012
'Kay, you're lit.

178
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:19,745
Hm?

179
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:25,712
Kakashiiii Senseiiiii!

180
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:28,045
What?!

181
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,678
Kakashi Sensei, we will
need a water jutsu
please...

182
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,212
O-Okay...

183
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:35,112
[snarling]

184
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:37,512
Oh noooooo!

185
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:45,778
<i>And just like that, the</i>
<i>fireworks show came to an</i>
<i>end, thanks to Orochimaru's</i>
<i>machinations.</i>

186
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,012
It's too bad they had to
cancel the show, huh?

187
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,978
Yes.

188
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:56,778
It was tough waking up
Kakashi Sensei. I ended
up using the only halfway
decent fireworks I had.

189
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:58,878
I wish I could've seen
what you came up with.

190
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:02,412
Oh, actually, I have some
left.

191
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:06,178
Just some boring old
sparklers. You wanna
light them up with me?!

192
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:07,578
[gasping]

193
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:17,412
You know, when all is
said and done, I think I
like simpler stuff like
this the best.

194
00:11:17,445 --> 00:11:18,745
Uh, Sakura?

195
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:25,145
Huh?! What the heck?!

196
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:29,645
Do not worry, if you act
now, I will throw in an
extra firework for free!

197
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:32,445
An extra firework...

198
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:39,112
<i>And so, Lee's feelings,</i>
<i>and Lee himself, were</i>
<i>scattered across the</i>
<i>heavens.</i>

199
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:41,045
Sakura!

200
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:42,112
Lee?

201
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,378
<i>And remember everyone!</i>
<i>Use fireworks</i>
<i>responsibly!</i>

202
00:11:57,161 --> 00:12:02,527
<i>The season of love. Maybe</i>
<i>it's this season, when</i>
<i>the sun shines so</i>
<i>bright...</i>

203
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,794
Impressive as always!

204
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:08,994
Looks like I will have
to use my special move
that only works in the
summer!

205
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,861
Huh? You have a move that
utilizes the summer??

206
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:15,594
Haaaaaaa!

207
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:20,227
Behold, the Summer Wrap!
My summertime specialty!

208
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,094
Lee! Summer wraps
are dresses!

209
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:25,261
This is a kid's show,
you're going over the
audience's head!

210
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:30,194
Would you please back me
up over here, Tenten.

211
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:30,894
Huh?

212
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:32,861
[sighing]

213
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:42,894
Bang! Tenten's
Acting Weird!

214
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,361
[sighing]
Something is
wrong.

215
00:12:56,394 --> 00:13:02,194
Tenten is just not her
usual energetic self
lately, is she? You think
something happened maybe?

216
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:06,394
I'm really starting to
worry... we need to snap
her out of this funk
she's in somehow.

217
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:09,327
We don't want to lose
our straight man.

218
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:11,627
Our straight man...

219
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:15,227
That is it! I have got
the perfect way of
getting Tenten back to
her normal self!

220
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,127
Hm?

221
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:20,861
[sighing]

222
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:25,061
Oh man, it is so hot!

223
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,227
Ugh, on days like this...

224
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:29,227
... you really
crave something
cold!

225
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:30,994
Hey, leave it to me!

226
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:38,627
<i>It's been five years</i>
<i>since we started</i>
<i>dating...</i>

227
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:41,994
<i>We used to go to all</i>
<i>kinds of places, but</i>
<i>lately...</i>

228
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:45,161
<i>... it's just been</i>
<i>whatever restaurant</i>
<i>we're closest to.</i>

229
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:48,294
Pass the sauce.

230
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:55,461
Um...

231
00:13:56,661 --> 00:14:01,094
I was thinking.. Maybe we
should um... ya know,
break up.

232
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:05,494
Sure. If that is
really what you want,
I am cool with it.

233
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:09,361
I'm... kidding.

234
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:10,861
Give it a rest.

235
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:16,927
<i>A shocking amount of</i>
<i>relationships... just</i>
<i>grow cold.</i>

236
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:21,861
<i>Nice, Lee! Tenten's the</i>
<i>number one straight man</i>
<i>on our show. Any second,</i>
<i>she'll-</i>

237
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,494
That's the wrong kind of
cold, you blockheads!!

238
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:27,061
She'll be back
to normal.

239
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:30,227
<i>Come on, Tenten! You can</i>
<i>do it! Let us have it!</i>

240
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,261
[sighing]

241
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:39,027
Something is definitely
wrong!

242
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:41,427
We have seriously got
to do something, Neji!

243
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:44,261
Yes, but the question
right now is what?

244
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:47,594
If it's this grave,
it'll be hard to ask
her about it.

245
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:50,261
Still, we will just
have to give it a shot.

246
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:52,794
<i>Yum!</i>

247
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:56,027
Darling, you make the
best veggies in the whole
world!

248
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,461
Oh, you. Such a kidder.

249
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:01,394
[sighing]

250
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:05,894
So tell me, sweet pea,
how is, uh, school going?

251
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,194
You finally starting
to make some friends
over there?

252
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:12,061
If there's anything on
your mind, you can always
talk to your father.

253
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:16,294
Trust me, kiddo, your
Daddy may not look like
much, but everyone at
work comes to me with

254
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:17,994
their troubles, believe
you me!

255
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:20,894
Oh my, isn't that nice,
Tenko?

256
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:24,361
[sighing]

257
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:27,227
Tenko, wait a minute!

258
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,061
I am your father,
I--

259
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,927
It is hopeless! There
is nothing we can do!

260
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:35,261
We just keep digging
ourselves deeper!

261
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:36,594
[sighing]

262
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:40,561
Hm? Hey, Bushy-Brows!
Neji! Why the long faces?

263
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:41,894
Oh, Naruto!

264
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:42,594
Ahhh!

265
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:46,194
Tenten's feeling down,
huh?

266
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:49,094
That doesn't sound
good... how long's she
been acting this way?

267
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:50,327
I would say...

268
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:53,361
It started sometime
around the fireworks
show, I think.

269
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:56,527
Why would that get her
down? Oh, hey! I've got
it!

270
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,227
She probably wants to set
off more fireworks!

271
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:01,227
You really think that is
what it is?

272
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,961
Now that you mention
it...

273
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:06,427
I'm surprised I didn't
see that, I mean it's
always a bit sad when
those shows are over.

274
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:09,927
Right then, if we know
the problem, let us
fix it!

275
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:15,261
Tenten!

276
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:17,127
Hm?

277
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:20,294
Since the fireworks show
got shut down halfway
through, Neji and I were
thinking we could put on

278
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,027
a little light show of
our own tonight!

279
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:25,261
You'll join us, won't
you? We bought a whole
variety!

280
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:27,294
<i>I've got Sparklers,</i>
<i>spinners...</i>

281
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:30,461
Everything from the big
blasts to black snakes!

282
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:31,561
[gasping]

283
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:35,561
And it would not be a
party without rockets!

284
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,827
[grunting]
Not this again!

285
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:42,194
[panicking]

286
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:42,927
[screaming]

287
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,894
Why meeeeee!

288
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:46,861
[sighing]

289
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,927
Hmmm...

290
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:51,127
So it wasn't the
fireworks, huh?

291
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,061
Afraid not.

292
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:56,094
Maybe... there's some
important clue we're
missing.

293
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:59,027
Hmmmm...

294
00:16:59,061 --> 00:16:59,994
Whatcha doing?

295
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:04,894
Choji, hey! Do you recall
anything important
we have forgotten about
the fireworks show?!

296
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:07,061
Something important...

297
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,327
AGGHH!!!

298
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,661
We forgot to eat a
chocolate-covered banana!
Could that be it?

299
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:13,261
Chocolate-covered
banana?

300
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:17,961
Yes, that must be it.
Obviously Tenten did not
partake in the culinary
delight!

301
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:22,427
It's elementary really,
women love treats! I
don't know a woman
without a sweet tooth!

302
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:24,894
There is no time to
lose! Let us go!

303
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:30,261
Feast your eyes on this,
Tenten, we made a chocolate
fountain for you!

304
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:34,327
And we've got plenty of
goodies for dipping,
too! Some berries,
sponge cake-

305
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:38,294
Not to mention some
rice and spaghetti for
higher-quality carbs
thrown in to boot!

306
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:39,527
Mmm...

307
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:41,027
Hm?

308
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,094
Anyway, let us eat until
we are covered head to toe
in chocolate!

309
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:47,561
[gagging]

310
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,227
[sighing]

311
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:55,194
I give up.

312
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:58,061
Same here... I'm all out
of ideas.

313
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,894
Yeah, I guess I got
nothing either, you guys.

314
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:04,361
Hey, why don't you
ask Shikamaru? He'll
probably know.

315
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:06,194
Oh yeah, Shikamaru.

316
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:11,427
We should have started
with him... Shikamaru's
IQ is over 200, he'll
know what to do!

317
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:13,094
Huh?

318
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:17,894
Oh man, you guys are
dumber than a pile of
rocks. She turned down
chocolate, she just

319
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:21,127
sighed at fireworks, and
you really still don't
know?

320
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:25,127
There's only one thing on
earth that'll drop a
woman into that kind
of funk.

321
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:27,161
Well, do not just stand
there, tell us!

322
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,361
Love, my friend. Love.

323
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:31,227
Whaaat?!

324
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:34,194
L-L-L-Love?! Tenten
is--uhhh!

325
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:38,927
He's right, that
depressed attitude is
just what you'd expect of
someone tortured by love!

326
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,094
She drop any hints
recently?

327
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:44,394
She bump into anyone
lately? An old flame?

328
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:45,261
[gasping]

329
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:51,127
Of course, it all makes
sense now! Now I understand!
Tenten has been--

330
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:55,961
Neji, follow me! There
is no time to waste! Tenten
needs our help, ASAP!

331
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:58,094
What're you talking
about, Lee?!

332
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:00,994
<i>Hey!</i>

333
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:01,594
Hm?

334
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:04,127
What's with all the
long faces, you guys?

335
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,227
Huh?

336
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:12,027
Lady Tsunade...

337
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:15,027
What's wrong? You look
somewhat troubled.

338
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,861
Yeah... a
little.

339
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:21,994
Well moping won't help,
ya wanna talk about it?

340
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,327
Ya might feel better if
ya get it off your chest.

341
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,161
Hm.

342
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:30,827
Lady Tsunade...
it's just that--

343
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:34,294
What?!

344
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:36,994
He called you the
"resident straightman"?!

345
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:40,927
Yeah. During the
fireworks show...

346
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:44,361
Ugh. The resident
straightman, eh?

347
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:46,627
The resident
straightman?

348
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:51,861
It's not like I enjoy it,
okay?! Oh, I don't know
what I'm doing with my life.

349
00:19:51,894 --> 00:19:53,127
Uh--

350
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,627
[crying]
Ever since...

351
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:55,861
Hey, look!
It's the stooge!

352
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,494
Let us have it!

353
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,261
Aaaahhh!

354
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:05,361
Maybe I only do
punchlines, and sarcastic
remarks, but everyone's
constantly setting me up!

355
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:08,027
It's not like it's
my "thing" or anything.

356
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,261
And honestly? It's
gotten to the point
where

357
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,527
I'm really starting
to question what I'm
doing with my life.

358
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:18,527
Well if you want my advice,
I'd say don't sweat it 'cause
you're fine the way you are.

359
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:19,427
Huh?

360
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:24,394
Plus, Lee and Neji are
worried sick about you.
They don't know what to
do with themselves.

361
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:25,461
Huh?

362
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:26,927
Wait, really?

363
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:31,394
Chin up now, Tenten, your
reactions are what keep
everyone on their toes.

364
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:33,594
Are you with me here?

365
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:34,827
Uh--

366
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:38,561
Yes! And thank
you so much!

367
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:42,194
Well, well, well, speak
of the devil.

368
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:42,994
Huh?

369
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:46,527
Lee, Neji...

370
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:49,527
I'm really sorry I had
you guys so worried about
me.

371
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:52,427
Not at all, we should
be apologizing.

372
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,227
We finally realized what
was wrong.

373
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:57,494
You've clearly been
weighed down by a
romantic quandary.

374
00:20:57,527 --> 00:20:58,394
Huh?!

375
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:03,827
And really... in
hindsight, the signs
you were showing were
obvious.

376
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,427
Wait... What??!

377
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:10,327
And given who he is, I
don't blame you in the
least for being upset.

378
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,594
After all, this is a
forbidden of love we are
dealing with here.

379
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:16,861
But we steeled ourselves
and headed out to talk to
him about it!

380
00:21:16,894 --> 00:21:20,927
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa--
hold on a second-who
exactly did you go and
see?!?

381
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:23,594
Who else? Orochimaru,
of course!

382
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:25,427
Tenten is in
love with you!

383
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:27,494
Please, at least meet
with her!

384
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,061
What the what?!?!?

385
00:21:29,094 --> 00:21:32,394
You've gotta be
kidding me! You can
just forget it!

386
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:34,627
[straining]

387
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,594
Put him out of your mind,
there are plenty of fish
in the sea.

388
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:39,927
Yeah, so cheer up, okay,
Tenten?

389
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:47,127
[anger building]
What?! What?!

390
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:49,961
Are both of your heads
broken or something?!?!?!

391
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:51,094
Ah!

392
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:53,394
I mean how stupid
are you two?!

393
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:54,561
<i>How can you say that?!</i>

394
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:57,327
The only one's who
are gonna have heart
problems are you!

395
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:58,661
[groaning]

396
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:00,327
Idiot! Idiot!

397
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:04,861
<i>Tenten, the truth is,</i>
<i>without you... we really</i>
<i>don't have a show.</i>

398
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:49,592
I am so glad you're not
upset anymore, Tenten!

399
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:55,858
Now look at the line up
for next time! Summer means
Seashell Styles and
Watermelon Wars!

400
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:59,892
<i>What does Seashell Styles</i>
<i>even mean? It doesn't</i>
<i>make any sense, even for</i>
<i>a summer show!</i>

401
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:01,692
Yeah, that is
a weird one, huh?

402
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:05,492
I have previewed it, too.
None of the girls in the
show have what I would
call "watermelons".

403
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:08,392
<i>Shut up! That's not what</i>
<i>the title means!</i>

404
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:13,125
Ow, Tenten!! Your
reactions are even more
intense now than ever!
