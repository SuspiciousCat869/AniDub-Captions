1
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:57,405
Welcome back! We join the
gang in the middle of a
big summer trip they've all
been looking forward to. Some

2
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:58,738
more than others...

3
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:00,972
This class trip is
going to be awesomely
awesome!

4
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:02,672
Agh!

5
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:06,538
We're not here to tell
everyone how great this
place is! This is a
training excursion!

6
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:08,505
And it's not just
our class, either!

7
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,605
Oh, so that is why
Konohamaru is here
with us, too!

8
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:17,672
But still, I will enjoy
this! Getting the day off
to visit the old capital
is a rare treat for us!

9
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:24,838
I want to see the sights
with all of my friends!

10
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:30,572
That's funny, 'cause it looks
like the only person you're
imagining being with is Sakura.

11
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:34,438
Regardless, let us all
go out and have a blast!

12
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:36,372
Yeah!

13
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:46,272
<i>"A Field Trip to the</i>
<i>Old Capital!"</i>

14
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:51,272
You're all free to go
sightseeing for the rest
of the day!

15
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,305
I wanna go and
visit the temples!

16
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:57,272
I think I'm going to buy
some oil blotting paper
from the makeup store in
Kawara.

17
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:59,272
Oh! Yeah, I wanna
do that too.

18
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,238
I need some as well.
So I will go with
you, Sakura.

19
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:07,305
She means papers for
blotting the oil on
your face.

20
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:11,805
We'll split up into groups
of three, and to see who's
in which one, we'll have
a lottery.

21
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:13,438
A lottery?! No way!

22
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:20,605
<i>At least this way, I have</i>
<i>a chance to be in the same</i>
<i>group as Sakura!</i>

23
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:24,538
But I'm on the same team
as she is! I figured that
I'd be in her group for sure!

24
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:28,405
I know what you are
thinking, Naruto...

25
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,372
<i>Bushy Brow wants</i>
<i>in her group, too!</i>

26
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:35,405
I will be in Sakura's
group, and there's nothing
you can do about it!

27
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:36,505
Bushy Brow!

28
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:40,538
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

29
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:44,372
[giggling]

30
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:49,538
[groaning]

31
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:53,405
Remember, everyone, you
have to meet back at the
inn in three hours!

32
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:55,172
<i>Okay!</i>

33
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,405
<i>All right, ladies!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

34
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,238
So what do you want to
do first? See the temples
or go shopping?

35
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,638
I don't know, that's
a tough call.

36
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:02,905
<i>Hold it, you!</i>

37
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:07,905
Please, Konohamaru, I
am begging you, here!
Trade teams with me!

38
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:09,672
Forget that!
Trade with me!

39
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:11,872
Uh, you're both
scaring me, guys!

40
00:04:11,905 --> 00:04:12,772
<i>Enough!</i>

41
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,438
[groaning]

42
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:18,338
Listen, rules are
rules. I won't allow
switching.

43
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:20,938
But why do I have to
be stuck with Naruto?

44
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:23,672
Come on! I should be
asking that about you!

45
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:25,738
There's something you
two need to remember...

46
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:26,438
Huh?

47
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:31,838
I expect you to behave.
Anyone who starts causing
trouble will be forced
to sit in their room...

48
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,905
...on their knees.

49
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:38,438
Us cause trouble?
Never! Right, Naruto?

50
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:40,372
Righter than Right,
Bushy Brow!

51
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:45,472
It seems there is no getting
out of this. We will just
have to visit the same places
as Sakura!

52
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:47,238
<i>Sounds like a plan.</i>

53
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:51,705
So, Sakura, tell me!
Where do you think your
group is going to head
first today?

54
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:53,405
They are gone!

55
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:57,638
Sakura?!

56
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:03,338
What's the big idea?
You punks just stepped
on my foot!

57
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:04,305
I am sorry.

58
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,905
Yeah, I'm sorry, too

59
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:10,472
That's what you
call an apology?

60
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:11,905
Where ya from?
What school?

61
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:14,338
Well, I think
Sakura is cool?

62
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:16,272
No, not what's cool!
What's school?!

63
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:19,372
You know what, guys?
I think we'd better
teach these punks a
lesson!

64
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:20,772
We're gonna have to
whoop these chumps!

65
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,538
I do not want to sit on
my knees for causing trouble!

66
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:26,538
They started it, and if
we don't finish it, we're
cowards!

67
00:05:26,572 --> 00:05:31,205
I am no coward! But if
we fight them, we will be
just like autumn skies to
a flame.

68
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:34,205
Get it right! The expression
is, like roundworms to a flame!

69
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:37,838
No, you are wrong! It is,
fly, fly, fly; flutter,
flutter to a flame!

70
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:41,672
You're both so wrong I
doubt you've ever been
right! It's like moths
to a flame!

71
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:45,372
And why are we even
bothering to argue about
their argument anyway?!

72
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:47,338
Here, eat this!

73
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:51,572
Huh?!

74
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:56,438
I don't get it!
Where'd they go?!

75
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:05,538
Ugh, you know, if I hadn't
used the Substitution Jutsu
back there, you two would've
caused a huge scene!

76
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:08,738
It is all because Naruto
wanted to fight with
those delinquents!

77
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:11,438
I had no choice after
you went and stepped
on his foot!

78
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,938
You guys! Listen to me!
Hey! You stepped
on it, too!

79
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:18,572
I do not have time to
argue with you, Naruto!
I have to go and find out
where Sakura has gone!

80
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,238
Not without me,
you don't!

81
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:25,305
Why do I always have to
get dragged into their
foolishness?!

82
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,938
Hold up, what're we
doing at a temple, anyway?

83
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,838
Remember what Tenten
and Sakura said?

84
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:38,972
So what do you want
to do first? See the
temples or go shopping?

85
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,938
I don't know.
That's a tough call.

86
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:42,838
This was simply
our first option!

87
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:45,838
N-Naruto?

88
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,538
Huh?

89
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:47,905
Hinata!

90
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:50,638
Hey, what's going
on, Hinata?

91
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:52,872
Oh...well...
um...

92
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:56,905
Stay calm. Just don't
startle her, and eventually
she'll speak.

93
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:58,605
I know, you don't
have to tell me.

94
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:03,372
But I really want to
hurry and get to the
next place that Sakura
and her group might be!

95
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:05,338
So do I, but
we can't yet!

96
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,638
We're a team.
We move as one.

97
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:11,172
So, I um...

98
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,938
Five minutes later...

99
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:15,505
Well, uh...

100
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:19,172
Ten minutes later...

101
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:20,905
Uhh...

102
00:07:22,938 --> 00:07:25,372
And twenty minutes later...

103
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:27,172
Um...

104
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:30,405
We're lucky to
have such nice
weather!

105
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:32,405
That's the best
you could do?!

106
00:07:32,438 --> 00:07:34,172
[whining]

107
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,105
Uh...

108
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:37,838
<i>You two...</i>

109
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,272
How dare you hurt
Hinata's feelings?!

110
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:45,105
[screaming]

111
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:48,272
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

112
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:52,072
It is hopeless.
We have completely
lost Sakura.

113
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,572
And it's your fault,
Bushy Brow!

114
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:57,438
No, you are wrong!
You are the one who
poured the oil on the
fire!

115
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:59,472
Wait! Oil!

116
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:03,938
I think I'm going to
buy some oil blotting
paper from that makeup
store in Kawara!

117
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,905
She said oil
blotting paper!

118
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:15,938
I don't see her
group anywhere!

119
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,372
Wait, what are you
doing now, Bushy Brow.

120
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:20,838
Sakura will be thrilled
if I buy these for her!

121
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:22,705
Good idea! I'll
get her these!

122
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:24,972
[charging yell]

123
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:25,805
Huh?

124
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,838
Aw, man! Look at the
size of this line!

125
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:30,438
<i>We do not have</i>
<i>time to waste!</i>

126
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:34,238
It's that woman at the
front. She's buying
a ton of stuff!

127
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,905
Then we have no choice.

128
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:38,105
Listen, lady, just
give it up!

129
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:41,505
Buying all that makeup
is not going to make
you young again, you know!

130
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,172
Oh, yeah?

131
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:46,705
Okay, thanks so
much for the tip.

132
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:49,805
[screaming]

133
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:57,205
Where are Naruto and
Big Bro Bushy Brows?
I gotta find 'em before
it's too late!

134
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:58,938
[screaming]

135
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:02,738
Why did it have to
be Lady Tsunade...

136
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:04,405
And why'd she
hit me too?!

137
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:06,472
You just had to
open your big mouth!

138
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,938
You opened
yours first!

139
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:09,505
This is all
your fault!

140
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:11,338
No, it is
all yours!

141
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:13,405
Big Brothers Naruto
and Bushy Brows!

142
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:14,338
Huh?!

143
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,438
What's up, Konohamaru?

144
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:21,772
Big trouble is what's up!
A bunch of bad guys are
harassing Sakura and Tenten
and won't leave 'em alone!

145
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:25,138
I tried to protect them,
but those punks were too
much for me!

146
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:27,172
What?! Sakura
and Tenten?!

147
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:30,438
Bushy Brow, I know we've
been fighting all day
long, but...

148
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:31,872
Say no more!

149
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,305
I declare a truce!

150
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,305
C'mon, doll face,
don't be shy!

151
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,272
We'll go eat some of
the old capital's
famous extra-thick ramen.

152
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:56,472
It's great! They put
green onions on the
top!

153
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:59,105
We're not going
anywhere with you!
Right, Sakura?!

154
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:01,872
Yeah! I hate thick
ramen! I like it
brothy!

155
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,238
That's the issue?!

156
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,138
Listen, you
my be cute...

157
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,905
...but don't you get
sassy, or we'll stop
being so nice, you got
it?

158
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:12,872
You're coming with
us, even if you
don't wanna!

159
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:13,738
Hold it!

160
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,105
Huh?!

161
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:16,905
I know that voice.

162
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:17,872
It's Lee!

163
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,038
Uh...

164
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:25,972
Hey! It's those two
guys from before!

165
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,338
Let us do it, Naruto!

166
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:28,805
Roger!
You got it!

167
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:37,005
This is so dumb, it's
making me dumber just
looking at it!

168
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:38,072
[attacking yell]

169
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,405
Forget it, Lee!
You can't copy
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

170
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,805
What is with
these guys?!

171
00:10:42,838 --> 00:10:46,338
Now take this! Shimura-
Style Clone Secret Strike!

172
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:48,205
Wow!

173
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:54,872
Huh?!

174
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:04,938
Naruto, we have been so
foolish fighting amongst
ourselves the way we have!

175
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:11,005
You're right. We've finally
got some vacation time, and
we're gonna get way more out
of it if we both work together!

176
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,038
Good grief, just
look at them...

177
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:16,805
That was totally
cool, you guys!

178
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:19,272
Why do they have to
keep wearing those
outfits?

179
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:22,905
Why don't we go buy
some souvenirs! Come
on, we'll go together!

180
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:24,038
Sakura!

181
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:30,305
And so, Naruto and Lee
made up and went shopping
for make-up with Sakura.
Their plan went off without

182
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:34,238
a hitch. Well, without
a lot of hitches. Okay,
despite the hitches!

183
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:35,205
But...

184
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:40,338
Their sensei soon heard
about all the troubles
that they caused, and the
friends were forced to

185
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:44,772
sit on their knees
together. And they
lived happily ever
after.

186
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,105
How did I get
dragged into this?

187
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:03,185
Night fell on the field
trip we're calling a
training excursion.

188
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:09,318
It's now past curfew...

189
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:11,718
And when she turned
around she saw...

190
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:14,485
Man, Konohamaru is taking
forever to get back!

191
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:15,418
Huh?

192
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:17,718
Well, I got
the drinks!

193
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:20,251
That is good
work, Konohamaru!

194
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:22,518
I guess, but it sure
took you long enough!

195
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,718
Come on, give me
a break, Naruto!

196
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:28,551
If the instructors
caught me, I'd have to
sit on my knees all night!

197
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:30,118
My heart was racing!

198
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:36,618
Okay! Our night of
fun begins right now!

199
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:38,285
So, cheers!

200
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,318
[screaming]

201
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:54,251
<i>"Girls' Rooms and</i>
<i>Candy Boxes."</i>

202
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,485
You guys, I'm
so sorry.

203
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:02,551
Come on! Don't you know
when you run with fizzy
drinks they get all
shaken up?!

204
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,318
Easy, Naruto.

205
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,451
So, what're we
gonna do now?

206
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,018
There's just
one choice!

207
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:10,785
We go to the girls'
room to hang out!

208
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:11,685
Huh?!

209
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,385
The girls' room?!

210
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,751
Of course! When you are
on a training excursion
that is actually a field
trip, sneaking off to go

211
00:13:18,785 --> 00:13:23,185
hang out with the girls,
is the climax of the
whole event!

212
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:26,318
Bushy Brow! This might
be your best idea ever!

213
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:27,718
Yeah! Count me in!

214
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,751
Do they have snacks?

215
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:31,518
You bet! Of
course they do!

216
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:34,585
Yes, a girls' room is
like one big box of
sweet treats.

217
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:36,785
Do you want to come?

218
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:38,418
Well, no, not
especially.

219
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:43,751
Then again, I suppose
one of you oafs might
try something funny
with Lady Hinata.

220
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:47,418
All right. I guess I'd
better tag a long to
chaperone.

221
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,985
Yeah!

222
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,485
You're up for this,
right, Shikamaru?

223
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:55,318
What a drag. I'm not
gonna go hang out with
some girls.

224
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:56,585
Shikamaru...

225
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,585
You're so lame
sometimes!

226
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,051
Well, we cannot
force him to go.

227
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:04,118
So? What's the
plan, then?

228
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:09,451
For starters, we don't
even know which room
Tenten and the others
are in right now.

229
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:15,185
<i>And if the instructors</i>
<i>catch us, we'll be sitting</i>
<i>on our knees 'till sunrise!</i>

230
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:19,585
That is true...

231
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:24,518
Okay! I'll go scouting
and find the girls' room!
I owe you! After that
fiasco with the drinks!

232
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:26,385
Are you sure
you can do it?

233
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:30,185
Just have faith in me!
Please, Big Brother
Bushy Brows!

234
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:33,551
All right, then! We
are all counting on you!

235
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:46,018
Wow, Sakura, they're
awesome! Let me see
again! C'mon, c'mon!

236
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,318
Huh? Uh... Um...
I just... Soft drink?

237
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,551
Uhhh...

238
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,785
Man, Konohamaru is
taking forever!

239
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:02,118
I hope that nothing
has gone wrong.

240
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,085
<i>Maybe one of the</i>
<i>sensei caught him.</i>

241
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:05,518
I will go take a look.

242
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:15,118
Hmm...

243
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:16,685
Hmm...

244
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:18,151
Hmm...

245
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:19,185
Uhh...

246
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:21,718
Uhh...

247
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,718
Sensei, pawn
to 2-D.

248
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:25,118
This note...

249
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:28,451
It's definitely
Konohamaru's writing.

250
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:30,151
And what does
it say?

251
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:35,185
Hmm, let's see. It says,
"The girls' are in the
last room at the north
end of the hall."

252
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:38,518
That must mean that
Konohamaru has succeeded!

253
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:42,018
But where is he?
Why did he just
leave a note?

254
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:47,251
Neji, you are up.

255
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:48,285
Byakugan!

256
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,718
[screaming]

257
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,618
Neji!

258
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:03,385
Hm?!

259
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:07,385
I saw something no
one should ever see.

260
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:08,718
What do you mean?
What was it?

261
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,051
A grisly murder scene?

262
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:12,385
Or a scary ghost
just wandering by?

263
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,185
Konohamaru was stuck
sitting on his knees.

264
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:17,418
We were right!

265
00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:22,785
Poor Konohamaru has made
the ultimate sacrifice
in order to leave us
this precious letter!

266
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:24,518
Konohamaru!

267
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,751
He grew from a boy
to a man while we
weren't looking!

268
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:29,551
Is it really
worth crying over?

269
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:35,085
We cannot let his
sacrifice be in vain!
We must make it to the
girls' room to hang out!

270
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:35,985
Yeah!
Yeah!

271
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:40,185
I think you just want
to go, and you'll make up
whatever excuse it takes!

272
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:48,685
What do we do?! We have to
get past the Sensei's room,
but if we just walk by,
we'll get busted!

273
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:52,485
<i>Yeah, we're up against</i>
<i>Kakashi Sensei and</i>
<i>Bushier Brow Sensei.</i>

274
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:58,018
Are you serious?! We
just have to charge in
and snatch defeat from
the jaws of victory!

275
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:01,385
I think you mean to
say, "snatch victory
from the jaws of defeat."

276
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:04,018
The jaws of
defeat! That's
it!

277
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:09,785
Here's the plan: we send
someone to get inside their
room, splash drinks on their
clothes, and get them both

278
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:15,551
good and soaking wet!
The two of them will then
have to head to the big
bathroom to get cleaned up.

279
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:21,085
And we'll take that
opportunity to run to
the last room on the
north end!

280
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:23,318
Wow, Neji! What
an excellent plan!

281
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:24,685
Let's get to it, then!

282
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:28,451
Huh, that's funny. I
thought you didn't
even want to go, Neji.

283
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:29,285
Hmph!

284
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,985
[whimpering]

285
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,685
Sensei...

286
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:37,085
[groaning]

287
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:39,185
Big Brother
Bushy Brows!

288
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:44,651
Konohamaru, we have a
plan. We will get both
of them to run off to
the bath and thereby

289
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,351
open a path to victory!

290
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:50,085
<i>Wow! I'm impressed!</i>
<i>You didn't give up!</i>

291
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:53,485
What's wrong, Lee?
You look a bit under
the weather.

292
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:58,185
Sensei, I think I have
a fever. Could you please
give me something cold to
drink?

293
00:17:58,218 --> 00:17:59,751
Something cold
to drink?

294
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,585
Hold on, I'll check.

295
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:03,418
Hm...

296
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:06,085
Here, drink up.

297
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:11,418
Now is my chance! I
just have to pretend
to sneeze and do a
Leaf Whirlwind!

298
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:12,485
Ah!

299
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:14,218
Ah!

300
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:16,151
Ah!

301
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:17,418
Achoo!

302
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:21,351
Ahh!

303
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:26,018
What?! I missed!
Noooooo!

304
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:27,785
You sneezed
all over me!

305
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:29,251
He messed
it all up!

306
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:31,485
Choji! It's time
for plan B!

307
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:32,385
Mm-hm!

308
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:35,718
Sensei, I'm really
thirsty now!

309
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:37,618
<i>He's not even acting?!</i>

310
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,585
Huh? Oh, help yourself
to anything on the table.

311
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:41,933
[chuckling]

312
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,285
Thanks, Sensei!

313
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:46,085
And now he's really
drinking it?!

314
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:48,151
Choji, do not
forget the plan!

315
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:50,118
Oh! I forgot!

316
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:53,551
Ahhhh!

317
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:55,618
[screaming]

318
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,618
You guys stink
at this!

319
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,551
E-Excuse me!

320
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:01,885
Huh?

321
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:04,451
I started a fire and I
can't seem to put it out!
Can you help me?!

322
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:07,251
They're never going
to buy that, Naruto!

323
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:08,651
Fine...

324
00:19:09,385 --> 00:19:11,551
Water style,
Bucket Relay!

325
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,651
[grunting]

326
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:18,018
This is not
going well...

327
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,285
Now go to bed!

328
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:26,018
Naruto and Big Brother
Bushy Brows' plan has
completely failed!

329
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:27,785
Those kids sure
are a handful!

330
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:30,118
Now I'm thirsty.

331
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:35,051
Oh, right. Choji
drank everything.

332
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:35,951
Sensei!

333
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:39,018
I still got the two
drinks I bought earlier!

334
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:41,151
Oh, how nice of you!

335
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:42,451
Thanks a million!

336
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,218
Yes!

337
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:52,018
You don't shake up
carbonated drinks!

338
00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:56,018
My- my eyes!

339
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:59,651
Now the two of them
will have to go in
the main bath!

340
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,751
They have a
private shower?!

341
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,118
Hurry up!

342
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:08,551
Huh. The faucet
won't turn.

343
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:09,451
Is that...

344
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:12,285
I think it's
Shikamaru's Shadow
Pull!

345
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:19,818
Hmph!

346
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,518
You guys sure can
be a real drag!

347
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:23,651
Shikamaru!

348
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:25,218
Nice one, buddy!

349
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:28,251
Forget it, I'm
going to the
big bath!

350
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:29,185
<i>Wait up!</i>

351
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:32,685
We did it!

352
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,118
You guys rule!

353
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,018
We got past Guy Sensei
and Kakashi Sensei!

354
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,585
To the girls' room!
Full speed ahead!

355
00:20:42,718 --> 00:20:44,318
Well, we made it.

356
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:45,685
Yeah!

357
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:48,718
It is all thanks to
Konohamaru bravely
leaving that letter
for us.

358
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:52,685
You know, Konohamaru.
I'm proud of you!

359
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,551
Mmm...
Big Bro...

360
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:03,185
But what letter did you
mean? All I did was get
caught and sit on my
knees all night long.

361
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:05,418
What?! Then
who wrote it?

362
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:13,751
[burp]

363
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:15,385
Huh?

364
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:17,585
[screaming]

365
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:20,118
I'll explain...

366
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:27,285
You see, the letter that
Lee and the others thought
was from Konohamaru was
actually written by Kakashi,

367
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:31,118
who used his Sharingan to
copy Konohamaru's handwriting.

368
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:36,385
Actually, Tenten, Sakura,
and the girls were in the
second to the last room on
the north end of the hall,

369
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:39,085
and Lady Tsunade was
in the last one.

370
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:42,451
Oh, noooo!

371
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:48,185
You boys, you got
guts, I'll give
you that!

372
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:50,751
[screaming]

373
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:53,518
Hmm...

374
00:21:56,151 --> 00:22:02,018
Lee and the others played
right into Kakashi and Guy's
hands- and fell right onto
their own knees.

375
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:07,251
And there they sat until
the sun came up. But, uh,
maybe we won't wait around
for that...

376
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,193
Guy, it's preview time!

377
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,060
<i>Oh, yeah! I'll do it</i>
<i>sitting on my knees!</i>

378
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:53,760
Why are you on
your knees, too?

379
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:57,427
<i>The kids don't get to</i>
<i>do all the training!</i>
<i>I want in on it, too!</i>

380
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,527
Oh, whatever.

381
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,227
Anyway, the titles for
next time are...

382
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:06,393
"The No-Ninja Jutsu Lifestyle!"
and "I Want to Share an Umbrella
<i>With Sakura."</i>

383
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:10,127
<i>Whew! My legs are numb!</i>
<i>You handle the rest,</i>
<i>Kakashi!</i>

384
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,360
I did! Pay attention!
Wait, you're numb already?!
