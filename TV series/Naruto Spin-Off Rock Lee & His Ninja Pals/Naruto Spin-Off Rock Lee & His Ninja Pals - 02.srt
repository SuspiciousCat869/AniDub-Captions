1
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:59,689
As always, Rock Lee spends
his days working hard to
become an outstanding ninja,
even if he can not use ninjutsu.

2
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:03,589
However, he's also
working hard to find
romance!

3
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:11,556
This is Sakura Haruno.
She's a member of Naruto's
team, but what's more, she's
the target of our dear Lee's

4
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,289
amorous affections!

5
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:16,256
What pretty flowers!

6
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,289
Hi, Sakura!

7
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,089
How would you like to
go on a date with me?!

8
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:24,422
Ahh...Egh...

9
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:25,189
[gasp]

10
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:29,256
I'm sorry. It's
just that I...

11
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,122
...don't like thick
eyebrows.

12
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:33,389
Ahhhhh!

13
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:43,256
<i>"Love Is a Part of</i>
<i>the Springtime of</i>
<i>Youth!"</i>

14
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:47,703
Why, oh why?!

15
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:51,903
Yet again, Sakura has
turned me down and
broken my heart!

16
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:57,537
Get a grip, Lee! She just
said no to a date. You
don't have to act so beaten
up about it.

17
00:02:57,837 --> 00:03:04,503
I am not beaten up! It is
just that with her, my heart
is vulnerable, and she has
landed a critical hit...

18
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:06,703
Too bad that it
wasn't actually
fatal...

19
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:12,903
If you ask me, this just
proves guys don't have
anything even close to a
clue about how women think.

20
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:18,103
Who in their right mind
would fall for someone
who just jumped in front of
them and blew them a kiss?

21
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:20,903
Oh?! Then how can
I win her heart?!

22
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:25,703
Don't try so hard.
Let's see now, maybe
you could play it cool?

23
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,603
Play it cool?

24
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:29,637
Of course!

25
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:38,903
You sure do have a messed
up idea of what cool is...

26
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,637
So how should I act?

27
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:43,403
Well, that's not so
easy to explain.

28
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,737
Very well, then. I will
set up a situation to
learn a women's feelings.

29
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,970
[cheering]

30
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:03,637
Why did I agree
to this?

31
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,170
This day is all about
me! Uh, I mean the truth!

32
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,903
I must learn what
women like about men!

33
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,737
What do you like, Nejimi?

34
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,803
Well, they say girls like
tall, dark, and handsome
men...

35
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:20,770
Thanks so much! That
is very helpful pretty
lady. And just who is
you type, Tenko?

36
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,770
Well, I don't think it's
enough for a boy just to
look good.

37
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,603
Wait, what do you mean?

38
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:30,437
He's gotta be naturally
kind, too! And always
give me lots of presents
to keep me happy!

39
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,637
<i>Oh, and be open and honest</i>
<i>about his feelings. But</i>
<i>still take charge every</i>
<i>now and again.</i>

40
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,003
A guy like that would be
the absolute perfect man
for me!

41
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:42,770
Okay! It was worth
casting that genjutsu!

42
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:46,770
What're talking about?
That was just a skit!

43
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:52,003
Be naturally kind, keep
her happy with presents,
remain open and honest
with my feelings, and

44
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:56,403
take charge every now
and again. That is what
a really cool guy does?

45
00:04:56,437 --> 00:04:59,403
Uh... I guess so.
Pretty much...

46
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:03,403
Understood! With your
teachings I will become
the coolest guy ever!

47
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,937
Now I will launch another
romantic attack on Sakura!

48
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,437
Hope he'll be okay...

49
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,003
<i>Hey!</i>

50
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:09,770
Huh?

51
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,503
What's wrong?

52
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,803
I'm supposed to warn
everyone about the rogue
ninja that are hiding on the
outskirts of the village!

53
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:16,670
[gasps]

54
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:19,903
Hey, wait. Where's
Bushy Brow running
off to?

55
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:21,503
A journey of love...

56
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:22,703
What's that mean?

57
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:26,603
Hey, Naruto, what do you
think it is that makes a
guy cool?

58
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:29,870
Ha! That's easy! Treating
people to ramen of course!

59
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:31,903
Serves me right
for asking.

60
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:37,103
Well, I don't really know,
but people who protect those
who are important to them,
I guess.

61
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:41,837
Idiot...Idiot...

62
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:49,403
[sigh]

63
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:51,503
Maybe I'll take a
little break.

64
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:52,937
Hello, Sakura!

65
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,937
Lee?!

66
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:57,903
The first part of being
a cool guy is natural
kindness!

67
00:05:58,537 --> 00:06:01,603
One moment! Let me
clean that filthy
bench!

68
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,070
If i did this harder
it would be great arm
training!

69
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:08,770
Ahhh!

70
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,503
Wow, you really
love cleaning.

71
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,570
All set!

72
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,537
Uhh...

73
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:17,570
Hey, Lee!

74
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:18,537
Tenten?

75
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,703
Lee, listen to this-

76
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:23,037
I understand! You are
here to see me acting
cool, right?

77
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,370
Good timing! I am applying
your lessons on how to be
cool right now, and everything
is going great!

78
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:30,803
No, just listen to me!
There are some rogue-

79
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:34,470
But I am just getting
started! Now check this
out!

80
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:35,837
Wait! Ugh...

81
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:37,903
Huh?

82
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:42,703
The second part of
being a cool guy is
keeping her happy with
presents!

83
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,037
Here, Sakura! For you!

84
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,070
Uh...

85
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:49,937
What?!

86
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,637
Ah! Bees! I like the
flowers, but I could
do without the bees!

87
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,537
<i>Do not worry!</i>

88
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,437
I will pummel them with
precision punches!

89
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,403
Ah! Yah! Yi! Yah!
Yi! Yi! Yah!

90
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:02,637
The only one he's
pummeling is Sakura!

91
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,570
What's wrong with
you, Lee?!

92
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:09,370
Ahh! I am sorry! I was
not trying to hit you,
Sakura! I swear!

93
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:11,937
What a disaster!
I must move on!

94
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:16,937
No! The third part of
being a cool guy: be
open and honest about
your feelings!

95
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,537
Uh...Sakura. I wanted
to talk to you!

96
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,603
<i>This is uh, hard to</i>
<i>put into words, but...</i>

97
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:25,470
Lee?

98
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:26,003
Uh...

99
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:30,337
Ahhh! You ugly beast!

100
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:33,903
Ugly...

101
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:34,737
Uh...

102
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:37,403
That's what you
wanted to tell
me?!

103
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:38,403
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

104
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:40,437
[groaning]

105
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,537
It is getting worse!
My only chance now is
the fourth part of being
a cool guy!

106
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:49,570
But still take charge
every now and again...

107
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:54,403
I will take charge, plant
a kiss on her, and steal
her heart!

108
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:55,703
Don't try this
at home, kids.

109
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,437
Sakura...

110
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,537
Ahhhh!

111
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,870
Chaaa!

112
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:04,070
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

113
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,903
Lee, you're a jerk!
Just stay away from
me!

114
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,637
Uh...

115
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,570
Boy, what could have
gotten into Lee?

116
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:19,470
But then again, maybe
I was a little too
harsh on him...

117
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:20,337
[gasp]

118
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:27,570
Uh, you don't have to be
so upset, Lee. Sure, it
didn't go well, but don't
be such a sad sack!

119
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:31,003
Sad sack...
Sakura...

120
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:33,937
Look, just take
another whack at
it!

121
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:36,937
Whack...
Sakura...

122
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,570
Come on! Cheer up, would
ya?! The Lee I know would
bounce back!

123
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:45,870
Back...
Sack...
Sakura...

124
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:51,284
It's no use, he's just
getting more depressed!
Plus, he kinda forced
that last one!

125
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:52,044
Ahhhh!

126
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:53,070
There you are!

127
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:54,037
Neji!

128
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,570
Did you forget? You
know what Naruto said.

129
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,703
I'm supposed to warn
everyone about the rogue
ninja that are hiding on
the outskirts of the village!

130
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:03,570
Huh?

131
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:05,437
Oh, yeah! That's
right! I forgot!

132
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,837
They were spotted
somewhere in that
area over there.

133
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,770
That way...
Is where...

134
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:16,537
Sakura! They are in
for a surprise!

135
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,637
Keep your shirt on!

136
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,537
Ahhhhh!

137
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,870
No, Lee! Come
back here!

138
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:25,937
Back luck for you. We
can't let you live now
that you've seen us.

139
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:33,603
[chuckling]

140
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:36,537
What do I do?!
I'm outnumbered!

141
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,170
Hm!

142
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:38,870
Now die!

143
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:39,870
[gasp]

144
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:40,737
Agh!

145
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:43,437
[groaning]

146
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,737
Hornet Stinger!

147
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,570
Huh? It's Lee!

148
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:52,570
Uhh... Give me
a second...

149
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:54,937
You made yourself dizzy!

150
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,103
Who's this guy?! And
where'd he even come
from!

151
00:09:58,137 --> 00:09:59,370
Who cares? Get him!

152
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:00,570
Lee! No!

153
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:03,637
It is okay! Sit
tight and watch!

154
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,770
Hah! Ahhhh!

155
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,570
[fighting grunts]

156
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,703
Does he really
need to spin?

157
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:16,770
[groaning]

158
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:19,003
And that takes
care of that!

159
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:21,070
But Lee...
Why did...

160
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:23,903
After I said those
mean things to you...

161
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:26,003
But none of that
matters.

162
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:26,603
Huh?

163
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,670
I do not need a reason
to protect the people
dear to me!

164
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:33,003
[stunned gasp]

165
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:37,103
Let us go home, Sakura.

166
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,803
Uhh-ahh!

167
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:40,537
Uh...

168
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,670
Oh no you didn't!
Chaaaa!

169
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,570
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

170
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:53,537
Idiot...Idiot...Idiot...

171
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,037
[humming]

172
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,603
<i>Tenten!</i>

173
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:58,370
Huh?

174
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,470
Ahhhh!

175
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:04,570
So I guess you
blew it, huh?

176
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:05,703
Yes...

177
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:08,070
It seems that I am
just not cool.

178
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:11,937
That's not true! Come
on! You're plenty cool,
Lee!

179
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,003
[surprised gasp]

180
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:15,870
After all, you protected
your friend!

181
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:19,503
[crying]

182
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:20,603
Uhh...

183
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,603
How sweet, Tenten!

184
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:24,103
Ahhh!

185
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:26,103
Ahhhh-hah!

186
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,003
<i>Ahhhhhh!</i>

187
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:28,870
Oops! Sorry!

188
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:31,770
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

189
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:38,970
The journey of love isn't
finished in a day. Remember,
everyone, sometimes it's best
to play it cool!

190
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:56,426
A great poet once wrote,
"Love makes both people
involved do crazy things."

191
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:02,559
Now the question is: will
the same thing happen to
Rock Lee and the girl he
has a crush on?

192
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:03,459
[sigh]

193
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,293
Whatever can I do to
convince Sakura to fall
for me?

194
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:11,459
Well, you can start by
not being so forward.
What I think you really
need to do is try a

195
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:12,526
more subtle angle.

196
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,359
Huh?

197
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,726
An ankle?

198
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,393
No, I said, "angle!"

199
00:12:16,426 --> 00:12:21,626
You gotta be more casual!
Just send her a letter or
something. Maybe a love
letter!

200
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:23,626
A love letter!

201
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:33,259
<i>"Love Makes Both</i>
<i>Sides Crazy."</i>

202
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:50,626
This is perfect! She
will find my letter,
and then...

203
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:52,626
What's this?

204
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:59,426
Dear Sakura, to me, you
are like the pickles that
come on the side with curry
and rice. Even just thinking

205
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:04,593
about getting a plate of
curry that does not have the
pickles, reminds me of the
time at summer camp when I

206
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:09,826
got homesick because they
did not make curry like my
mom does. Merely the thought
of that moment is enough to

207
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,459
move me to tears.

208
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:13,426
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>does that mean?</i>

209
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,426
It's poetry, sheer
beautiful poetry!

210
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,526
Who could've written me
this wonderful romantic
letter?

211
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,893
Oh! And sent this
beautiful present!

212
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,693
That would be me!

213
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:24,559
[gasp]

214
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,659
Oh, Lee! No one has ever
said something so beautiful
to me!

215
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:31,593
Oh, Lee...

216
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:32,659
Yes, Sakura...

217
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:33,693
Oh, Lee!

218
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:34,793
Yes, Sakura!

219
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:36,559
I am yours.

220
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:39,759
Uh... What is up
with your face?

221
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:45,393
[humming]

222
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,259
It is all going
according to plan,
so far!

223
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,493
Now I just wait
till she reads it!

224
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:53,359
Ahhh!

225
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,259
W-What?!

226
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,959
That is not the letter
I wrote to her!

227
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:02,293
W-What is going on?!

228
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,726
Someone else sent
one, too?!

229
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:10,559
And just look how happy
she is! That can only
mean one thing, that she
is very excited about

230
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:12,959
receiving a love letter
from someone else!

231
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,826
Farewell, my youth! Hello,
crushing weight of my age!
It is only the second episode
and I have already lost the

232
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,859
heroine forever!

233
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:24,859
What's wrong, Bushy Brow?
You look really depressed.

234
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:25,926
[groaning]

235
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,626
<i>Is that?!</i>

236
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:32,759
It is! She has a
love letter from
someone else!

237
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:35,759
Someone else sent one?!
All right, who was it?!

238
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,626
I do not know,
but Sakura...

239
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:40,826
<i>She is so happy to</i>
<i>have gotten it!</i>

240
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:41,693
[giggle]

241
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,826
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

242
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:51,526
I forgot. You like
Sakura, too. Right,
Naruto?

243
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,926
Yeah, we're like two
peas in a pod, huh?

244
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,459
No, we are not!
Sakura is mine!

245
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:58,393
Wanna bet?!
She's gonna
pick me!

246
00:14:58,426 --> 00:15:00,693
[growling]

247
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:07,193
Look, Bushy Brow,
fighting each other
isn't going to help
anything.

248
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:09,393
So what are we
supposed to do?

249
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,193
I think I've got an idea!

250
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:15,693
[humming]

251
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:23,659
Okay, all we have to do
is steal the letter before
Sakura reads it.

252
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:28,926
Of course! Because that way
she will never know what it
said, and the truth will be
"lost for words."

253
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,393
No, I think you mean,
"lost in translation."

254
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:33,759
No, "lost to the ages!"

255
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:36,793
Then I will blast Sakura's
bag right off her shoulder!

256
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:38,459
Wind Style!

257
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:39,326
Huh?!

258
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:42,626
<i>I didn't think he could</i>
<i>use ninjutsu! When did</i>
<i>he learn that?!</i>

259
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:44,759
Leaf Revolution!

260
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,826
That attack blows!

261
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,493
That's nowhere near
enough wind. Just leave
this to me!

262
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:00,226
Uh, Naruto,
what is that?

263
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,259
Listen, if you're gonna
snatch someone's purse,
you don't want a sad little
gust of wind, you need-

264
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:05,493
<i>Please don't try</i>
<i>this at home, kids!</i>

265
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:09,293
...Heat of the sun!
At least I think I
remember reading that
somewhere!

266
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:22,459
Boy! It's getting hot!

267
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:24,526
Ahh!

268
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,226
<i>She is going to put her</i>
<i>handbag down! Nice, Naruto!</i>

269

[gasp]

270
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:30,993
Uh-oh...

271
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:33,926
That was pointless. With
your hands full, you
could not grab her bag.

272
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,993
Just hang on! I still
have my secret backup
plan!

273
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:37,959

[groaning]

275
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:44,459
My alarm did not go off!
I will be late for my
first day of school!

276
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:47,293
That's it, Bushy
Brow! Keep it up!

277
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:50,426

going, would ya?

00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,626
[bell ringing]

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,493
[gasp]

282
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:03,459
Huh!

283
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:05,459
It's you!
It is you!

284
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,559
I call this my, "Crash into

Ah...

00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:31,526
Ah! I am so sorry!
Are you hurt, ma'am!

292
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,893
Hold on tight! I will
get you to the hospital!

293
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:41,559
Bushy Brow! You're
killing me here!

[sigh]

295
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:44,659
This is getting
us nowhere.

296
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:49,693
And we're getting there
fast! Alls we've done is
put her on guard even
more! At this rate,

297
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:52,393
she won't want to open
her handbag ever again!

298
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:53,693
Open her handbag...

299
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:55,359
That is it, Naruto!

300
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:55,993
Huh?

301
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,759
We will have
her open it!

302
00:17:58,026 --> 00:17:58,959
What?

303
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,959
Hey, Haruno!

304
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:03,659
Huh?

305
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:07,326
Stop! We must
inspect your bag!

306
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:10,859
What?! Hold on!
Who are you guys?

307
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:15,826
Guidance counselors sent
to put a stop to any
behavior that is unbecoming
of a ninja from our village.

308
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:17,959
No, I mean...
Guidance ninja!

309
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:20,259
What the heck's
a guidance ninja?

310
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,493
We just need to take a
look in your bag. We've
had problems with a whole
lot of ninja lately.

311
00:18:24,526 --> 00:18:27,359
Carrying items unrelated
to their mission, ya know.

312
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:31,793
Uh! What items?!
I'll just have to...
Wing it!

313
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:33,726
Sorry for the
trouble! Now...

314
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:34,859
Hey, hold on!

315
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,659
<i>No! It is not</i>
<i>here, Naruto!</i>

316
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:43,559
C'mon! What're you
doing, Bushy Brow!
Hurry it up!

317
00:18:43,593 --> 00:18:45,393
<i>I am trying to</i>
<i>tell you-</i>

318
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:46,393
<i>Are you finished?</i>

319
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,326
Uh... Just a
moment longer!

320
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,959
Uh... Faster!

321
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,493
<i>Wait! Almost done!</i>

322
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,593
[gasps]

323
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:58,459
[shocked breathing]

324
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:02,859
Are those really
Sakura's panties?!

325
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,559
No! No, this is
not the time!

326
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:08,826
I have to concentrate
on finding that love
letter!

327
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:14,826
But then again, this
may be the only chance
that I ever get to see
them in all their glory!

328
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:20,559
<i>No! What is wrong with</i>
<i>me?! Naruto would be</i>
<i>disgusted if he knew!</i>

329
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:25,759
<i>Even with those panties</i>
<i>staring him in the face,</i>
<i>Naruto is focused on that</i>
<i>love letter!</i>

330
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:29,826
<i>Wait! He is completely</i>
<i>focused on the panties!</i>

331
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:30,759
<i>Naruto!</i>

332
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:32,593
Oh! Right!

333
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,359
Can you guys please
hurry this up?

334
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:36,026
Uh, just a sec!
Almost done!

335
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:42,226
It looks like you are in
need of some guidance!
You are hiding something
from us, Haruno!

336
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:42,959
[shocked gasp]

337
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:44,293
Like what?!

338
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:46,959
Your reaction
just proves it!

339
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:51,893
If you have black panties
in there, then you probably
have a black bra, too!

340
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,793
A chunin is too
young for-

341
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:54,859
Agghh...

342
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,559
What in the hell did
you just say to me?!

343
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:02,893
[screaming]

344
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:07,459
[screaming]

345
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:09,893
Oh no! I sent
'em flying!

346
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,326
Huh?

347
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:20,759
Wait, it's a girdle?!

348
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,759
That is so misleading!

349
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:23,959
Why does she have that?!

350
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:27,559
Come to think of it,
she said her stomach
was bothering her.

351
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:31,559
Never mind that! The plan
was a bust, but now we
have her handbag!

352
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:33,059
All right...

353
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:35,426
The only thing left to
do is grab the love
letter the other guy wrote!

354
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,226
Y'know!

355
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:41,526
Ahhhh!

356
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:42,859
Huh?

357
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:43,693
Huh?

358
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,493
<i>Naruto fish cake?</i>

359
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:46,759
Pickles?

360
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:49,526
Wait! That's my letter!

361
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,293
Huh?

362
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:53,359
What are you
guys up to?

363
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,659
Oh! We, uh...

364
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:57,726
Did you see any
letters land over
here?

365
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:00,659
I got two love letters
out of the blue today.

366
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,826
I don't know who
sent them, though...

367
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:03,726
What?!

368
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:08,726
That's such a shame.
I really wanted to
read them later, too.

369
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,726
I see. So the other
person was you, Naruto!

370
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,459
Bushy Brow, you...

371
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,526
Ahhh!

372
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:22,826
Don't worry! I'll explain.
You see, both of them snuck
a love letter into Sakura's
handbag!

373
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,559
Aw, man!

374
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,859
[groaning]

375
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:33,459
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

376
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:38,959
So they had no idea and
ended up destroying both
letters, huh? That's not
surprising!

377
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,959
Do you think this
mess has damaged
their friendship
at all?

378
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:44,826
No. Apparently
just the opposite.

379
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:46,793
How so?

380
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:51,526
Right now, they're both
hard at work on a combined
love letter.

381
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,393
We need to put much
more emphasis on curried
vegetables in this section!

382
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:58,459
No, I'm telling you, a
sentence about ramen
is perfect!

383
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:06,859
"Love makes both people
involved do crazy things."
That was certainly true
today for Lee and Naruto!

384
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,052
I'm calling a
post-mortem!

385
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:52,152
<i>Why are you so</i>
<i>mad, Tenten?</i>

386
00:23:52,186 --> 00:23:56,419
I told you the last time
that I wanted a serious
fight, but...

387
00:23:56,652 --> 00:24:03,752
<i>Next time on Rock Lee and</i>
<i>Friends, "A Competition</i>
<i>with the Genius Ninja, Neji,"</i>
and "Tenten's Must-Win Battle!"

388
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:04,619
[gasp]

389
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,286
So that's-!

390
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,552
<i>There you go, Tenten!</i>
<i>The serious fight you</i>
<i>were looking for!</i>

391
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:09,819
I'll do my best!

392
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:10,786
<i>We both will!</i>

393
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:12,019
<i>Yeah!</i>

394
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:15,019
By the way, I've
already given up.
