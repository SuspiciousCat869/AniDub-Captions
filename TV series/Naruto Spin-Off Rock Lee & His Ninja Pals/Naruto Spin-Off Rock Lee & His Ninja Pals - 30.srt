00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:57,084
Ughhh! Come on,
Deidara! Let's stop
messing around and
go, already!

00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,584
I'm not messing
around....

00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:04,650
Look as this delicate
yet bold creation, it's
almost <i>too</i> artistic! Ha!

4
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:07,117
But it's just going
to explode, right?

5
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,184
You dunce! --
Destruction is
eternal beauty.

6
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,617
In other words,
art is--

7
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,250
Gahhh!!

8
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,417
Aughhh!

9
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,217
Did I just peek
into eternity?

00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:25,384
All because of
this garbage...

Hmm..?

14
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:31,217
Actually, this could
prove interesting! Hm!

"Autumn Shinobi
Safety Lessons"

16
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:49,150
Lady Tsunade! There's been a
real uptick in ninjutsu related
accidents caused by neglect
and carelessness lately.

17
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:53,084
Mhmm. I want to
nip this problem
in the bud.

18
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:56,584
Agreed! That is
why I think we should
start a safety
awareness campaign!

00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:57,850
[scream]

20
00:02:57,884 --> 00:03:00,117
Interesting. You think
that'd be enough to
change anything?

21

And on top of that..!
A performance where we...

Ahaa...

I don't understand why
we have to disguise
ourselves and come all
the way to the Leaf!

24
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:20,084
To us, the Hidden
Leaf is just one
giant eyesore.

25
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,884
You should be leaping
at the chance to threaten
them... hmf!

26
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:27,484
You're sure we're not
here because you have
a personal grudge
against them...?

27
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:28,484
Huh?!

Hey! What are you

Get over here!

Spare us the song and

know why we stopped you!

(Thinking)
No way! Did they
figure out who
I am!?

39
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:06,684
[whistle]
You were clearly
traveling ten kilometers

What!?

Don't play dumb!

My eyes can never
be deceived!

Wow! The Byakugan can
really detect someone's
speed!?

49
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,217
Ahem. When a passing
car flashes his lights
he's warning you a
cop's up ahead.

50
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,250
Hmmm...

51
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:38,650
But it's rare that
anyone gets stopped
around here.

52
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:44,450
We've had a lot of reckless
ninjutsu drivers out here
lately, so we've had to start
cracking down pretty hard.

53
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,184
What on earth is a
reckless ninjutsu
driver?

54
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:50,650
Are people sleepwalking?
Or blocking mountain
passes on the weekends
or something?

55
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:53,117
Anyway, sir, we
appreciate your
cooperation!

56
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,917
Absolutely! Now, may
we see your license,
please?

57
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,050
L-Lic...
License?

58
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:01,650
Hurry up, or they'll
get suspicious!

59
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:04,217
You do NOT want to
tell me you do not
have one!

Well- ya see,
I...

Wait, this is
actually a thing?

69
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:31,084
I'm also a 2nd degree space-
time ninjutsu user, a promoter
for Make-Out Tactics, and a
military provisions sommelier.

00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:32,984
You are quite the
go-getter, are
you not!?

71
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:36,317
In today's economy,
it's helpful to have
lots of qualifications!

72
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,617
Hey! Those aren't even
close to being drivers
licenses!

Oh please! This was
never about drivers
licenses!

Huh!?

75
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,550
Precisely, gentlemen! This is a
driving test designed to assess
your techniques for weaseling
your way out of a ticket!

Say what!?

77
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,950
Although there wasn't
really any technique
involved other than
smooth talking...

<i>They're just checking</i>
<i>to see if I've been</i>
<i>drinking... hm...</i>

84
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,217
I will just need you
to blow into thi
s straw.

85

No proble-- guh!

86
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:12,417
We can't have you
interrupting, sir!

87
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,984
There's no need
for that!

88
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:18,517
My compatriot here
would never turn to
the bottle-- he's a
true artist!

89
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,384
Tobi... What are
you saying..?

90
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:24,950
The truth is... I've
always loved his art.

91
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,584
It's more than just
raw strength, it
has real impact!

92
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:30,150
Yes... yes,
exactly!

93
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:34,517
Only a select few
ninja can elevate
ninjutsu to the
level of true art.

94
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,917
Deidara! You're
so cooool!

95
00:06:40,084 --> 00:06:43,350
All things with
form are destined
to crumble...

96
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:47,550
But a violent explosion
burns itself into the
memory for al eternity!

97
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:51,250
The ultimate
expression
of art..!

98
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:54,217
(Lee)
Nope! You fail!

99
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,550
I mean, test or no test,
you are obviously way over
the legal limit, and completely
drunk on your own talent!

100
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,184
Drunk in that way?

101
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:03,117
Yeeeeah... He's
always like this.

102

Mhmm.

Just who's side are
you on, anyway!?

105
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:09,650
Enough is enough.
What's the point
of all this?

106
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:14,150
Operating under the
influence makes you
weave all over the
road like a wild snake.

107
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,284
...Like Orochimaru!

108
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:23,584
Just 'cuz you said
"snake" doesn't mean
you have to work
that traitor in!

109
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,617
Now stop waisting all
our time-- Let us in
the village already!

110
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,417
well, we have tested
them pretty thoroughly.

111
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,684
They're good,
right, Lee?

112
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:35,450
I am afraid not, Tenten!

113
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:36,850
What the hell
else is there?

114
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:40,484
One last check.
Something you
absolutely cannot
be without!

115
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:42,284
And what would
that be?

116
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:45,584
Why, brakes!
Of course!

117
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:49,150
(Thinking)
Uch, more of
this nonsense?

118
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:52,150
Take it easy,
Deidara. Leave
this part to me.

119
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,950
(girly voice)
I'm just your everyday,
ordinary office girl.

120
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:02,684
Totally average...
Nothing special about
me...

121
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:06,150
But there is one thing
no one can surpass me in,

122
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:09,984
and that's my undying
admiration for Mr.
Daraday...

00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:20,950
Oh, come off it! A
homely girl like Tobiko's
not even on my radar, are
you kidding me!?

like you crying her eyes
out?

129
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:34,084
[sob]
I've made my choice!

130
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,650
Give me the works!

131
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:46,184
I WILL BE PRETTY!

132
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,517
[gasp]

133
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:56,617
I didn't even
recognize
you, Tobiko!

134
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,884
Are you going to get
him to ask you out, or
take the initiative
yourself?

135
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:05,250
It doesn't matter
anymore, Zetsy.

136
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:07,984
But you've always
wanted Mr. Daraday!

137
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,284
Yes, but...

138
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:12,950
Mr. Daraday's just
a playboy...

139
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:17,017
[brakes screeching]

140
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,250
He, he stepped
on the brakes!?

141
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:22,517
That was some
spectacular braking!

142
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,550
Wow!

143
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:25,617
One who can always stop
when things get risky!

144
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,250
It's actually a vital
ability for any real
shinobi to have!

145
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:31,050
I don't know if
I agree with that!

146
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:34,584
Alright, now it is
your turn. Let us
see what you can do!

147
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,284
Uh, me?

148
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:38,284
Want me to work
the breaks, huh?

149
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,384
The rules are
simple:

00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:47,317
Step on it, and stop
as close to the edge
of the cliff as you can.

151
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,150
Hey! I'm no chicken
either, Dean!

152
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:52,617
Heh! Let's rumble,
Tobi!

153
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,650
Go!

154
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:02,017
Any closer and
I'll...

155
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,350
Heh!

156
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:19,217
[running gasp]
He didn't even
touch the breaks!

157
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,350
Huh?

158
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,584
[laughter] Anyone
scared enough to hit
the breaks will never
be a true artist!

159
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,250
What is the
meaning
of this!?

160
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:30,950
Shut your mouth!

161
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:34,184
Delay us any longer
and I'll blow the lot
of you to kingdom come,
do you hear me!?

162
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,150
Uh oohhh...
He snapped.

163
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:39,250
Ah man, this guy
seems really dangerous!

164
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:43,384
That sculpture! It's
got a ton of chakra
crammed into it! It's
gonna blow!

165
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:44,417
Blow, huh?

166
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:48,450
[gasp] Hey! Wait a
second! I know
you, do I not?

167
00:10:48,484 --> 00:10:50,217
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>We've got trouble, Lee!</i>

168
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,417
It's time for the
show and the actors
haven't arrived yet!

169
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,250
Do not even worry
about it!

170
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:56,550
Come on!
Hurry, everyone!

171
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,617
Huh?

172
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:04,617
Hey there, everyone! We're
starting a bit late, but
please enjoy the show!

173
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,717
[crowd cheering]

174
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,884
I think they might
be mistaking us for
the actors...

175
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,284
Heh. I should really
be thanking them.

176
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:15,084
I get to share one
of my creations...

177
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:17,950
Now get ready 'cuz
true art is an explosion!

178
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:19,284
YOU FOOLS!

179
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:21,317
[screaming]

180
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,617
As you can see, reckless
ninjutsu driving will get
you a beat down at the
hands of the Hokage.

181
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,117
(Tsunade)
End of story.

182
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:34,917
I bet the stage show really
drove home the dangers of
reckless driving...

183
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,717
and made everyone more
safety conscious.

184
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,450
If it drove anything
home, it's the fact that
Lady Tsunade is a force
to be reckoned with.

185
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:45,050
Regardless, we should have
far fewer accidents now.

186
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:49,184
On a side note, those 2
actors... they were so
realistic, what do you
think?

187
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:55,350
Uh, excuse us, we're
the stage show actors.
We got caught in a speed
trap on the way here!

188
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:57,617
Huh? Actually, the
show is already over.

189
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,650
Huh?

190
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:03,217
[wince] I told
you we shouldn't
have gone...

191
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,517
Damned... Leaf...
Village... ugh!

192
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:09,250
Ow...

193
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:13,450
<i>(Narrator)</i>
And so, unbeknownst to everyone
<i>Lee and his pals saved the</i>
<i>village from disaster.</i>

194
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:27,982
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Thanks to the safety</i>
<i>campaign, accidents in The</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf are way down-</i>

195
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,449
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>And Lady Tsunade</i>
<i>couldn't be happier.</i>

196
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:32,149
[happy chuckle]

197
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:36,149
You know, I had an
idea. Why don't we
hold a festival as a
reward for everyone?

198
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:37,816
A Fall festival?

199
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:43,016
Yeah! I was thinking
we'd do it western
style and cut loose!

200
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:46,382
What do you think?

201
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:51,649
If I detonate this
inside the village, it'll
cause mass destruction!

202
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:53,782
You still want to
attack the Leaf?

203
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:54,916
Yeah, of course!

204
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:57,816
Besides, I've always
wanted to go out like
this anyway!

205
00:12:57,849 --> 00:13:00,882
I don't know. They
might not even take
it as a threat.

206
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,649
They're having a
Halloween festival
apparently.

207
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:07,282
What the blazes
is a Halloween?

208
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:13,982
Well, from what I hear, it's a
terrifying holiday where witches
monsters, &amp; ghosts come out to
frighten people in the night.

209
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:15,782
The point is to
frighten people?

210
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,982
<i>(Tobi)</i>
<i>Nah, there's more</i>
<i>to it than that!</i>

211
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:21,416
<i>(Tobi)</i>
<i>People put on scary costumes</i>
<i>and run around saying "Trick</i>
<i>or Treat" to get candy.</i>

212
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:23,016
<i>(Tobi)</i>
<i>Plus, they tock out</i>
<i>at crazy parties!</i>

213
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:25,149
Sounds pretty damn
weird if you ask me.

214
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:28,516
It's like an
American Obon!

215
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:31,482
An American Obon?

216
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:34,016
Oh man, now I'm
definitely in!

217
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,649
Seriously?

218
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,416
I'll sneak my newest
masterpiece onto
center stage...

219
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:42,982
...and teach
them the meaning
of real terror! Hm!

220
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:47,149
I could try to stop
him, but he won't listen.

221
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:48,682
Hm??

222
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:58,549
"Deidara's Art Is
Always A Blast"

223
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:02,616
I can't wait to
see the looks of
horror on their
faces...

224
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,682
Lady Tsunade herself put
us in charge of the
Halloween festivities!

225
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:09,682
Let's all work
extra hard!

226
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,616
It's them again...

227
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,816
...so they're in
charge of the
festival...

228
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,482
Anyone know what
we're supposed to
do for Halloween?

229
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:20,982
I cannot say I am
that familiar with
it, but we do not
have that much time!

230
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:22,449
We have to
plunge in!

231
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:25,982
Well, it can't be
<i>that</i> hard, I mean
Halloween is, ya
know...

232
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:27,216
Is what!?

233
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:30,916
Well there's uh,
there's a lot of
pumpkins and stuff,
right?

234
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,649
Okay, pumpkins. They
are in season at the
moment.

235
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:38,149
Then we'll decorate
with pumpkin jam and
soup, lanterns! Roasted
squash! Citrons!

236
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:41,482
You idiots. It's not
the winter solstice.

237
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:45,649
Hey, I know you. You're
the actor from the safe
driving performance
earlier, right?

238
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:49,149
Lee, the real
actors came after
the performance,
remember?

239
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:51,149
<i>So uh, then,</i>
<i>who are you?</i>

240
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,516
Uh, well, I-- uh...

241
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:56,616
Wait! I have got it!
You are none other
than--

242
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:59,782
A wandering artist...
Right!?

243
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:02,682
Yes. Yes I am.

244
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:07,782
Makes sense. He's dressed
as an eccentric, and his
partner had a real flair
for the dramatic as well.

245
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:11,782
He must be some kind
of workaholic! That is
why he still went on
stage the other day

246
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:13,049
Suffering for
his art!

247
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:14,716
A workaholic?!

248
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:19,649
It seems Lady Tsunade
must have brought him
on to liven up the
Halloween festivities.

249
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:22,382
Uh, yeah! Pretty much.

250
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:27,782
You are a lifesaver!
We are complete newbies!
Please teach us everything
you know about Halloween!

251
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,082
Whaa!?

252
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:33,049
<i>(Deidara thinking)</i>
<i>Well this took a turn</i>
<i>for the weird...</i>

253
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:37,082
<i>But if they don't have</i>
<i>their little festival,</i>
<i>it'll ruin my plans...</i>

254
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:43,582
Halloween is a scary holiday
where witches, monsters, and
ghosts come out to frighten
people in the night.

255
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:45,982
Yeah, this isn't
helping... I'm
still not getting it.

256
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,116
Could you please elaborate
a little bit more?

257
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:49,682
Uhh... Okay...

258
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,616
<i>(Tobi)</i>
<i>People put on scary</i>
<i>costumes..!</i>

259
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,382
First, you'll need
to get some scary
costumes! Allow me
to demonstrate...

260
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,782
You! Ready
over there?

261
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,449
Ta-da!

262
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:04,016
Well, guys, what do you
think? Nothing's scarier
than the minions of
Hell, right?

263
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:06,416
That is just adorable.

264
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:09,516
That's nowhere near
frightening enough,
Tenten.

265
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,682
You want people to
be utterly shocked
into silence.

266
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:17,549
Give them glimpse of
someone who would commune
with the depths of Hell.

267
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:18,449
What-?

268
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:20,649
No no, Neji!
Are you crazy!?

269
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:23,549
You've gone so full
circle you practically
look divine now!

270
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,416
Mere child's play,
you two.

271
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,049
This is the face...

272
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:31,016
...of abject terror!

273
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,282
What is that..!?

274
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:35,749
A man who has gone far
beyond just a demon
living in Hell.

275
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:38,016
Nothing can top
the terror I bring!

276
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:40,882
I have no idea
what that's supposed
to mean, but it's--

277
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,916
REJECTED!!!

278
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:45,582
Think the sensors
are gonna let this
fly!?

279
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:47,982
Okay, so... Next up.

280
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:50,116
<i>(Tobi)</i>
<i>...Trick or Treat...</i>

281
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:54,082
Trick or Treat! We
go out and beg for
candy!

282
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:56,116
No way, I flat
out refuse.

283
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,049
What?

284
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,549
Pestering people is no
better than stealing.

285
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:01,716
The children of the
Village will feel
the same.

286

Come on, don't be
such a wet blanket,
Neji...

287

Lighten up! It's
all part of the
festival!

288
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:10,682
So we need to create
an environment where
candy will be given
willingly!

289
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:17,016
Matches..! Does any
body need any matches?

[groan]
[tummy growl]

291
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:23,349
At least I can use
them to warm myself up.

292
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:30,516
Oh my..! Just look
at all of that
delicious looking
candy!

[gasp]

294
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:37,449
<i>Kindly old Granny Guy...</i>

295
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:41,516
<i>Granny... the yummy</i>
<i>candies are fading</i>
<i>away...</i>

296
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:45,349
I am afraid I
am... fading as
well..

297
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:49,382
CANDY!??

298
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,549
I'll give you
whatever you want!
Take it all...!

299
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:53,382
Great! Let us go
with that then.

300
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,349
Well done.

301
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:56,716
You don't honestly
approve of this..!?

302
00:17:56,749 --> 00:18:00,682
Alright, I suppose all
that's left is for us
to rock out at the party.

303
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:03,549
Excellent! Just
leave everything
to me!

304
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:08,082
Well, I think we can
all agree we've had a
lovely evening so far!

305
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:12,616
And now if we could
all share a moment of
gratitude for those who
made this day possible!

306
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:19,849
Dad, Mom, you have
my thanks. I'm so
grateful that you
raised me right.

307
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:23,682
I hope I'll be
as happy as you...

308
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:25,782
Oh why me!?

309
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:28,116
Wow, this is a
great party!

310
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,782
Are you kidding!? I
don't see anyone rocking
out around here, do you!?

311
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:35,116
It'll be fine. We
just need to let
loose a bit more,
ya see?

312
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:38,516
Maybe it's just me,
but I don't really
think that's the
problem here.

313
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,516
Something tells me
this isn't very
"Halloween-y..."

314
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:44,416
I'd have to agree, it
seems very haphazard.

315
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:47,716
Yeah, I mean, the
whole point is for
the night to be
scary, isn't it?

316
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:51,016
I don't wanna burst
your bubble here, but
this isn't exactly
terror inducing...

317
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:53,482
Are you sure this
is the right way
to go?

318
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,282
[gasp]

319
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:58,616
You haven't just been
pulling random ideas
out of the air this
whole time, have you?

320
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:02,682
And here I am
being nice and
trying to help...

321
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,782
Do whatever you
want then!

322
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:06,482
Nonsense! We
cannot give up!

323
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:11,016
If we let our youthful
passion explode, I am
sure something good
will come of it!

324
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,616
Let it explode...

325
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,516
You're up for
explosions, then?

326
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:17,049
Our young power will
make a colossal blast!

327
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:18,849
But what do we do?

328
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:21,649
There must be a clue
buried in all this
somewhere...

329
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,649
<i>...Scary costumes...</i>

330
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:25,482
<i>...Tick-or-Treating...</i>

331
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:27,149
<i>...Rocking out...</i>

332
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:30,716
The one unifying
theme that links
it all together...

333
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:33,382
<i>It's like an</i>
<i>American Obon...</i>

334
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:34,916
[gasp]

335
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:38,982
Let's do it! We'll
rock out Halloween
style all night long!

336
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,382
Yeah!!!

337
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:44,516
There's not much
time! Just do
exactly as I say!

338
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:48,416
We're celebrating the
dead, set up tomb stones
and polish them until
they glow..!

339
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:49,516
Hiiiyah!

340
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:52,782
Cow..! Horses..! We
offer them up as
sacrifices!

341
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,582
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Flying weapons..!</i>

342
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:55,849
Needle Storm!

343
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:58,882
A fire to welcome
spirits back from
the great beyond!

344
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,782
Haaaaa-chaa!

345
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:05,782
Alright, now everyone
dance your butts off
to appease their wrath!

346
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:08,949
Wait a sec... is
that what I think?

347
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:12,616
What the heck, it's
the wrong season
for the Bon Dance!

348
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:16,649
That's right. The Bon
Dance is a ritual done
in honor of the dead.

349
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:22,782
If Halloween really is
like a foreign Obon, I
imagine this is just
what we need...

350
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:26,949
[excited crowd chatter]

351
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:29,816
Ha ha! It is all
thanks to you,
Mister Artist!

352
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:31,716
Well, you guys
did an amazing
job..!

353
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:34,482
Deidara! You
big goof..!

354
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,682
How could you forget
something this important?

355
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:38,782
Oh, look who's
here. It's your
partner again.

356
00:20:38,816 --> 00:20:39,516
[gasp] Is that...

357
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:46,582
<i>(Tobi)</i>
<i>I came all this way</i>
<i>to bring it to you!</i>

358
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:48,916
<i>(Tobi)</i>
<i>Let's finish the job</i>
<i>and get out of here!</i>

359
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,882
What on earth
is that thing?

360
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,816
[grunt]

361
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,349
[smile]

362
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:03,516
Hmmph... In the end,
I guess it's my fate
to be destroyed...

363
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:07,549
However, I won't let
you all suffer the same!

364
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:09,349
Deidara..!?

365
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:11,682
(Tobi)
[screaming]

366
00:21:11,716 --> 00:21:13,049
Farewell to you!

367
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:18,416
Oh man! He really
went out with a bang!

368
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:21,449
Mister Artist..!!!

369
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:29,482
Turns out, Lady Tsunade
didn't actually send for
those guys in the first
place... weird, huh?

370
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:31,016
It was just dumb-luck!

371
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:33,782
She thought up the
whole Halloween idea
on the spot!

372
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:36,416
If that's the case,
who the heck were
those guys!?

373
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:39,816
Yeah, I don't know!
I feel like I've
seen those outfits
before...

374
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:45,716
Not to worry! We will
meet those two again
someday, I just know it!

375
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:52,782
