<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Today's episode is</i>
<i>about Neji and his</i>
<i>cousin, Hinata Hyuga.</i>

2
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:02,578
What's up? Why are
you following me?

3
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:06,112
You are going off to
supervise Hinata's
training, aren't you?

4
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:10,778
I have always wanted to
study your Gentle Fist
technique! This is a
great opportunity!

5
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:12,812
What's cookin',
everybody?

6
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:16,045
(Lee)
Oh! Hi, Naruto!

7
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:17,445
Good to see you!

8
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:20,512
[screaming]

9
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:24,478
There's really nothing
going on, and besides,
Sakura was looking for you.

10
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:27,478
What!? For <i>me</i> ?
I wonder what
she wants!

11
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,612
What in the world
did you do <i>that</i> for!?

12
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:32,778
That guy gets into
other people's
business way too
often!

13
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:36,178
He's so pushy, it
would interfere with
my training plans.

14
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:39,212
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Oh come on! You don't have</i>
<i>to be so mean about it!</i>

15

<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>He is the protagonist</i>
<i>of Naruto Shippuden</i>
<i>after all...</i>

16
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:46,545
<i>(Neji)</i>
I don't care if he's the king of
the universe. Having him around
<i>would be a huge distraction!</i>

00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:03,812
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>You're right, Hinata likes</i>
<i>Naruto so much, she'd faint</i>
if she caught a glimpse of him!

19
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:06,812
And my training s
schedule would go
down the drain in
a flash.

20
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,645
Oh yes, I'd
appreciate if
the two of you
didn't--

21
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:11,578
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>[shouting]</i>
Now what?

22
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:14,078
Nejis! Everywhere!

23
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:18,078
We are surrounded
by clones!

24
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:20,145
I apologize
for my friend!

25
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:23,045
They're all relatives!
Of course they're gonna
resemble Neji!

26
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:27,145
The similarity is
too much! How can
they all have the
same resemblance!?

27
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:28,712
Doesn't make sense.

28
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:32,145
What are you talking
about!? You two look
the same and you're
not even related!

29
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:38,112
Oh, she already
started. Have to
give her credit
for trying.

30
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:40,578
[little grunts]

31

[gasp]

32

What are you
doing?!

33
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:47,912
You are like me, Hinata!
Filling every minute of
the day with hard work,
so you can advance!

34
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:52,145
When you think about it, the
similarities are amazing! You
even have the same hairstyle
as us!

35
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,978
We can almost be
brother and sister!

36
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:56,245
[whimper]

37
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,745
Stop you two! You're
gonna make her cry!

38
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:02,512
Hmf! Eight Trigrams
Defense! Sixty-Four Palms!

39

Lady Hinata!

42
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:13,778
Those two were so
frightening... She
had an automatic
defense response!

43
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:15,112
[sigh]

44
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,045
If you interrupt
training again,
I'll <i>really</i> get
mad!

45
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:20,412
-Got it.
-Got it.

46
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,145
I want to point out, Neji,
the Eight Trigrams Defense,
Sixty-Four Palms maneuver
was very effective.

47
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:28,445
It was almost like
you were attacking
us!

48
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,178
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>The Gentle Fist and Byakugan</i>
<i>techniques have been in the</i>
<i>Hyuga Clan for generations.</i>

49
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:37,645
<i>Many ninja still try</i>
<i>to steal the moves,</i>
<i>even today...</i>

50
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,178
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Hinata is next in line</i>
<i>to lead the clan...</i>

51
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:44,178
<i>...but unfortunately, she</i>
<i>does not have enough talent</i>
<i>as a shinobi...</i>

52
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:49,045
And that is the
reason she trains
so diligently.

53
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:53,112
That makes sense, but
it doesn't explain why
you're so protective
of her, Neji...

54
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:56,645
As I recall, you
didn't get along
with her in the
past...

55
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:02,712
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>It's true...</i>

56
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:08,145
(Neji)
In the past, I said
and did terrible
things to Hinata.

57
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:11,578
I'll never be able
to make up for those
mistakes...

58
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:15,045
...but now I want
to protect her and
aid her in whatever
way I can.

59
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:17,678
It's the least
I can do...

60
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:21,445
If we can be of any
help to you, Neji,
we're happy to do it.

61
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:24,512
We are partially to
blame for what
happened between you.

62
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:26,012
Thank you, guys.

Alright, Hinata.
It's time to begin
your training.

77
00:05:58,245 --> 00:05:59,978
It's gonna be six
against one!?

78
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:01,878
Good heavens, no!
Of course not!

79

We showed up
because we want
to help out
however we can!

80

She's right! We
each have a
specialty we're
good at,

an expert at hand-to-hand
fighting! He'll give you
tips on strategy--

Here! You should wear
this body suit while
you're training!

So how do I
look, Neji?

you have the courage.

injured by out-of-

Better to let me
handle this, if you
want something done!

00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:52,878
We should start
by addressing the
weakness in Hinata's
defense...

Wait a minute,
he's actually
being serious!

He may have some
insight here. He and
Lady Hinata do have
similar hairstyles.

Sorry! I mean
training styles...

00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:10,578
Heh heh heh...
not even close!

147
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:15,212
What!? Who are you
and why are you all
dressed like Naruto?!

148
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:18,612
The fact is, who
we are isn't really
important, Hinata.

149
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,912
What's important is,
you're coming with us,
and then we're going
to steal your power!

150
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:22,978
Say what?!

151
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:28,012
Darn it! How could I
have missed sensing
those rogue ninjas!?

152
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:30,078
Wait for us, Neji!

153
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,812
Just follow along!

154
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:35,778
[panting]

155
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:39,145
Not bad, young lady.
But it isn't going
to change anything!

156
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,078
You're coming
with me now,
understand?!

157
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:43,578
[gasp]

158
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:45,612
[scream]

159
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,512
From what I hear,
no one gets along
in the Hyuga Clan!

160
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:52,712
As a result, no
one's coming to
save you!

161
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:53,912
[frightened gasp]

162
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:57,978
[shouting in pain]

163
00:09:58,012 --> 00:09:59,712
That was really close!

164
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:02,178
I'm so sorry, Hinata.

165
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:04,912
I can't apologize
enough for putting
you in danger.

166
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:07,812
If it's about the
training, it's really
not your fault.

167
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,878
It's not about that.

168
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:13,812
I forgot what was
important once, and
as a result, did some
pretty awful things.

169
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:14,878
[gasp]

170
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:17,578
[grunt] What are
you mumbling about
over there!?

171
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:23,545
Lady Hinata, now
is the time to
combine our powers!

172
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:25,778
To help one another
as fellow kinsmen!

173
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:28,645
Right!

174
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,212
It would be
my honor!

175
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:34,945
We can do this! If
together we coordinate
an attack, we can take
all of them out!

176
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:35,745
Right!

177
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:37,778
(Lee)
Hey! Do not
forget about us!

178
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:39,478
Huh?

179
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:40,512
[gasps]

180
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:45,078

[gasps]

182
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,778
How many fake
Narutos are there?!

183
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,578
We're taking the
Byakugan and you
can't stop us!

184
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:52,078
That remains
to be seen!

185
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:56,145
This is getting
complicated, but I
see an opportunity
here...

186
00:10:56,178 --> 00:10:58,945
Hinata, you'll be
on defense, so
prepare yourself!

187
00:10:58,978 --> 00:10:59,612
Got it!

188
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:01,212
Eight Trigrams
Rotation!

189
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,545
Eight Trigrams Defense,
Sixty-Four Palms!

190
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:05,912
Eight Trigrams
Infinite Rotation!

191
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:08,045
Woaaahhh!

192
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:09,478
Wow..!

193
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:11,712
I m must say,
good job, Hinata!

194
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:14,978
Thanks! But I need
to keep working on
my technique.

195
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:18,478
Someday, I want
everyone to
acknowledge
my strength.

196
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:22,445
Neji!! I Finally
found you, you
big jerk!

197
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:24,778
Have you got some
kind of a problem
with me!?

198
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:26,045
Huh!??

199
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,512
I can't believe it!
You're the real Naruto!

200
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:34,212
[gasp]
ooo... ee! ow!

201
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:35,912
What was that about?

202
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:40,745
Naruto... Why
do you always
have such bad
timing!?

203
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:43,712
Wha? What do you
mean!? All I did
was come back here!

204
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,912
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Eight Trigrams!</i>
<i>Sixty-Four Palm!</i>

205
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:48,178
(Naruto)
You're so mean!

206
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:52,712
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Once again Naruto attempts</i>
<i>to set a record by achieving</i>
<i>sub-space orbit without a ship.</i>

207
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:07,548
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Everyone in this world</i>
<i>has some kind of weakness.</i>

208
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:10,148
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>And the work of</i>
<i>overcoming it</i>
<i>is never easy...</i>

209
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:12,581
You need to refine
your footwork!

210
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,848
[small whimpers]

211
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:17,181
You need to be more
aggressive, Hinata.

212
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:19,681
Neither will happen if
all you do is defend
yourself.

213
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,481
Oh, alright.

214
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:22,981
[gasp]

215
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:24,448
Oooo!

216
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:26,548
Lady Hinata!

217
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:28,581
Oh! What's
going on!?

218
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:33,481
I thought you were sparring!
You can't quit now! This is
no time to be laying down on
the job, Hinata!

219
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:34,581
You again!?

220
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:35,415
Huh?

221
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:38,048
I should have guessed!
Causing trouble again!

222
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:40,781
Woah! Don't blame
me! I did nothing!

223
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:46,715
I can't say I'm
surprised Neji is
fed up with me.

224
00:12:46,748 --> 00:12:52,115
I have limited skills,
and now this weakness
around Naruto is becoming
a real problem...

225
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,681
Oh, Hinata, don't
beat yourself up.

226
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:58,015
Tenten is right! all
you really need to do
is overcome that weakness!

227
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:02,115
I understand. But how
in the world do I do so?

228
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:08,115
Well, if you could somehow find
a way to hang out with Naruto
every day, you'd get used to him
and he wouldn't affect you so.

229
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:09,848
Great idea!

230
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,581
So all we have to do is
create some scenarios
where Hinata ends up
being close to Naruto!

231
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:16,181
Exactly what kind
of scenarios are
you thinking of?

232
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:19,748
I have a great idea!
I will call it "Dating
to Fix the Fainting!"

233
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:26,915
If Hinata and Naruto start going
<i>out, she will eventually get</i>
<i>used to him, and the problem</i>
<i>will evaporate!</i>

234
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:29,015
That sounds perfect!

235
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:33,781
So not only will Hinata's
weakness get fixed, but she'll
get to date her hero, and
they'll make a great couple!

236
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:35,948
Except, how do we
pull this off?

237
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,815
[quivering]

238
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:39,215
Hm?

239
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:42,615
This may be just the
drastic measure I need
to get myself together.

240
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:44,515
I'm ready to start!

241
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:45,781
Um, Hinata...

242
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:47,915
More than alright!

243
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:52,115
Rock Lee, the Master of Love,
will do everything in his power
to aid your mission, and ensure
it's success!

244
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,448
Master of Love, really?

245
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:03,815
"Hinata's Weakness is Naruto"

246
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:09,948
So, Lee, tell me. When
exactly did you become
the "Master of Love?"

247
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:12,948
Have you already
forgotten my pursuit
of Sakura?

248
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:18,548
The extreme passion I
Poured into that effort?
And the bittersweet torture
of love that resulted?

249
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,848
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>I remember she</i>
<i>flat out turned</i>
<i>you down.</i>

250
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:23,948
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>It was less bittersweet,</i>
<i>and more of a complete</i>
<i>rejection!</i>

251
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:29,748
Regardless! You cannot
have success until you
know failure!

252
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:32,881
Be kind in a
casual way, buy
him some presents-

253
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,481
Be open and honest
about your feelings,
and be a little pushy
every now and then.

254
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:41,981
Just follow these 4
principles I have laid
out and in time your
target will fall for you!

255
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:45,815

256
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,315
Great advice!

257
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:51,148
Well that target didn't
just fall! He got Hidden
Lotus-ed and destroyed!

258
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,848

<i>Umm... excuse me?</i>

Huh? What's up
Hinata? Who's
that with you?

264
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:09,581
Ignore me. I am
just a stagehand
in this production.

265
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:11,115
Fine, whatever.

266
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:14,715
Now remember Rule
One, Hinata. Be kind
in a casual way.

267
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,815
Right!

268
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,815
Uhh, so I just happened
to have this on me and
wondered if you'd like
some!

269
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:24,148
Oh! That'd be great!
You're awesome,
Hinata! Nice timing!

270
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:28,148
So far so good.
Now it is time
for Rule Two.
Presents! Go!

271
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:29,715
Mhm!

272
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:33,115
You should eat more
than ramen so I
brought you these
fresh vegetables!

273
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:35,581
Look at that!

274
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:38,015
Don't move, Naruto!
I'll get that bug!

[screaming in pain]

276
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,881
My eye! I think
I've gone blind!
That bug's still on you!

277
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:46,781
I'll get it!

278
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:50,681
[crying out in pain]

279
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:54,415
Oh yeah. I don't
think this is
working out as
planned...

280
00:15:54,748 --> 00:15:56,681
I've got a little
problem! What do
I do?!

281
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,648
We have to go with
the last two rules!

282
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:01,148
Be open, honest,
straight forward,
and give him a
kiss!

283
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:02,915
A kiss!?

284
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:04,648
What's going
on up there!?

285
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:06,881
Naruto is panicking
right now, and we
have to stop it!

286
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:13,081
It is generally understood,
that the only thing that
ever calms and out-of-control
hero is a kiss from the heroin

287
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,648
I saw that in
the movies!

288
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:18,881
You need to get over
yourself, mister! He's
no hero, and she's no
heroin!

289
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:21,715
Go on now,
Hinata.
Do it!

290
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,015
(Lee)
Kiss him!

291
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,081
I have to say,
I'm a little
nervous, know
what I mean?

292
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,848
I'm... not...

293
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,081
She imploded!

294
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:38,515
Hmm... there must be
a way to overcome
Hinata's weakness
with Naruto...

295
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:39,548
Hm?

296
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:42,148
[squeal]

297
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:43,615
Lady Hinata!

298
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:47,015
Why... me..?

299
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:53,481
I'm sorry! You
both tried so
hard to help!

300
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:56,481
It is my fault,
for devising such
a horrible plan!

301
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,848
You tried your best!

302
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:59,848
I'm afraid this
will never work.

303
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:02,881
I do want to change,
so I went on the
offensive... but...

304
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:05,648
Offensive... that's
what we need to be
doing!

305
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:06,781
Tenten?

306
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,715
Sakura is the one
Naruto is attracted
to, right?

307
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:12,048
[sad whimper]

308
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,615
Please, Hinata!
Don't panic!
Hear me out!

309
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:18,115
Sakura has a very
forceful, confident
personality!

310
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:22,715
<i>You could say she</i>
<i>always nails the</i>
<i>punchline, and Naruto's</i>
<i>the perfect target!</i>

311
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:23,915
So what?

312
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:26,815
People are drawn to
those who compliment
their personality.

313
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:31,948
Naruto will be attracted
if you allow him to set
you up, and you respond
with a slick punchline!

314
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:33,148
That's what he said!!

315
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:37,115
Oh! That was really
an incredible punchline
Hinata!

316
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:39,881
See!? You may just
overcome your weakness!

317
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:43,715
Of course I still
have to say the line!

318
00:17:43,748 --> 00:17:45,881
I'd like to help
you achieve that.

319
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:46,681
[gasps]

320
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:48,548
<i>(Hinata)</i>
<i>Really Neji??</i>

321
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:51,648
It's critical for you
to overcome that one
weakness...

322
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:55,681
He's right about that,
Hinata, so welcome to
the world of reaction
comedy!

323
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:57,881
Are you absolutely
sure about this?

324
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,115
Hm?

325
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:02,815
I find myself wondering,
is she really cut out
for this?

326
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,648
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>I think Hinata is</i>
<i>fine, just the way</i>
<i>she is!</i>

327
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:08,915
Come on, Lee,
don't be a wet
blanket.

328
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:12,848
How does Hinata feel?

329
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:15,748
The Hyuga Clan is
known for delivering
punch lines...

330
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:16,881
(Tenten)
Seriously?

331
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:20,481
And I belong to
the Hyuga Clan!

332
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:24,048
This book is great!
It will teach you
jokes for any
special occasion!

333
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:28,181
Slowly I Turned, That
phrase is a favorite
from way back when.

334
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:33,081
Tenten! I didn't
know you were a
comedy historian!

335
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:34,948
Ready when you
are, Hinata.

336
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:35,748
Alright!

337
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,815
Your mama!

338
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:39,515
That's what
she said!

339
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:41,181
He came back with
a counter punch line!

340
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:43,915
Her delivery was
good, but he hit
with twice the force!

341
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,815
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>That's Neji's</i>
<i>comedic power!</i>

342
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:47,781
Your delivery
is too laid-back!

343
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:51,015
To master comedy
it is important
that you keep up
a fast pace!

344
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,015
I get it! The Eight
Trigrams Sixty-Four
punchline!

345
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:56,181
He's pushing her up
against the wall!

346
00:18:56,215 --> 00:19:00,181
What's the matter,
Hinata!? Don't you
have anything to say!?

347
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:01,715
Hm! I can do this!

348
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:06,915
I'll nail the punchline,
and then I'll nail Naruto's
heart with cupids arrow!

349
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:09,148
Hm? Naruto's
heart?

350
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,748
Oh, didn't you know?
That's what all this
training is for!

351
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:14,948
Our plan is for them
to start dating so
she will stop fainting!

352
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:20,181
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Well, Neji came in</i>
<i>late, so he had no</i>
<i>idea what was going on.</i>

353
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:24,848
What are you talking about!?
You can't do comedy at the
same time you're dating
somebody!

354
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:26,715
You'll blunt your edge!

355
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,515
Neji really demands
strong discipline!

356
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,948
I want those punchlines
and I want them now!

357
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:36,581
I don't care what they're about!
Ecology, biology, chiropractic
medicine, whatever!

358
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:38,348
He is relentless!

359
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:42,581
She's going to get
overwhelmed! Hinata,
you have to react!
Give him <i>something!</i>

360
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,881
Sorry, I just can't
come up with one!

361
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,715
This is really bad.

362
00:19:46,748 --> 00:20:00,581
Just thinking about you
and Naruto together,
doing this and that...

363
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,815
It's all so disgusting!

00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:05,681
Just like your face!

365
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:11,215
A perfect punchline!
In fact, it's precisely
what I was hoping for!

366
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:12,915
Alright!

367
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:15,815

369
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:22,148
Amazing! This is some
rich flavor they were
able to put together!

370
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:25,748
The crap miso and
the sea cucumber are
in perfect balance!

371
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:29,815
You know what, you're
too <i>un</i> balanced to eat
that soup!

372
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:32,815
Oh, that punchline
was awful! I can't
do this!

373
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:36,615
Huh? What's up,
Hinata? Did you
come to swat
another bug off me?

374
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:38,015
Huh?

surprised to see
you acting nice

Ew! It's a

Gross!!

388
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:15,481
You're really giving
up your training?
After all that effort?

389
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:20,015
I just don't think
I have it in me to
attack and defeat
Naruto for comedy.

390
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:22,615
It would not be all
that funny, anyway.

391
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,615
It's too bad. you
know. In the end,
we didn't make any
progress!

That's not really
true, though!

to keep myself together
around Naruto much longer
than usual!

As long as I have time
to mentally prepare-- Hm?

Hey, Hinata! Sorry
about that, I forgot
to give this back!
