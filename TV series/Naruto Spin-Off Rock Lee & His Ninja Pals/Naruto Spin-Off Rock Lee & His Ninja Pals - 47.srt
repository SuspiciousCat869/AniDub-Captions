I wonder what's
wrong with him...

Maybe it's puberty.

it's not puberty.

Yeah! Take a look! It's
a café where you can
bring your dog to play!

Hey! It says they
have good waffles

Well... but...
maybe...

26
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:07,008
I mean, to be honest, we
could take it or leave it.
But for little Akamaru's
sake, we have to go!

It's the right
thing to do!

Yeah... I suppose...

00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:16,475
Oh, but there are
four of us, and he's
the only dog. That'll
seem kinda weird...

Would you like to
be my little puppy?

And you? How
about it?

46
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:57,408
Sure! I've secretly
always wanted to try
dog food! It's so
meaty looking...

Well he doesn't
actually have a dog
so maybe we can
ask him to leave?

be fair, we don't

certainly a rare name,
isn't it?

So, that really
is a dog, then?

No. I've run into him
a time or two before.

There's no way that
thing's a dog!

Come on! Of course
it's not a dog!

Does he feed it
dog food though?

anymore...

120
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:34,108

Samehada's definitely
not built for agility.
This might blow his cover!

124
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:50,142
You're right! That would
say, "it's not a dog"
without actually saying it!

We can't have you
catching a cold,
Samehada.

129
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:15,042
Oh no, is it too
small? I bought the
largest they had in
the store...

00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:17,375
I wonder why it
doesn't fit you.

It doesn't fit because
it's not a dog!!

He's so excited he
was wagging his tail
really fast! See?

Very well. Go on
ahead, Samehada!

easy! That's not a

164

Allow me to explain:

165
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:02,275
Dogs will sometimes
try to eat kitty litter
because they like to
eat kitty poop.

166

Even so, that's
not a dog.

So, this is
Sasuke's file?

Sasuke Uchiha...

212

<i>He and Naruto were</i>

<i>out of nowhere...</i>

have time to tell
the whole story..

re-watch the main series

Don't mention the

Anyway, I wonder what
Sasuke has been up to.

219
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,573

of a certain set of

any mercy, understand?

What is that!?

256

jutsu that turns
his body into water!

Plus, she wears
glasses...!

glasses off, anyway?

out her chakra!

00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:11,207
Well, so far, so
good. At least this
guy seems normal.

302
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,040
He seems like a
really nice person.

303
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,473
I guess that makes
you the Leaf ninja.

304
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:18,940
Indeed! You seem like
a reasonable man. Can
we talk to you?

305
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:24,173
No... I'm
gonna... kill...

306
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,107
What.

307
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,340
...kill you! I'm
gonna kill you!
[laughter]

308
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:31,740
[scream] What the heck
just happened here!?

309
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:36,107
Jugo can't control
his emotions. He snaps
at the drop of a hat
out of nowhere...

310
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,040
...It's dissociative
identity.....

311
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:41,440
I'm gonna [bleep]
your [bleep] up and
shove your hats up
your [bleep]!

312
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:44,373
That was almost
every single word
you can't say on
the air!!!

313
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:48,540
It was the same one
Kimimaro used when
I fought him...

314
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,107
What's that?
Kimimaro?

315
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,173
Are you saying that
you knew Kimimaro?

316
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:59,573
Yes. I was his
final opponent
before he...
passed away.

317
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:02,540
Is that so...

318
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,540
What were his
last words?

319
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:06,540
He said...

320
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:09,307
I just wanna know:
What was the last
thing he ate?

321
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,940
Huh? I-I did not...

322
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,673
At the very end,
what kind of pants
was he wearing!?

323
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:15,807
What!? Why do you
care about his pants!?

324
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:22,307
So them, Sasuke,
these are your new
comrades?

325
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,240
Quite a cast of
characters you've
got there. not that
I'm one to talk.

326
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:31,740
Sasuke. Listen. There is
something I have wanted
to understand for three
years now...

327
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:34,740
And that is...
to know why..!?

328
00:18:34,773 --> 00:18:35,873
Easy...

329
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:40,540
Why were you so
popular with all
the ladies!?

330
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:43,873
Wait, that's
your question!?

331
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,473
Oh, that stuff? I
never cared about it.

332
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:48,673
[agonizing scream]

333
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:52,007
Why!? I do not
get it! He does
not even try!!

334
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,273
Lee!

335
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:59,173
But...I.... I
have....

336
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:03,007
I have got Sakura
screaming for me all
the time now! That
means something!

337
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,607
(Tenten)
It's not out of
excitement you
moron!

338
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,240
Enough, already.
I've no business
with you.

339
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,140
Please wait...
Just hear me out.

340
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:15,307
You once considered me
enough of a rival to
copy my moves...

341
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,040
Shut up!

342
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,773
Is that true, Sasuke?
Did you copy his
widdle moves?!

343
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:26,007
I had my reasons!
Just leave it at that!

344
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,973
It's because they were
so basic. Copying your
movements was nothing
to me...

345
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:33,607
I have trained a
lot and have
improved since then!

346
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,640
So, do you think
you have what it
takes to copy me
now!?

347
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:40,340
[scoff]

348
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,907
Wow! He's matching
Lee blow for blow!

349
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,173
How in the world
does he copy him
so fast!?

350
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:51,973
His Sharingan has
evolved since we
last saw him.

351
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,173
Fine! How about this!

352
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:59,407
Get a load of my
Sexy Swimsuit Jutsu!

353
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,973
[screaming]

354
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:03,173
[screaming]

355
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:04,940
And I am not
done yet!

356
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:07,240
Behold! The fruits
of my training!

357
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:13,740
I call this maneuver
the Sexy Swimsuit Special!

358
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:15,640
Huh!? Why am
I in this!?

359
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,073
Amazing, huh? See
what an incredible
move this is?

360
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:23,773
Sasuke and I both did
this in the manga,
but your version is
anime-only, Neji!

361
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,007
That doesn't
make it better!

362
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,673
This achievement is the
result of an entire year
of exposure to episodes of
Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals!

363
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:35,607
<i>Are you kidding!?</i>
<i>Do you know how</i>
<i>many people worked</i>
<i>on this show?!</i>

364
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,207
And the best you can
offer the viewers after
a year is to make Neji
cross-dress? That's sad!

365
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:46,723
Chidori Stream!!!

366
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:48,823
It's frustrating,
isn't it...

367
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:50,923
Snap out of it!
Hurry up and
heal him!

368
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:52,057
hmf!

369
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:56,323
Karin!!!

370
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:57,957
Curse you...

371
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,090
That's enough!
Let's do this!

372
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:03,857
Suigetsu! Karin!
Jugo! Attack!

373
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:14,123
No way! Is that--?

374
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:15,590
It is! A
fusion attack!

375
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:19,723
Here we come! Combo
ninjutsu! Snake-Hawk
Super Jet!

376
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:22,257
That combo move
looks... really
stupid.

377
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,557
Brace yourselves!

378
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,023
What the--!?

379
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:31,523
Where did they
go? They disappeared.

380
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,557
He got us. He trapped
us in an illusion when
we looked at his Sharingan.

381
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,157
There's no telling
how long they've
been gone...

382
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,223
No!!

383
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:45,890
The cross-dressing,
the stupid combo move...
everything we did!

384
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:48,990
Sasuke has made fools
of us all! I cannot
believe it!

385
00:21:51,823 --> 00:21:55,490
Last chance, Sasuke.
You're sure of this?

386
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:59,190
There's no need to
bother with them
any longer. Let's go.

387
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:03,090
Sasuke? What the--?

388
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:04,557
Just my luck.

389
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,390
