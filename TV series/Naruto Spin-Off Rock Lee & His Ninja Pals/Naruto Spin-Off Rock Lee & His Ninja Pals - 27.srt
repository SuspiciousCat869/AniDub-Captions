[chuckle] Yep, it

Luck has finally revised
her poor opinion of me!

5

Oh!

00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:22,237
I want to go out to

Aren't they a little
young to be sitting
at the bar, anyway?

Maybe you can

Yes! That's it,
Lady Tsunade!

I know how to preserve
your honor as Hokage

all about eating sushi
at a five-star restaurant

Wait, what economic
bubble are you
talking about..?

84

Speaking of swallow, I
can't believe you can
swallow that story!

87
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:12,604
LIsten! When you guys grow up
a little bit more, and become
strong-willed ninja who aren't
so easily swayed by temptation-

88
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:15,737
...then, and only
then, may you all
sit at the sushi bar!

Well, Guy may be
exaggerating a bit,
but I have to admit,
he does have a point.

Not you, too,
Kakashi Sensei!

91
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,770
Perhaps they are right
and we are too young
to eat at the bar...

You're about to

grueling of tests:

Sit at the bar,
order what you want,
eat, and leave.

00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:52,604
So this is what

126
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:57,104
If your spirit wavers
even a little, then you

Do you really think
that's what it means

At least now we
know what to expect.

129
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:04,304
And that means I'm
going on the offensive!

Ah, welcome!

131
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,104

Too much wasabi!!!

137
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,104
That poor fool. He

138
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,637
Failing to handle
wasabi is a fatal

No, us getting pulled into

fatal weakness!

00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:37,270
Alright! I've got a

Byakugan!

142
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:43,604
Nice one! Now he can
see if there is any
wasabi inside his sushi!

143
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:46,470
Or, he could just ask them
to hold the wasabi...

Hey old man,
I'll have...

What do I want?

146

[horrified gasp]

147
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,137
Sea urchin, shrimp,
your fattiest tuna,
and a caterpillar roll.

148
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,604
And what about
you, Neji honey?

149
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,237
<i>What!? That's the</i>
<i>most expensive stuff</i>
<i>on the menu!</i>

150
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,604
<i>It'll cost me...</i>

So, what'll
it be, sir?

152

Uh, give me...

153

Yes..?

154
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,370

<i>[buzzer sound]</i>

When your girlfriend
orders an expensive meal,
you obsess over the cost!

157
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,170
And as a result, you end
up ordering something
that's inexpensive in order
to balance out what she bought.

158
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:26,504
Bushier Brow Sensei
knows scary tactics!

159
00:09:26,537 --> 00:09:31,337
Not as scary as Neji gullibly
falling for Guy Sensei
pretending to be his girlfriend!

160
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,104
That's it! I'm
going to go in next.

161
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:37,637
I'm a girl, so money will
be no object whatsoever!

162
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,337
Hello there! Some
flounder, please.

163
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,037
(Kakashi)
Flounder, comin' up!

164
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:47,170
Mommy! I wanna try
flounder! Get some
for me right now,
mommy!

165
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:52,270
Forget it! Kids eat
kid's sushi, so have
an egg roll or a
salad or something!

166
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:54,537
(Kakashi)
One flounder...

167
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,270
Huh!?

168
00:09:58,504 --> 00:10:00,604
Uh, what do
you want?

169
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,637

I had no idea that
a sushi bar is so
riddled with
unforeseen traps!

173
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,670
Set all the traps
you want..!

174
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:21,637
If every single seat
at the bar is taken,
then that doesn't matter!

175
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,770
Okay, pops, one tuna!

180

There's only one
left now...

181
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:39,604
Are you finally beginning
to see that you're
simply not yet ready
to sit down at the bar!?

182
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:43,737
Maybe they are right,
after all. Maybe it
is too soon for us.

183
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:47,370
Conveyor belt sushi
is plenty for you
right now.

184
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:51,404
Conveyor belt sushi...
revolves! That is it!

185
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:54,137
Well, Lee? What's
it going to be?

186
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,337
Alright. I would
like lean tuna please,

187
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,570
Ahhhhhh!
Great Leaf Hurricane!

188
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:08,404
What's... he doing!?
He's moving just like...

189
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:13,204
...A sushi conveyor
belt rotating around
the counter!

190
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:18,604
Yes! I need to approach
this like I'd approach
a conveyor belt sushi
restaurant!

191
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:23,104
This is the only way
to stop my wavering and
impose the strength of
my will!

192
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:24,370
[chomp]

193
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,104
"Thank you, conveyor
belt sushi!"

194
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:27,404
"Farewell sushi bar!"

What just happened!?
Why is this up here?!

196

He isn't saying
goodbye at all!

197
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,504
Well, it looks like
they got one past
us, doesn't it?

198
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,370
Yep, we lost
this one.

199
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:41,137
Not quite. I learned
something when I used
the Great Leaf
Hurricane just now.

200
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,437
I am more confidents
being at a conveyor
belt sushi restaurant!

201
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,804
So I am going to
hold off on sitting
at the sushi bar until
I am truly an adult!

202
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:50,404
Lee...

203
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:53,737
Listen, if you still
want to go, I'd be
happy to treat all
of you to that!

204
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,337
Yeah! Alright!!!

205
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,370
<i>(Narrator)</i>

206
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:06,604
<i>But... unfortunately</i>

<i>up for the price difference.</i>

207
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,770
Why does this
happen to me?

208
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:24,403
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>It's the end of</i>
<i>another beautiful</i>
<i>autumn afternoon.</i>

209
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:27,903
Guy Sensei really put
us through the wringer
today with those exercises.

210
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:29,770
What do you guys
want to do now?

211
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:31,770
I do not know.

212
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:34,937
Maybe enjoy the cool
breeze and relax with
a good book?

213
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:38,937
There's no breeze on
earth that's cool enough
to make that relaxing!!

214
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,737
Not even in the
Arctic Circle!

215
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,003
I mean, come on, you
don't have to act like
Guy Sensei when you're
reading a book too, ya know!

216
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:48,403
You do not understand,
Tenten! Guy Sensei is
my hero!

217
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:50,337
I want to be like
him as fast as I can!

218
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,737
Hey, look there.

219
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:55,903
Iruka Sensei!

220
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:57,303
It has been a while!

221
00:12:57,337 --> 00:13:00,970
Oh, it's you
three, huh...

222

in addition to my usual
teaching duties, I
teach the lower grades.

226
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,837
<i>(Iruka)</i>
<i>Unfortunately, most of</i>
<i>those kids are very spoiled.</i>

227
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,603
<i>They refuse to listen</i>
<i>to a word I say...</i>

228
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:30,403
<i>And they have zero</i>
<i>interest in trying</i>
<i>to work together...</i>

229
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,637
<i>If I scold them, they</i>
<i>just start crying!</i>

230
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,270
<i>But worst of all, I</i>
<i>have to deal with</i>
<i>their parents.</i>

231
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:40,970
Enough!

232
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,037
Oh, I see!

233
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,837
They are what they
call "intimidator
parents," is that right?

234
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,903
No, you mean
"helicopter parents."

235
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:50,670
And there's going to
be an open house
coming up soon...

236
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:55,337
If I lose control of those
kids during that, then I'm
gonna get into big trouble.

237
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,803
But I can't yell at
them, or I'll upset
their moms.

238
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,703
Just thinking about the
whole thing gives me a
headache...

Yes, I understand.

240
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:05,037
I say, we come in like
we did last time--

241
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:10,437
--and give them a hot-blooded
lesson in friendship, effort,
and exactly what it takes to
achieve victory!

242
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,003
(Tenten)
The only thing that looks
like a lesson in, is a
Shonene Jump manga!

243
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,937
Their whole life, those
kids have been raised
believing that they can do
whatever they please.

244
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,937
They couldn't care less
about ideas like friendship
and effort...

245
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,237
and the only work you
used that they'd respond
to is "victory."

246
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:28,937
Thanks anyway...
[sigh] What am I
going to do...?

247
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,837
Wow, they really
don't care about
friendship or effort?

248
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,903
You wouldn't get
along with them
very well, Lee.

249
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:38,837
Well, maybe not those
parts, but I do like
victory like they do!

That's it!

class already like the
idea of winning, right?

253
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:50,837
<i>Well then, we just need to use</i>
<i>that as the foundation for</i>
teaching them all about the joys
<i>of teamwork and effort!</i>

Yes, I follow your logic,
but how do we go about
putting it into practice?

go ask Guy Sensei?

00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:18,970
The Leaf Strawman Heros are an
elite squadron of warriors

291
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:23,470
Who teach children the value of
friendship and effort in their
quest for justice and victory!

292
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:25,703
Why am I narrating this?

293
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:26,737
What are you
guys doing?!

<i>(Thought Narration)</i>
<i>I'll explain...</i>

295
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:34,503
Bushy Brow asked us to come help
him put on a skit about heros to
<i>teach your class the value of</i>
<i>effort and friendship.</i>

296
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:37,737
Why do you have
to put on a hero
show skit to teach
them that?

297
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,770
<i>(Thought Narration)</i>
<i>I'll explain...</i>

Listen, all of you
just stop narrating,
alright!?

299
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,537
We can use Guy Sensei!

300
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,137
(Neji / Tenten)
Guy Sensei!?

301
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,637
We can use him as
our example and
become true heros
exactly like him!

302
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,003
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>It is an immutable</i>
<i>fact that children</i>
<i>look up to heros!</i>

303
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:57,503
<i>If we become heros and</i>
<i>demonstrate friendship and</i>
<i>effort, they will learn to</i>
<i>appreciate them for sure!</i>

304
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:01,403
So please, just leave
this to us, Iruka Sensei.

305
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,837
Uh... Yeah okay.

306
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,303
Good luck, Lee.

307
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:06,837
Now! Everyone,
transform!

308
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:10,603

-Right!

-Now! Switch modes!
-Right! Got it!
-Begin Change!
-Yeah! Transform!

312
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,337

315
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,403
Red Hero, ready

Red Hero! All

The one time you
synch up, and it's
just the color!?

319
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:33,570
All of us agreed
that I get to be red.

320
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:35,370
No way! I get
to be red!

321
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:37,137
Forget it! I
wanna do it!

322
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,903
It doesn't matter what
color you guys are,
just get on with it,

323
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,303
(Neji)
Hey Lee...
Huh?

324
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:44,703
Why do I have to
be the one in pink?

325
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:46,470
Oh, why not, Neji?

326
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:48,637
Because it's weird,
and not a good look
for me!

327
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,903
Look, no one cares!

328

You can change, but
this is the only
spare costume we have.

Hmm....

Oh, come on!
You're all red?!

332
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,703
I guess each of them
wanted to be the leader.

getting back on
track now.

Not this again!

342

You know, Yellow Heros
always love curry.
Right, Bushy Brow?

343
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:28,937
No way! I am
going to be
the red one!

344

Good grief.
Alright, fine.

345
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:35,270
Listen up! Is there
anyone here who really
likes to eat curry?

We're on the scene!

the idea that you built a
strong friendship between
all of you!

This is more of
a drag every second.
