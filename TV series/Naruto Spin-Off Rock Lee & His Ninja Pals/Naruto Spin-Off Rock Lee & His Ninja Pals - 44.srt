It's time, everyone...
for our annual bean-
scattering competition!

5
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,670
This year our
onis are...

6
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:11,803
...Team Three! Lee,
Neji, and Tenten!

7
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:13,870
I should have guessed
it would be our team.

8
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:16,603
Hey, are you saying
there's no way out
of this..?

9
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:20,237
I say, let us all
give the job everything
we have got!!!

10
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:28,303
[nasty chuckle]
I did it! I succeeded
in making Lee the oni!

11
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:30,903
What is the point of
doing so, Lord Orochimaru?

12
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:32,870
It's quite simple, really.

13
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:37,503
Once he's been weakened
from being pelted with
beans. I'll be able to swoop
in and finish him off!

14
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:39,903
Maybe it's just me,
but isn't that
inefficient?

I'm surprised these

prepared for us...

17
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,703
Not only that, but
they're kinda
embarrassing.

18
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:03,603
Please do not be
ridiculous! Of all
people, onis do not
get embarrassed.

19
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:06,837
Excuse me, but
you're a thunder
god, not an oni!

20
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,637
How could that
happen..!?

Look at this!
I had no idea!

25
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:18,870
A mask comes with
this costume!

26

Well you're the
only one! We didn't
get anything like
that!

[nasty chuckle]
That's terrific! Now
hurry up and put it on!

28
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,870
What exactly is
happening, my lord?

29
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:34,603
That, my friend, is a
terrifying mask I prepared
especially for Rock Lee!

30
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:36,337
What's so
terrifying
about it?

32

really be able to get
into character!

Lee? What's
going on..?

36
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:51,803
It is the mask!
The maaask!

37
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:53,337
What <i>about</i>
the mask!?

38

Are you sure it's
coming from the mask?

Oooof! Never mind!
You're right! It's
awful..!

42

Oh yuck! Get
it out of here!

43
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:05,470
I'm trying to figure
out what's going on

44
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:07,903
It's not terrifying
because it's cursed
or anything?

45
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:10,770

No it's nothing
like that...

this mask will not
come off!

48
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:20,370
That doesn't make
any sense! What's
happening!?

49
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:21,803
Do you think
it's cursed?

50
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:23,270
It might as
well be...!

51
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,670
The end result
is the same!

52
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,570
This is crazy! So
if it's not cursed,
what's really
happening here?!

Huhhh...

55
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:36,670
Now Lee is stuck with
that stinky mask for
the forseeable future!

56
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:41,770
He won't be able to
smell straight for
the next six months!

Alright! Who has
been naughty!?

59
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:49,303
That's a <i>namahage</i>
<i>demon</i> , not an oni.

Naruto!? What do you
think you are doing
up there, you idiot!
That really hurt!

62
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:59,903
[chuckle]
I'm throwing beans
to ward off the
oni, of course!

[pain grunts]

64

Throwing handfuls of
beans is what Setsubun's
all about!

65
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:09,270
So just because I am
an oni, you get to
randomly hit me with
whatever you want!?

66
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:11,637
Isn't that the
whole point of
being an oni??

67
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,337
Out with the demons
...in with good fortune!

68

here and take it!

[grunts]

70
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:27,337
Sorry about that,
Lee! But we're just
following tradition!

71
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,603
[groan] I had no
idea this was such
an unfair process!

72

Out with the demons..!

00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:35,837
...In with
good fortune!

74
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,770
The truth is. they're
not wrong about the
nature of the event.

75
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:41,070
But they're enjoying
it way too much!

76
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:46,537
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>And while I'm thinking about</i>
<i>it, tell me this: How come</i>

[chuckle]
Oh, I can answer
that one.

78
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:54,303
I used a technique that
makes anyone who sees the
mask, want to bombard it
with beans!

79
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:55,937
Really? You can
do that?

80
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,470
[groan] W-wait a
minute! Time out!

81
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:00,637
We have no
choice, Lee!

82
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,337
It's time to
retreat..!

83
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,370
This is just the
beginning. Before it's
over, this will be the
Setsubun from hell!

[heavy breaths]

85

It was close,
but we got away.

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,603
A bean!?

87
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:15,303
Did they catch
us already!?

88
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,870
Do not panic.
Look, it's only
a child!

89
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:21,937
All demons have to
be... chased out!

<i>Why do I have</i>
<i>to do this!?</i>

91

He must be from
the outskirts of
town...

92
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:29,270
Young man... where
are your parents?

93
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:31,270
They're both
as work...

94
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:37,203
Aha! Now I see! They are
both too busy with work,
and you had no one at home
to play demon for you!

95
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:42,237
[cries]
It is okay! Hit me
with every bean you
have in that box!

96
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,603
Okie-dokie! Out
with the demons!
[laughter]

97
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,803
Maybe I should
not have done that.

98
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:50,803
Thanks a lot,
Mr. Oni!

99
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:56,770
Well, Lord Orochimaru.
I did as you asked, and
was able to throw a whole
bunch of beans at Lee...

100
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:59,770
But it didn't really
injure him at all, so
what was the point?

101
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:01,537
The point is quite
simple, my friend!

102
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,537
I was able to mix my
own boogers in with
those beans!

103
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,537
So now he's covered
in beans AND boogers!
Take that, Lee!
[vomiting]

104
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,303
How is the guy supposed
to be grossed-out if
he has no idea what
you pulled off?

105
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:17,537
It doesn't matter to
me if he has no idea!

106
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:22,770
Lord Orochimaru...!
What is that you're
wearing!?

It's ridiculous! That
outfit's not going to
food them!

111
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:34,603
It is a tiger!

112
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:35,803
Where did it
come from!?

113
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:37,370
Do you think
it's from the
zoo!?

114
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:38,903
I don't know!

115
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:42,170
What the heck!? How
can they be scared?
The costume's so
amateurish!

116
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:44,470
What's this tiger
doing out here anyway?

117
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:47,570
It looks like he
is trying to tell
us something...

118
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:52,603
I have been looking
everywhere for you! You
are the spitting image of
my long-lost husband!

119
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:56,937
This has been very
upsetting to me! I
hope you are finally
ready to come home.

120
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,637
Excuse me?

121
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,737
She's mistaken you
for someone, because
of those pants.

122
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,870

<i>it, I would know</i>
<i>those stripes anywhere!</i>

124
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,437
Oh no! This is
made from her
husband's pelt!

125
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,303
Lee...

126
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:13,803
What are you
gonna do?

127
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:17,303
The right thing,
of course! Consider
your husband returned!

128
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:18,837
I can't believe
you are doing this!

129
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,803
[sigh]

130
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:26,921
I had it figured out right.
I knew he'd take his pants
off eventually, I just had
to push the right button!

131
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:31,121
So you were after the
kid's pants? You mean
that's what this whole
exercise was about?

132
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:36,088
Now I just need to get
the villagers out here to
witness this, and he'll be
trapped like a naked rat!

about to go down.

135
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:46,788
Being free of that
impersonation has given
me a cool, refreshing
feeling in my lower half.

136
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,955
Ya know what,
you're already
way too free!

137
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:50,621
We finally found
the onis!

138
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,621
You won't get away
from us again!

00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:54,155
What!? Yikes!

140
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:55,188
There's no escape!

141
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:56,355
How did they
track us down?

<i>to be so mean to me?</i>

145
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:08,055
<i>What did I ever do to</i>
<i>provoke them!?</i>

146
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:12,988
<i>Is it because I am</i>
<i>an oni? And if so,</i>
<i>are onis this powerless?</i>

147
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:18,588
<i>That is impossible!</i>
<i>Onis are terrifying</i>
<i>beasts! They cannot</i>
<i>be weak!</i>

148
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:23,188
I... get it!

149
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,821

<i>The bean-throwing is</i>

But I have so
many left in
the box!

152
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,755
Okay! Time
to go home.

153
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,121
Lee!

154

Are you okay?

155
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:41,321
I think I am
fine... sort of.

156
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,288
[nasty chuckle]
That's too bad...

157

Orochimaru!

I've come to finish
you... for good!

[gasps]

161
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:54,755
It is alright, my
friend. You do not
have to act so evil.

162
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:55,788
Huh?

163
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:57,388
What are you
talking about?

164
00:09:57,421 --> 00:10:01,221
It is quite simple
really. I learned
something today,
playing the oni...

165
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:02,888
I know how
they feel.

166
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:05,021
What? I beg
you're pardon?

167
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:09,721
I can see now that
oni truly just want
to make friends and
play with everybody.

168
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:13,055
For instance...
It is like cats
with mice....

169
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:18,588
...or monsters
with heroes...
or kaiju with
cities...!

170
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:23,955
They end up being cast
in the role of villains,
but really, to them, the
fighting is all in good fun.

171
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:28,155
That is how you
feel, right,
Orochimaru?

172
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:30,088
I suppose.

173
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:36,655
You are more than powerful
enough to destroy the village,
but you only try these
petty idiotic schemes.

174
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:41,621
You really just have
fun tussling with us,
and want to keep doing
so, do you not?

175
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:45,021
What?! You are out
of your mind. I
refuse to listen
to this dribble!

176
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:47,088
Prepare to die
Lee! Huh!?

177
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:51,055
Feel free to come at
me and do your worst,
Orochimaru!

178
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:56,221
Believe me, it is
perfectly okay,
because today I
am the oni!

179
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,088
Huhhhhh?

180
00:10:58,121 --> 00:10:59,088
Do it!

181
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:03,621
You get away from me,
you nut case! You're
freaking me outttttt!

[panting breaths]

185
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,372
Looks like both of
you are worn out!
That's my cue to hit
the road... bye-bye!

186
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:34,032
Ah! I did not
expect him to
disappear like
that!

187
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,732
I'm so exhausted.
It's hopeless...

188
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:40,766
It's alright. This
has been a
particularly long
mission.

189
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,799
I agree. We need
to find somewhere
we can all rest.

190
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:53,566
"The Raikage is Under Attack"

191
00:11:57,932 --> 00:11:59,732
So that's the Hidden
Cloud Village...

192
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:04,099
If I'm right, that's the
place where the ninja who
hosts the Eight-Tails
inside his body lives.

193
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,966
Yo yo! Did I hear
somebody call for me?

194

Killer Bee's my name
and rappin' is
definitely my game!

195
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:17,132
I see we got us some
ninja from the Leaf!
Are y'all sneakin' around
tryna be a thief?

196
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,899
Gimme the word,
y'all! Fools, ya fools!

197
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:21,866
Is this some
kind of joke?

I'm tellin' you now,
this ain't no joke!

Preach on, rap-
master! I'm down for
some smoked salmon!

203
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,932
I agree completely!
In fact, I would
love some smoked
sausage!

204

Will you stop
trying to imitate

'Cause I don't want

Oh please, I have
countless enemies
out there.

226

I've spent my whole
life fighting other
shinobi, and other
villages!

227
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,966
The fact of the matter
is, shinobi are fated
to hate one another.

228
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,232
I do understand.

229

Hm? What's wrong,
Neji? You look so
mad...

Nothing at all.

We were just

And you, Lord Raikage.

239

And who are these
people walking with
you? Leaf ninjas?

240

This is serious! They
could be Master Bee's
new disciples!

241

If they're any good,
they may end up taking

heavy imagination!

cutting....

00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:37,866
This is terrible!
He hit his tongue
and Black Panther
became <i>panties!</i>

286
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,899
AARGGHHHHH!
Looks like Lord Raikage is
receiving a critical hit!

287
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:44,799
Darn it! Now the
intruder's getting
away!

288
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:47,132
Lightening!
Laser! Support---

289
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,032
Braaaaa!

290
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:52,766
Oh come on, guys.
That's really pushing
things too far.

291
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,832
Nooooo!

292
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:57,632
This is becoming
some kind of
disturbing sexy jutsu!

293
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,999
Hm?

294
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:01,866
I won't let anyone
hurt my brother!

295
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:04,666
Stand back while I
take care of this
bad mother--!

296
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,599
Did he grow an
<i>octopus</i> tentacle?

297
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:09,599
The Eight-Tailed Beast
lives inside Master Bee.

298
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:12,599
...and he's got
complete control
of its power when
he needs it!

299
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:18,999
Yo, people! I'm the
big Eight-O, and you
don't mess with me,
YO! Yeahhhh!

300
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:22,699
Hey! You're not supposed
to transform inside the
village!

301
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:25,899
What's the big deal,
big daddy?

302
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:29,166
Bee! You idiot!
Turn back to
normal at once!

303
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,766
Walking around the
village in that form
is dang--- AHHHH

304
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,532
Uh oh! I just
nailed my big bro!

305
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:39,499
Have you gone insane!? We
have to find Lord Raikage
as fast as possible!

306
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:42,632
Now that he's been
injured, he'll be
defenseless, and easy
prey for the assassin!

307
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:47,666
Hey, bro, I did mess
up! But at least I had
the courage to fess up!
Ya fool! Ya fool!

308
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:51,632
[groan] Just being
around these crazies
completely exhausts me!

309
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,532
Let me tell you something,
I feel your pain...!

310
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,432
Huh?

311
00:17:56,466 --> 00:18:00,599
Hold on a second! I
just noticed something.
Did your white-eyed friend
wander off somewhere?

312
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:03,766
Our village is pretty
big, you know. He might
have gotten himself lost!

313
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,699
He is right! I
just realized,
Neji is gone!

314
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:14,699
Hm. Let me as, this white-
eyed friend of yours, does
he happen to be... a member
of the Hyuga family?

315
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:16,666
Yes, actually.

316
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:18,132
It's possible...

317
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,399
What is possible,
sensei?

318
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,032
I know both you and
Tenten have been
told the story...

319
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:28,132
...about how the Leaf
and Cloud villages were
at war years ago... and in
the course of that action...

320
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,166
...Neji's father
was killed.

321
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,199
[gasp]

322
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:33,566
Yes, I remember.

323
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,899
Excuse me?

324
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:36,499
What are you guys
talking about?

325
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,266
Thirteen years ago, there
was very nearly a war
between our two villages...

326
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:43,532
...centered around the
Leaf's Hyuga clan and
their Byakugan.

327
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:45,966
But ultimately...

328
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,132
<i>Neji's father sacrificed</i>
<i>himself to stop the war.</i>

329
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:53,632
<i>And in the process,</i>
<i>protected both his clan,</i>
<i>and the two villages.</i>

330
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:58,199
I see now. That gives
your friend Neji more
than enough motive to
go after the Raikage.

331
00:18:58,232 --> 00:18:59,966
You have no
proof of that!

332
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,066
<i>(Darui)</i>
<i>You have to admit</i>
<i>the possibility.</i>

333
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,766
[groan]

334
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,032
<i>(Darui)</i>
<i>And if it's true, we have</i>
<i>to find and confront Neji</i>
<i>as soon as possible!</i>

335
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,666
I finally found him.

336
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,566
Oh no! Are we
too late?

337
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,299
[grunts]

338
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:26,866
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Wait a minute...</i>
<i>Neji is protecting</i>
<i>the Raikage!</i>

339
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:31,099
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>You are right, Tenten!</i>
<i>And the enemy is that rogue</i>
<i>ninja we've been chasing!</i>

340
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:35,099
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>He used a very high</i>
<i>level invisibility</i>
<i>technique to escape!</i>

341
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:39,799
I decided to go off
on my own, to make
sure I wouldn't lose
sight of him!

342
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:42,166
There's no hiding
from my Byakugan!

343
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:45,199
But... aren't
you a Hyuga?

344
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:48,132
I don't get it...
Why would you help
me, considering
our history?

345
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,766
...The fights between
our two families?

346
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:55,099
...it's because of my
father's last words.

347
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:58,599
Please pass this
message on to my
son, Neji...

348
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:05,899
Tell him I chose death
freely.. to protect my
family... my village..
and my son...

349
00:20:05,932 --> 00:20:11,232
...that just for this
one time.. I wanted
to rebel against my
destiny as a Hyuga...

350
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:14,966
...and at this critical moment
...to choose my own fate.

351
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:18,245
And that is all
there is...

352
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:24,784
Lord Raikage, you said
earlier that we shinobi
are fated to hate one
another...

353
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:28,124
I understand what
you are saying...
but I reject it!

354
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:31,544
I choose to rebel
against that fate!

355
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:32,944
Hm?

356
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:36,611
You aren't getting
away this time!

357
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:37,477
[grunt]

358
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:38,377
Yeeeeahhhhhh!

359
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:40,611
ALright, it is time
for the Lariat!

360
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:43,177
Why do you want
to use a Lariat?

361
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:44,077
Woah!

362
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,277
Lookout!

363
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,211
Ahhhh Wait! Whoa!
Just a minute..!

364
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:51,211
Eight Trigrams
rotation Lariat!

365
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:56,077
Yeah, he tripped at the
worst time, but he was
able to disguise it as a
new move!

366
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:01,544
You guys really
came through for
us...

367
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:03,411
It was nothing...

368
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:08,511
...but its a good start.
The leaf and Cloud villages
will walk together, toward
a brighter future.

369
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:16,477
After all, I know two
incredible shinobi who would
do anything to protect both
our villages for their families.

370
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:19,411
Our villages are
their families...

371
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:26,611
[small sob]

372
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:31,277
Your strong dedication sent
shivers up my spine! Now
you've got to come along
with me for some training time!

373
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:34,944
Ya heart me there,
perfect tool, fool,
ya fool!

374
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:36,344
No thanks...

all out here, let's

up some rice, yo!

377
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:45,311
I am ready to work,
but first I need some
JERK, chicken that is!

378
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,244
Oh boy. This can't
lead to anything good.
