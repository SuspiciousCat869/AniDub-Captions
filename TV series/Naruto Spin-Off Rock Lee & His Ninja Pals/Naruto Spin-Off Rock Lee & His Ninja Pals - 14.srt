1
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:57,571
What's your dream job?
If you could be anything...
A baseball player? A soccer
star? Maybe an actor! How

2
00:01:57,604 --> 00:02:01,671
'bout a ninja? The most
popular job in the Hidden
Leaf is, of course...

3
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,938
Anything but a ninja?!

4
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:07,904
I hate to admit this,
considering that's what
we do here, but you're
correct. Not that long

5
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:13,971
ago, it was everybody's
dream job. But all that
has changed. Frankly, it's
just not that popular anymore.

6
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:16,504
And is there some
reason for this?

7
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:21,438
Well, despite all the
hard work it takes to
learn ninjutsu, it's not
a very stable career.

8
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:23,938
What are the popular
choices, for most people?

9
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:26,971
Civil service and corporate
jobs with a regular salary.

10
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:29,871
Oh. So people prefer
to eat, I guess.

11
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:37,538
Lady Tsunade's very concerned
and has been trying to think
of ways to spark interest in
the children.

12
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:39,538
Now go!

13
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:45,438
Advance three spaces,
Tsunade! The board says
you failed to hide your
wrinkles with makeup!

14
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:46,804
Not a very good move!

15
00:02:47,304 --> 00:02:49,571
Really? She doesn't
seem that concerned
to me!

16
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:54,271
Have no fear, Shizune!
If I teach the kids it
is possible to become
first-class ninjas

17
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:57,504
without having to learn
ninjutsu, that should
change their minds!

18
00:02:57,538 --> 00:03:00,371
That might work. If
they actually believe
you.

19
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:03,304
The question is, how
should I make my case?

20
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:05,538
I must go talk
to Guy Sensei!

21
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,271
[chuckle]

22
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:11,404
I am sure Guy Sensei will
know what to say to the
kids to turn them around!

23
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:12,304
<i>[gasp]</i>

24
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:13,504
There he is now!

25
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:14,838
Guy Sensei!

26
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:18,438
I believe ninjutsu is
all we'll ever really
need.

27
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:19,504
[screaming]

28
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:25,171
<i>...ninjutsu is all</i>
<i>we'll ever really need!</i>

29
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,904
<i>"I Want my Popularity Back!"</i>

30
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:37,338
[sigh]

31
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,871
Really? You're sure
that's what he said?

32
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:45,304
I have to assume he was
implying that it is
ninjutsu that makes us
ninja in the first place.

33
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:48,804
It was obvious that
ninjutsu is what Guy
Sensei cares about.

34
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,571
However...

35
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:57,571
If you want to be a real
ninja without using
ninjutsu, then follow me,
but be prepared to endure

36
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,404
whatever hardships
may come along.

37
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:00,804
Got it, Guy Sensei!

38
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:03,671
I know, right?

39
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,371
[screaming]

40
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:06,938
No desserts
for us, Lee!

41
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,704
I understand,
Guy Sensei!

42
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:10,771
That's the hardship
you endured?!

43
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:13,671
It was just the first of
many I would experience.

44
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:14,871
Right...

45
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:16,271
<i>[chuckling]</i>
<i>Awesome!</i>

46
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,704
[laughing]

47
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:22,538
Wind Style Jutsu!

48
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,804
[cheering]

49
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:25,871
What a drag,
but here goes!

50
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:30,938
Awesome! Wow!

51
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,371
Alright, who wants
to be a ninja now?

52
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:34,604
Me!

53
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:39,704
How do we overcome this?
The ninjutsu of Naruto
and the others is super-
popular!

54
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,438
[crying]

55
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:45,771
Lee, it's not like
you to be such a
quitter!

56
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:51,471
Either find a way around
it or embrace the ninjutsu,
but don't sit there sobbing!
You have to make a choice!

57
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:55,438
I hear what you are
saying. I will do my
best!

58
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,171
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

59
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:03,704
Naruto and Shikamaru are
going to assist me in
my ninjutsu training!

60
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,804
We couldn't find
a way to say no.

61
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,504
Don't worry, Bushy
Brow! This'll get
you excited about
training!

62
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:13,971
I fail to see how this
is supposed to inspire
Lee to train.

63
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:16,538
I am absolutely
throbbing with
excitement!

64
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:17,838
Control yourself!

65
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:19,771
Oink! Oink! Oink!

66
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:23,704
Alright Lee, I'll attack,
and your job is to counter
me with ninjutsu.

67
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:24,871
I understand.

68
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:27,171
Here I go.
Ready?!

69
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,104
What?!

70
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:32,438
No way! He used the
Replacement Jutsu?!

71
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:35,604
Lee! Where are you?

72
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:37,338
<i>Right over here.</i>

73
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,338
Over where? What
do you mean?

74
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,638
Right over here.

75
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:41,238
Huh?

76
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:43,871
I'm standing in
front of you,
can't you see.

77
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:46,338
I can see Neji
talking, not you!

78
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:47,404
Exactly!

79
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:49,438
That is Replacement Jutsu!

80
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:53,338
What's the matter with
you two?! That's not a
jutsu, it's just
ventriloquism!

81
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,271
Why have I been
reduced to such!

82
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:56,838
Why did you go
along with it?!

83
00:05:56,871 --> 00:05:58,938
Those two make an
awesome combination!

84
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,671
<i>Nobody asked for</i>
<i>your opinion!</i>

85
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:04,838
Does my voice...
Sound a little...
Slow to you...

86
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:07,504
Of course it does,
so knock it off
right now!

87
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:11,404
Stop with the stupid
games, Lee, and use
some real ninjutsu,
right now!

88
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,771
Fine, but I will have
to use the summoning
jutsu!

89
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:16,271
What?! You mean you're
able to do that?!

90
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:17,604
Summoning Jutsu!

91
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:20,638
No good! That's
Neji again!

92
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,838
I said I would help, but
I didn't think I'd be
humiliated every time Lee

93
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,904
failed to engage his
jutsu properly!

94
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:30,538
Bushy Brow! I'm impressed!
Where in the world did you
learn to summon like that?!

95
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:31,404
Oh come on!

96
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:33,238
Here we go!
Round two!

97
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,871
Alright, fine!
Break through!

98
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:36,138
What?!

99
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:39,638
How am I going to do
that in this get up?
There's only one way!

100
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:43,638
Eight Trigrams
Rotation!

101
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,304
His jutsu is
very powerful!

102
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:49,304
I have to meet that
force with equal force!

103
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:52,604
Flying Weapons,
Bladestorm Riot!

104
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:55,304
I will counter with
the Rasengan!

105
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:57,571
How do you know about
the Rasengan, Lee?!

106
00:06:57,971 --> 00:06:59,938
Naruto taught me
the secret!

107
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,438
It's simple once you know
how. Just squeeze the
chakra out of your body,
into the palm of your hand.

108
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:07,638
Time to try it!

109
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:09,738
[screaming]

110
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,771
[gasps]

111
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,938
Well, he was able to
squeeze out his chakra!

112
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,738
That isn't chakra!

113
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,571
Rasengan!

114
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:29,904
No, no, don't do it!
That's not a Rasengan
you've go there!

115
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:30,738
[grunting]

116
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:33,271
And...Hee-yah!

117
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:35,204
Didn't you hear
what I said?!

118
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:38,504
[screaming]

119
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:40,471
My eyes!
My eyes!

120
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:43,538
Such an amazing
destructive force!

121
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:45,838
This training
is such a drag.

122
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:47,771
And stinky, on
top of that.

123
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:53,438
I have got my confidence
back! This jutsu is
definitely the key!

124
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:57,704
Wait a minute. You don't
even know how to handle
it yet...

125
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:02,271
[laughter]

126
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:04,404
Hm? What happened here?

127
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:07,504
Summoning Jutsu!

128
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:08,638
[gasps]

129
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:09,804
Prepare for...

130
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:14,938
...Rasengan!

131
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:15,871
[laughing]

132
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:18,671
That smells! It's
making my eyeballs
hurt!

133
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:25,938
I did it! Now I can
finally say that I
am also a user of
ninjutsu!

134
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:27,838
Lee!

135
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:30,338
Guy Sensei!

136
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:33,671
I see you're trying
to use ninjutsu,
buy why?

137
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:36,838
I overheard you the
other day. Remember
what you said?

138
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:40,704
I believe ninjutsu is
all we'll ever really
need!

139
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:44,604
After hearing that, I
trained very hard, so
I could use it, as well!

140
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:45,504
You fool!

141
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:46,704
Is something wrong?

142
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,404
<i>I can assume</i>
<i>I messed up?</i>

143
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:55,838
I don't know what you
heard, but ninjutsu is
very powerful! It's not
to be used as a mere trick!

144
00:08:55,871 --> 00:09:00,404
I hear what you are
saying, but what were
you talking about with
Yamato Sensei?

145
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:05,438
That? We were just
brainstorming on how to
get kids excited about
becoming a ninja!

146
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:12,571
To get girls interested,
I believe ninjutsu is all
we'll ever really need!

147
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:19,904
You missed the first part
about my plan to start a
Ninjutsu Girls Talent Troupe!

148
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,771
Are you kidding me...

149
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:28,204
Tell me what your dream
is, Lee. Isn't it to become
a first-rate ninja even
though you can't use ninjutsu!

150
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:31,671
Correct.

151
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:35,238
That's what I thought,
and developing you into
such a ninja...

152
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:37,604
...has always been
my dream!

153
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:39,671
Guy Sensei!

154
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,304
[crying]

155
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:45,804
I am so sorry, Guy
Sensei! I completely
misunderstood what you
were doing!

156
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:48,304
It's okay, Lee!
Don't say anything
more!

157
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,304
Sensei!

158
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,304
Lee!

159
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:51,504
<i>We've got trouble!</i>

160
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:56,504
A bunch of ninja from
other villages have gotten
together, and are attacking
us right now!

161
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,371
This is a good
opportunity!

162
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:02,804
It will be difficult,
but it's a chance to
prove our ninja way.

163
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:04,671
I agree, Sensei!

164
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,971
Do I wanna know
what's going on
there?

165
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:08,338
Uh-uh...

166
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,504
[screaming]

167
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:14,171
Ha! Ha! That's it!
Run away!

168
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:17,238
Hey, dummies! What
are you guys up to?

169
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:20,504
You think you can storm
in here? You're not
getting away with it!

170
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:22,604
Really? Well, we'll
see about that!

171
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,571
You're gonna wish
you hadn't interfered!

172
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:26,638
Let's do it, guys!
Take 'em all out!

173
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:27,371
<i>Right!</i>

174
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:28,904

175
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:29,971

Eight Trigrams,
Sixty-Four Palm!

179
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,771
Bladestorm Riot!

180
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:38,638
Alright, Lee. You
ready to jump in?

181
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,604
Oh yeah!

182
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,671
[attacking yell]

183
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:46,204
Here comes the Leaf
Super-Great Twister!

184
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:48,338
[screaming]

00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:53,871
[cheering]

187
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:55,738
That was cool!

188
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:56,904
I wanna be a ninja!

189
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:57,904
Me, too!

190
00:10:57,938 --> 00:10:58,904
And me!

191
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:00,804
Even I want to!

192
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:06,704
Nice job, Lee!
Great!

193
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:09,504
Thanks, Sensei!

194
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:11,638
Lady Tsunade...

195
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,571
After that demonstration,
I think our problem is
nearly solved!

196
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:17,704
Mm-hm! I couldn't
agree more!

197
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:23,571
Lee and the gang were
then entrusted with the
task of restoring the
popularity of ninja.

198
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:31,804
Of course, nothing is as
easy as it first appears.
As you can imagine, the
debut of the 'Leaf Village

199
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:38,804
48,' which was Guy Sensei's
entertainment troupe of
ninjutsu girls, did not go
over as well as he had hoped.

200
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:53,388
It's almost like
clockwork, really...

201
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:58,622
When the rainy season
finally ends. A brutal
summer is sure to follow.

202
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:02,255
I did not think we
were going to make
it this morning.

203
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,988
I was ready to go back
to bed as soon as I
got up.

204
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:06,522
Yeah...
[groaning]

205
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:11,055
Maybe we can have some
cold noodles for lunch.
What do you think, Guy
Sensei?

206
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:11,988
Well...

207
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:12,522
[gasps]

208
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:16,155
Are you alright?

209
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:19,122
I don't think this
workout is working
out for you.

210
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,622
I'll be fine in a
minute. I just missed
breakfast this morning.

211
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,255
That can be
very dangerous!

212
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:28,588
I once passed up a
complete breakfast,
and it still bothers
me to this day!

213
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:33,322
I am down to plate
number twenty! And
all I have to do now
is choose between

214
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:34,722
<i>chicken and salmon roe!</i>

215
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,155
Ahh!

216
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,422
The salmon roe!

217
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:40,455
Great! Agh!

218
00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:44,155
950 per serving!

219
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:47,588
To eat this, I would
need a loan from the
bank! I will come back

220
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:49,322
someday and have a
big plate of you!

221
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:53,555
The point is supposed to
be, 'if you're hungry,
you can't beat your
enemies!' Not, 'if you

222
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:56,355
don't have the money
you can't eat gold-
plated sushi!'

223
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:59,588
What if I make a plate
of your favorite curry!
That should perk you up!

224
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,022
That sounds great.
I'll just go to the
table...

225
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:07,088
[gasps]

226
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,622
Is it the curry?!

227
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,388
[groaning]

228
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,455
If so, we can make
something else!

229
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,655
Guy Sensei!

230
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:23,388
<i>"Death!"</i>

231
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,522
He is being hospitalized?

232
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:30,422
Yes, once he collapsed,
we really had no choice.

233
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:33,455
But I wouldn't worry.
It's probably just
heat exhaustion.

234
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,555
I hope you are right.

235
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:38,488
It's fine. This happens
whenever there's a heat
wave.

236
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:41,422
He'll be back on his
feet after resting for
a couple of days.

237
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:42,755
Are you sure
about that?

238
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,522
It's Guy Sensei, c'mon!

239
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:45,488
[affirmative grunt]

240
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:47,588
I suppose you are right.

241
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,988
However...

242
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:58,255
He has been in here
for three days! And he
does not look any better!

243
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:02,222
Well, part of the problem
is, he refuses to eat any
of the hospital food!

244
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:05,588
These people are trying
to poison me with this
watery gruel!

245
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:09,322
It's ridiculous! I need
something more substantial,
if they expect me to get well!

246
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:13,655
I'm they're concerned that
your system can't absorb
anything that puts too
much pressure on it!

247
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,422
What exactly did
you have in mind?!

248
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:19,588
I'm sure if they were to
give me my favorite curry,
I'd make a full recovery,
lickety-split!

249
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:23,222
Have you completely lost
your mind? Your stomach's been
weakened by this condition!

250
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:26,755
Believe me, putting spicy
food like curry in it,
will make things much worse!

251
00:14:26,788 --> 00:14:28,988
Now eat this, or
I'll force you!

252
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:30,555
<i>She is right,</i>
<i>Guy Sensei!</i>

253
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:31,288
Huh?!

254
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,122
You will never get better
if you do not eat something
nutritious.

255
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:37,522
Would you mind telling me
why you're eating his food?!

256
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:39,222
...if I eat that
garbage, I'm only
gonna get worse!

257
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:43,422
Guy Sensei is suffering
from more than exhaustion.
I'm afraid he's terminally
stubborn.

258
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,522
It's his natural
condition.

259
00:14:45,555 --> 00:14:49,622
Guy Sensei, I figured
it would be boring, stuck
in here for so long, so I
brought you a book to read.

260
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,555
Why thank you, Lee!
How terribly thoughtful
of you!

261
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:55,022
I took a chance, but
I thought you might
like it!

[screaming]

263
00:14:59,388 --> 00:14:59,722
Huh?!

264
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:00,988
Want curry!

265
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:02,655
This is making
things worse!

266
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:05,088
You're right! Maybe
we'd better change
the subject!

267
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:09,322
Once you get better, Guy
Sensei, we can all start
planning our summer
vacation!

268
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:10,688
How 'bout the beach?!

269
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:13,188
<i>That sounds pretty nice!</i>

270
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,222
<i>Hooray for Okinawa!</i>

271
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,955
If it was up to me,
I'd go to the mountains!

<i>mountains to choose</i>
<i>from!</i>

<i>I have to say, you</i>
<i>make a good case!</i>

275
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,722
I know it's tough, but
if you can't decide, we
could go camping, and
spend time at each one!

276
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:32,155
You know what would
make it perfect? If
we had fireworks at
each place!

<i>♪</i> Oh, how I love
camping with you! <i>♪</i>

278
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:39,388
And what could be better
to eat on a camping trip,
than a big plate of curry!

279
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:41,222
Oh, please!

280
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,122
Lee, you idiot!

281
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:46,722
You all have to leave
right now! This patient
cannot endure any further
traumatic incidents!

282
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:48,422
Sorry about that...

283
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,322
Lee...
Lee!

284
00:15:51,355 --> 00:15:52,388
What is it?!

285
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:56,555
Be a good boy and bring
me some curry, will you?
And don't let the staff
catch you.

286
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,422
What? But you heard
what the nurse said!

287
00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:00,622
Think of it as a
training exercise!

290
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:10,722
Hey. I wonder if they
haven't been telling
us the truth. Maybe it's
more than heat exhaustion.

291
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:12,122
Well, what could it be?

292
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,122
Might Guy has a
big problem.

293

[gasps]

294
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:17,522
Why fool around? We
should just remove
it all.

295
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:20,355
Really? I'm not so
sure he'll agree to
that.

296
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,688
I don't think we should
give him the option to
decide.

297
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:25,355
That's pretty severe.
He won't have much
left at all.

298
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:26,455
Huh?!

299
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:28,288
I knew it was serious!

What do you think's
happened?!

301
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,555
I don't know, but it
can't be good if they're
talking about surgery!

302
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:36,388
One of his organs
must be affected!

303
00:16:36,422 --> 00:16:39,255
You heard what she
said! Guy Sensei won't
have much left!

304
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:41,955
The poor guy!

305
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:45,888
Be a good boy and bring
me some curry, will you?
And don't let the staff
catch you!

306
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,822
We can't just ignore the
man's needs! That very
well may be his last
request!

307
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,788
I will not
accept that!

308
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:52,722
Lee...

309
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:57,688
As Guy Sensei's student,
I refuse to accept that he
might be about to breathe
his last breath!

310
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:01,922
I will move heaven and
earth to save him! And
to that end, I have no
choice but to get him

311
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,622
the curry he
desperately wants!

312
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,688
Are you willing
to help me?!

313
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:06,688
[affirmative grunt]

314
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:14,955
<i>Shizune is</i>
<i>standing guard.</i>

315
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:17,055
<i>Calm down, or she'll</i>
<i>get suspicious!</i>

316
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:18,822
<i>G-Good Day, ma'am.</i>

317
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:21,055
We have a package
here for Might Guy.

318
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:23,355
Oh! Okay, go
right in!

319
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:27,788
Huh? What is
that smell?

320
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:34,788
Let me say, nothing is
going on here! We are
not trying to sneak in
any curry!

321
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:37,288
Don't be silly.
Of course it's
curry!

322
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,555
Clearly, we failed.

323
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:50,522
Excuse us for bothering
the patient, but it is
time for a nice, yummy
shot!

324
00:17:50,555 --> 00:17:52,888
Not in a million
years! Take it away!

325
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:56,322
This is a lot harder
than we thought.

326
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:01,588
Look at that! They've
beefed up security to
his room! This is
horrible! I feel like

327
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,755
some kind of criminal!

328
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:04,022
Criminal...

329
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:06,355
Of course!
That is the
ticket!

330
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,855
Good afternoon,
everybody. Would
this be Might Guy's
room?

331
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:14,422
We're from the police.

332
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:15,788
<i>Her are our badges.</i>

333
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:17,688
What's this about?

334
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,488
It's an urgent matter.
Might Guy is a person
of interest in the Apple
Killer Case. We've come

335
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:22,455
here to interview him.

336
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:23,655
But, no one called.

337
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:26,722
No 'buts' young lady!
We're going in there
right now!

338
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:33,222
Come clean! We
know it was you!

339
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:36,722
Stop it! We're in a
hospital and this is
a sick man! You can't
treat him in such a

340
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:37,555
rough way!

341
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:38,855
That is correct.
[gasp]

342
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,955
This lady has made
a good point.

343
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,688
Roakely, sir!

344
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:47,755
Detective White Eyes,
there is no need to
beat a confession out
of the suspect.

345
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:49,655
I apologize!

346
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:54,555
Detective Roakely,
a.k.a. 'The Extractor!'
I can't believe I'm finally
going to see him in action!

347
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:56,855
Watch closely,
Detective Spoilsport!

348
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:02,555
Sorry about the attitude,
there, my friend. These
kids today get much too
caught up in their work.

349
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:06,688
As a matter of fact, I
have a twenty-year old
son at home myself.

350
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:11,455
He is always getting
into fights. I have no
idea where he gets his
aggression from.

351
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:16,055
But no matter what, I
always find we can talk
it out over a good meal.

352
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:21,022
It works every time. I
think the food helps us
communicate.

353
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:25,955
<i>You look like you might</i>
<i>be hungry. What do you</i>
<i>say we share a meal</i>
<i>together?</i>

354
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:32,388
Nurse, I am sure the patient
is on a restricted diet
because of his illness, but
I need to get some answers

355
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:36,855
quickly in the most
efficient way possible.
Would you mind looking
away for a moment?

356
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:38,655
Uh! Of course!

357
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:44,088
<i>What a perfect plan Lee</i>
<i>came up with! Even Shizune</i>
<i>can't object! Now for the</i>
<i>curry!</i>

358
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:46,455
I just happened to
have this on me!

359
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:49,555
Why'd you bring a
fried pork bowl?!

360
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,055
Ahhh!

361
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:51,888
[screaming]

362
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:57,522
I got carried away with
the plan, and thought
fried pork bowl would fit
the scene better!

363
00:19:57,555 --> 00:19:59,588
You idiot! All he
wanted was the curry!

364
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:02,588
We have no choice now!
We have to break in!

365
00:20:03,422 --> 00:20:04,855
Hold it, you fools!

366
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:08,088
You're not getting
through, no matter
what you do! Form a
line, everybody!

367
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:08,888
Got it!

368
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:10,288
Freeze!

369
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:12,688
Curry Wave Attack!

370
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:13,922
[screaming]

371
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:16,288
Eight Trigrams,
Sixty-Four Palms!

372
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:18,055
[screaming]

373
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:20,888
Flying Weapons,
Bladestorm Riot!

374
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:23,322
[screaming]

375
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,488
Lee! Go on, leave
these people to us!

376
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:26,222
Wait a minute...

377
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:28,355
Get that curry
to Guy Sensei!

378
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:28,988
Alright!

379
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:36,422
Hang tough, guys! I will be
back! I will deliver this
meal, then return to free
you from this vicious assault!

380
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:38,455
Guy Sensei!

381
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:41,955
Fear not, my friend!
I have brought you
the curry!

382
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:43,455
Huh?

383
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:47,622
Hm? What's your
problem, laddie?

384
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:50,055
You are not
Guy Sensei!

385
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:52,655
What is happening here?!

386
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:56,788
[laughing]

387
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:58,722
[screaming]

388
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:03,288
Are you looking for Guy?
We discharged him earlier
this afternoon.

389
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:07,622
He ate a nutritious meal
and got better right away!

390
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:11,722
He ran out of here,
shouting something about
pigging out on curry!

391
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:14,622
I- I thought he
had no time left!

392
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:16,022
<i>I can explain that!</i>

393
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:17,622
[screaming]

394
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:24,955
When you've got thick
helmet hair like Might
Guy, you can get over-
heated. I asked a doctor

395
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:29,055
how we could convince
Guy that his hair was
raising his body
temperature too much.

396
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,655
Why fool around? We
should just remove
it all.

397
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:34,355
Really? I'm not so
sure he'll agree to
that.

398
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:36,922
I don't think we should
give him the option to
decide.

399
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:39,688
<i>That's pretty severe.</i>
<i>He won't have much</i>
<i>left at all.</i>

400
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:41,855
Oh! Now it all
makes sense!

401
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:43,388
You three...

402
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:45,355
...have to pay for
what you've done!

403
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,388
Huh?

404
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:47,488
Ahh!

405
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:50,422
Now it's your turn to
spend some time in
the hospital!

406
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:53,955
<i>Sorry!</i>

407
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:58,655
Oh, this is so good!

408
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:01,322
Get better soon, guys!
Then you can eat some
with me!

409
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:06,022
We'd show you more, but
we're in a big curry-
I mean, hurry- to get to
dinner ourselves!

410
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:51,529
Hey, everyone, I have
great news! A large
pool has opened up in
the Leaf Village!

411
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,663
<i>Really?! Ah, yes!</i>

412
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:54,457
It is true!

413
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:59,111
<i>Join us next time for:</i>
<i>"The Pool's Finally Open!"</i>
<i>and "The Super Happy Orochi-</i>
<i>Pool Park!</i>

414
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:01,585
<i>Wait a minute, that name</i>
<i>sounds a bit sketchy...</i>

415
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:03,185
How so?

416
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:06,085
<i>Orochi Pool Park, eh?</i>
<i>Sounds fun! Maybe I'll</i>
<i>tag along too!</i>

417
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:11,518
<i>Not you too, Lady</i>
<i>Tsunade! No! All I</i>
<i>get is a bad feeling</i>
<i>about all of this!</i>
