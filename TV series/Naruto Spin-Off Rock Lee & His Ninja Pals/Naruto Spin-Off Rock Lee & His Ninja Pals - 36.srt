1
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:54,533
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

2
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,766
Another day, another
mission. Great job,
everyone!

3
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,133
Hmm! We're
finally done!

4
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:06,399
Hey! Why don't we take
a little break at this
tea house before we
go back?

5
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:10,233
Do not be foolish,
Tenten! We have no time
for loitering! We should

6
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:12,899
run home as fast
as possible! On
our hands!

7
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,433
He's right, Tenten.

8
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,533
Can we at least
walk normally?

9
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:17,433
Never!

10
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:19,933
Remember! I have
genius rivals to
surpass!

11
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,933
Come on, don't be such
a wet blanket. Let's
live a little!

12
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:25,666
But while we are
relaxing, Gaara is
probably-

13
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,166
Sitting down,
eating dumplings?!

14
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,633
What?! Dumplings?!

15
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:33,899
Hey, look, it's
the Leaf Guys.

16
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,166
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>way out here?</i>

17
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,166
Being the Kazekage,
I sometimes have to
visit other nations.

18
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,799
Tell me, Gaara. Are
those dumplings as
good as they look?

19
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,633
Lee, you're not going
to challenge Gaara to
another stupid contest,
are you?

20
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,199
You always get way
too worked up about
them.

21
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:51,799
No need to worry.

22
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,566
We will be
just fine!

23
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:57,599
Just fine shouldn't
involve setting up the
Primary Lotus, you
nitwit!

24
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,399
Cut it out!

25
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,699
[screaming]

26
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,833
Give me a break.

27
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:05,599
Huh?

28
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:09,699
Bothering the Kazekage
with your oddball antics
again?

29
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,366
<i>Temari!</i>

30
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,699
<i>"Tenten vs Temari!"</i>

31
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:27,399
You've probably got some
catching up to do. Oh well,
I guess we may as well take
a quick breather.

32
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,699
<i>Lady! I'll take some</i>
<i>dumplings, please!</i>

33
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:36,399
Wow. Not only did she
blow all my weapons away,
she landed a powerful long-
range punchline while

34
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,666
doing it. Such
amazing skill.

35
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:39,499
My goodness...

36
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:40,433
Huh?

37
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:43,299
You're as incompetent
as ever. Such a shame.

38
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:44,799
[growling]

39
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,533
And just who are you
calling incompetent?

40
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:50,899
Did I stutter?
You, of course.

41
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:54,799
Ah! Excuse me. I seem
to be caught in the
middle!

42
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:56,833
Uhh...

43
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,899
Tenten?

44
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:01,533
<i>Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!</i>

45
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,533
Sorry, Lee.

46
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:05,299
What's going on?
That wasn't like
you at all.

47
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:09,433
She and I fought
once before, a
few years ago...

48
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:13,899
But no matter what I
did, she deflected
every single weapon
I threw at her.

49
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:20,899
That's all you
got? How boring.

50
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:27,599
It's not like I'm some
prodigy, so I had to work
really hard to improve on
my specialties.

51
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:33,633
But seeing my attacks to
be so completely ineffective
ate me up inside.

52
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,599
And that's the reason
why I lost my temper
earlier.

53
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,899
I know how you feel,
Tenten. Believe me!

54
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:43,833
Tenten!

55
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,033
Huh?

56
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:47,766
Put on these tights
and I guarantee you
will get stronger!

57
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:52,899
No!

58
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,666
Now then. This
might work.

59
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,266
Wow! That move
is so awesome!

60
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,899
<i>Let's take a little</i>
<i>bit more off here.</i>

61
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,766
Try this way
instead!

62
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:06,266
What in the world
are you two doing
back there?

63
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,899
I assure you there is
nothing to worry about.

64
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:13,466
I know your efforts
better than anyone.
You have worked hard
on your specialty.

65
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:15,466
Huh? Yeah. Sure.

66
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,499
There are many levels
of competition. One way
or another, you will
beat Temari!

67
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,166
Like, maybe with your...

68
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,799
Agh! She lost!

69
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,399
Don't compare those
without permission
you jerk!

70
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:32,933
All right. That's plenty
of break for now. You
ready to hit the road?

71
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,233
Hold on, please!

72
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,266
Before you leave, Gaara...

73
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,699
I challenge you!
Check these out!

74
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,799
That's not even
a contest!

75
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,866
I lost...

76
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,999
That's not what I
meant! Those are
volleyballs!

77
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:49,866
It figures. You people
just never change, do you.
Gaara, there's no need to
play along with their antics.

78
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,599
Come on, Lee. You
need to stop this.

79
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,533
You are not leaving
without facing...

80
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:55,533
Let's settle this!

81
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:55,966
Huh?

82
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,799
What?! Tenten...

83
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:03,499
I've been training nonstop
since our last match, too.
I refuse to keep losing
to her!

84
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,499
The rules are simple.
Whichever team steals
their opponent's Heaven

85
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:12,399
or Earth scroll wins
the battle and shall be
proclaimed the champion.

86
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:17,233
Damn! What do we do?
I got pissed and now
we've gotta fight!

87
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:22,299
Everything will be fine.
For starters, I want you
to use this scroll Guy
Sensei gave me.

88
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,199
Huh? Oh, okay...

89
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,833
<i>Flying Weapons! Guy</i>
<i>Sensei's Unwashed</i>
<i>Tights!</i>

90
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,533
Ew, that's so gross!

91
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,799
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!

92
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,466
Oh, no! They're
coming back!

93
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:35,333
[screaming]

94
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,533
[groaning]

95
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:41,666
The stink's been completely
blown off! Now I can wear
these again!

96
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,266
No! Wash them first!

97
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,666
I don't think we've
ever actually interacted
before.

98
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,233
Then allow me to
introduce myself.

99
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,199
I am Kankuro.

100
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:54,833
<i>I wear black. And you're</i>
<i>the Byakugan master Neji.</i>

101
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:56,566
<i>Black versus White!</i>

102
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,166
Can your white eyes
best my secret black
techniques?!

103
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:03,733
He uses chakra threads
to perform his puppet
techniques.

104
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:06,766
But something's off.
I'm getting a strange
vibe here...

105
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,366
<i>I can't put my</i>
<i>finger on it.</i>

106
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,199
What the heck are
you trying to pull,
Lee?!

107
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,733
Only a puppet master
can fight another
puppet master!

108
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,233
These are just ordinary
threads- Ow! Ow! Ow!

109
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:20,199
You idiots! I'll show
you what a real puppet
master can-

110
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,266
What the-?

111
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:22,633
Go for it, Tenten!

112
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,499
<i>Flying Weapons,</i>
<i>Pilfered Puppets!</i>

113
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,199
She stole them
from me!

114
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,899
I can't risk attacking
Kankuro's puppets.

115
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,733
All right! I hit her!

116
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:33,399
Huh?!

117
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,166
What's happening?!

118
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,833
Uh, I have no idea how
this happened, but the
puppets have turned her

119
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,599
into some kind of
female android!

120
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,233
Oh well, guess I'll
just have to fight
like this.

121
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:44,499
Hey! Stop acting
so giddy about it!

122
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,866
I'll join in!

123
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,299
You stay out of this,
Sensei! And why do you
have to be naked?!

124
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:50,799
We are not through yet!

125
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,733
We're not?!
What's next then?!

126
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:56,866
<i>Flying Weapons! Are</i>
<i>Not These Two Together</i>
<i>A Lot?!</i>

127
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:58,299
You've got to
be kidding me!

128
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,233
Time to spill the beans!
What exactly is going on
with you and Shikamaru?!

129
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,699
We want the
truth! Now!

130
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,899
Leave me alone!

131
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:10,499
<i>And these are obviously</i>
<i>fakes! Is that my ghosts?</i>
<i>Come on! This one isn't</i>
<i>even possible!</i>

132
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,466
You're in the
springtime of
youth!

133
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,333
I'll save you, Temari!

134
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,299
Kankuro...

135
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,933
Secret Black Technique:
My Makeup Mugshots!

136
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:19,199
Do something else!

137
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,433
I don't think so.

138
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,733
Eight Trigrams!
Hyuga Family Album!

139
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,733
No more pictures!
Please!

140
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,466

[sigh]

143
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,799
Keeping up with
these shenanigans
is exhausting.

144
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,333
I've had enough!

145
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:36,499
<i>Now...</i>

Slice!

150
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,833
After that is
the tofu.

151
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:46,399
Slice.

152
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,499
Stop! Now!

153
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,233

00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,766
If those attacks collide,
we'll be blasted to kingdom
come! Everyone protect
yourselves!

156
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,399
What are you doing?

157
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,833
Barrier on!

158
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,366
Are you a child?!

159
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:06,766
Barrier on!

160
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,599
[screaming]

161
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,299
Hold strong for
me, Barrier!

162
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,633
As if that could
work! What morons.

163
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:21,266
<i>Oh, no! Lee and Guy</i>
<i>Sensei are going to</i>
<i>get hurt. I'll have</i>
<i>to cancel my attack.</i>

164
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,199
[groaning]

165
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:31,466
That was the most
pointless exercise
ever!

166
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,366
[groaning]

167
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:38,866
Crap!

168
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,966
Looks to me like you're
out of scrolls and you're
out of moves, as well.

169
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,499
Guess that means
I win again.

170
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:46,266
Hm?!

171
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,799
[gasps]

172
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,066
Now then. This
might work.

173
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,466
Wow! That move
is so awesome!

174
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:55,133
Let's take a little
bit more off here.

175
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,233
Try this way instead!

176
00:09:57,266 --> 00:10:02,066
There is nothing to worry
about. I know your efforts
better than anyone. You have
worked hard on your specialty.

177
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:02,899
[gasp]

178
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:07,233
That's right. I've
worked so hard this
whole time.

179
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:11,233
I'm not that weak
little girl anymore.
I'm strong!

180
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,166
[gasp]

181
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,333
She turned her shirt
into a summoning scroll?!

182
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:18,799
Now is your chance!
Use the new attack
I devised!

183
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,566
<i>Flying Weapons:</i>
<i>Boob Hammer!</i>

184
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:24,333
What did you
do to me?!

185
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,233
Did he say "Boob
Hammer"?!

186
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:27,099
The Boob Hammer?!

187
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,033
The Boob Hammer?!

188
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,999
Oh no, not the
Boob Hammer

189
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,033
Yes! The Boob Hammer!

190
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:31,933
The Boob Hamm-

191
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,499
Oh my god!
Stop saying it!

192
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,533
Huh? Oh, yeah!
The scroll!

193
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:38,866
Whoa! What the heck
happened? They've both
been totally ruined!

194
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:41,233
Idiot! Idiot!

195
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,166
Oh, well. I guess we
didn't settle anything.

196
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,066
Wrong.

197
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:50,333
Regardless of what
happened during the team
battle, remember: I lost
to you one-on-one.

198
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,099
Huh?

199
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:55,966
Nice work. You're
a lot more fun than
I thought you'd be.

200
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:56,866
[gasp]

201
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,033
Next time we'll have
a real one-on-one
fight.

202
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,033
[giggle]

203
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:09,999
Rumors of the intense battle
gained momentum and spread
like wildfire throughout
the village.

204
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,333
Hey! Look out, here
comes the Boob Hammer!

205
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:12,799
[laughing]

206
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,399
Hey, Boob Hammer!

207
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,966
All I won was a
terrible nickname!

208
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:32,041
Can you believe it's
December? How time flies!
The Leaf Village is bustling
with shoppers, and a certain

209
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,441
someone wants in
on the action.

210
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:35,841
[laughing]

211
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:41,641
Just you wait, you little
Leaf Village brats. I'll
just lie and wait here
until you're lured in by

212
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:44,408
the incredible deals,
and catch you in my
trap!

213
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,008
Pardon me, but are
you here alone, sir?

214
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,675
Are you hitting on
me? I'm flattered.
I'll think about it,

215
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,808
but let me carry
out my plan first,
okay?

216
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,608
I think you
misunderstand me.

217
00:11:56,408 --> 00:12:00,408
See, we're having a
special family sale. That
means only families and
couples are allowed in

218
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:02,708
today. You'll have to
come back another time.

219
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,608
Huh?!

220
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,508
You're kidding me!

221
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,341
Hey, who's that man?

222
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:14,441
<i>Mommy, who is he?</i>

223
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,675
<i>Don't stare, honey.</i>

224
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,275
Must be here alone,
poor thing...

225
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:24,441
Poor thing...
Poor thing...
Poor thing...
Poor thing...

226
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:26,241
[screaming]

227
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:29,808
Hey, Kabuto...

228
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,008
Tell me, what
is happiness?

229
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,941
Where'd that
come from?

230
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:38,741
I think I may return to
being an ordinary ninja.

231
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:47,975
<i>"Orochimaru's Search</i>
<i>for Love!"</i>

232
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:52,875
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

233
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:53,808
<i>What?!</i>

234
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,041
Oh come on! There's
now way, Lee!

235
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,675
It can happen if you
try hard enough!

236
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,475
It's not a matter of
"trying hard enough."
I'm telling you, it
can't be done!

237
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:02,875
It is totally
possible!

238
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,275
Not in a million
years. No way,
not ever.

239
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:05,775
Huh?

240
00:13:06,508 --> 00:13:08,241
<i>Orochimaru?!</i>

241
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:10,875
What are you doing here?!

242
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:18,641
Oh, it's you three. Well,
I want to go back to being
a normal ninja again.

243
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:19,775
<i>Mmm, bye.</i>

244
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:23,408
Hey! Hold on
a minute!

245
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:25,908
[grunting]

246
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:28,941
You expect us to
believe you? You've
gotta be kidding.

247
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,341
Seriously! I've been
doing a lot of thinking,
and I want to reintegrate
into society!

248
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,941
We're not going
to fall for that!

249
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:34,941
It's true!

250
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,575
Haven't the three of
you ever thought long
and hard about how
you'll end up if you

251
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:40,575
keep following the
path that you're on?

252
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:46,041
Hey, I'm home.

253
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:51,041
[chuckling]

254
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:52,575
So, how are
you feeling?

255
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:54,975
Sorry you had to watch
the house all day alone.

256
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:09,875
His son's already
that big...

257
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:11,741
Those were some
really good times.

258
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:19,475
The whole lot of us just
goofing around, heh. It
seems like it was just
yesterday, doesn't it.

259
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:23,875
[laughing]

260
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:25,908
[deep sigh]

261
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:28,541
What am I doing
with my life?

262
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:33,608
When I think about that
being my future, it
terrifies me! Utterly
terrifies me!

263
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:34,941
[screaming]

264
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:38,341
You're being too
negative and your
not convincing
anyone here!

265
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,341
[crying]

266
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,475
He convinced him!

267
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:41,641
[sobbing]

268
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:44,275
Orochimaru, I commend
you for renouncing your
evil ways!

269
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:46,008
It's splendid,
absolutely splendid!

270
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:50,908
Sensei, have you gone
completely bonkers?!
Did you forget everything
he's done?!

271
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:56,208
The past can't be changed,
but the future is yet to
be written! I say that
youth must be forgiven!

272
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,175
Be forgiven!

273
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,341
What?!

274
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,208
A misguided soul regrets
his past and wants a
new start...

275
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:01,875
[crying]

276
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:03,441
I'll guide you
with passion!

277
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:04,375
[crying]

278
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:07,408
Truly! You are in
the springtime of
youth!

279
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,175
Truly! Springtime
of youth!

280
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,541
But he's not even young!

281
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:13,008
From now on, you
will be our comrade!

282
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,075
Our comrade!

283
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:16,041
<i>He joined our team...</i>

284
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,175
Idiot! Idiot!

285
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:23,008
Right! Another day
of hard work awaits!

286
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,141
You are up first,
old-timer!

287
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,341
Old-timer?

288
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:31,475
Well, the way I see it,
he is part of the team
now. But Mr. Orochimaru
feels too formal to me.

289
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:33,275
So, I decided to
give him a nickname.

290
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,308
I don't think he
needs a nickname.

291
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:37,941
What about Oro?
That has a nice
ring to it.

292
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:40,875
<i>Orochy? O-Man?</i>
<i>The "O"-ster?</i>

293
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:43,575
I, uh, kind of like
O-Man, personally.

294
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,341
<i>It is settled.</i>
<i>Orochy it is!</i>

295
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,108
Are you listening
to him at all, Lee?

296
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:52,375
But first, we must answer
the most important
question. Just what is
a "normal" ninja to you.

297
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:54,108
You're starting
that far back?!

298
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:56,408
Hm... Let's see...

299
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:59,041
<i>I'd say, a steady</i>
<i>income...</i>

300
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,841
<i>Two days off a</i>
<i>week to relax...</i>

301
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:07,275
<i>And a happy family</i>
<i>waiting for me when</i>
<i>I get home. That kind</i>
<i>of ninja.</i>

302
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:10,041
That's not really
how being a ninja
works...

303
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:14,041
Family. I understand.
You need to start
dating!

304
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:15,275
Start dating?

305
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,341
Get real here! Do
you have any idea
what you're saying?!

306
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:22,541
Those who miss their
chance to marry young
can only hope for a
miracle as they dive

307
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:24,208
head first into the
world of dating!

308
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:29,041
It is a brutal form of
training that constantly
puts your life and sanity
on the line!

309
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,108
<i>Dating is not training!</i>

310
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:34,975
To master the art of
dating is to master
being a normal ninja!

311
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:37,241
But we're talking about
Orochimaru here...

312
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:40,908
Ah, that is true.
Between his looks and
his personality...

313
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,675
This may very well
be impossible!

314
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,608
Excuse me, I'm standing
right here, you know!

315
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:50,308
Very well, it is settled.
We will take the necessary
steps to remake Orochy into
the ideal Mr. Right.

316
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:55,541
Back up! People can't
plan out their happiness
through some half-hearted
self-improvement program!

317
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:58,041
You do not understand
how this works, Neji.

318
00:16:58,075 --> 00:16:59,808
Huh?

319
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:02,441
<i>Women think of marriage</i>
<i>as the ultimate life and</i>
<i>relationship goal, even</i>

320
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:04,875
<i>though the real fight</i>
<i>actually starts from</i>
<i>there.</i>

321
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:09,441
To that end, if we can
trick an unfortunate
girl into marrying him,
that will be good enough!

322
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:10,875
Lee, you're awful.

323
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:11,975
Listen up, Orochy!

324
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:12,841
Yes, sir!

325
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:15,975
The very first thing
women look for in a
husband is...

326
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:18,375
This! Stability above
everything else!

327
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:23,108
Yeah, you're right about
that. Financial stability
is very important to
everyone.

328
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:25,341
Wow, Lee, that's a lot
more normal than-

329
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:30,341
Wait! You idiot! That's
not it at all! Giant
feet provide the wrong
kind of stability!

330
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,575
They do? But, look!

331
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:35,075
He stays on his feet,
no matter what life
hits him with.

332
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,875
You're still
not getting it.

333
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,941
The next thing women
look for in a potential
husband is...

334
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,641
This! Fatherliness!

335
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:42,875
Fatherliness?

336
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:45,441
The husband plays an
active role in raising
the children.

337
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:49,408
But the most he can do
about that right now is
just act like he wants
kids, right?

338
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:54,108
No. Even without having
actual children, he can
still demonstrate his
fatherliness.

339
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,975
And how is that?

340
00:17:56,008 --> 00:18:00,208
The proof is in his own
life! Orochy has already
raised a very precious
baby, have you not?

341
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,108
You're talking
about Manda?!

342
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:07,208
Indeed! If women see how
well Orochy has raised
Manda, they are sure to

343
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:09,041
presume he will make
a great father!

344
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:10,541
You really believe that?

345
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:14,575
And finally, the last
thing women want in a
prospective husband is...

346
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:17,441
This! A similar taste
in sense of humor!

347
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:21,075
Now I don't disagree
with you, but isn't
that also the hardest
one?

348
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,041
Quite the opposite!

349
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:25,475
If he has all these,
one is bound to be
similar!

350
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:30,441
"Humor", not "ewer"!
Enough of this! Why don't
you go to a speed dating
party or something?

351
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:33,475
We all know this is
destined to fail. Just
get it over with!

352
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:38,308
Okay, Orochy! This way!
Follow me to the battlefield
of romance!

353
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:40,241
Hm?

354
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:41,875
Coming, Orochy?

355
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,941
I can't seem to move...

356
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,475
<i>Of course you can't.</i>

357
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:53,375
Now remember...

358
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:57,341
Keep in my mind you should
always smile and be polite.
When asking questions,

359
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,341
always ask three for
every one she asks
you.

360
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:04,541
Wow, you're really
convincing. I'm surprised
at how credible you seem,
Lee.

361
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,441
Guy Sensei taught me
everything I know.

362
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:08,608
And just like that,
the credibility is
gone.

363
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:11,441
I got it, thanks!
Wish me luck!

364
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:16,008
Is something wrong?

365
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,208
<i>I can't get inside.</i>

366
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,608
Of course you can't.

367
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,908
<i>Leaf Speed</i>
<i>Dating Party!</i>

368
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:28,975
Where's Orochimaru?
Ah, over there!

369
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,408
[laughing]

370
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:33,175
But everyone around
here calls me Orochy.

371
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,575
<i>Is he pulling it off?</i>

372
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,008
So, uh...
What's with
the shoes?

373
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,975
I'm very stable, see?
Isn't that great? Bad
economy, downsizing,

374
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:44,208
consumption taxes,
I say bring it on!

375
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:48,141
Uh, say, Orochy, what's
that giant thing on your
back?

376
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:52,508
Oh! This is Manda.
I raised him all
by myself!

377
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,575
And, uh, what
about the jars?

378
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:58,608
Huh? Oh, come now!
These are my sense of
humor ewers, silly!

379
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:00,608
Which one of them
would you ladies
like?

380
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:03,975
[laughter]

381
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:06,241
He's crashing and
burning. Hard.

382
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:09,241
How strange, the
plan was perfect.
I do not understand
this!

383
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,275
You're crazy!

384
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:13,608
So, Orochy, what
exactly do you do
for work?

385
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:18,008
Well, actually, until
recently I was the
leader of a certain
organization.

386
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:19,441
What?!

387
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:22,275
Oh, my! Really? Was
it listed on any
exchanges?

388
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,841
Huh?! Well, yes, we
had a symbol and uh...

389
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:27,375
And how many employees
were under you?

390
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:30,175
A lot. Well, I couldn't
say with any certainty.

391
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,408
What kind of company?

392
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:34,241
We'd go in and take
over other villages!

393
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,941
Acquisitions, then!

394
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:38,875
What? The CEO of a
major acquisitions firm?

395
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:41,908
One of the top earners
in the whole village?
Maybe even the country?

396
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,941
A villa in the
southern mountains?!

397
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:46,008
[screaming]

398
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:53,641
Orochy? Are you okay?

399
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:56,241
Forget about this.
Let's find you
someone else.

400
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:59,408
No kidding. It was
just a bad crop this
time around.

401
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:03,575
[laughing]

402
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:08,475
What's wrong with the
women in this village?
All they care about is
money, money, money!

403
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:13,075
They're so shallow! It's
ridiculous! I don't want
any part of it!

404
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:16,441
All I wanted was to
marry and become a
normal ninja.

405
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:22,375
Once I did that, I planned
to gain residency in the
Leaf Village and bring it
down from the inside.

406
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,241
What?!

407
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:27,341
You heard me, it was
all a plot! What did
you expect, huh?!

408
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:31,308
But then, your team
took my plight so
seriously...

409
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,375
You're all so
very kind...

410
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:35,941
Orochimaru...

411
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:42,041
Listen, you three! One
day I will crush the Leaf
beneath my heel! And don't
you forget it!

412
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:43,275
Huh?

413
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:49,208
Regardless of what he
said, I think Orochimaru...

414
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,208
<i>Yeah...</i>

415
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:53,875
Being a normal ninja
is harder than it
sounds.

416
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:55,008
<i>Orochy...</i>

417
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:00,008
<i>Hey, Kabuto...</i>

418
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,175
Tell me, what
is marriage?

419
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,408
Orochy?

420
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:07,141
...Mumbled Orochimaru
