1
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:55,493
<i>Have you ever wanted</i>
<i>something so badly you</i>
<i>were willing to wait in a</i>
<i>long line for it?</i>

2
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,293
<i>A ride at an amusement</i>
<i>park?</i>

3
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,593
<i>A very special purchase?</i>
<i>Or a delicious bowl of</i>
<i>ramen?</i>

4
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:03,593
Finally, morning
training's over.

5
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,493
Now, we can look into
getting some lunch.

6
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,326
Any preference on that,
Lee?

7
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:09,560
Let me see...

8
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:13,560
Yesterday we had pork curry.
The day before that was
ground beef curry.

9
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:17,460
And three days ago
was green curry!

10
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:21,593
That makes the choice
clear: We top things
off by getting the
ultimate curry!

11
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,326
[groaning]

12
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,726
It will be amazing!

13
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,793
What is it with all the
curry this month?! This
crazy curry festival of
yours needs to end!

14
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:33,726
Well, strictly from a
business point of view,
if we keep pushing curry,
a food company might

15
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,293
notice and decide to
sponsor the show--

16
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:37,426
Leave stuff like that up
to the producers!

17
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,760
How about ramen, then? We
haven't had that in a
while.

18
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:46,393
[growling]
Ramen, you say? I'm
sold! Let's head over
to Ichiraku!

19
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:51,493
<i>For those of you who</i>
<i>don't know, Ichiraku is</i>
<i>a famous restaurant in</i>
<i>the Hidden Leaf village,</i>

20
00:02:51,526 --> 00:02:53,826
<i>and Naruto's first</i>
<i>choice for ramen!</i>

21
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,126
<i>Save Ichiraku Ramen!</i>

22
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,526
What?! Ichiraku might go
out of business?!

23
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,860
Yeah, unfortunately.

24
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:14,793
A famous ramen chain from
the Flavor Village called
"Tasty Ramen" just
opened up a store

25
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:19,393
directly across the
street, and it's taking
away all of Ichiraku's
customers.

26
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:21,693
Look there's another
ramen spot over there.

27
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:25,693
But look at the line for
the one behind us. It's
gotta be a much better
place!

28
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:28,560
People see that line,
make assumptions, and hop
right in.

29
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:33,360
It's almost as if just
the act of lining up for
that place itself is
becoming a new trend.

30
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:38,293
Anyway, because of them,
no one's going to
Ichiraku anymore. The old
man and Ayame are really

31
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:41,493
depressed about it. And
I'm getting really
worried about them!

32
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:44,693
People are suckers for
two things: famous names
and long lines.

33
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:48,693
And unfortunately, it's
survival of the fittest
in the business world.
Always has been.

34
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:53,093
But what is happening
here is not fair! It is
one thing if their food
is better, but they are

35
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:55,393
winning due to a catchy
name and fad status!

36
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:56,393
Naruto, listen!

37
00:03:56,426 --> 00:03:57,593
Huh?

38
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:00,660
You can count on the
three of us to help save
Ichiraku!

39
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:04,393
You mean it? Alright,
Bushy-Brow! Let's do
it!

40
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:06,960
I sincerely appreciate
the offer,

41
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:11,160
But making ramen is too
hard for a bunch of
novices to waltz in and
do it right away.

42
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:12,193
[sighing]

43
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:14,260
Your skill lies
in eating ramen, not
cooking it!

44
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,660
Hey!

45
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:18,593
You need not worry. We
have no intention of
changing the flavor.

46
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:19,726
[nodding]

47
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,493
Your ramen has been
beloved by the villagers
here for many years. A
true local favorite.

48
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:31,793
<i>Um, from that montage, it</i>
<i>looks like Naruto's been</i>
<i>the only one eating</i>
<i>anything here...</i>

49
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:36,193
Listen: if you simply
alter your business
strategy a bit, I
guarantee you can bring

50
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:38,293
in customers and beat
Tasty Ramen!

51
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:40,093
Come on, pops! What do
you say?

52
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:45,860
All right. I can't turn
away enthusiasm such as
this! Let's give it our
best shot!

53
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:47,360
[giggling]

54
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:51,593
The first thing we must
do is learn as much as we
can about our enemy.

55
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,793
Which means it is time
for some recon.

56
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,560
I see, so we find
out about their
recipes.

57
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,426
Don't you dare!

58
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,560
First of all, the enemy
is sure to recognize us.
And secondly, I don't
think my stubborn old dad

59
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,426
is going to line up at a
competitor's store and
eat his food.

60
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,126
Hm.

61
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,093
No way! He's already
there?!

62
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,793
Dad, please! Show a
little pride, will you?
Jeez!

63
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:15,226
Talk to him, Naru--

64
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,926
[gasping]

65
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,526
What the-?! Not you,
too?!

66
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,526
Huh?

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,060
Do not worry yourself,
Tenten.

68
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:24,326
We do not need
Naruto or Mr. Teuchi
to spy on the flavors
of the enemy!

69
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,226
Neji!

70
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,393
That's right!

71
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:30,193
They don't know Neji's
face! He should easily be
able to get a seat and--

72
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:31,360
Byakugan!

73
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,626
[gasping and groaning]

74
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:38,693
That's what you meant
by "spy on the flavor"?!

75
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:42,426
Even if you can see the
dish from here, that
still doesn't mean...

76
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,860
<i>... you can tell</i>
<i>what it tastes like!</i>

77
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:45,026
It's thick.

78
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,526
A very thick
pork-based broth, with
two types of mackerel,

79
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,360
bonito and vegetable
dashi.

80
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:53,760
In spite of its
heaviness, it has a
smooth, mild flavor.

81
00:05:53,793 --> 00:05:57,193
You really can see the
flavor?! That's some
Byakugan.

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,693
Okay then. Now that we
have our information, we
need to formulate a

83
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:05,093
Double Fish Pork
Ramen Counterattack!

84
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:08,393
"Double Fish" what?
Since when are you so
knowledgeable about
ramen?

85
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:09,593
First off...!

86
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,126
...We need to come up
with the right side
dishes!

87
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
Indeed, we do.

88
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:17,593
Dumplings, gyoza, fried
chicken...

89
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:20,160
There are a lot of good
side dishes that go with
ramen!

90
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:24,426
Wow. You know what?
It's true that we work
very hard on our ramen
dishes, but we tend to

91
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,660
neglect the sides. I'd
never thought of that
before.

92
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:28,126
And so!

93
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,326
I came up with a
"barbecue lunch set"
side dish!

94
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,393
Are you crazy?! A lunch
set is way beyond a side
dish! That's a whole meal
in itself!

95
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:35,793
It's a ton of food!

96
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:39,093
And as an additional
measure to counter the
thick broth of our
enemy...

97
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:43,860
[screaming]
What'd you do
to him?!

98
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:46,760
We shall lay the service
on even thicker! Get it?

99
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:48,726
Your head is the only
thick thing around here!

100
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,860
One thing's got absolutely
nothing to do with the other!

101
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:53,826
Whoa! For some reason,
I'm burning with youth!

102
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,826
Especially in the
head area!

103
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,493
That's because that
stupid wig is making
you hot!

104
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:01,260
Don't forget: Our enemy
isn't just laying it on
thick!

105
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:04,260
They manage to keep it
all in check with a
smooth, mild flavor!

106
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,393
I remember. So then...!

107
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:08,593
Here!

108
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:11,526
No!

109
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,993
A Go-Go Girl?!

110
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:17,860
This approach with the
wardrobe allows us to
balance our thicker service
with something smoother!

111
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:20,226
This isn't food service,
it's fan service!

112
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,426
And this isn't smooth,
her outfit shows no
restraint at all!

113
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,260
None shown here. Not
here, either!

114
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,293
There's nothing left to
the imagination!

115
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:28,326
[sighing]

116
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,260
Then I suppose I need to
keep things more in check?

117
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:32,493
Huh?!

118
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:33,193
Here!

119
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:34,726
Is that a school
swimsuit?!

120
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,326
Showing less skin
doesn't fix the
fundamental problem!
This changes nothing!

121
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,460
It doesn't matter what
kind of service we're
offering,

122
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,626
it won't make any
difference if we don't
have any customers!

123
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,226
That is true.

124
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,693
Here's an idea: why
don't we use ringers?

125
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:50,560
<i>Think about it: just</i>
<i>seeing the line seems to</i>
<i>draw people to the other</i>
<i>ramen house.</i>

126
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:54,526
That's true. There's some
psychology to making people
want to stand in line.

127
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,660
Ringers might be
the ticket.

128
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:59,593
I like this plan! We
should give it a try!

129
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,726
Here is our ringer:
Sakura!

130
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,826
We need more than just
her!

131
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,560
What's going on here?

132
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:11,260
Er, I'm sorry, Sakura.
Look. No one's gonna get
in our line just because
she's in it!

133
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:12,460
Not true! We did!

134
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,360
She only works on you
two!

135
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,160
Hey, look! A line!
Let's get in it!

136
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:17,826
Get back in the kitchen,
dammit!

137
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,226
If you're here, who's
gonna make the food?

138
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,726
Just leave the cooking to
me!

139
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,626
No! You leave it to the
professionals!

140
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,026
That hurts.

141
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,493
Now that we are set, we
simply wait for the
customers to roll in.

142
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:28,726
Yeah!

143
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,326
[sighing]

144
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,293
<i>But even after all that,</i>
<i>no customers came back to</i>
<i>Ichiraku.</i>

145
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:35,793
Aw, man. Why did it not
work?

146
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:39,193
Despite our planning, I
think our business plan
got off on the wrong
track.

147
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:41,760
"Got off on the wrong
track"? I'd say it
went straight off the

148
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:44,226
rails and flew off into
space! It was a disaster!

149
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm sorry about all this,
kids...

150
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,726
You tried so very hard to
help me out.

151
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,426
Ugh. Pops...

152
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,126
I've got a lot of
confidence in my cooking
and my dishes. I'm just
disappointed I'm not

153
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,826
getting a chance to
compete on flavor.

154
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,693
All those customers are
lining up because of the
name of the place, or
the line itself.

155
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:04,693
I wish we could show them
how good our food is
without having to try it.

156
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:07,293
"Without having to try
it", you say...

157
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:09,693
We totally can! There is
a way to do just that!

158
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:12,493
Oh, yeah? How exactly
do we pull that off,
Bushy-Brow?

159
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:14,793
Just leave everything to
me!

160
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:19,226
Hello! We are here today,
on location, to find the
best ramen in the Leaf
Village!

161
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,660
And joining us on this
culinary quest is one of
the most well respected
gourmands in the village,

162
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,226
Choji Akimichi!

163
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,426
Thank you. Glad to be
here.

164
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,593
<i>I'm gonna stuff myself</i>
<i>silly!</i>

165
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:31,526
What's going on here?
What's the plan?

166
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,526
The only way to convince
people of a restaurant's
quality is a positive
review from a famous food

167
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,660
critic. And if such a
critic were to sing its
praises in front of that
line...

168
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:41,860
Hey, that ramen place
over there looks pretty
good!

169
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,626
I think I'll
give it a shot!

170
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,793
Me, too!

171
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,393
<i>Bam!</i>

172
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:50,393
We will have an even
bigger line than the one
over there.

173
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,226
I get it, but why Choji?

174
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,260
That is the ingenious
part of the plan! Choji
even looks like he could
be a famous chef!

175
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:58,693
Food always look yummier
when a fat person is
enjoying it!

176
00:09:58,726 --> 00:09:59,760
<i>I am not fat!</i>

177
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:00,660
[gasping]

178
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,660
I'm just big-boned!

179
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:05,660
<i>Okay, everyone! Time to</i>
<i>dig in!</i>

180
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:08,226
Right! Bon appetite!

181
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:10,660
Goodness! This is
delicious!

182
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,460
What do you think, Mr.
Nejiyama?

183
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:13,860
What? Me?! I--?!

184
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,226
Why'd you put
him on the spot?

185
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,626
Well, it's, um I'd
say it's--

186
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,726
It's Eight Trigrams and
Sixty-Four Palms of
deliciousness!

187
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,393
That made no sense at
all!

188
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:29,260
It was the best I could
do, okay? Man, being a
food critic is so
complex...

189
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:32,193
You're over thinking
this. Get over yourself,
already!

190
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,593
What are they doing over
there?

191
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:35,460
I don't know and I
don't get it.

192
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:38,426
This is bad, Lee. They're
getting turned off by all
the confusion!

193
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,760
<i>This is great! Another</i>
<i>round, please!</i>

194
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,493
Nice going, Choji!

195
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:47,293
If he eats a few more
bowls, we can easily
convince people the ramen
here is that good!

196
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:51,193
Man, this barbecue lunch
set is outta this world!

197
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:52,760
No! No! You gotta
eat the ramen!

198
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:55,660
How could my brilliant
side dish backfire like
that?

199
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,726
Lee, you are the biggest
idiot on the entire
planet! How could you be
so stupid?!

200
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,393
We worked so hard and you
ruined it! You ruined it!

201
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:02,726
<i>Don't worry!</i>
<i>I've got this!</i>

202
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,393
Neji! Please, turn this
around for us!

203
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,626
The flavor is
Byakugan-tastic!

204
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,993
That is the
opposite of helping.

205
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:12,326
Wait! All I'm trying to
say is that the flavor is
bright and clear!

206
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,126
No, there's nothing but a
black void awaiting us
now.

207
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,226
Choji! Hold on, please!
Try some ramen instead!

208
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,726
Hang on, I haven't
finished what I
already--

209
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,493
Eat it and tell us what
you think!

210
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:26,126
Back off! Let me finish
my beef first!

211
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:27,460
[gasping]

212
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:28,726
No! The ramen!

213
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,460
[screaming]

214
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:33,060
Sakura! Watch out!

215
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,593
Should've known!

216
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:38,226
Time for Leaf Hurricane!

217
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:42,260
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

218
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,593
Hey, wait a minute! This
stuff is really tasty!

219
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,493
I like what I've tasted
so far! I'm gonna check
that place out!

220
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:50,126
Oh, yeah!

221
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,793
Huh?

222
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:54,726
[clamoring]

223
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,560
Gimme ramen!

224
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:58,193
I want some ramen!

225
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,626
Dad, it worked!

226
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,860
Hey, Naruto! Lee!
Thanks so much!

227
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:07,626
[laughing]

228
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,493
<i>Thus, Ichiraku escaped</i>
<i>bankruptcy.</i>

229
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:16,760
<i>But the sudden upswing in</i>
<i>customers was not without</i>
<i>its consequences. It left</i>
<i>Lee and the others with</i>

230
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:19,460
<i>empty bowls and empty</i>
<i>stomachs.</i>

231
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:22,226
I want my ramen!

232
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:36,906
<i>As our story opens, Lee</i>
<i>and his team are just</i>
<i>coming back from a</i>
<i>mission.</i>

233
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,306
Thank goodness. We're
finally home.

234
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,206
"Thank goodness" is
right! That mission was
brutal. I need to get
home and take a break.

235
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:47,173
You are in need of a
break, you say? Okay!

236
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:50,573
All right, I will squeeze
100 apples and make us
the most refreshing juice

237
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:52,239
you have ever tasted in
your life!

238
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:56,339
That's no break at all.
You're just painting
yourself right back
into a corner.

239
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:59,839
I continue to train my
body, even when I am
resting.

240
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:01,739
Suddenly, I am burning
with passion!

241
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:06,773
You don't have to burn up
to make juice! Can't you
regulate your temperature
any better than that?

242
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:11,073
[sighing]

243
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:19,873
<i>Vacations are for</i>
<i>Training!</i>

244
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,806
Bushy-Brow refuses to
rest?

245
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,106
Yes, exactly.

246
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,839
Ever since fall began,
it's been one event after
another.

247
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:31,439
And he makes a big
production out of
all of them!

248
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,039
On top of that, Guy
Sensei always makes him
do these bizarre,

249
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:38,539
weird exercises with
him on our days off!

250
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:42,839
<i>Yeah, that's bizarre and</i>
<i>weird all right. What are</i>
<i>they doing?</i>

251
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:45,239
I'm worried about what
this is doing to his
health.

252
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:48,173
As am I. There is such a
thing as over training,
you know.

253
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:50,339
If he hurts himself,
it'll all be for naught.

254
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:52,006
Hmm...

255
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,006
Well, I completely
understand what you're
saying. But if this is
what Bushy-Brow wants,

256
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,339
why not leave him be?

257
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:58,573
See ya!

258
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,039
[sighing]

259
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,106
<i>Later, that evening...</i>

260
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,339
Thanks for the meal!

261
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:06,839
So, Lee! Exhausted from
another day of training?

262
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:09,206
Now's the time to fill up
on your favorite food,
and take a nice long
rest.

263
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:13,006
[groaning]

264
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,739
I cannot eat another
bite.

265
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:18,873
You didn't eat a thing.
Although I've never heard
anyone say that in their
sleep before.

266
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:21,439
He really does need to
get a proper break, and
soon.

267
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:23,406
Hmm.

268
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,006
[snoring]

269
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:27,973
Hmmm...

270
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,973
Agreed. That is cause for
concern.

271
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,039
You think so, too, Lady
Tsunade?

272
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:35,506
Even if you're fit,
overtraining will have
the opposite effect.

273
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:36,706
[struggling]

274
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,906
Additionally, as a
teenager, Lee's body is
still growing.

275
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:43,373
<i>Wait, why are just his</i>
<i>eyebrows still growing?</i>
<i>That seems kinda weird.</i>

276
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:48,006
In order to grow in a
healthy way, the body
needs plenty of rest.

277
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,373
What's going on here?
This is definitely not
balanced, it's nothing
but hair!

278
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:53,873
Look how I've grown!

279
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,639
It's not even him
anymore!

280
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:59,339
We agree, of course. But
even when we tell him to
rest, he ignores us and
keeps going.

281
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:02,806
We need a way to force
him to take sit back and
take it easy.

282
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:04,906
Huh?

283
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:06,873
Of course!

284
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,039
The answer is Labor Day!

285
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:11,106
Labor Day? How so?

286
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:17,973
Labor Day was originally
created for laborers and
tradesmen to celebrate
their contributions, and

287
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:20,439
offer mutual gratitude to
one another for all their
efforts.

288
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:23,373
<i>Somehow watching this</i>
<i>doesn't make me feel</i>
<i>grateful at all.</i>

289
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:26,806
In fact, I don't even
want to watch this!
It's too much for
me to handle!

290
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,073
This year, I'll add
another facet to the
holiday...

291
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:32,273
... I'll order everyone
in the village to rest
and take it easy.

292
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,939
If it's a rule, Lee will
have no choice but to
comply!

293
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:37,139
Lady Tsunade...

294
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:38,339
Thank you! Thanks so
much!

295
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:39,473
[giggling]

296
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,839
<i>And so, Labor Day came.</i>

297
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,239
This year, the Hokage has
declared that everyone in
the village has to take
the day off and rest.

298
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:50,806
So make sure you actually
take it easy today. Okay,
Lee?

299
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:53,306
Understood. shall take
the day off, as ordered.

300
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,539
I think it's
working!

301
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:57,506
He's finally learning the
importance of rest and
relaxation.

302
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:03,373
Well, since I have the
entire day off now, I am
free to train to my
heart's content!

303
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:06,573
That dummy hasn't learned
anything!

304
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:09,873
Lee, these are Lady
Tsunade's orders! You've
gotta obey them!

305
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:13,939
Look at it this way: try
to think of resting as
today's mission. Got it?!

306
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,306
Yeah, I got it... Orders
are orders.

307
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:17,239
[yelling]

308
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:19,473
<i>We demand the right to</i>
<i>train!</i>

309
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:24,039
The Hokage is taking away
our human rights to train
as we wish! She must go!

310
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:26,339
Enough already!

311
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:27,806
[grunting]

312
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:29,706
You just don't
get it, do you?

313
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,539
It looks like he needs a
lecture directly from
Lady Tsunade herself.

314
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:40,939
Why did you follow me
here? Don't you get it?
I told you all to take
the day off!

315
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,173
Her head is totally in
vacation mode.

316
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:46,339
Yes, but I do not
understand what the
problem is, Lady Tsunade.

317
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:49,506
For starters, this hand
doesn't feel right.

318
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:51,806
<i>She's completely focused</i>
<i>on the game.</i>

319
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,173
"This hand"? You are
saying I just need to
rest my hands?

320
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:57,873
You mean fold? You don't
know anything, do you?

321
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:00,239
<i>Wait, maybe she'll</i>
<i>explain things to him</i>
<i>after all.</i>

322
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:05,273
This is no time to lie
down and quit! The real
fight starts now!

323
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:06,906
<i>She's even more</i>
<i>oblivious than Lee!</i>

324
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:11,373
Now I am even more
confused than before.
What will happen if I
don't rest?

325
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:17,406
"Get too full of yourself
and treat your underlings
to lunch! You lose your
bonus!"

326
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,206
You shouldn't even have
to ask... You grow weak.

327
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:24,273
<i>Speaking of which, it</i>
<i>seems Lady Tsunade's mind</i>
<i>is growing weak...</i>

328
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:26,873
She won't be able to
convince Lee in her
current state...

329
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:30,539
Did you say "weak"?
You feel I am growing
weak? No!

330
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:32,106
<i>I didn't expect that!</i>

331
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:33,406
Maybe now Lee will...

332
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:38,173
When you are this beat
up, you must put all
things aside and rest.

333
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,873
<i>Yes! It's working!</i>

334
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:46,173
I will not allow my body
to grow weak.

335
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:51,306
I have to train harder
than ever before! Time to
work!

336
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,173
That's the complete
opposite effect!

337
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:57,173
And now he's run off...

338
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:59,273
Would you please help us
stop him, Naruto?

339
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:02,473
I told you, I think you
should just let him do as
he pleases!

340
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:04,373
If you help us, we'll buy
you all the ramen you
want!

341
00:18:04,406 --> 00:18:06,173
Yeah! Sure thing! Count
me in!

342
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:07,873
Where'd you come from?!

343
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:11,939
No fair, Choji! They
asked me first! I'm in,
too! That ramen is mine,
you hear me?!

344
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:13,506
No way! You snooze,
you lose!

345
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:17,039
Those fifty bowls
of ramen and ten barbecue
meals have my name all
over them!

346
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:19,073
You're adding things! I
never said that!

347
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:23,073
[giggling]

348
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:25,573
I'll use my jutsu to
transform into Sakura.

349
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:28,139
Then, I'll invite
Bushy-Brow out to lunch.
After that...

350
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:32,006
I am so elated you want
to have lunch with me,
Sakura! Of course I
will join you!

351
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,039
I will stop
training right away!

352
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:35,539
It's foolproof!
I'm a genius!

353
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:39,973
Nice! Simple, but
practically guaranteed to
work! Great idea, Naruto!

354
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:45,406
Give Lee, Give Lee, leap
into the fray, forget
common sense, throw it
all away!

355
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,839
Hey, Sakura!

356
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:50,406
Bushy-Brow! What do you
say we grab some ramen
together, you know?

357
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,506
Hi, Naruto.

358
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,373
What? How'd you know?

359
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:56,506
Naruto, you dimwit...

360
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,006
Alright. Now it's my
turn.

361
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,139
I'll lure him in with
some BBQ-ed goodness.

362
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:08,139
Hey, Lee! Wanna grab some
lunch with me? I've got
some coupons.

363
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:10,039
We can eat 'til
we're completely
stuffed!

364
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:13,073
Wow! Thank you so much! I
was just starting to get
hungry!

365
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,806
[eating]

366
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,506
[slurping]

367
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:21,506
[eating]

368
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:24,206
Whew, I'm full!
Couldn't eat another
bite!

369
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:28,539
Thank you for inviting
me, Choji! Now I am all
fueled up for my
afternoon training!

370
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:30,239
No problem! Good luck
with all that!

371
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:32,439
You just wanted to
eat a big lunch,
didn't you?

372
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:34,839
Now he's more
motivated than before.

373
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:35,839
Oh, sorry about that.

374
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:38,039
I've had it!
I give up!

375
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:41,139
You'd think all of
Bushy-Brow's skits
would have you exhausted.

376
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:43,206
Why are you still at
it on your day off?!

377
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:46,506
Wait a sec, the skits? Of
course!

378
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:47,739
What do you mean, Tenten?

379
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:51,239
Those stupid skits Lee's
always making us do!
Think about it!

380
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,006
We can use a skit to
teach him the importance
of proper rest!

381
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,339
One of those skits,
huh? I'm not too thrilled
about it, but it may be
our only shot!

382
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,273
Naruto, Choji, will you
two help us out?

383
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:01,273
Well, if you insist.

384
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:03,573
If at first you don't
succeed, fry, fry again.

385
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:05,206
Try, not fry.

386
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,906
<i>Say it ain't</i>
<i>so, Doctor!</i>

387
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:08,539
Hm?

388
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:11,473
You're saying my dad
is going to--

389
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:15,506
Yes... He's got about a
week at the most.

390
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,373
Oh, no...

391
00:20:19,573 --> 00:20:22,273
Daddy, make sure you rest
up, okay?

392
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,873
Hey, sis, when is Lee
coming home? He should be
here.

393
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:29,173
It shouldn't be long.
I've got an old friend
out looking for him right
now.

394
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:31,973
Tenko, are you--are you
going to call him?

395
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:34,173
Well, I was planning on
it, yes...

396
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:38,039
[coughing]

397
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:41,573
That boy abandoned our
family to run off and
chase his foolish
dreams...

398
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:46,039
Don't you dare call
him, you got that?! I
won't speak to him even
if he does show up.

399
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:47,373
[coughing]

400
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,439
We lost Mom when she was
very young.

401
00:20:51,473 --> 00:20:55,539
That left Daddy the
responsibility of raising
all three of us by
himself.

402
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:57,106
Thanks to Daddy's
efforts,

403
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:02,006
my big brother
Lee was able to pursue
his lifelong dream of
becoming an actor...

404
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,406
... but daddy never
forgave him for leaving
us.

405
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:10,073
Even though he talks
tough, I'm sure that
Daddy secretly longs to
see his boy Lee again.

406
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,306
Lee. I beg you. Come
back...

407
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:23,873
Please! It's been ten
long years...
[crying]

408
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:25,439
Oh, sis...

409
00:21:25,473 --> 00:21:26,839
Great job, Tenten!

410
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:29,306
There's no way
Bushy-Brow won't
be moved!

411
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:33,573
[crying]
Fine! I will stop
training!

412
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,539
He'll be bawling
like a baby!

413
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:38,239
And he'll finally give
his body the rest that
it needs.

414
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:41,239
This will actually
help us get through
to him!

415
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:42,206
Huh?

416
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:45,173
What are all
of you doing?

417
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:48,073
We finally get the day
off, and you are
performing skits?

418
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,473
Huh?!

419
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:52,773
Anyway, I must go work
out now. Bye!

420
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:55,106
What?!

421
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:59,439
<i>Don't stop the Lee!</i>
<i>Today, Tenten and the</i>
<i>gang learned a hard lesson:</i>

422
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:03,039
<i>That no skit can convince</i>
<i>Lee to stop training.</i>

423
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,206
<i>But make sure you all get</i>
<i>plenty of rest, kids!</i>

424
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,939
<i>Lee, you butthead!</i>

425
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:50,466
Next time is "Caring for
Animals is Hard Work,"
and "Howl at the Naruto."

426
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:53,033
Okay then, I will put my
heart into it and howl
out!

427
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,233
[howling]

428
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,566
<i>Lee, I don't think it's</i>
<i>supposed to be literal.</i>

429
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,233
[howling]

430
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:01,199
<i>Whoa, what's that? I</i>
<i>think the Nine-Tails is</i>
<i>reacting inside me!</i>

431
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,766
<i>[howling]</i>

432
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,166
<i>Stop howling at each</i>
<i>other, you morons! And</i>
<i>the Nine-Tails isn't a</i>
<i>dog, so cut it out!</i>

433
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:11,499
[howling]
