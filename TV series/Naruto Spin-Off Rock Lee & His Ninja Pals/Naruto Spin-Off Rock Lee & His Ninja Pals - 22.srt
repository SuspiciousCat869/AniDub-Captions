<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>And another fun</i>
<i>summer comes to</i>
<i>a close...</i>

2
00:01:55,502 --> 00:02:00,468
[sigh] The end of
Summer every year
is always so bitter
sweet...

3
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:03,535
...like going
from high noon
to sunset...

4
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:06,602
Somehow that makes
a lot of sense, and
yet, none at all.

5
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:12,568
At least we've taken care of our
responsibilities, so we're free
to just kick back and enjoy
these last few days of August.

6
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:15,735
You're right! All of
our summer homework
is already finished!

7
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,535
What summer homework?!

8
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:19,868
You know, that report
we were supposed to do.

9
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:22,602
You were right there when
Guy Sensei assigned it.

10
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:27,735
I want everyone to
write about the
missions they'll carry
out this summer...

11
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:31,668
You're all responsible
for your own work, there
will be no collaborations!

12
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:35,435
One more thing...
Even though I call it
a report, it's more
like summer homework.

13
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:39,102
Think of it as a
return to the heyday
of your youth!

14
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:42,735
Heyday Shmayday! I
have nothing against
doing the report, but

15
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:45,635
honestly you look like
an old dusty relic of
the past in that get-up!

16
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:48,102
You got your report
done, didn't you, Lee?

17
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:51,802
[screaming]

18
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:54,568
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>I totally forgot</i>
<i>about that assignment!</i>

19
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:04,835
"Always Do Your Homework
at the Last Minute!"

20
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:09,135
What have you been
doing!? All this time
and you didn't even
start the assignment!?

21
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:11,002
It has to be
turned in tomorrow!

22
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:15,468
What can I even
do at this point!?

23
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:18,502
This is unfortunate.
He's paralyzed with
indecision.

24
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:22,168
Yeah. I don't remember
the process being that
difficult...

25
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:27,135
You see... the trouble
is I cannot remember what
I did back on July 21st.

26
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:29,535
You mean you're
stuck on the
very first day!?

27
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:32,535
(Naruto)
It's all a blank...
I just can't remember!

28
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:33,935
Huh?

29
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:37,102
What in the world did
I do on July 21st!?
It's like a lifetime
ago!!!

30
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,168
Another genius.
What a pair.

31
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,935
Oh! Sakura!

32
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:43,135
Oh boy! Am I glad
I ran into you!

33
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,935
Would you by chance
want to go to the
amusement park with me?

34
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:49,035
Wait a minute! That
is totally not fair,
Bushy Brow!

35
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:52,068
I'm not letting you
have all the fun before
the summer ends!

36
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:54,202
What in the world are
you talking about!?

37
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,768
You both need to do
your homework before
the summer ends!

38
00:03:56,802 --> 00:04:00,768
Tenten's right! You both
have to complete your
homework assignments first!

39
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:03,835
There will be plenty
of time to relax after
you finish them up.

40
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,629
[groaning]

41
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:10,602
(Lee)
July 21st. Sakura
and I went on a date
at an expensive resort.

42
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:15,902
<i>(Naruto)</i>
July 21st. Sakura and I ate big
bowls of ramen at a place by the
<i>Shinobi Sea.</i>

43
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:19,635
Don't make stuff up
because you want to
get the assignment
done quickly!

44
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:24,035
Come on! Seriously,
you guys, we all did
so many things together
over the summer.

45
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:26,635
I can't believe
you could possibly
have forgotten it all!

46
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:28,835
I, for one, do
not dwell on
the past!

47
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,068
No excuses, wise-guy!

48
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:34,502
This is a terrible
mess! We are not
making any progress!

49
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,702
My summer and my
homework are both
going up in smoke!

50
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,602
If only I could
get help from
someone!

51
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:44,502
Both of you guys are
completely shameless.

52
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,902
Guy Sensei said we
needed to do this
assignment ourselves,
though.

53
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,035
Yeah, but how will
he ever find out?

54
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:53,635
Fine. This one time,
we'll all lend you a
hand.

55
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,435
[grateful sobs]

56
00:04:56,468 --> 00:05:01,635
What do you say we hold off on
the journals for now, and do
the easier assignments first,
alright?

57
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,502
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>We'll start with a</i>
<i>math problem.</i>

58
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:08,835
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>There are five ninjas.</i>
<i>Each ninja can use three</i>
<i>different jutsu.</i>

59
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:13,702
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Therefore, by multiplying,</i>
<i>how many types of ninjutsu</i>
<i>are there in total?</i>

60
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:16,868
That's simple math and
should be fairly easy!

61
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:19,068
It does not sound
easy to me!

62
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,635
My brain doesn't
do well with
advanced numbers!

63
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:24,568
Okay guys, but these
numbers aren't all
that advanced!

64
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:28,002
If we cannot do it
mentally, we will
have to work it out
in real life!

65
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:33,168
So, there are five
ninjas... And each
one of these ninjas
can use 3 jutsu...

66
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:37,735
Please, everyone. Could you
do your specialty moves?

67
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:38,935
If you insist...

68
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:47,435
So! Have you
got it now?

69
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:50,068
Nope. Still no clue.

70
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:52,535
It's not that hard.
It's just 5 times 3.

71
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:55,835
300? No, wait...
330..?!

72
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:57,868
How in the world
did you get that!?

73
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:02,468
Easy! With all those
shadow clones the
numbers got really
big really quickly!

74
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:05,702
What!? You're not
supposed to count
Naruto's clones!!

75
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:09,202
The next assignment
is the book reports.

76
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:12,068
Very good. I
presume you are
all ready.

77
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:15,335
I admit, I'm a
little lost here.

78
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:18,802
Shouldn't the person
who's writing the report
report be the one who's
reading the book??

79
00:06:18,835 --> 00:06:21,668
Tell me, what was your
favorite part of the book?

80
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:24,002
Well, actually, I
haven't finished
reading it yet.

81
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:27,568
This is not a book
report, for heaven's
sake! It's an interview!

82
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:31,002
Hey! I've got a great
idea! Why don't we
split up the work!?

83
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:33,902
You'll have
the next page...

84
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,035
I'll take page 3!

85
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:35,902
And I've got 5!

86
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:38,602
You can't even
read a book by
yourself?!

87
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:41,168
What did you like
about the book in
particular?

88
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:42,902
Page one was
really funny!

89
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,602
That's true, but
page 3 was kinda
scary!

90
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:47,802
And page 5 got me
a little choked up!

91
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:52,868
Now you're reviewing
individual pages?!
This whole thing is
driving me crazy!

92
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:56,002
[clones talking]

93
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:58,035
One at a time,
please, guys!

94
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:01,435
Quiet everyone! I
cannot understand
a thing you are
saying!!!

95
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:04,668
This is ridiculous!
Just read the book
yourself!

96
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:07,502
Next up is
independent
research...

97
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:11,535
The assignment is
to think of a new
jutsu inspired by
the summer season.

98
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:16,435
Lee, I think you should
focus on a combat suit,
since Taijutsu is your
specialty.

99
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,902
Yes! An excellent idea!
Glad you thought of it!

100
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:20,868
I have got
this one!

101
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,835
Nejisuke!

102
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:30,135
About time, Leeko.
What took you so long?

103
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:33,602
Sorry about that!
The line just went
on forever!

104
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:36,668
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>Nejisuke and I have</i>
<i>been close for years</i>

105
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:39,668
<i>I was able to spend</i>
<i>the whole summer</i>
<i>hanging out with him!</i>

106
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:46,535
<i>He is a boy and a</i>
<i>friend, but not a</i>
<i>boyfriend.</i>

107
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:49,635
<i>And I do not wanna</i>
<i>risk our friendship by</i>
<i>taking it any further...</i>

108
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:54,035
Nejisuke...
Want to swim?

109
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:55,402
Huh?

110
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,468
[gasp]

111
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:07,868
Hm!

112
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:25,035
What the heck's
going on!?!?

113
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:29,635
Why? Why do I always
get roped into these
things and end up
looking like an idiot!?

114
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:33,768
What the heck was
that about!? It made
absolutely no sense
at all!

115
00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:39,702
When a female friend changes
into her swimsuit, it makes
her male friends excited to
see her in a new way!

116
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:41,502
It's a romantic Jutsu!

117
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:43,102
You did not get that?

118
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:47,102
Of course I didn't! I
don't even know how
your brain comes up
with these things!

119
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:51,868
It is pretty basic!
Simply thing of a
new jutsu inspired by
the summer season!

120
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:55,668
Oh, come on! You're
just making an excuse
to stare at women in
swimsuits!

121
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,102
Well I get it,
Bushy Brow! Let
me try it one time!

122
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:05,468
When a male friend
suddenly turns into
a woman, it's going
to make his --oof!

123
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:09,535
It makes them
very exasperated...

124
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:12,535
...with your
incompetence
that is...

125
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:17,835
We felt bad, so we tried
to help. But if you're not
going to take this
seriously, we're done.

126
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:19,968
Let's go, guys.
We've got other
things to do.

127
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:22,402
Looks like we're
gonna be on our
own now.

128
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:31,735
Apparently they don't
intend to give up on
their scheme...

129
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:33,302
Well, that's
no surprise.

130
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:39,135
So stupid. Apparently
you forgot all the
things we did over
the summer, Lee...

131
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:41,868
You'll never finish
that journal on time.

132
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:51,702
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Everyone's homework</i>
<i>is due toady!</i>

133
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:55,968
I want to announce,
we've gone over
everybody's papers.

134
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:57,702
Excellent work, folks!

135
00:09:57,735 --> 00:10:00,102
Huh? Including
Lee and Naruto's?

136
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,102
All the journals
were outstanding!

137
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,068
Especially Lee
and Naruto's!

138
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:08,102
Wonderful stuff,
guys...

139
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:13,468
You really conveyed how
precious the experiences and
memories are to you that you
shared with your friends.

140
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:15,435
How'd you pull
that off, Lee?

141
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:18,668
Last time we talked,
I thought you'd
forgotten everything.

142
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:25,535
When I came up with that
independent research jutsu,
it reminded my of all the
stuff we had done together.

143
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:29,468
Tenten, you and Neji
were with me the whole
time!

144
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:32,635
All that was left was
for me to write it down.

145
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:34,402
Lee...

146
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,802
I faced the same
challenge...

147
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:43,002
Actually, I'd like to
read the entry that
Guy Sensei and I were
most moved by.

148
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,468
Oh, please, sit.
It is too embarrassing!

149
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:47,702
<i>(Kakashi)</i>
<i>"The date is August</i>
<i>31st..."</i>

150
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:52,502
<i>"Today, Tenten, Neji,</i>
<i>and Sakura helped me</i>
<i>with all the homework I</i>
<i>had not yet completed."</i>

151
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:56,835
<i>"Naruto and I then</i>
<i>managed to get most of</i>
<i>it done without lifting</i>
<i>a finger..."</i>

152
00:10:56,868 --> 00:11:01,502
<i>"They are so helpful</i>
<i>and loyal. I would not</i>
<i>trade my friends for</i>

00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,502

154
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:03,168
[gasp]

155
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:04,102
[gasp]

156
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:05,102
[screaming]

157
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:06,802
We see the truth, now!

158
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:11,435
So as punishment for
helping Lee and Naruto,
you're all going to
continue writing these

159
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:13,902
reports until we
say otherwise!
Got it?!

160
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:16,068
(Tenten)
Lee you stupid idiot!!!!

<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Take a lesson here, kids...</i>

162

<i>Get your summer</i>
<i>assignments done</i>

163

<i>(Narrator)</i>

<i>and Naruto Uzumaki.</i>

165
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:45,841
<i>(Iruka)</i>
<i>All right. Today we're</i>
<i>having a test on the</i>
<i>transformation jutsu.</i>

166
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:48,408
That's no good.
You have to try
harder!

167
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:54,108
You're been in the Academy
for three years now. How
can you still be struggling
with transformation?

168
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:58,574
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>For those who might not be</i>
<i>aware, this is Iruka Umino.</i>

169
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:01,608
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>He's an Academy teacher,</i>
<i>and the man who once</i>
<i>taught Naruto.</i>

170
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:02,908
Gosh darn it!

171
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:04,041
(Suzume)
Iruka Sensei!

172
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:05,541
Hm?

173
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:08,241
We've received word
that there are Rogue
Ninjas lurking outside
the Academy!

174
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,574
You're sure
about that?

175
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:12,874
We have security ninjas
on the way just to be safe!

176
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:17,308
You heard what's
going on. No one leaves
this school under any
circumstances!

177
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:18,808
[gasps and mumbling]

178
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:22,141
(Lee)
Ha ha! Do not
worry, children!

179
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:30,241
Those criminals will
flee in terror at the
sight of my
transformational skills!

180
00:12:30,274 --> 00:12:33,008
It is my Sexy Female
Teacher Jutsu!

181
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,341
Why are you catering
to a specific fetish!?
It's disturbing!

182
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:46,374
"Class-Three Lee! We
Are Team Guy!"

183
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:51,941
Y-you're part of the
security team, right?
Can you please explain
to us what's going on?

184
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:55,608
The primary approach
of this technique is
that I am a female
student teacher!

185
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,974
I didn't mean that
you had to explain
the stupid disguise!

186
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:02,008
This is no time
to joke around,
Lee!

187
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,841
Our mission is
very clear:

188
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:08,174
We have to disguise
ourselves as student
teachers, and protect the
kids from the rogue ninjas.

189
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,874
We should try and
keep a low profile.

190
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:12,841
Really? These are the
security shinobi?

191
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:15,941
That's not even a
jutsu there, it's
just a wig!

192
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:19,308
Listen you three! I
have nothing to hide
here!

193
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,941
I am a ninja who
absolutely cannot
use ninjutsu!

194
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:24,974
[gasps]

195
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:27,308
So, how'd you
graduate from
the Academy?

196
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:32,474
Ha ha! If you wear
this uni-suit and
work very hard, you
will get stronger, too!

197
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:34,141
Work hard?

198
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:37,874
Since you all appear to
be such good kids, I am
willing to give a set
to everyone--

199
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:39,241
Uh-huh!

200
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:40,074
[scream]

201
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:41,841
Can it! Nobody wants
your lame suit!

202
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,508
[groaning]

203
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,041
Working hard is
stupid! It's for
suckers!

204
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:49,608
We've always been a
bunch of failures,
and nothing you can do
is gonna change that!

205
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:52,174
Let's go play soccer
or something... ha!

206
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,874
Hey! What are you
three doing!? You
can't leave!

207
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:55,708
[shivering]

208
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:58,308
Woah! Lee looks like
he's been mugged!

209
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:01,208
Come to think of it,
I guess he has been!

210
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,874
I'm sorry. Those
three are always
giving me a hard
time...

211
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:07,008
Oh, they're something
else, alright.

212
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:11,341
Each one of them is
very capable, but
they're also extremely
lazy...

213
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:14,374
They decided they
can't do anything and
just gave up.

214
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:17,174
Reminds me of
how I used to be.

215
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:22,041
<i>I had absolutely no talent.</i>
<i>Everybody called me the</i>
<i>"Hot-Blooded Failure."</i>

216
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:28,341
<i>My Academy career was</i>
<i>very lackluster. But</i>
<i>Guy Sensei's words</i>
<i>got through to me.</i>

217
00:14:28,374 --> 00:14:33,341
<i>He said if I applied</i>
<i>myself and worked hard,</i>
<i>I could become a great</i>
<i>shinobi!</i>

218
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,508
So now I try to
pay it forward!

219
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,874
I want to teach your
kids the value of--

220
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,408
Lee!

221
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:42,908
[laugh] Pretty
good shot, don't
you think!?

222
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,408
You see the look
on his face when
he went flying!?

223
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:47,408
That's enough from
you three for today!

224
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:49,841
Alright, my novice
assistants!

225
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:51,374
You have assistants?

226
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:54,974
Just pretending to
be a student teacher
will no longer be
sufficient!

227
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:58,874
I will now teach these
kids for real, and show
them the beauty of hard work!

228
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:06,141
Something in my gut is telling
me that teaching those three to
work hard is probably not going
to be all that easy.

229
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:07,641
I have to agree.

230
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:11,241
My experience is, that
dealing with people like
them can be very frustrating.

231
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:14,374
Do not worry! I have
a secret weapon!

232
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:16,508
It is Class-Three Lee!

233
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,941
(Kids)
Leescalante Sensei!

234
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:21,441
<i>The mountain silhouette</i>
<i>quickly grows dark...</i>

235
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:25,208
<i>Surrounded on all</i>
<i>sides by the cliff,</i>
<i>and the threes, and</i>
<i>stunning vistas...</i>

236
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:28,874
I'm afraid your
secret weapon is
gonna be against
the rules!

237
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,374
Alright, everybody.
Please close your books.

238
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:35,574
So why are you acting
like this is a normal
homeroom class?

239
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:38,441
This is the Ninja
Academy, in case
you've forgotten.

240
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:41,474
Today, I want to
point out the value
of hard work,

241
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,074
particularly in the
education you receive
here.

242
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:49,208
If you want to become
truly outstanding ninjas,
you need to put forth the
effort every single day.

243
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,241
Oh, come on! Just
drop it, already!

244
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:55,008
The only ones who
waste their time
training are hot-
blooded weirdos!

245
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,574
In case you haven't
noticed, we're a bunch
of failures!

246
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,908
We're rotten right
down to the core!

247
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:04,408
I can see that forcing
them to participate is
just going to make them
rebel even more!

248
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,574
Rotten, you say!?

249
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:08,974
You little fools!!!

250
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,874
Is this a
teaching tool!?

251
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:13,941
And what is wrong
with being rotten,
anyway!?

252
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:18,041
You may have noticed
that fruit is the most
delicious in the days
just before it spoils!

253
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:20,541
Well, he's persuasive,
but this still seems
wrong, somehow.

254
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:25,541
Using a banana's not a
very good example! It
can go brown on you in
the blink of an eye!

255
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:29,474
It does not matter
if you are a failure,
or on track to success!

256
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:34,174
Society functions...
because everyone in
it is supportive of
one another!

257
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,674
Yes. Like right now.

258
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:40,141
From what I can see,
you appear to be
completely monopolizing
the support!

259
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:42,941
Let me ask you, do
you not have hopes
and dreams?!

260
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:44,174
Dreams?

261
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,508
I have a dream!
A good one..!

262
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:54,308
(Three Kids)
Sensei!

263
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:56,141
What is going on?

264
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:59,474
Sensei! We finally
get what you've been
trying to tell us!

265
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:04,408
We promise you, we're all
going to work much harder
from now on, so please
don't quit and go away!

266
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,408
This is great.

267
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:13,974
Alright! Let us move
forward from here and
dash off into the sunset!

268
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:22,941
Yes, I am getting
emotional. But seeing
the 3 of you learn the
value of shared effort...

269
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:26,008
That is a dream
come true! ARGH!

270
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:27,974
Hah hah! What
a dork!

271
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:30,641
You're straight out
of a bad 80s movie!

272
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,874
As you can see,
it's useless.

273
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:36,008
Yeah, no kidding. I
mean Lee's teaching
by the way...

274
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,908
<i>[children shouting]</i>

275
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,274
Now what?

276
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,308
Rogue Ninjas!?

277
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,108
There are kids
out there! We
have to hurry!

278
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:45,374
[frightened cries]

279
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:51,508
The only way to get through
to those kids and make them
understand, is to show them what
kind of strength effort breeds!

280
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:55,141
I will prove it, by
defeating these
intruders with taijutsu!

281
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:04,008
What!? Those outfits
are totally designed
not to be kicked!

282
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:08,508
But I cannot lose!
I need to set an
example for the
children!!!

283
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,941
Time for a Dynamic Entry!

284
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:15,341
Time out! Time out,
Lee! You need a time
out on your dynamic
brain!

285
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:19,174
I don't see what's
so special about him.
He's just gonna kick
those guys.

286
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:24,074
A plain ol jump kick
is boring! I'd be more
impressed if he did
something spectacular!

287
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:25,708
Huh!?

288
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:30,308
Guess I have no choice!
I shall use my new move,
the Leaf Great Crimson
Great Gust!

289
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:32,541
Ooo! That sounds
pretty cool!

290
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:36,274
<i>What move is he</i>
<i>talking about!?</i>
<i>He just made that</i>
<i>up on the spot!</i>

291
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:38,874
<i>And he used the</i>
<i>word "great" in</i>
<i>the name twice!</i>

292
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:45,274
I have put explosive
tags on my feet, and I
will kick them off
right before impact!

293
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,574
It should be great!
A perfectly flashy
new move!

294
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,108
Here I go!

295
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:57,608
[shout]

296
00:18:57,641 --> 00:19:00,208
Agh! No! I'm
not ready yet!

297
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,841
He's in the air
and out of control!

298
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:09,341
But he shredded his
clothes very skillfully!

299
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:12,108
I will now have to
use my forbidden move!

300
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:15,341
It is time! I have to
somehow protect the
people most precious
to me!

301
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:19,208
There are precious things
on your own body that
aren't being protected
right now!

302
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,974
Here I go!

303
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,808
[screams]

304
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:30,241
Primary Lotus!

305
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:34,441
Hey Sakura! What
are you doing at
the moment?

306
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,074
Look out!!!!
Ahhhhhhh!
Hey Sakura!!!

307
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,174
Stop it! Leave
me alone!

308
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:42,608
Alright, that's
it! Get away!

309
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,308
ARGH!

310
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:47,008
What a disaster.

311
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,241
I should have figured
it was unavoidable.

312
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:52,874
I could never make
that move work, even
when I tried it in
the main series.

313
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,974
Why'd you think it
would work now?!

314
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:58,841
I'm prepared to blast
these guys with the
bubbles from my soda!

315
00:19:58,874 --> 00:20:00,508
<i>Is that what</i>
<i>it's come to?!</i>

316
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,174
<i>We're down to</i>
<i>attacking the</i>
<i>bad guys with</i>
<i>bubbles?!</i>

317
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:07,441
So if we work
really hard we
could end up
like him!?

318
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:10,008
That doesn't leave
much motivation to
excel...

319
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,241
<i>(Iruka)</i>
<i>You little fools!</i>

320
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:12,874
-Huh?
-Huh?
-Huh?

321
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:16,141
Do you really think
you can just stroll
in and be good at
everything immediately!?

322
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,274
You have to work very
hard to achieve that.

323
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:23,374
<i>I've seen shinobi</i>
<i>become so strong from</i>
<i>their sweat and toil,</i>
<i>it's unbelievable!</i>

324
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:24,941
Hmm...

325
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,341
Listen to me,
kids....

326
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:30,541
In my time--

327
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:36,841
Well, that just killed
Iruka's famous
inspirational monologue!

328
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:39,408
I am so sorry,
Iruka Sensei!

329
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:45,074
The trouble is, losers like
us were destined to be
secondary side characters
right from the beginning.

330
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:46,374
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>You do have a point.</i>

331
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:47,274
-Huh?
-Huh?
-Huh?

332
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:50,141
But you cannot
rule out every
possibility.

333
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:57,308
Even secondary characters,
if they were to work very
hard each day- might get
noticed by the producers!

334
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:01,074
And suddenly find
themselves promoted
into main characters!

335
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:03,108
Get it!?

336
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:04,441
Sensei!

337
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:05,174
Huh?

338
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,374
Use this! It'll
help you to win!

339
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:08,841
[grunts]

340
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:13,108
Thank you very much!
Time for the Leaf
Banana Shooter!

341
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,374
Grrrr!

342
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:20,041
It looks like a flying banana
split, except this one's gonna
pack a lot more punch when it
hits their stomachs!

343
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:24,041
Ahhhh!

344
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,074
-Oh, wow!
-Oh, wow!
-Oh, wow!

345
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:29,541
Do not worry if your
effort is superficial
at first...

346
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:34,174
Take it one step at
a time, work hard,
and you'll become
great ninjas!

347
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:36,208
-Yes sir!
-Yes sir!
-Yes sir!

348
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:42,808
[chuckle]

349
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:46,841
[children mumbling]

350
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:50,574
From then on, those
three followed Lee's
example, and finally
got motivated!

351
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,941
I really have
to thank Lee
and his team!

352
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:54,208
(Boy)
Good morning, Sensei!

353
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:55,108
Huh!?

354
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,641
They've taken
Lee's example too
much to heart!

355
00:21:58,674 --> 00:22:03,941
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>I guess the moral of the story</i>
<i>is: If you're an adult dealing</i>
<i>with kids, be careful what you</i>

356
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:06,408
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>pass on... Even in</i>
<i>the way you dress.</i>

357
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:49,563
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>Our next episode is:</i>
<i>"Naruto is Lee, and Lee</i>
<i>is Naruto!"</i>

358
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:52,563
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>And, "I Dream of Taking</i>
<i>the Nine-Tails For a Walk!"</i>

359
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,830
<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>It's quite a challenge.</i>
<i>Taking him for a walk</i>
<i>is really hard!</i>

360
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:58,697
<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>And he's finally started</i>
<i>eating food out of my hand!</i>

361
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,797
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>You actually have the</i>
<i>courage to feed him?</i>

362
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,697
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>He sounds much tamer now</i>
than when he used to run around,
<i>biting everyone in sight!</i>

363
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,563
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>You are a good</i>
<i>trainer, Naruto!</i>

364
00:24:06,597 --> 00:24:10,363
<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>Next thing I'm gonna do</i>
<i>is train him to shake,</i>
<i>sit, and heel!</i>

365
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:14,530
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Maybe you can train him</i>
<i>to recognize junk mail,</i>
<i>and then dump it!</i>
