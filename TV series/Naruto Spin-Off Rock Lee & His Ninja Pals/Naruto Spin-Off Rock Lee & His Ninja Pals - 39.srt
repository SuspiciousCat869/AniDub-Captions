00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,446
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Greetings, everyone!</i>
<i>It's Christmas Day!</i>

2
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,512
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>And here in the Hidden Leaf</i>
<i>Village, the residents are</i>
<i>celebrating with a big party!</i>

3
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:11,046
"Christmas Is The Last
Chance For Love"

4
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,912
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Attention, everyone!</i>

5
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:26,246
<i>I'm sure you're all having</i>
<i>a great time, but let's take</i>
<i>a moment to gather 'round</i>
<i>for the gift exchange!</i>

6
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:32,812
As you can obviously see, we've
got the presents everyone
brought piled high on stage
under this beautiful tree!

7
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:38,746
Of course, now the question
is: Who will get which present?
And it's time to get excited
about that answer!

8
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,679
[cheering]

9
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:44,379
-Time to get <i>serious!</i>
-Time to get <i>serious!</i>

10
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:49,679
The gift exchange is the
Christmas party's most
anticipated and
compelling activity!

11
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:54,312
The truth is, the presents
are the main reason people
even come to the party!

12
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:55,846
And no matter what...

13
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,812
And no matter what...

14
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:02,546
...I am going to take
home Sakura's present!
...I am going to take home
Sakura's present! Ya know!

15
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:06,212
Oh brother... those
two are impossible!

16
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:08,846
They always make such
a big deal out of this
event every year!

17
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,546
You're sick of it
too, right, Hinata?
...Huh?

18
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,146
Hinata..? Hello!?

19
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:18,346
No matter what, I'm gonna
get Naruto's present!

20
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,646
It's coming home
with me, ya know!

21
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:24,579
Oh wow, Hinata is
completely possessed!

22
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:28,046
Neji... Help me out
here. Say something,
will you?

23
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:33,546
I should have figured...
Whatever gift Naruto bought,
it's surely meat for Sakura.

24
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,079
Oh, come on!
Not you <i>too</i> !

25
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:41,112
If Hinata gets his
present, it will have
absolutely nothing to
do with her...

26
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:48,146
<i>A cherry "Sakura"</i>
<i>mochi-cake?</i>

27
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:51,746
<i>This gift was meant</i>
<i>for Sakura! [sob]</i>

28
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:54,679
Hell no! I cannot
let that happen!

29
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:59,212
Cut it out, Neji.
I've never heard
of an overprotective
cousin!

30
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:01,846
I wonder if anyone
wrapped up a big
plate of meat!

31
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,179
Is food the only thing
you and your bone-head
brain can think of!?

32
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,079
This is a pretty
big drag, I
should go home.

33
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:10,546
Who's stopping you!?
Just get outta here!

34
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:16,379
[mumbles]

35
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:20,512
Argh! There are too
many people with
individual agendas!

36
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:23,312
Lady Tsunade will
explain the rules!

37
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:27,512
We've set it up so that
each team will be competing
in a survival race--

38
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:32,279
<i>Each door you see before</i>
<i>you, leads to the room</i>
<i>where the presents are</i>
<i>currently located.</i>

39
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:38,812
What that means is, each
door leads to the goal, but
there are many obstacles and
traps you'll have to get past.

40
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:43,179
Whoever gets to the room
first, can pick whichever
gift they like, got it?

41
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:44,646
Yeah!!!

42
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:49,712
Alright then, let
the gift exchange
survival race begin!

43
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:52,479
[eager cheers]

44
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:54,146
Let's rumble,
Bushy-Brow!

45
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,279
You are on,
my friend!

46
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:59,279
But I am telling you
now, Sakura's present
is all mine!

47
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:00,846
Only if you're
able to beat me!
NOT!

48
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,512
And now, we'll see what
happens! The teams have
entered their respective
doors!

49
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:08,346
We're gonna win this
race for sure, Hinata!

50
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,712
We know how you
feel about Naruto!

51
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:12,646
Thanks so much,
Shino and Kiba!

52
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,279
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Team 8 makes it to</i>
<i>the first room...</i>

53
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,846
Huh? What is this?

54
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,679
Yeah, it happens every
year. THe whole world's
focused on Christmas...

55
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:27,212
...and us single
guys are left out
in the cold without
a lot to celebrate.

56
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:33,379
Well, when you really think
about it, Christmas is really
for the youngsters, wouldn't
you agree, Chief Guy?

57
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:36,746
I guess so. Let's go
knock back a few down
by the station.

58
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,612
Ooo! That sounds
like a plan!

59
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:42,246
We'll celebrate the
only way that single
adults know how!

60
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,579
You three wanna come?

61
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:44,812
[gasps]

62
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,579
What... a polite
offer...

63
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,712
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>And there you have it, folks!</i>
<i>The first pothole in the road!</i>

64
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:54,412
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Team 8 has been trapped by</i>
<i>the camaraderie between two</i>
<i>old bachelors!</i>

65
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:57,646
Of course, on the other
hand, I should have known
the traps would be like this.

66
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:02,512
Come on now, Chief
Kakashi... Ms. Hyuga
is still a young
woman...

67
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:05,412
She's probably going
to spend the night
with her boyfriend.

68
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:08,412
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>A high-pressure situation</i>
<i>with a tinge of sexual</i>
<i>harassment!</i>

69
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:10,579
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>They'll have a hard time</i>
<i>saying 'no' now!</i>

70
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:14,479
Chief Guy, Chief
Kakashi, Shino and I
will come with you.

71
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:15,979
[gasp]

72
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:19,846
Hinata, though, needs to
leave early. She hasn't
been feeling all that well.

73
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,412
<i>Leave them to</i>
<i>us, Hinata.</i>

74
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,579
Yes! You go
on ahead!

75
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:28,212
<i>Kiba... Shino...</i>
<i>Thank you!</i>

76
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:32,546
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>So noble! So moving! This</i>
<i>is truly what a Jump anime</i>
<i>is all about!</i>

77
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:38,846
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Ah, and here is Team 10. But</i>
they seem to be missing a member
<i>-What could have happened!?</i>

78
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,512
Wait a minute...
Where's Choji?

79
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:43,179
You know what? That is
a very good question.

80
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:47,446
<i>We have a special today,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen! Forty</i>
<i>percent off, all you can eat!</i>

81
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,712
The first ten
customers only!

82
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:55,179
<i>(Shizune)</i>
Why am I not surprised? Choji's
<i>been totally distracted by an</i>
offer for deep-discount chicken!

83
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:57,312
That idiot! How could
he fall for something
like this?

84
00:06:57,346 --> 00:07:00,479
You go on ahead,
Ino. I can't leave
Choji behind.

85
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:04,379
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>How dramatic! Well, it feels</i>
<i>like it should be dramatic.</i>

86
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:08,246
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>But something's off here.</i>
<i>Not sure what it is...</i>

87
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,179
Oh boy, what a drag.

88
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:13,246
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Hold on, he's in line</i>
<i>too!? He's not supposed</i>
<i>to be that dumb!</i>

89
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,746
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Let's check in on the</i>
<i>progress of team 7.</i>

90
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,112
[gasps]

91
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:21,346
Huh? What the?

92
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:24,546
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Our team has stumbled into</i>
<i>a lonely bachelor's apartment.</i>

93
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,646
<i>(Shizune)</i>
He has no one to celebrate with,
<i>so he's playing some games by</i>
<i>himself on Christmas. So sad.</i>

94
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:34,779
So, what do you think
we should do?

95
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:36,246
I'm scared...

96
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:41,146
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>They appear to be</i>
<i>deliberating carefully</i>
<i>over the problem...</i>

97
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,312
(Sakura)
Right hand, Red!

98
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,512
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>It seems they've decided that</i>
<i>Sakura & Sai will both stay</i>
<i>behind & keep the boy company</i>

99
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,679
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>It's noble, but I have</i>
<i>to say, I do feel sorry</i>
<i>for them.</i>

100
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,612
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>Team 3 is lagging behind.</i>
<i>I wonder, have they been</i>
<i>caught in a trap as well?</i>

101
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,379
(Ramen Guy)
Don't just stand there!
Come and sit down...

102
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:04,112
What is the matter, Mr.
Ichiraku Ramen guy?

103
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:05,479
Family...

104
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:08,746
My daughter said she's bringing
<i>her new boyfriend home today.</i>

105
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,546
And I feel so awkward meeting
him, I cant bring myself to
go home!

106
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,612
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>It's so hard being a father!</i>

107
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:18,746
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>And dealing with a daughter's</i>
boyfriend? Well, that's obstacle
<i>to overcome!</i>

108
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:21,746
Why exactly does the
trap have to deal
with an obstacle?

109
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,112
This will not do,
my friend. How about
I help you out?

110
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:26,812
We will meet
him together!

111
00:08:26,846 --> 00:08:28,512
Lee, you don't
really have the time!

112
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:31,179
We're on a deadline,
you know. We have
to keep moving!

113
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:34,112
That is so cold,
Neji. Imagine how
you would feel...

114
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,746
<i>...if Hinata announced</i>
<i>she was bringing home a</i>
<i>new boyfriend!</i>

Guh!

116
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,512
Neji! This is the
love of my life!
My new boyfriend!

117
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,679
Let's drown our sorrows
together, pops!

118
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:47,679
Does this mean you'll
keep me company!?
Thanks a lot!

119
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:50,412
<i>(Shizune)</i>

<i>Looks like he's</i>
<i>about to be eliminated</i>
<i>from the competition!</i>

121
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,446
Lee! You Bird-brain!

122
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:58,146
Why'd you have
to say that!?

123
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:00,446
Gahhh I thought
I was helping him!

124
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:03,712
I'll deal with Neji and
Mr. Teuchi! You keep
working on the challenge!

125
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:05,312
Alright! Sorry!

calling, please?

Excuse me?!

out someone has stood them
up on Christmas!

<i>This may be it for Ino!</i>
<i>She's way behind now.</i>

139

<i>Alright! This means I</i>

<i>Naruto isn't coming!</i>

144

<i>That means Hinata will be</i>

<i>Eve alone!</i>

145

<i>After all the dropouts, we're</i>
down to just Team 3's Rock Lee,

147
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:42,179
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>And now, they must both</i>
<i>clear the final hurdle!</i>

Aha! Lee and Uzumaki!
You boys have perfect
timing!

150
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,479
We need this paperwork
done by tomorrow...

151
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:52,412
The end of the year
is always a busy time
for us...

<i>of Lee and Naruto!</i>

This is pretty awful
timing... but still!

156
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:08,779
There's no choice!
It's gotta get done!

157

[groan] There's no end
to this paperwork!

158
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,846
[sigh] Christmas is
going to be over before
we get finished...

159
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,512
We may still be working
through New Years...

160

Do you wanna... end
this competition?

161
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,512
You sure?

162
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:32,912
Oh yes, absolutely!

163
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:37,179
A peaceful Christmas
beats a competitive one
any way you figure!

<i>...who gets to</i>
<i>pick first!?</i>

171
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:02,312
I am satisfied with
having finished the
race! You go ahead
and choose.

172
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,779
I wouldn't feel
right about it since
we both tied!

173
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:09,846
Mhm. Go together, and
if you want the same
present, play rock
paper scissors for it.

They ALL look

<i>each</i> other's presents!

187
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:48,312
Merry Christmas..! And
Happy New Year, everybody!
Ho ho ho!

188
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:05,226

<i>Thank you, everyone, for</i>

<i>this past year!</i>

189
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:10,392
<i>(Narrator)</i>
Here at the Hidden Leaf Village,
<i>the seasons have changed, and</i>
t's time for the annual clean up

190
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:12,559
Good to see everyone!

191
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,559
Today, you're all going out
to clean up the year's worth
of dirt and clutter that has
built up here in the Village!

192
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:20,159
An entire year's
worth of dirt..?
Oh boy...

193
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:24,326
Over the run of this show,
you've all been responsible
for an enormous amount of
trouble...

194
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:30,092
By your behavior, you've
thrown the entire schedule
into chaos, and inconvenienced
the production staff!

195
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,559
It's time to wipe the
slate clean and start
over!

196
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:35,259
Oh really? And this is
your solution!?

197
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,559
We go to work and
sweep everything
under the rug!?

198
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:48,126
"Clean Up Is A Chance
To Wash Away The Past"

199
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,692
Looks like we've been
assigned to clean out
the storehouse in the
western part of the village.

200
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:55,292
Yes, but to be perfectly
honest, I would much
rather be training.

201
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:56,492
Oh quit complaining.

202
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:59,359
Do you wanna get
some New Year's
noodles after this?

203
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:00,759
Sounds like a great idea!

204
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:04,126
After that, we can go
listen to the temple
bells ring in the new year!

205
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,259
I'll ask Ino if
she wants to go!

206
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:09,526
Ahhh!

207
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,226
[excited sounds]
Let's get all of our
cleaning done quickly!

208
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,192
All of a sudden Lee
seems really motivated!

209
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:21,526
He overheard Naruto
and Sakura talking about
going out for soba noodles.

210
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,026
And he expects to
be included?

211
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,226
Hey! Why are you
lollygagging!?

212
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:30,559
If you keep slacking
off like this, I will
be cleaning you up, Neji.

213
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:35,726
That's not the kind of cleaning
we're supposed to be doing, and
while we're on the subject, who
are you, anyway!?

214
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,392
Alright, fine! But we
need to finish the job
as quickly as possible!
If we do...!

215
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,426

[goofy chuckle]

219
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:03,992
What are you
imagining!?

220
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:07,092
Spending New Year's
Eve with Sakura...

221
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:11,559
It's one thing to have an
ulterior motive, mister,
but you're taking it way
too far!

222
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:13,259
This is not
helping!

223
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:16,692
If we keep joking
around, I will miss
the soba noodles and
the singing as well!

224
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:21,026
We have to speed
this up... Great
Leaf Hurricane!

225
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,059
Good heavens!

226
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:23,692
Stop it! What
are you doing?!

227
00:15:31,992 --> 00:15:33,392
And fore!

228
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:35,259
Hey! We're not
golfing!

229
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:36,592
Now what do we do?

230
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:39,092
All of those important
documents got blown away.

231
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:42,392
Do not worry. I will
go out and pick them
all up.

232
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:43,792
You mean all by
yourself?!

233
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:47,592
Hey! I will be fine!
Believe me, I can handle
this job in my sleep!

234
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:51,959
<i>In the end, it is a lot</i>
<i>easier than tracking down</i>
<i>those seven spheres that</i>
<i>grant your wish!</i>

235
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:55,059
You're really pushing
it now, mister!

236
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:58,259
We're all doing this
clean-up because you
keep pulling stunts!

237
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,559
Idiot..! Idiot..!

238
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:04,326
At least they
did not blow
far away!

239
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,492
Hinata? What
is going on?

240
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:11,592
Oh, hi, Lee.
Good morning.

241
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:16,059
I was just about to
mail a New Year's
card when a big gust
of wind came up!

242
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:18,492
There were a lot of
papers in the air.

243
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:23,159
Oh... really? That
is too bad! I need
to go now!

244
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,659
That card was
really important.

245
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,092
I don't know how I'm
going to find it!

246
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:34,326
Uh... well... if that
is true, I suppose I
could stay and help
you look for it...

247
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,026
Huh? Is this it?

248
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:39,192
"A very happy New Year
to you, Naruto."

249
00:16:39,226 --> 00:16:43,059
"Thank you for everything
you've done for me. I
hope we grow closer."

250
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:46,259
Not 'grow closer!' You
misread what I wrote
down!

251
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:50,692
Why would I write
'closer...?'
Actually, it says
"closed stir!"

252
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:53,392
Naruto has a talent when
he makes instant ramen!

253
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:57,026
Some people just stick a
spoon in, but he uses a
'closed stir' technique.

254
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,559
And that way-- he
doesn't get burned!

255
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:04,059
It's something he...
came up with... and it
belongs... to him!

256
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:08,592
<i>(Narrator)</i>

<i>has overwhelmed her,</i>
<i>and she's down!</i>

Stay with me, and
hang in there, Hinata!

Oh! Lady Tsunade! I

Hinata just fainted!

Is there something
wrong?

260
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:19,226
Well, actually,
there is.

261
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:20,959
I discovered I had won a
prize in the lottery.

262
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:25,092
I was on my way to claim
it when a gust of wind
blew through, and swept
the ticket away!

263
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:30,292
What a mess! It would
have been my first and
last win of the year!

264
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:32,126
I don't know where
that wind came from...

265
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,426
Uhh... me neither!

266
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:36,459

like this, but could
you take care of
Hinata!?

What seems to be
the matter..?

270
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:52,692
It was weird... This
huge gust of wind came
along and blew over all
of my ramen deliveries.

271
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:56,026
Why are we having
hurricane-force winds
at the end of December?

272
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,592
I'm gonna have to go
back and make a whole
new batch of ramen...

273
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:00,926
And believe me!
I had a lot to
deliver!

274
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:03,359
A stroke of crummy
luck for me...
Lousy freak wind...

275
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:08,692
Well now! Thank you for
sharing your problem! I
will try to do something
about it!

276
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:11,059
Idiot..! Idiot..!

277
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:12,426
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Tenten! What's</i>
<i>the status?</i>

278
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,292
(Tenten)
What do you think?
There's a lot to do.
So much got broken.

279
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:18,126
And on top of
everything else,
where on earth
did Lee go?

280
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,692
And what do you
think he's been doing
this whole time?

281
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,592
He hasn't helped
us clean one bit!

282
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,359
<i>(Mr. Teuchi)</i>
<i>Five orders ramen,</i>
<i>ready to go!</i>

283
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,492
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>I will be right back!</i>

284
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:28,259
<i>(Mr. Teuchi)</i>
<i>Thanks a lot, Lee!</i>

285
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,792
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>Alright, I have</i>
<i>returned..!</i>

286
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:33,959
<i>(Mr. Teuchi)</i>
<i>Next up, we've got a</i>
<i>chashu and four tanmens!</i>

287
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:35,259
On my way!!

288
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:40,559
[sobbing] I am going
to miss my New Year's
soba dinner with Sakura!

289
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:41,626
I don't get it,
where could Lee be?

290
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:44,026
I don't know, but all
the papers got picked up.

291
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,359
(Naruto)
New Year's soba
noodles for us,
please!

292
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,726
I think that's
Naruto...

293
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,726
Hold your horses,
Naruto! I'm still
looking. I haven't
decided yet!

294
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,159
I think I'll have
the barbecued soba.

295
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:57,426
I wonder if they'd
be willing to wait
around, in case Lee
happens to show up.

296
00:18:57,459 --> 00:19:01,192
I would feel pretty bad
asking everyone to wait
around here on our account.

297
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,059
I've got it! I know how
we can pull it off! I'm
sure this will work...

298
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:06,626
Tell me...

299
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,326
Do you remember
our sushi test?

300
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,259
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Sushi test? You mean the</i>
<i>one from episode 27?</i>

301
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:14,959
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>It doesn't matter which</i>
<i>episode it was!</i>

302
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:19,626
<i>If we create an environment</i>
<i>where everyone feels bad about</i>
<i>eating, they wont be able to</i>
<i>order, and they'll hang out.</i>

303
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,026
(Neji)
Sounds like a plan.
So how do we do that?

304
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:25,459
I'm not worried. We've
endured a whole year of
being in Lee's skits...

305
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:28,659
Don't you think we
can come up with
something? Heh heh...

306
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:31,492
Huh...? ARGH!

307
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:33,459
Sakura, will you
hurry up and pick
something!?

308
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:37,092
Stop pushing! I'm torn
between the curry udon
and the hot-pot udon!

309
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,492
You're supposed to
eat soba on New Years
remember?

310
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,259
(Tenten)
Excuse me...

311
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,192
Huh?

312
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,259
Could I have an order
of broth and soba?

313
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:47,659
Wait a minute, sis,
I thought we were
getting tempura soba.

314
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:51,292
I'm sorry, but it's
too expensive, we
can't afford it!

315
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:56,026
When you think about it,
we should be grateful we
get to eat soba noodles at
all on New Years Eve.

316
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,959
It's best if we
don't get greedy...

317
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:03,159
Alright then! I'm still
happy we can have hot soba!

318
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:05,392
We'll have to share
a bowl, but that
should work out!

319
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:06,392
That's fine!

320
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:08,526
Nice, Tenten! This'll
hit em right in the heart!

321
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,559
It's so sad, I
can't stop crying!

322
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:14,559
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>how good broth</i>
<i>and soba sounds..!</i>

323
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:18,626
<i>After hearing them, I</i>
<i>can't bring myself to</i>
<i>order either udon dish!</i>

324
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:22,726
Here's what I'm thinking,
let's wait for those kids
to finish before we order...

325
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,426
<i>This is working</i>
<i>out great!</i>

326
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,059
<i>I knew it would!</i>

327
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,092
Excuse me, guys...

328
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,592
Here we go..!

329
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:32,492
Why are you both
doing this? Tenten?
Neji?

330
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:34,392
[gasps]
<i>He recognized us!</i>

331
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:35,492
Well, actually...

332
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,059
It's kinda funny...

333
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,126
[gong]

334
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,626
Those chores took me
all day and it is so
late!

335
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:47,159
I imagine that
Sakura, Tenten, Neji,
and the others have
probably eaten by now.

336
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,992
<i>(Restaurant owner)</i>
<i>What's going on!? Aren't</i>

[gasp]

338
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:54,526
It's late. And I need to
close up the restaurant!

339
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,292
Back off, lady...
Isn't it obvious to
you my daughter's
still eating..!

340
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:03,359
Oh really?! How many
hours dos it take to
eat a bowl of soba!?

341
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,659
<i>(Woman)</i>
<i>We're closed! Everyone</i>

345
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:18,359
You waited for me?
That is amazing.

346
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:21,226
Considering how hungry
we were, I hope you
appreciate it!

347
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:24,492
That's all well and
good, but in the end
none of us got any soba.

348
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:26,259
Hey, don't sweat it!

349
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:29,159
He's right. We'll get some
after the first of the year.

350
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:30,159

Can I ask...

351
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:31,426
Huh?

352
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,526
This meal, does it
absolutely <i>have</i> to
be soba..?

353

Hmm?!

<i>You should have come here</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

355

Let me tell you, Lee
really saved my hide
earlier!

356
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:45,692
That's why your
meal is on the house!
