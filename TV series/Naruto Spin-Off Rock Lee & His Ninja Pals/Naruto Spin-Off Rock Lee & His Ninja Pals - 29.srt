1
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:56,125
<i>Well folks, here we are in the</i>
<i>middle of autumn. But you know</i>
<i>what?</i>

2
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,258
It's hard to tell that when you
live in the Hidden Sand Village.

3
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,158
See you when I get back.

4
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:02,325
Be careful.

5
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:04,692
And say hi to the Leaf
guys for us!

6
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,225
Oh...

7
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:08,658
Do you have any souvenirs you'd
like me to pick up?

8
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:09,725
Like what?

9
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,058
If I were picking up something,
it would be one of their
delicacies.

10
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:16,592
Oh yeah, how 'bought
some saury fish?

11
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,258
<i>That's something we can never</i>
<i>get here in the Sand Village.</i>

12
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:20,925
Saury?

13
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:31,192
<i>"We're Here to Welcome Gaara!"</i>

14
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,125
<i>Oh! Gaara is here?</i>

15
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,792
Yes, he arrived earlier today.
We're having a meeting this
afternoon between the two
villages.

16
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,725
He'll be here for a
couple of days.

17
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:44,158
That is wonderful news!
It has been a while!

18
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,125
Dosukoi! Dosukoi!

19
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:50,592
I am formally requesting a
match!

20
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,092
Why does it have
to be <i>sumo?!</i>

21
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,792
<i>Very simple. As our bodies</i>
<i>collide in combat, we will</i>
<i>grow closer as friends!</i>

22
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,225
But you aren't colliding,
you're giving him the slip!

23
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:02,925
And if you watch very carefully,
you'll see you end up pushing
the guy away!

24
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,892
Alright, enough about that.

25
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:08,258
I want you all to show the
Kazekage our best Leaf
hospitality!

26
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:09,958
<i>Can I count on you?</i>

27
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:10,992
[All] Yes!

28
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:16,892
We need to be hospitable. So
then...

29
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:17,958
What are you
thinking about?

30
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:21,792
Actually, sticking with standard
hospitality is our best course.

31
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:23,658
What does that
mean, exactly?

32
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:34,792
Here is what I had in mind. I
think pretty much anyone on
earth enjoys a game of Mariko
Kart.

33
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:39,625
Oh yeah, you're right about
that one! Anyone on earth who
still happens to be in
elementary school!

34
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:41,958
Can't you come up with something
a little more <i>adult?!</i>

35
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,558
Of course I do not want anyone
to feel left out.

36
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,992
So for people like Satou, who
prefer to read quietly, I will
assemble and provide a good
collection of manga.

37
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:53,958
I totally know there's always
one guy like that, but who the
heck is Satou?!

38
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:58,958
Additionally, I plan to have my
mother whip up some snacks that
<i>everyone can enjoy!</i>

39
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:02,125
Welcome! What can I get
you kids to eat?

40
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:03,258
<i>Curry!</i>

41
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:07,225
Oh, give me a break! Everyone
would be terrified of a mom who
looked like that!

42
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:10,758
Maybe not! I bet Gaara would
find her very interesting!

43
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:15,725
Now that you mention it, we
don't know if Gaara would be
interested in something
extravagant or uncommon.

44
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:19,125
And since we don't know, I still
think normal is the best way to
go.

45
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,258
Okay! Let us go buy a game!

46
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:22,558
<i>Hold it!</i>
Huh?

47
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:23,958
<i>Guy Sensei?</i>

48
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:29,825
Lee, I agree that anyone would
have a good time if they
experienced such hospitality.

49
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,958
Right! That is why I
am off to go-

50
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,292
Idiot!
[Grunt]

51
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:34,792
So why punch him?!

52
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:38,658
Lee! What was it that Lady
Tsunade said to you?

53
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:42,658
I want you all to show the
Kazekage our best Leaf
hospitality!

54
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:48,725
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>
<i>Playing Mariko Kart, reading</i>
<i>manga, eating dinner...</i>

55
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:51,292
Do you consider that
real hospitality?

56
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:51,925
Huh.

57
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,592
Let me suggest something.

58
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,092
<i>True hospitality is more like</i>
<i>what I'm about to describe...</i>

59
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:05,658
<i>I believe it involves</i>
<i>demonstrating your sense of</i>
<i>culture as much as possible...</i>

60
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:09,225
<i>...so that ultimately, your</i>
guest feels how intelligent and
<i>refined you are.</i>

61
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:14,058
But you can't feel or sense
anything when your body's going
completely numb!

62
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:19,992
A true measure of hospitality is
when there is a contest of wills
between the host and the guest.

63
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:24,258
Those who have experienced such
<i>battles report that they can</i>
<i>feel it in their hearts!</i>

64
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:27,692
That's because their hearts are
the only places with blood left!

65
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:31,758
Gaara won't enjoy an activity
that anyone off the street could
do!

66
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:35,092
You need to use everything
you've cultivated in your
life...

67
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,225
...and hit him with the kind of
hospitality that only you can
provide!

68
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:40,725
That's the first step to
becoming a true host!

69
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:44,992
<i>Everything I have cultivated,</i>
<i>and hospitality only I can</i>
<i>provide...</i>

70
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,525
I will do my very best!

71
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:51,725
But...what is it that I can do
that is unique only to me?

72
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:56,792
There is my journey to become an
elite ninja, despite my
inability to use ninjutsu...

73
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:59,158
...but beyond that, I
have no special traits!

74
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,825
You have so many special traits
it's absurd.

75
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:04,192
You just need a little more
self-awareness.

76
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:09,125
Right. As I recall, Guy Sensei
said you need to use everything
you've cultivated in your life.

77
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:13,692
I'd interpret that as drawing on
your experiences, but not trying
to over-achieve.

78
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,858
I see! Experience counts!

79
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:20,958
I can use the experience points
<i>from the time I spent grinding</i>
<i>away at this one video game...</i>

80
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:23,025
<i>...trying to finally beat the</i>
<i>last boss!</i>

81
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:26,725
Have you lost it?! That's for
RPG's not the experience Neji
was talking about!

82
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:30,558
<i>Well then...</i>

83
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,092
<i>Maybe I can draw from the</i>
<i>feelings I experienced during</i>
<i>those fleeting, bittersweet</i>
<i>summer days...</i>

84
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,092
...I spent with that girl I met
<i>over summer vacation.</i>

85
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:48,292
Stop it! You don't get to make
up fake summer romances!

86
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,792
It's like your brain downloads
random memories floating around
in space!

87
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:54,958
I get it. This is not going
very smoothly, is it?

88
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:58,325
That's because all of your
so-called experience is just
made up.

89
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:02,558
I bet you could come up with
something that works better, if
you were a little more
realistic.

90
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:03,158
Realistic?

91
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:05,092
Of course, I have it!

92
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:05,725
Huh?

93
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,558
We've now reached that point in
<i>the story where it's time to</i>
<i>entertain Gaara.</i>

94
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:10,958
It's been awhile.

95
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:12,725
It has indeed, my friend!

96
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:18,792
Today, I will show you my own
personal brand of hospitality,
cultivated from all my life's
experience so far!

97
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:20,558
Great, I look forward to it.

98
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,725
<i>I wonder if this is</i>
<i>really gonna work.</i>

99
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,825
To start, I want you to
race me in Mariko Kart!

100
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:26,792
Huh?!

101
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:31,192
<i>You mean after everything we</i>
talked about, the best he could
<i>come up with was that cart</i>
<i>again?!</i>

102
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:35,558
So without any further delay,
let us begin!

103
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:36,625
Why are you doing this?!

104
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,025
How can you ask that? I took
your advice and went with
something realistic.

105
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:42,692
You misunderstood! I
didn't mean real carts!

106
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:45,825
And this activity isn't
cultivated from your personal
experiences, either!

107
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:47,658
What in the world do you mean?

108
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:48,692
Huh?

109
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:51,258
<i>Think back for a moment, to</i>
<i>all the previous episodes.</i>

110
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:56,692
<i>All the things we have</i>
experiences in this series. All
the different types of genjutsu!

111
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,958
Like I've said, they're not
genjutsu, they're skits!

112
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:02,658
Time to race, Gaara!

113
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:05,692
My hot-blooded passion
will fuel my victory!

114
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:08,958
He's not kidding about that!
He's flying down the track!

115
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,892
I understand. I don't understand
why we're racing. I guess this
is part of Leaf Hospitality.

116
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,758
You're wrong, Gaara! It's
somebody's interpretation of
hospitality!

117
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,258
[Cheering]

118
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,258
Nice driving, Gaara!

119
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:40,858
This is a great contest of wills
between the host and the guest!
An example of true hospitality!

120
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:43,592
The contest was a metaphor, not
to be taken literally!

121
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:48,158
You're on the right track, Lee!
Now hit Gaara with something
only you can do successfully!

122
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,725
I hear you, Sensei!

123
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:53,225
Ahh! He literally hit him!

124
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,992
[Groaning]

125
00:08:57,092 --> 00:09:00,558
[Sigh] Well, even with all the
craziness, at least he was
enjoying himself.

126
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:01,992
<i>Do not worry</i>
<i>yourself, Tenten!</i>

127
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:02,725
Huh?

128
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,725
I was able to set up a
Satou-style area for just such
an occasion!

129
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:11,225
You set this up in real-life, as
well?! Neji, have you nothing to
say about this?!

130
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:12,092
<i>Hey, Lee!</i>

131
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:14,692
Where's my "Fist of the
Mole" volume four?!

132
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:16,858
Are you actually sitting
there, reading manga?!

133
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:23,525
You're right. I have to admit,
it makes no sense. But I
guess this is part of
Leaf hospitality.

134
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:25,625
Stop accepting everything
at face value!

135
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:30,125
Attaboy, Lee! What you're doing
here is perfect! It's sure to
make Gaara feel right at home!

136
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:32,892
Assuming this madness
hasn't numbed his brain!

137
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,925
[Heavy Breathing]

138
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:40,292
But, now that I think about it,
all that's left for us as hosts,
is to prepare Gaara something
good to eat.

139
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,458
However, that's a tricky task.

140
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:46,592
You're faced with asking a
private individual like Gaara,
what he'd like to eat.

141
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,425
I'm not sure you'd be able to
trust the information.

142
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,692
You really might be
over-thinking this situation.

143
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,425
Believe me, it is all good!

144
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,692
I will be drawing on my wealth
of experience when it comes to
snack foods!

145
00:09:57,892 --> 00:09:59,058
What am I missing here?

146
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,058
I get it! At dating parties,
it's hard to start a social
conversation.

147
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:07,658
Having a discussion about your
favorite foods is a great
icebreaker!

148
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:11,958
Don't you see? It's a smart way
to discover what someone likes
to eat!

149
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:15,425
I hate to bring up the obvious,
but you could just ask him
directly!

150
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,725
Tell me, why is Gaara
dressed as a girl?

151
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:23,358
I am utilizing the full depth of
my experience. Notice I am using
Neji in my genjutsu.

152
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,958
I think you're utilizing the
full depth of your stupidity!

153
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,625
Nejie, sweetie, what
can I get you?

154
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:31,625
You know what? I think I'll
have a bagna cauda!

155
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:32,792
Here we go again.

156
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:33,892
And you, Gaako?

157
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:34,925
Um, well...

158
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:41,058
Hey, I know! How about some
saury fish? That's something we
can never get here in the Sand
Village.

159
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:42,858
Saury?

160
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,525
[All] Saury?

161
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,558
<i>All set, Gaara! Here you</i>
<i>go, hope you like it!</i>

162
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,692
[Mmmm]

163
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:02,725
Delicious!

164
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:06,892
[Laughing] <i>Success! We did it!</i>

165
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:13,325
Thank you for today. I really
enjoyed trying out something
new.

166
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,525
Excellent! I am glad we were
able to entertain you!

167
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:19,592
I agree! For a while, I wasn't
sure what was going to happen!

168
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,525
Ha! I was never the
least bit concerned.

169
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:26,425
By goofing around together, you
<i>shared a common experience.</i>

170
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:32,392
Nothing else could have made
that fish taste so good. You
were all emotionally connected.

171
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,292
An excellent job, Lee!

172
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:37,858
[Heavy Breathing] Guy Sensei!

173
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:39,492
You're welcome, Lee!

174
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:40,727
[Crying]

175
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,692
Do you have to carry on like
that in front of us?!

176
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,692
Thanks for
your hospitality!

177
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:50,525
Another happy ending. But as it
turned out, Gaara took more home
with him than just his pleasant
<i>memories...</i>

178
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:56,992
That was saury from the
Leaf Village.

179
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:59,292
You sure?

180
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:01,692
Going to the Leaf is really
dangerous these days!

181
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:06,425
<i>No-one could comprehend the</i>
<i>experiences Gaara brought back</i>
<i>from his trip.</i>

182
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,458
Perhaps this is why you can only
get saury in the Leaf?

183
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:25,597
Autumn is chock full of seasonal
<i>treats to eat! Is anybody else</i>
out there indulging a little too
<i>much?</i>

184
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,030
Excuse me...?

185
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,397
Why in the world are these
pants so tight?

186
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:36,164
Huh? Can't be...

187
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:44,397
[Nervous Inhale]

188
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:48,597
[Loud Scream]

189
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:59,264
"The Ultimate Autumn Diet!"

190
00:13:00,397 --> 00:13:02,464
You called for me,
Lady Tsunade?

191
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:03,630
Yes. Glad you're here.

192
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,597
Let's have a talk, regarding
our kunoichi.

193
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:12,497
<i>Those who have been</i>
<i>practicing in your recent</i>
<i>special training sessions have</i>
<i>found them a bit overwhelming.</i>

194
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,997
I wonder if you could come up
with something more appropriate.

195
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:20,197
Huh? What do these people mean
by 'overwhelming' specifically?

196
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,164
Well, I get the impression they
mean it's a bit too harsh.

197
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,197
<i>I don't want to tell him it's</i>
<i>his intense personality that's</i>
more overwhelming than anything
<i>else.</i>

198
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,097
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

199
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:33,964
...But that's how I am! I have
to hold the line!

200
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:36,230
I absolutely will not change my
methods!

201
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,130
If they can endure my
harsh training regime...

202
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:43,230
They'll find they can do
remarkable things, like this!

203
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:46,297
This is exactly what
I'm talking about!

204
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:49,264
Harsh training doesn't
always work.

205
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:52,464
Women in particular
sometimes need a little
kindness mixed in.

206
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:55,897
You want me to train them with
kindness? Really?

207
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:59,430
Is everybody about
ready to order?

208
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,264
I'm not that hungry. I think
I'll just have an iced tea.

209
00:14:02,464 --> 00:14:05,230
Me too. My stomach
feels kinda full.

210
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,397
I'm not feeling all
that hungry, either.

211
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:11,630
Me either, when I think about
it. My chest feels full to the
brim already.

212
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:13,397
[All] Huh?
Really? That doesn't
seem right.

213
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,197
Hmmm.

214
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,464
Mmmm.

215
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:21,330
Hmph.

216
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:27,597
So, let me ask. Is everyone
here on a diet?

217
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,030
[Gasps]
<i>So obvious.</i>

218
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:35,597
Between the sushi, the
matsutake mushrooms, and the
saury, we've had a lot of
food-related episodes lately.

219
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:38,464
The writers must be hungry or
something all the time.

220
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:39,930
You think <i>that's</i>
the problem?

221
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:43,964
What it comes down to is,
everything's so delicious, you
can't help but over-eat!

222
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:47,397
I have to agree. I, myself, have
gained [Idiot] pounds.

223
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:51,997
Oh please, you're fine! I
discovered I'm up [Idiot]
pounds!

224
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,164
Well I've gained [Idiot] pounds.

225
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,364
And you, Hinata?

226
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:58,164
[Idiot] pounds I believe.

227
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,197
[Groans]

228
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,230
This is bad. If the boys found
out, they'd broadcast the news!

229
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,897
This is an emergency! Sakura
Haruno has put on [Idiot]
pounds!

230
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:10,930
And I can not believe Tenten has
put on [Idiot] pounds!

231
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:14,264
It's horrifying! We can't let
anybody find out about this!

232
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:17,464
I promise not to say anything,
even if someone tortures me!

233
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:20,297
Oh no! They'd never be able to
keep the secret!

234
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:22,564
You're right! Not a
single one of them!

235
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:24,864
<i>Especially Naruto!</i>

236
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:28,097
That settles it. We've gotta
lose this weight, and quick!

237
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,030
But how?

238
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,564
We'll just have to be
intense, brutal even!

239
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,430
Wait a minute, that's it!
Huh?

240
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:36,930
We just need to apply some of
Guy Sensei's special training!

241
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:39,264
You're saying that's
the only option?

242
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:41,330
He's always been a
little too intense.

243
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:44,397
Remember what Kakashi Sensei
said about Guy's program?

244
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,364
You'd end up burning off a whole
day's calories if you happened
to run into Guy, first thing in
the morning.

245
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:52,464
What if he's right?

246
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:53,364
That would be good.

247
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:55,330
We might even lose
a little extra.

248
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:57,064
Yeah! Let's try it!

249
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:58,397
Hmmm.

250
00:15:58,597 --> 00:15:59,930
I'm gonna do it.

251
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:00,997
Hinata!

252
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,197
Whatever it takes to
lose this weight!

253
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:06,464
Then I'm in as well!
I wanna slim down!

254
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:08,864
Alright! I'm on board, too!

255
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:11,497
<i>Let's take the pledge! We're</i>
<i>gonna burn it off!</i>

256
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:14,964
[All] We promise to fight 'til
we're right!

257
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:18,630
Really? You all want
to train with me?

258
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:22,430
Yes! We talked about it and
decided to come and ask you,
together!

259
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:25,130
We want the harshest
training you can provide!

260
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:26,397
<i>Please help us!</i>

261
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:32,030
What's going on here? I thought
Lady Tsunade said they wanted me
to ease up on the training. Wait
<i>a minute!</i>

262
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:34,430
[Groaning]

263
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:40,097
No slacking off! You'll never be
able to beat the boys, if you
have that attitude!

264
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:44,664
I see. You say he showed no
signs of backing off his harsh
training?

265
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:48,564
That's very upsetting. I can't
trust our youth to such an
inflexible man.

266
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:51,264
<i>Might Guy! Negative three</i>
<i>points!</i>

267
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:55,130
This might be her sneaky way of
<i>evaluating me.</i>

268
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:59,464
<i>Very well, I'll follow Lady</i>
<i>Tsunade's orders and try to</i>
<i>approach things as she wishes.</i>

269
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:03,297
I understand! And I'll be
happy to train you!

270
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:03,964
Sir!

271
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:06,164
<i>I will lose this flab...</i>

272
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:08,197
...before the boys know
I put it on!

273
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,064
<i>It's only [Idiot] pounds!</i>

274
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,264
I don't want Naruto
to be grossed out!

275
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:15,264
Alright! For our first
exercise...

276
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:18,430
...I'll have you, do a full
ten push-ups!

277
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:20,197
[All] Are you serious? <i>Ten</i>
push-ups?

278
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,892
Huh?

279
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:21,564
<i>Is that too many?</i>

280
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:24,430
What's going on here, Sensei?
Are you making fun of us?

281
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:26,630
If that was a joke,
we're not laughing!

282
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:29,664
We wouldn't have come to you if
you weren't going to take us
seriously!

283
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:31,297
Make the program harsher!

284
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:33,064
<i>Woah! They're</i>
<i>really into this!</i>

285
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,597
Uhh, okay girls, in that case...

286
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,930
I want you to try and
keep up with me!

287
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:38,930
They're really doing it!

288
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:40,964
[Groaning]
That's just stupid!

289
00:17:41,264 --> 00:17:42,497
Next up, try this!

290
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:44,997
For heaven's sake, why on
earth should we do <i>that?!</i>

291
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:47,230
Are you telling me you
<i>can't</i> do it?!

292
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:48,964
No normal person could do that!

293
00:17:49,197 --> 00:17:52,364
[Groaning]
Really?! I guess
you're not normal!

294
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,097
[Heavy Breathing]

295
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,864
[Hmmm]

296
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:05,064
Harsh training doesn't always
work. Women in particular
sometimes need a little kindness
mixed in.

297
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:09,197
<i>So she expects a little</i>
kindness from me. I can do that!

298
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,330
Great job, ladies! You've earned
yourself a break! How 'bought a
little treat?

299
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,064
A carrot and stick policy should
<i>work out just right!</i>

300
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:23,164
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

301
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:24,197
No thank you.

302
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,030
Can we just continue on
with the training, please?

303
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,397
Can you give us
something tougher?

304
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,564
[Gasp]
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

305
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:34,330
Here's the next exercise! Now
try and keep up!

306
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,930
Give me a break! Not the
'Thousand Years of Death!'

307
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:39,497
[Groaning]
What! You're actually
doing it?

308
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:45,230
Perhaps they felt too much
pressure to not accept the
carrot part. I understand.

309
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,497
I better ask Lee for help.

310
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:50,430
[Heavy Breathing]

311
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,130
<i>You are doing great</i>
<i>work girls!</i>

312
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:52,630
Huh?

313
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,264
We heard you've all been
training pretty hard.

314
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:56,597
So we brought you
some treats!

315
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,364
[Groaning]

316
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:02,230
Go ahead, everybody. Dig in!

317
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,064
<i>[Chuckles] I know what they'll</i>
<i>say later.</i>

318
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,364
What? You arranged this
for us, Guy Sensei?

319
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,597
You're so much sweeter than we
thought you were.

320
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,497
How gentlemanly of you!

321
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,397
<i>Yes! An indirect carrot, to go</i>
<i>along with a direct stick</i>
<i>policy!</i>

322
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:19,197
Look, thanks guys...

323
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,964
...But we just came
here to train.

324
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,497
You really need to
take this stuff away.

325
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:24,497
What?!

326
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,964
<i>Hold on here! Have I</i>
<i>misunderstood what's going on?</i>

327
00:19:29,764 --> 00:19:32,297
<i>Is it possible they really and</i>
<i>truly want to train under me,</i>
<i>with no ulterior motive?</i>

328
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,497
<i>That aura! It's like they're</i>
burning with passion to achieve
<i>their goals!</i>

329
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:43,330
<i>This changes everything!</i>
<i>Alright! I'll take them as far</i>
<i>as they want to go!</i>

330
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,530
[Grunting]

331
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:52,130
You're too slow! Hit it back, no
matter where it comes from!

332
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:54,964
If you can't handle <i>this,</i>
you'll never be able to
take the gold!

333
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:55,464
Ahh!

334
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:57,264
Hinata!

335
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,264
<i>Don't help her!</i>

336
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,297
Stand up, Hinata! Come on, I
know you can do it! Up!

337
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,497
Yes...

338
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:05,664
Give me another round please.

339
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:07,064
We're ready for it!

340
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,997
Incredible.

341
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,330
We're just starting.
Follow me, girls!

342
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,664
We're gonna sprint all
the way to the ocean!

343
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:15,497
Yes!

344
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:20,364
<i>I'm so happy! They finally</i>
<i>understand my hot-blooded</i>
<i>passion for training!</i>

345
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:22,530
<i>Well, at least in the short</i>
<i>term...</i>

346
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:23,964
<i>I am gonna lose this!</i>

347
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,164
I don't understand the point of
<i>any of this.</i>

348
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,897
<i>He's way too intense, but I</i>
<i>can't quit now!</i>

349
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,364
<i>I will get in shape!</i>

350
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,230
[All] We won't quit!

351
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:36,864
<i>And now for the results...</i>

352
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:40,464
[Nervous Breathing]

353
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,597
[Groaning]

354
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,430
[Gasps]

355
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:47,364
I made it!

356
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:49,664
It was really tough, but it was
worth it!

357
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:52,064
I set a goal and I achieved it!

358
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,264
I'm so proud of myself, really!

359
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:55,230
[Laughing]

360
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:56,964
You should all be
proud of yourselves.

361
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:59,164
You survived my toughest
training.

362
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:03,397
Right now I can't help myself,
I'm bursting with joy!

363
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,097
Guy Sensei!

364
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,930
[Crying] <i>You're some of the best</i>
<i>students I've ever had!</i>
<i>Congratulate yourselves on a</i>
<i>job well done!</i>

365
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,630
Time for a reward!

366
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:15,564
Huh?

367
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:19,064
<i>Everyone, eat up!</i>

368
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,964
After all you went through,
it's my treat!

369
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:23,697
[Gasps]

370
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,197
This is good! Mmmm delicious!

371
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,697
Thank you Sensei! It was very
generous of you to let us all
join in!

372
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,397
You should have
some of this, Hinata!

373
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,030
The hunger meter's
approaching max! It may blow!

374
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,964
Batten the hatches
on the port side!

375
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,197
The third line's
been breached!

376
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,197
We're in trouble! The fourth
line can't bear the pressure!

377
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,064
[Screams]

378
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:46,364
It's over! We can't hold out
anymore!

379
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,230
Bear down! We just have to get
through this meal!

380
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:52,897
[Screams]

[Eating Loudly]

382
00:21:55,664 --> 00:22:01,097
<i>And so, they instantly</i>
<i>rebounded. And the ultimate</i>
<i>autumn diet ended in failure.</i>

383
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,530
<i>Apparently, Guy Sensei will</i>
<i>never understand the hearts of</i>
<i>young women.</i>

384
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:49,044
<i>Tune in for our next episodes,</i>
<i>which will be:</i>

385
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:52,844
"Autumn Shinobi Safety Lessons,"
<i>and "Deidara's Art is Always a</i>
<i>Blast!"</i>

386
00:23:52,877 --> 00:23:54,844
<i>Let's proceed with youthful</i>
<i>energy!</i>

387
00:23:54,877 --> 00:24:00,110
I'm done with youthful energy!
I'll just rebound again. And
explosions are dangerous! We'll
just get hurt!

388
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:05,944
<i>I think a blast is just what</i>
<i>we need to shake things up!</i>
<i>Whaddya say, let's blast them</i>
<i>wi</i>
th the flames of our youth!

389
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,310
The truth is, it doesn't matter
what you say...

390
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:12,910
<i>There's no way to control it!</i>
<i>Guy Sensei's mind is always</i>
<i>exploding with something!</i>
