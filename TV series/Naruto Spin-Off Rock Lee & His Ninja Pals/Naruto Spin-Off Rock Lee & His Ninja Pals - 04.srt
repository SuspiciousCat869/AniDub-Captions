1
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,909
Normally our friend Rock Lee
is focused on seeking a path
to greater strength. But
today, he's kicking back and

2
00:01:57,942 --> 00:01:59,409
in high spirits!

3
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:00,909
[humming]

4
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:03,742
I am so happy right
now that I could just
dance!

5
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:09,675
The reason Lee's excited is
because his beloved sensei,
Might Guy, the man he
emulates in every way, shape,

6
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,909
and haircut, is returning
from a mission.

7
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:14,009
Please hurry! We
cannot be late!

8
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:17,542
Actually, we can. We
really don't need to
welcome him back.

9
00:02:17,575 --> 00:02:19,875
Today we will obtain
greater strength!

10
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:21,975
Guy Sensei promised!

11
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:27,509
[roaring]

12
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,309
Monkey Style! Snake
Style! Preying Mantis
Style! And Badger Style!

13
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:35,209
Ahhh!

14
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:38,642
That last one looked weird,
though. How does making a
circle like that resemble
a badger?

15
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:44,009
Excellent question, Tenten!
It represents the badger's
instinct to burrow when it
sees an opening.

16
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:48,409
You mean, it's so
embarrassing that you
just want to crawl into
a hole and disappear?

17
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:51,609
Well, I suppose. That's
the general idea, at least.

18
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:54,009
Lee, you understand,
right?

19
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,175
No, sir! Not
at all!

20
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:59,909
Really? Maybe this
technique's too
advanced for you
three.

21
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:03,809
Guy Sensei, I would
rather you teach us
fighting styles that
can be put to more

22
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:05,475
practical use.

23
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,609
Your kempo skills are
incredible to watch, but
they are too difficult
to get the hang of!

24
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:15,775
I feel like there must
be a style that is more
suited to the skills
that we possess.

25
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:16,775
Hmm...

26
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,475
Very well, then. Maybe
if I create a brand new
style, you'll understand
what I was trying to say.

27
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:25,575
You will create an
original kempo style
designed just for us?!

28
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,242
Yup! Leave it to me!

29
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:31,842
Uh, are you sure,
Sensei? It can't be
that easy to create
a whole new style!

30
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,242
A man never goes
back on his word.

31
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,642
Besides, it's just a whole
new fighting style! Coming
up with a few of them will
be an absolute breeze!

32
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:42,275
Do you have to shake
like that when you
say it?

33
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,675
Idiot! idiot!

34
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:47,575
I promise you.

35
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:51,942
I will teach you all a
brand-new kempo style
when I return from my
next mission!

36
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,142
Hnnh!

37
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,909
I cannot wait to learn
that new kempo style!

38
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:58,709
[crowd chattering]

39
00:03:58,742 --> 00:03:59,642
Huh?!

40
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,942
What do you think
is going on here?

41
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,609
They're bringing in
someone who got arrested
for lewd acts.

42
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:06,909
What, seriously?

43
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,242
Lewd acts? Ugh,
how gross!

44
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:10,409
I wonder who it is!

45
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:12,742
Some disgusting sicko,
I am sure of it!

46
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:14,642
Look! There he is!

47
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:16,975
[shocked gasp]

48
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:24,542
[screaming]

49
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:26,742
Guy Sensei, why?!

50
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:35,375
<i>"Guy Sensei Didn't Do It!"</i>

51
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,709
The victims in this
incident all told us
the same story.

52
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:53,809
Welcome, welcome, come
in, come in! Welcome to
Shimura Hot Springs!

53
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:59,375
[screaming]

54
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:04,009
Basically, Guy kicked
down the wall separating
the men's and women's
baths while wearing that

55
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:08,842
ridiculous outfit. And
then he charged into the
women's bathing area.

56
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,309
That guy's one
heck of a pervert.

57
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:16,009
Really, Guy Sensei?
This isn't the time
for sparkly teeth.

58
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:19,675
It's hard to believe
Sensei would do that.
It's not his style.

59
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,809
That is right! Guy
Sensei is well known
as the Noble Blue Beast
of the Leaf!

60
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:27,375
Yeah, the guests at the
hot springs sure thought
he was a beast, all right.

61
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:30,442
That is not what I
meant! Yes, Sensei
can be a bit different-

62
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:32,709
I wouldn't say
different, more
like deviant.

63
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:33,509
You are wrong!

64
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,542
Give it up, Lee.
She's got you beat.

65
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:39,642
Hm. One thing's uncertain,
though. We don't know why
he did it.

66
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,775
Sensei, please tell
us what happened.

67
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,975
You're going to be
branded a pervert!

68
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,642
Sensei!

69
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:52,675
Please, you have to clear
up this misunderstanding!
And then teach us that
new kempo-

70
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:54,642
Lee, you fool!

71
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:56,442
Where did that
come from?!

72
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:01,475
A thought came to me
while they were putting
me under arrest. My ninja
way is to make you just as

73
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:02,875
strong as I can.

74
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:07,409
But simply handing you
answers is not the way
to make you truly strong.

75
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:08,909
Guy Sensei...

76
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,942
So to that end, I have
a mission for you three.

77
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:15,375
What do you think I
was really trying to
do on that day?

78
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,975
You must uncover the
truth on your own!

79
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,609
But, Sensei...

80
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:25,275
I'll gladly give up my
future as a ninja if it
helps my beloved pupils
to grow even stronger!

81
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:28,775
Oh, boy. He's staking
his whole reputation
on us.

82
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:30,842
Idiot...Idiot...

83
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,275
That's the town where
the Shimura Hot Springs
are.

84
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:37,375
Guy Sensei can be
such a pain!

85
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:40,809
He could get out of that
jail any time he wants,
but he's staying locked up.

86
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:42,542
Staying locked up...

87
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:48,575
Perhaps he was trying
to drive home his lesson.
Remember? When he talked
about Badger Style and

88
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,709
the instinct to burrow
into an opening?

89
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:52,942
Yeah, I don't think
it's anything like
that...

90
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:54,209
But...

91
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:57,342
I think we should
split up and retrace
Guy Sensei's steps.

92
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,542
<i>Maybe we can</i>
<i>find a clue.</i>

93
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,675
It is hopeless!

94
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,242
All that, and I have
no idea what-

95
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:20,642
No, of course you
don't! You didn't
even try to get any
intel at all!

96
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,409
I most certainly
did try!

97
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,742
Guy Sensei has staked
his entire future as
a ninja on me, and I
intend to give it my

98
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,609
all in searching
for the answer!

99
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:31,309
Idiot...Idiot...

100
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:36,942
Where are you
going, Lee?

101
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:38,209
Where else?

102
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,375
To the hot springs!

103
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,475
The jets and drains
are holes! Just like
his Badger Style lesson!

104
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,342
Oh, drop it already!

105
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:50,975
If we don't find some
real answers soon, then
Guy Sensei is gonna be
branded a pervert for life!

106
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:53,975
You keep running to
these random places
with no good reason!

107
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,709
Do you even want
to save Guy Sensei?!

108
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,875
Uh...But, Tenten.

109
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:02,575
[clearing throat]

110
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:05,442
You're right that Lee
is at fault for not
helping us more.

111
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:08,242
But at the same
time, I think he
has a point, too.

112
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,842
The hot spring's the
scene of the crime,
so we should check
it out.

113
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,775
[sigh]

114
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,275
All right...

115
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,842
I suppose that I have
been running around a
bit randomly. Tenten
was correct to get

116
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,842
upset with me.

117
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,675
But when I see an
opening, I want
to dive in!

118
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,209
[gasp]

119
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:33,309
Hold on, is this...

120
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:38,275
Ooh, mysterious!
What did Lee see?!

121
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:45,809
Time passed, but the three
did not return, and finally
the day of Guy Sensei's
release arrived.

122
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:50,309
Listen, are you absolutely
certain about this, Guy?

123
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:53,309
Of course! I'm sure
that my pupils will
clear my name.

124
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:59,409
It's been a long
time, Might Guy.

125
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,009
Who are you?

126
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,742
A while back, this guy
ran us through the wringer,
and we haven't forgotten!

127
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,842
At long last, we've
come here to get
our revenge!

128
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:07,675
That's right!

129
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:08,575
Get him!

130
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:10,009
Not on my watch!

131
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:10,875
Huh?!

132
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:11,909
Lee!

133
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,609
<i>Where have you been?!</i>

134
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,909
I have followed my
instincts and burrowed!

135
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:18,742
Huh?

136
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,242
Yes, I see...

137
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,409
I understand what
you meant, Sensei!

138
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:29,309
We cannot ignore even
the tiniest of openings!
We must always dig and
probe!

139
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:31,875
That is how we unearth
our inner power!

140
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:34,742
That is the wisdom
you wanted to impart
to us!

141
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,942
Wait...
These are...

142
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:47,775
After seeing that mural,
you dug and you probed
in order to create a new,
original kempo style...

143
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,842
..."White Swan" Style!

144
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:53,409
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

145
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,409
Just get out of
the way, kid!

146
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:57,775
[growling]

147
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:03,475
[gasp]

148
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:06,375
Why, you!

149
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:07,242
Hidden Leaf...

150
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:07,842
Un...

151
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,975
Deux...

152
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,309
Trois!

153
00:10:10,758 --> 00:10:11,184
Huh?

154
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,875
Not to shabby.

155
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:16,475
That's just the beginning!
Wait 'till you see what
this training has really
taught us!

156
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:17,442
You little...

157
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:18,309
Neji!

158
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:19,575
Why me?

159
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:22,809
<i>Hidden Leaf...</i>

160
00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:24,842
...Pas de Deux!

161
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,809
[screaming]

162
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:26,942
Nice one!

163
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:28,209
Uhh...

164
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:30,809
Yeah, us!

165
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:32,875
Not bad, but it
could be better.

166
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:34,709
Agh! That does it!

167
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:36,375
You're going down!

168
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:36,942
[gasp]

169
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:39,375
That's...

170
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:41,275
... A paper bomb!

171
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,742
He's going to blow up
Guy Sensei with it!

172
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,442
Now die!

173
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:46,109
I'll-

174
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:47,942
No, just let me
handle this!

175
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:51,575
[growling]

176
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,175
[sigh]

177
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:56,642
I wish I hadn't promised
them a new style so hastily.
Now what do I do?

178
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:02,675
Takakura? Matsudaira?
No, not those...

179
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,209
Whoa! Of course!

180
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:09,675
Hm!

181
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:11,575
Ahhhh!

182
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,609
Bring it on! Block
one! Block one!
Block one!

183
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,575
No way! Are you
kidding me?!

184
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,809
Shimura Style
Secret Strike!

185
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:21,675
[screaming]

186
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:23,209
Wait, that worked?!

187
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:27,375
Is this it, Sensei?
The new kempo style?

188
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:31,809
I was so excited by the
idea, I couldn't resist
trying it out right
then and there!

189
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:35,275
Of course, I may have
overdone it just a
little bit.

190
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:40,442
Oh! When you settled down,
you realized you'd kicked
a hole in the divider
between the rooms!

191
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:45,309
Shimura and the Shimura
swans inspired me, so I
named it "Shimura Style"
after Shimura!

192
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:46,775
Okay! We get it!

193
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:49,309
What's wrong, Lee?

194
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,475
I have such a
long way to go!

195
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:57,475
In the end, I was not
able to come up with
as good a solution as
Guy Sensei came up with!

196
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,875
<i>That's not true.</i>

197
00:11:58,909 --> 00:11:59,675
Ah?

198
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:03,742
Don't beat yourself
up, Lee! Even if your
idea wasn't the same,
it still came the

199
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:06,842
closest to Guy Sensei's,
and it's certainly just
as weird!

200
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,009
You guys...

201
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:11,542
Besides, you created
an excellent kempo
style, too!

202
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:17,442
With even the most
innocuous of objects, and
with the most enchanting
of costumes, you just do

203
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:18,475
enough hard work...

204
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,575
<i>...you will become</i>
<i>stronger!</i>

205
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:21,475
Yes, sir!

206
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,775
Now come with me, Lee!
We'll merge and refine
our two styles and create
an unrivaled new kempo

207
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:30,042
style that only the
two of us know!

208
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,409
Double Shimura
style form Shimura!

209
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:33,642
Just stop it!

210
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,875
Idiot...Idiot...

211
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:38,675
Un, Deux, Trois!

212
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,609
Un, Deux, Trois!

213
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:43,442
Well...

214
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:46,542
At least we managed
to keep Guy Sensei's
reputation intact.

215
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:49,975
He may not be a deviant,
but he's definitely
decidedly different.

216
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:56,475
<i>You know, Neji. That</i>
<i>outfit actually looks</i>
<i>really good on you.</i>

217
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,375
I want to crawl
into a hole!

218
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:18,066
Ever determined to become
as strong a ninja as Guy
Sensei, Rock Lee runs full
speed down the path of youth!

219
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:22,499
But what if there were
someone who completely
outclassed his beloved
sensei?

220
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:26,466
Were about to find
out! Why else did you
think I brought it up?

221
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:30,099
So what's going on,
Lee? Why did you tell
us to meet you at this
spot?

222
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:30,999
[chuckling]

223
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,566
Today there will be
an amazing showdown...

224
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:36,199
...and we cannot miss
it for the world!

225
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:37,199
<i>That's...</i>

226
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,733
<i>Kakashi Sensei</i>
<i>and Guy Sensei!</i>

227
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:44,633
So they're...

228
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,199
<i>Precisely!</i>

229
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:50,333
A fierce face-off between
Guy Sensei and his eternal
rival Kakashi Sensei!

230
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:53,233
You do not want to
miss this contest!

231
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:02,533
<i>Guy Sensei's rival</i>
<i>is Kakashi Sensei.</i>

232
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,299
All right...

233
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:08,399
Now, let's do
this, Kakashi!

234
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:11,399
Come on, Guy, not
today. I mean, you've
got a cold!

235
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,766
Please, this is just
a sniffle! Youth waits
for no man!

236
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,199
Let's Rock!

237
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,299
You're too old to still
be going on about youth,
you know.

238
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,966
Excuse me?! It's
about how young at
heart you are!

239
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,633
Ahh-choo!

240
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,233
Sorry.

241
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,199
Kakashi Sensei got
the drop on him!

242
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,333
Oh no! That's
the Tiger Seal!

243
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,733
<i>A fire style jutsu?!</i>

244
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:40,333
Is he going to use
that at point blank
range?!

245
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,699
Leaf Village Secret
Finger Jutsu!

246
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,699
A Thousand Years
of Death!

247
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,533
[screaming]

248
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:51,366
Wow! He just poked
him in the butt!

249
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:55,166
Boy, that had
to hurt.

250
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,566
Oh no! Not Guy Sensei!

251
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,166
You've still got
a ways to go.

252
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,133
[gasp]

253
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:06,066
Well, I guess I win
this round. If I were
you, I'd wait until
you're over that cold

254
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:07,399
before you- Huh?

255
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:12,133
Quick, Kakashi.
I'm hurt real bad.
Call me a doctor.

256
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,966
Hmm, maybe I shouldn't
be poking thirty-year
old men in the butt...

257
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,933
That defeat ought to
cool Guy Sensei down
for a while.

258
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,666
We're really lucky that
Kakashi Sensei is around
to bring him back down
to earth.

259
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,966
Guy Sensei can't win,
but he won't stop.

260
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,166
That is not true!
He can win!

261
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,733
I used to be an underachiever
like you, but now I have a
winning record against the
genius Kakashi!

262
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,599
And my own
popcorn maker!

263
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:42,266
Diligence and hard work
made Guy Sensei the
equal of Kakashi Sensei!

264
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:45,199
You've still got
a ways to go.

265
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:52,633
Agh! What am I thinking?!
I know that Guy Sensei has
beaten Kakashi Sensei
plenty of times before!

266
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,133
Like that one time...

267
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,199
<i>Lee!</i>

268
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:58,066
Eat these for a hundred
times more energy!

269
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,366
[groaning]

270
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,433
You've still got
a ways to go.

271
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,099
Okay, bad example.

272
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,466
But still, Guy Sensei
has that hot-blooded
passion that Kakashi
Sensei lacks!

273
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:13,699
You're right, but all
the girls sure love
that cool attitude
Kakashi Sensei has.

274
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,666
Kakashi! Kakashi!

275
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:17,699
Kakashi! Kakashi!

276
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:20,166
You've still got
a ways to go.

277
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:21,933
Agh!

278
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:26,233
Maybe Guy Sensei is
not as good as I
thought!

279
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:30,033
It's not a big deal!
Kakashi Sensei is just
a really incredible man!

280
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:35,599
They call him the Copy Ninja
because he's copied over a
thousand jutsu with his
Sharingan!

281
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:40,266
Oh, but, uh...
Guy Sensei's a
quick learner, too!

282
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,566
Tenten, I must stop
being so soft!

283
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,033
Huh?

284
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:48,499
I will follow in Kakashi
Sensei's footsteps 'till
one day I am strong enough

285
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,466
to have my own
kunoichi cheerleaders!

286
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:52,166
That's what your
concerned about?!

287
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,633
But first, I must
master that jutsu!

288
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:55,733
Neji!

289
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,666
Forget it!

290
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,266
Fine, then I will just
have to train alone!

291
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:01,299
Come on, that's the
jutsu you're learning?

292
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:10,166
Our first mission with
Kakashi Sensei, and he's
even tardier than the
rumors would suggest.

293
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,666
And come to think
of it, Lee's late,
too.

294
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,266
<i>Sorry about that!</i>

295
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,999
What?! You're a copy
of the Copy Ninja?!

296
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:21,333
This is the best way
for me to learn from
Kakashi Sensei.

297
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:24,099
So you're literally
trying to mold yourself
in his image?

298
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:25,566
What happened to
your jumpsuit?

299
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,033
We are on a break...

300
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:35,933
If we take too long to
get going, the enemy will
escape. We'll just have to
leave without Kakashi Sensei.

301
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:40,433
Our mission is to
capture a group
of rogue ninja.

302
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,466
They've all escaped being
brought to justice numerous
times before now.

303
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:47,266
We need to proceed carefully
and take them by surprise.

304
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,166
But...

305
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:52,433
They're the ones
doing the surprising!

306
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:56,066
But with me here you
have no chance of
defeating us!

307
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,366
You're either brave
or stupid. You're
outnumbered four to
one!

308
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:05,199
Of course I am. I am the
Copy Ninja who has copied
over a thousand jutsu,
Kakashi Hatake!

309
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:08,499
He's taking this whole
role-playing thing way
too seriously!

310
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:14,266
If you expect us to believe
that, you're even dumber
than you look. Show us your
Sharingan, Kakashi!

311
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,566
This is not good!
They're calling his
bluff! Lee doesn't
have-

312
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,699
Sharingan!

313
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:19,999
What's that?!

314
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,499
Relax, Tenten! They've
been making Sharingan
contacts forever. The
ultimate eyes are no

315
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:26,499
longer a dream!
Look!

316
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,366
Byaku-Sharingan!

317
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,199
Aw, come on!
Not you too!

318
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:35,033
You're definitely an
impostor! You're much
too worked up to be the
cool, collected Kakashi!

319
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:36,233
Agh!

320
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:39,233
I cannot believe they
saw through my terrible
impression!

321
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:42,666
What did you think
would happen?! Face it,
they've already figured
it out!

322
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:45,233
<i>I have no choice</i>
<i>but to use the move!</i>

323
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,266
Wait, I know
that stance...

324
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:51,533
Behold, the results of
my training to be like
Kakashi Sensei!

325
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,533
<i>A Thousand Years</i>
<i>of Death!</i>

326
00:18:58,733 --> 00:18:59,415
[gasp]

327
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:01,166
[chuckling]

328
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:04,099
I've been hit by
that before, so I
come prepared!

329
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:07,499
An iron plate?! This
is unbelievable!

330
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,366
This whole fight's
unbelievable!

331
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,199
I've battled a Leaf
ninja who used that
same attack before.

332
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:18,033
That ninja was Kakashi's
father! They called him
the White Fang of the
Leaf's because of the

333
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,133
bite of his Thousand
Years of Death attack!

334
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,366
No, they didn't!

335
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:23,066
Sorry, kid.

336
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,266
Get him!

337
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,133
On it!

338
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,266
Oh, no! Come on,

339
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,566
Neji, we gotta help!

340
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,466
<i>I can't!</i>

341
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:29,399
Huh?

342
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:31,666
These contacts are
making my eyes sting!

343
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,499
Seriously! Now you
decide to get dry eye!

344
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,366
I am doomed!

345
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:38,966
[gasp]

346
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:42,599
Guy Sensei?

347
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:46,299
If you even think of
laying a hand on my
students...

348
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,133
You'll pay the price!

349
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,399
It looks like you're
paying the price, Sensei!

350
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,099
Kakashi Sensei, is
Guy Sensei okay?!

351
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,399
Nope.

352
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:58,633
But he was so worried
about you that he
rushed off anyway.

353
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,466
Huh?!

354
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:05,233
<i>Like you, Guy started out</i>
<i>as a hopeless case, with</i>
<i>no talent as a ninja.</i>

355
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:08,066
But he still challenged
me over and over.

356
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:12,533
I believe that through
his actions, Guy is always
trying to reveal to you...

357
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,166
...the path that
you should follow.

358
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,533
Ahhh!

359
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:21,433
And that's the same
kind of jumpsuit
that I wear!

360
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:23,333
Thank you! They
are so cool!

361
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:26,699
You wear those, and
someday you'll be as
strong as I am.

362
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:33,433
<i>Guy Sensei does so much</i>
<i>for me, and I had the</i>
<i>nerve to imitate Kakashi</i>
<i>Sensei instead!</i>

363
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:41,099
Guy Sensei! It is you!
You are definitely the
best!

364
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:41,966
[chuckle]

365
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:45,499
Now! Kakashi, Lee!
It's time to get
serious!

366
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:46,099
Yeah.

367
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:46,666
Right!

368
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:47,966
[gasps]

369
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:55,933
Don't be scared! We're
completely shielded
from that attack!

370
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,499
Oh, yeah?

371
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:02,266
<i>What?!</i>

372
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:06,599
Three Thousand
Years of Death!

373
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,633
Noooooo!

374
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:13,533
Guy Sensei! I am so
sorry! I lost sight
of what is truly
important!

375
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:16,099
Lee, you don't have
to say another word.

376
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:17,433
Guy Sensei!

377
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:18,299
[crying laugh]

378
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,299
You've still got
a ways to go...

379
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:24,566
Maybe from your point
of view Guy Sensei
comes up short, but to
me, there is no one who

380
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,033
is greater! And I will
stick by him forever!

381
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:27,766
Huh?

382
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,166
What are you talking
about, Lee?

383
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:31,333
About what Kakashi
Sensei just said!

384
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:33,499
No, no, you've
got it all wrong.

385
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,333
I just meant that my
Thousand Years of Death
still doesn't have quite
the bite that my father's

386
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:39,266
version did.

387
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:40,533
Ogh!

388
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,233
Then, you mean...

389
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,999
I've long acknowledged
Guy as my rival.

390
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:48,699
That's right! And I still
have more wins than you
under my belt, by the way.

391
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:51,266
Now that is our
Guy Sensei!

392
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:58,399
In the end, things went
back to normal between
Lee and Guy Sensei. Or
as normal as they get...

393
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:02,233
Together they redoubled
their efforts, hoping to
find even greater strength.

394
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:04,566
Would you please work
on a different attack?!

395
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:49,582
Neji, what kind of
underpants do you
wear to a fight?

396
00:23:49,616 --> 00:23:50,782
<i>I'm not telling!</i>

397
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:52,982
Aw...

398
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:57,416
<i>On the next episode:</i>
<i>"I'm Going to Teach</i>
<i>Konohamaru Kempo" and</i>
<i>"I Save My Lucky Undies</i>

399
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:58,716
<i>for Physicals!"</i>

400
00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:01,549
<i>Ah, I see. We'd</i>
<i>better ask Tenten, too</i>

401
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:04,682
<i>Oh, I wear- Wait,</i>
<i>I'm not going to</i>
<i>tell you that!</i>

402
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:06,549
But it is important
for the next episode!

403
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:08,782
<i>Then why don't you</i>
<i>go ask Sakura!</i>

404
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:11,449
I could never ask
Sakura such a shameless
question!

405
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,882
<i>Well, then don't</i>
<i>ask me, either!</i>
