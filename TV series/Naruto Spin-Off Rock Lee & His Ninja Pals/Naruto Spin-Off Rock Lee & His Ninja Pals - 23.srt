desire the things we don't have.

3
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:00,587
Uh, Bushy-Brow?

4
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:05,721
You are so lucky Naruto...
You can use ninjutsu.

5
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:07,887
Where the heck is
this coming from?

6
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:09,154
I will tell you!

7
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:09,687
Ahh!

8
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:14,921
<i>Somebody help!</i>

00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:17,121

[Laughing]
It's mine now lady!

11
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,054
Not on my watch, pal!

[Grunt]

15
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:34,787
Nice work there, Guy Sensei.
Fantastic as usual.

16
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,921
Yeah but you shouldn't have
thrown your Ninja Tortise, I
feel bad for him.

17
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:43,787
I got a first hand reminder that
<i>Guy Sensei can use ninjutsu as</i>
<i>well.</i>

18
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:46,754
It made me wish I could, too.

19
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:51,687
Why do you even care, though
Bushy-Brow? Your Taijutsu skills
are off the charts, aren't they?

20
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:56,054
It is true, but still! I want
to become even stronger!

21
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:59,121
So that...so that I can
protect Sakura!

22
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:00,154
Huh?

23
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:03,587
[Humming]

00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:14,687
Did you say the bath house?!

00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:30,754

a big bath!

00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:31,221
Huh?!

33
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,154
Move over, Naruto!

34
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:34,887
Stop pushing me!

35
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:36,787
I would if you would stop
hogging it!

36
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,487
Please! I saw it first!

37
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,554

doing?

40
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:51,087
N-no, do not be silly, of course
not! We were just uh, you know
uh, trying to...

41
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:52,854
Yeah...you got us...

42
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:55,721
There's no excuse.

43
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:57,754
No question about it, we were
peeping!

44
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,554
You're so serious about it!

45
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:04,421
What can I say? You know me. I
don't ever go back on my word!

46

That's my ninja way!

Frame it however you want.
You're still a creep!

48
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:15,887
I, I swear! I will watch over
Sakura until the day I die!

49
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:18,054
That shouldn't extend to
peeping!

50
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:21,787
Those were the worst attempts at
being cool I've ever seen, you
idiots!

51
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:25,587
Look, we're trying to protect
Sakura from danger, OK?!

52
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:28,154
Yes! We were merely
demonstrating our resolve!

[Gasp] Oh dang it all!

56
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,887
I got so ticked off I let a
Mind-Body Reversal Jutsu slip
out!

How's that even
happen y' know?!

Oh my goodness,
that really smarts!

59
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:46,954
Huh?

60
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,621
Hmm?

61
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,621
Huh?
Huh?

62
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:53,487
I do not understand,
why am I...

63
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,721
Why the heck am I standing over
there right now?!

64
00:04:56,521 --> 00:05:01,587
It's one of my clan's secret
techniques...It targets two
people and switches their minds.

65
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:04,054
Whaaaat?!

66
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,487
Wait, what you are telling me
is that I am Naruto now?!

67
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:11,021
And I'm stuck being
Bushy-Brow right now?!

68
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,221
This will not do at all!

69
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:15,754
Yeah, come on, switch
us back will ya!

70
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:20,821
I'm sorry...I can't right now...

<i>She looks sick!</i>

72
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:28,854

chakra...I can't switch you
back till I recover...

[Sigh]

74
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:32,687
Are you all right, Ino?

75
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:34,921
Not for a while...

76
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:35,687
Ah, crap!

77
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,854
Welp, I'll just have to use the
transformation Jutsu!

78
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:45,621
Oh, right...Bushy-Brow can't use
ninjutsu.

79
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:48,587
Oh wait, that is right! Then
maybe...!

80
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:50,021
Transformation Jutsu!

81
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:52,987
Oh wow!

82
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,887
Thank goodness, I am back to
normal again!

83
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:59,821
Are you out of your friggin'
mind?! You went overboard on the
pretty-boy factor!

This is amazing!

87
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,021
I did it! My very first
ninjutsu! I can not wait
to tell everyone!

88
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:09,554
Where do you think you're
going?!

89
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:11,054
[Screams]

90
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:14,154
What did you do that for?!

91
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:17,887
Ah forget about that, will ya?
How're we gonna explain how
we got switched around?

92
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:18,587
Uhh.

93
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:21,521
Everyone is gonna find out
that Ino caught us trying to
peep.

94
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:22,621
<i>And then...!</i>

95
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:26,021
You wanna run that by me again,
you were doing WHAT?!

96
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,154
Sakura will most assuredly
murder us!

97
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:33,587
Ah well, we'll just have to keep
it under wraps until Ino is able
to recover her chakra.

98
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:41,621
I finally used a ninjutsu,
this is a pity!

99
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:43,821
Sometimes it just is
what it is, Lee.

100
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:46,787
But I might as well get in a
final workout for the day!

101
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:50,154
If I do not keep moving, my
body will lose its edge!

102
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:52,621
[Grunting]
But...that's my body.

103
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:54,987
Hmm.

104
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:58,021
Speaking of which, I feel a lot
lighter than I usually do.

105
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:03,854
Huh!

106
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:04,887
Right!

107
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:07,421
Woah!

108
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,621
Unreal, I'm faster than
lightning now!

109
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:14,121
Welp, that <i>is</i> my body!
It should feel different!

110
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:20,154
What the heck! Taijutsu users
are amazing!

111
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:23,087
[Laughing] You are just barely
scratching the surface!

112
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:25,421
Woah!

113
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:29,787
This is the core of Taijutsu
training! Surpassing all
limitation!

114
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:32,054
I'm overflowing with power!

115
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,821
Here goes! Eyebrow Whirlwind!

116
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,987
Two can play at this game, I can
use Ninjutsu now!

117
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:39,721
Here goes!

118
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:42,021
[Humming]

119
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:46,121
Well you might have a handle on
chakra, but now you're gonna
need to work on style.

120
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,621
Oh yeah? Well get a
load of this.

121
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:54,721
Check me out! This is true
youth! I am bursting at the
seams with passion!

122
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:56,754
What're you, kidding me?
That's even worse!

123
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:58,421
Oh yeah, well how about this?!

124
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,021
[Laughing]

125
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:06,021
Woah! Even though you can't
turn into yourself?!

126
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:07,721
Boy, this should come
in handy!

127
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,854
Now to use your trademark
technique!

128
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:12,454
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure that
one's out of your league.

129
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:15,821
Monroe Jutsu!

130
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:16,721
Wow!

131
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,054
Huh?

132
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:24,687
Man I wonder what it would be
like if other people got
switched around, ya know?

133
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:27,854
Now Sakura and Kakashi
Sensei, that'd be cool!

134
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:30,187
Oh I think I can guess how that
would end up...

135
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:33,654
One Thousand Years of Death!

136
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,621
Why did I end up being the
victim in that story?

137
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:39,421
Probably not as bad as a
Sakura/Neji swap.

138
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:42,621
Sneak attack! Cross dressing
punchline for the win!

139
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,521
Ahh!

140
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,454
No fair, how come I'm
always the funny man.

141
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:49,854
But of course the biggest coup
would be switching Sakura and
Guy Sensei.

142
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:51,854
Guy Sensei!

143
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:53,654
This is what I call
"youth" baby!

144
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:55,721
I finally found you,
Naruto!

145
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,021
I finally found you,
Naruto!
Ahh!

146
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:58,521
Will you cut it out!

147
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,554
Do not worry, it is all
hypothetical!

148
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:04,521
But you know what, I bet
if we switched places with
each of our sensei's...

149
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,587
...it would make for some
top notch training!

150
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:07,721
Yeah, I suppose.

151
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,921
<i>Heck, if we swapped into their</i>
<i>bodies, we could probably come</i>
up with some crazy new moves ya
<i>know!</i>

152
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:16,721
Hey, you know who I would want
to switch with? Lady Tsunade!

153
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:19,521
And what exactly would you do
inside <i>her</i> body?

154
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,787
Kidding! Just kidding!

155
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:25,621
Anyway, let's keep a low profile
until Ino recovers her chakra.

156
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:31,621
It's crazy, I kinda feel like
I'm seeing the world in a whole
new light!

157
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,521
I know! It is like I am stronger
than I have ever been!

158
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,154
There you are, I've been looking
for you.

159
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:38,187
For me?!

160
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:43,087
<i>Sakura was looking for me! She</i>
<i>was really looking for me!</i>

161
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:46,687
Good day to you, Sakura!

162
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,921
What the heck is wrong
with you, Naruto?

163
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:53,587
Will you stop acting like a
creep? Sakura was really looking
for me, remember?

164
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:57,021
Uhh, could you guys stop
whispering in front of me?
You're creeping me out.

165
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,654
Oh yeah, you're right, sorry
about that Sakura.

166
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,621
So what's up anyway? Do you
wanna go on a date or something?

167
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:03,454
Huh.

168
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:08,754
Look I'm really sorry, but the
truth of the matter is, you're a
little too intense for me.

169
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:09,921
[Screams]

170
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:12,454
[Chuckling] My
sympathies, friend.

171
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:17,887
Are you crazy, what the heck are
yougloating about?! She's not
talking about me, you're the one
she thinks is a weirdo!

172
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,487
Ahhh!

173
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,087
Oh...right...

174
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,654
It's fine though. You should
come too Rock Lee.

175
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:30,187
Lady Tsunade has just handed out
orders for Team Kakashi and
Team Guy on a joint mission.

176
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:37,521
Oh hey Lee, there you are,
we were just about to come
and find you.

177
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,821
Hey, Tenten, Neji,
how's it goin?

178
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:40,887
Huh?
Huh?

179
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:42,654
What gives?

180
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:44,954
He's talking like a
normal person.

181
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:49,187
I guess miracles do happen,
although Lee being normal takes
the cake.

182
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:52,854
The heck, Bushy-Brow? What kind
of weirdo life do you live,
anyway ya know?

183
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:56,787
I am the hardest-working ninja
there is! I work on the basics!

184
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,821
You know, stuff like this!

185
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:01,187
Knock it off! You're
gonna jam my fingers!

186
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:06,087
Just remember Lee, we've got a
mission today. So no challenging
me to any matches.

187
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:10,254
Yeah, no duh, captain obvious. I
already beat you a long time
ago, so I think I'm good.

188
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:11,521
What...?

189
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,554
What's gotten into you? You're
always pestering Neji to fight
you!

190
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:17,654
Huh? Oh! Of course I do!

191
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:21,987
Oh by the way Neji, on another
note, I hear the Hyugas are
having a tough time lately.

192
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:23,021
I suppose so.

193
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:25,521
Don't even worry about it!

194
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:29,054
When I become Hokage, we'll get
the Hyuga clan fixed right up!

195
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,754
Who are you and what have you
done with Rock Lee?

196
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:36,187
Looks like everyone's here.

197
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:39,454
What about Kakashi
and Guy Sensei?

198
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:44,154
Sorry we're late, everyone. I
got caught up in a daydream and
I didn't want it to end.

199
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:47,454
The procrastinating bird never
gets the worm.

200
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:52,621
But since you're finally out
and about, whaddya say to a
little ramen speed-eating
contest?

201
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:55,821
Forget it. I'd just embarrass
you in front of your pupils.

202
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:59,721
That is patently false! Guy
Sensei will win for sure!

203
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:01,954
Naruto?

204
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,521
It is true!

205
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:06,254
It is because Guy Sensei
is beyond compare!

206
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:07,554
Th-thanks.

207
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:13,154
<i>What?! My stock seems to have</i>
fallen off a bit. Is it because
<i>I was late?</i>

208
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:15,821
To have such respect
coming from <i>you...</i>

209
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:19,054
[Gasp] This is what real youth
is, you crazy kid!

210
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:22,554
Lee, get over here! Leap into my
heaving bosom already!

211
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,021
Hit me again, Pops!

212
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:25,821
You're choosing
ramen over me?!

213
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:29,921
Okay...Settle down, and I'll
explain our mission.

214
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:38,087
Hidden throughout the forest are
<i>rouge ninjas who are targeting</i>
<i>the village.</i>

215
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,721
Our mission is to capture them.

216
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:44,187
I can't believe I have to use
this body is real combat.

217
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:48,021
This is my chance to try out
real ninjutsu. Bring it on!

218
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:50,054
Yeah. We've still
got this!

219
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:58,687
I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to protect Sakura!

220
00:12:58,721 --> 00:12:59,521
Ya know!

221
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,842
<i>"I Dream of Taking the</i>
<i>Nine-tails for a Walk!"</i>

222
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:30,009
<i>Neji, your Byakugan made</i>
<i>things much easier.</i>

223
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,142
We found them right away.

224
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:35,842
So all we have to do now
is round 'em up, right?

225
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:38,609
Don't be scared, we've
got them outnumbered!

226
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:41,042
You're never seeing your
village again, Leaf losers!

227
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:42,309
Get 'em, fellas!

228
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:42,976
Okay!

229
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:45,076
Heh, I'll handle these guys!

230
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,642
<i>Let's see what Bushy-Brow's</i>
<i>Taijutsu can do!</i>

231
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:50,242
Eyebrow Whirlwind!

232
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:51,609
What!
What the!

233
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:53,142
He shot out his
nose hair?!

234
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:56,142
You pin-head moron! I can
counter that easy!

235
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:57,876
[Screams]
Lee!

236
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:01,909
Let's go, Naruto. I'll draw
their attention. You cover me!

237
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,476
Yes, sir! Copy that!

238
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,642
<i>Finally, my chance to shine!</i>

239
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,009
Woah!
What!

240
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:10,609
Now, Naruto! Hit them with
everything you've got!

241
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,542
Huh?!

242
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,609
Look at this, Kakashi Sensei! I
made two shadow clones all by
myself!

243
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:17,242
Uhh, and?

244
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:21,509
Have no fear, Kakashi-Sensei,
this leads into my new jutsu!

245
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:28,576
What do you think of my Sexy
Sakura Jutsu! The enemy's eye's
will pop right out of their
sockets!

246
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:30,009
What are you doing?

247
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:33,576
Also I just said I was in
charge of distracting them.

248
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:36,776
But it's perfect, isn't it! This
is impressive, even for me.

249
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,776
Although I think I might be
lacking a few curves here and
there.

250
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:40,576
Totally!

251
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:42,609
Idiot!

252
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,176
What's with you guys?

253
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:45,709
Get serious, will ya!

254
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,109
Okay, Lee!

255
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,242
We'll hit 'em with a
tag team combo!

256
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:50,209
Uh, okay!

257
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:53,676
<i>Now for my newly-evolved</i>
<i>Taijutsu prowess!</i>

Hurricane!

How am I supposed to
work with <i>that?!</i>

260
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,942
Don't be silly now, Lee!
Something like that should be a
piece of cake for you!

261
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:06,676
Now rend the air with your kicks
and start shooting some
fireballs!

262
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:07,642
Hiya!

263
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:09,809
No way man,
that's impossible!

264
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,842
Pass!

267
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:13,809
What gives Lee?

268
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:15,109
I quit.

269
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,242
You're through!

270
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:18,909
Kakashi Sensei!

271
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:23,576
Clearly you two aren't at a
hundred percent today. Just stay
back!

272
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:25,676
[Sigh]

273
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,476
Gosh I feel terrible about this,
we're not helping at all.

274
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,042
If I could at least make some
shadow clones...

275
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:35,042
I guess I can forget about
protecting Sakura, at this
rate...

276
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:38,509
Shall I lend you my power, then?

277
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,942
Huh?

278
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:43,242
That voice...The beast sealed
within Naruto's body?

279
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:50,209
So this is what the inside of
Naruto's mind is like...

280
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:52,876
You there, young one.

281
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:55,709
Hurry up and let me out of here.

282
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:59,209
I am sorry. I can not do that
without your owners permission,
Niney.

283
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:01,676
What the! Did you
just call me Niney?

284
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:05,176
But listen, if you promise to
behave yourself, I will give you
this!

285
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:06,642
I don't need that!

286
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,076
Fair enough, suit yourself! But
I still might have just the
thing for you.

287
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:13,309
<i>A high-quality rawhide bone!</i>

I'm not chewing that!

think I am, you little
pipsqueak?!

[Gasp] What wild chakra...!

291
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:24,509
I need to speak from the heart
if I want to have any chance of
quelling his anger.

308
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:11,509
Oh perfect timing...

309
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:16,576
[Snarling]

310
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,242
Aren't the tails in
the wrong spot?

311
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:19,809
The eyebrows?

312
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:24,209
He's begun the Tailed...No, the
Browed Beast Transformation.

313
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:27,842
I'm sorry but "browed beast"
sounds weird, Kakashi Sensei!

314
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:30,242
[Snarling]

315
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:34,009
We have to stop it before
browed beast's power runs amok.

316
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,109
So we're sticking with "browed
beast," then.

317
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:39,242
[Struggling] my body is on fire!

318
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:41,242
This giant dog chakra is awful!

319
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,076
<i>Did you say giant dog?!</i>
Huh?

320
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,176
<i>Guy Sensei!</i>

321
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:51,042
I have...to control it
somehow...for you Guy Sensei!

322
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:53,142
I won't lose control!

323
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:54,176
Ahh!

324
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,576
Naruto is attacking
Guy Sensei!

325
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,209
<i>Now's my chance to seal it!</i>

326
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:00,909
Phew!

327
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,776
Look out everyone! The enemy's
attacking!

328
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,109
Everyone run!

329
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,476
Paper Bombs!

00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:15,942
Oh no! Sakura!

332
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:21,676
Ow...

333
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:25,642
Well I don't think I'm hurt too
badly, but I can't...

334
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,576
Huh?

335
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:28,709
[Evil Laughing]

336
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,242
She knows what we
look like, boys.

337
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,676
No other choice then,
we've got to get rid of her!

338
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:33,776
Prepare to die.

339
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:41,042
<i>This is bad. I need to heal</i>
<i>myself with medical ninjutsu,</i>
<i>but there's no time! What do I</i>
<i>do...</i>

340
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:42,909
Let's get her!

341
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:47,776
[Battle Cry]

[Gasp]

343
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:51,776
Naruto! Rock Lee!
Where did you?!

344
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:53,042
You kidding me?

345
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:56,176
Back for more, huh? You rejects
are gluttons for punishment!

346
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:59,509
You guys! Don't push it, go get
Kakashi and Guy Sensei!

347
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,542
She has a point. We can't fight
the way we normally do.

348
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,942
But we can still beat
these guys if we try!

349
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:06,776
But you...

350
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:10,309
No way <i>I'm</i> giving up, even if I
can't use my ninjutsu.

351
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:14,209
As long as I work hard enough, I
can control Niney's power.

352
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:18,576
I never go back on my word, no
matter what! Cause that's my
ninja way!

353
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,942
Do not forget! I swore to
protect you with my life!

[Gasp]

355
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,576
Come Naruto! Let us
combine our powers!

356
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,709
Sounds good to me! No one's
laying a finger on Sakura, ya
know!

357
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:34,076
Looks like this group
is down for the count.

358
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,109
Hurry everyone!

359
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:36,709
Yeah we have to
help them!

Huh?

363
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:47,676
[All]
What the...?

364
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,109
Ahhh!

365
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:50,609
Here we go!

366
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:52,676
Rasen Shu-Lee-ken!

367
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:54,042
<i>He threw him?!</i>

00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,842
[Screams]
Uhh...

369
00:19:57,276 --> 00:19:58,676
What is Shu-Lee-ken?

370
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:02,642
Jeez, it really feels like they
shoehorned that name in there,
huh...

371
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:04,142
[Groaning]

372
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:06,076
Looks like everything
worked out after all!

373
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:07,209
Yeah!

374
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,076
I gotta say, you really
are something else.

375
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:14,109
It's so hard not being able to
use ninjutsu, but you still
manage to fight with the best of
'em!

376
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:15,509
That goes for you as well!

377
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:21,042
I can not imagine how you deal
with that giant, disobedient dog
every day, there is no may I
could handle it.

378
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:22,642
Giant dog...?

379
00:20:24,242 --> 00:20:26,842
Anyway, regardless of how you
look at it, we both have a lot
on our plates, right?

380
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:28,209
Boy do we ever!

381
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:30,076
[Laughing]

382
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:31,476
<i>Hey, Naruto!</i>

383
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:36,909
Yeah?

384
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:39,609
Well that explains it. You had
your minds switched, didn't you?

385
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,942
I knew something was
off with you nitwits.

386
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:44,242
You've been talking like
one another all day.

387
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,609
Oh, well...the
thing is we...

388
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:52,109
Go ahead. How exactly did this
happen to you two.

389
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,676
[Both]
Uhh...

390
00:20:57,009 --> 00:20:58,576
Serves you right, I'd say.

391
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,309
We promise we will never do it
again, now will you please
switch us back.

392
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:05,609
With, with sugar on top.

393
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:08,276
Get those swollen
faces away from me.

394
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,742
Fine. Whatever. My chakras's
fully recovered now anyway.

395
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:14,776
Here we go! Mind-Body Reverse!

396
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,509
Ahh!
[Grunts]

397
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:20,209
[All]
Huh??

398
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:24,242
Oh come on, I'm not just
cross-dressing, I'm an actual
girl now?!

399
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:27,142
Im a teenager, not an old
man in his 30's!

400
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:29,876
I don't see what the big deal
is, right Guy?

401
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:30,976
This is youth!

402
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:32,942
Um, Ino, I think you-

403
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:34,242
I'm not Ino, I'm Sai.

404
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:40,576
I'm so sorry. When I tripped and
fell, a Mass Mind-Body Reversal
Jutsu accidentally slipped out,
and...

405
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:43,076
Again!? You can't
keep doing that!

406
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:44,842
Wait, does that mean
we will still be...

407
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:49,176
Yeah, until I recover all my
chakra again, we're all stuck.

408
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,009
Oh no!

409
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:53,209
This is all your fault, you
block headed idiots!

410
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:55,176
How are you gonna fix this?!

411
00:21:55,742 --> 00:21:57,509
<i>Wake up, Ino!</i>

412
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:04,509
And so, everyone was stuck in a
<i>different body for a few days,</i>
until Ino finally recovered all
<i>her Chakra. Oh boy...</i>

413
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:50,863
Join us next week for "I'm Sai's
<i>New Agent!" and "Win Lady</i>
<i>Tsunade's Heart!"</i>

414

<i>Uhh, why Lady Tsunade?</i>

415
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:55,663
It is finally time! I
am so nervous!

416
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:57,530
<i>About what?</i>

417
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:02,730
If I am going to marry Sakura,
my final mission is to win the
approval of her master, Lady
Tsunade!

418
00:24:02,763 --> 00:24:08,096
Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness!
I need to let her know of my
intentions!

419
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,530
<i>What?! Lady Tsunade isn't even</i>
<i>Sakura's mom! Besides, the two</i>
<i>of you aren't even dating!</i>
