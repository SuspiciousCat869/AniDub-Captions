Hinata! Say something!

00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:19,976
Grr.

3
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,222
Sorry for the wait.

4
00:00:32,222 --> 00:00:33,924
Thanks, Shikamaru!

00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:35,759

move out.

Oww!

00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:47,871
Tsk... Huh?

9
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:49,473
Rasengan!!!

10
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,209
That's enough!
You hear me!?

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,479
[shouting]

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,115
Get over it.

13
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:00,283
I'm simply walking
the path I chose.

14
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:03,053
Watch out...
He's gonna‐‐

Kakashi Sensei!

22
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,853
(Guy)
Just leave these
hotheads to us!

23
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:39,122
(Kakashi)
You two go after
Sasuke! Move!

24
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:40,690
But, what about‐‐

25
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:42,826
(Guy)
Go‐‐ Now, Lee!

26
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:45,695
The people of the
Hidden Leaf Village
need you...

27
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,865
Protect them!

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,737
[sigh] Understood, sir!

29
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,105
Naruto, are
you with me!?

30
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:56,973
Yeah! Right
behind you!

31
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,710
Now, how do we go
about stopping
these things..?

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,114
We can do it if
we're willing to
put everything on
the line!!

33
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:15,625
I've finally done it.
Are you watching, Itachi?

34
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,095
These are the Hidden
Leaf's final moments.

35
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:25,035
[thunder / lightning]

36
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:26,870
It's all over!

37
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,238
(Naruto)
Hold it right there!

38
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:31,074
You're a persistent pest.

39
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:34,277
Whatever you have to
say, it'll never
change my mind.

40
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:37,247
Yeah, I know. No
point in wasting
out breath on you.

41
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:39,883
But remember, our
feelings haven't
changed either!

42
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:42,786
We will protect the
village with our
lives! We will never
give up!

A shadow clone?

51
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,357
Eat this, Sasuke!

52
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:22,359
Kirin!!!

53
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:34,137
Naruto... Sasuke...
no...

54
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,941
[panting breaths]

55
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:41,678
It's over, Naruto.
I'll finish you,
personally.

56
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:42,846
[grunt]

57
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:49,953
[panting]
Looks like we got
here just in time.

58
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:54,157
Neji, Tenten...
I am glad you
are both safe.

59
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:57,093
Don't worry about
us. Just explain
to me...

60
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,929
Why are we suddenly
having a final ultimate
battle!??

61
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:02,432
How am I supposed to
make snappy comebacks and

62
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,867
punchlines during all this!?
None of it makes sense!

63
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,936
Well today is the last
episode, so we wanted to
go out with a bang!

64
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,673
"Go the whole nine
yards" so to speak.
Understand?

65
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:12,342
You must've gone over
nine thousand yards at
this rate!

66
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,512
Our regular viewers are
going to be totally
confused by all this!

67
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:18,248
I think the animators are
getting exhausted, too,
just look at us!!

68
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:22,185
Besides, I get Naruto,
but you have absolutely
no connection to Sasuke!

69
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:27,324
Sure I do! He completely
demolished me in the
popularity contest! Remember?

70
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:29,326
Then that would make
YOU the aggressor!

71
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:32,762
Regardless! We must
now face our biggest
foe! This is it!

72
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:34,831
It feels more like
the world's biggest
setup!

73
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,933
I don't care if this
is the last episode
or not...

74
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:39,836
but one extra
straight man won't be
enough to defeat me!

75
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:42,038
Sasuke, your face!
Your face!

76
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:44,307
We've got a lot
more than just
one extra...

77
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,712
Ah, would you look
at this. What a drag.

78
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:52,749
You don't look worried!
You look excited to be
in the last episode!

79
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:56,219
Whoa! Good thing we
just happened to be
passing by!

80
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:58,922
"Happened to be
passing by!?" You're

81
00:04:58,988 --> 00:04:59,889
just sneaking in
more screen time!

82
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:04,661
[singsongy battle cry]

83
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,329
Prepare to meet
your demise, Sasuke.

84
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:08,164
I'm sorry, Lee. I
wish I could be the

85
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,934
kind of sensei who lets
his pupils take all the
good parts, but I'm not.

86
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,870
And you two idiots
are trying way too
hard!!

87
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,573
I suppose this is really
exciting, but only because

88
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:18,575
everyone's hyped up to be
in the last episode!

89
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:21,711
Sasuke, give it up.

90
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:24,581
[chuckle] You never
change... how sad.

91
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,050
Still so much
blind faith in me.

92
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,551
Don't do this.

93
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:30,620
But I'm a man on a
mission. And Iwill

94
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,989
see that it's
completed.

95
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:37,227
Could that be...

96
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:39,896
What's he getting
ready to do!?

97
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:40,663
(Kakashi)
Use a forbidden jutsu that

98
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,533
turns any chakra he touches
into a bomb.

99
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,735
(Kakashi)
It will damage his own body,

100
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,804
but it hits the attacker
with incredible force.

101
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:50,907
I see. So it follows the
same principle that when

102
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:52,942
you're on a diet, seeing
someone eating causes

103
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:55,245
you to go way overboard
and gorge like crazy.

104
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:56,413
That's evil...

105
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:58,915
The atmosphere is
all we have now,
please don't ruin it.

106
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:03,086
So what you're saying is
that our chakra becomes
his explosives? Great.

107
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:06,222
That means we can't
risk attacking him
with our ninjutsu.

108
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:08,224
That makes things
even more boring.

109
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:09,893
(Lee)
It is okay...

110
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:12,562
I am a ninja who
cannot use ninjutsu.

111
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,899
That means this is
my time to shine!
Just stand back!

112
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,167
Whoa, Bushy Brow...

113
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:20,403
Lee! Now is the time
to show them your
true power!

114
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:23,807
I apologize for stealing
the spotlight from you,
Naruto, but remember...

115
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:27,644
...the real main
character of this
show...

116
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:30,046
...is me! Rock Lee!

117
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,316
Oh well! Go get
him, Bushy Brow!

118
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:36,553
[attack yell]

119
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,055
Attacking alone,
are we?

120
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:41,891
[charging yell]

121
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:03,146
[attack grunts]

122
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:08,485
[screaming]

123
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,320
Lee's pushing him back!

124
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,622
Of course! Sasuke can't
use chakra because of

125
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:15,625
that forbidden jutsu!
Lee has a chance!

126
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:23,933
Fine, have it
your way.

127
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,603
This is gonna hurt,
but you leave me
no choice!

128
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:28,705
What's that?

129
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:31,674
A move Sasuke created
on his own: Kirin.

130
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:34,511
He's going to expend a little
chakra to activate the clouds,

131
00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:37,380
and strike himself
to activate the
forbidden jutsu.

132
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,883
No! Don't do
it, Sasuke!

133
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,354
[crowd groans]

134
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:46,122
That's what we're
going with, here!?

135
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:50,960
Farewell, Hidden Leaf.

136
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:04,374
[screaming]

137
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,808
Orochimaru?

138
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,710
Orochimaru!?

139
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:09,546
[shouts]

140
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,049
[screaming]

141
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:18,121
Orochimaru, why
did you do that!?

142
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:20,456
[chuckle] Because
crushing the Hidden

143
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,492
Leaf Village is
my bit...

144
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:26,195
And I won't let
Sasuke steal that
honor away from me.

145
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:28,798
Orochimaru...

146
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:33,202
Listen, Lee... matching
wits with you those many
times this past year...

147
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:37,040
It... was fun.
[dying breath]

148
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:43,112
Orochimaru!!
Please, no!

149
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:46,449
Orochimaru!

150
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,023
Sasuke... Mark my
words, I will defend

151
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:57,961
this village until
my last breath!

152
00:08:58,027 --> 00:08:59,195
[grunt]

153
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:00,997
Here I come!!!

154
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:05,335
Shimura Style Secret
Strike! Woooow!

155
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:08,104
Just had to pull
that one out
again, huh?

156
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:09,072
Sexy Jutsu!

157
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:10,607
And that one's
completely useless!

158

00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:13,843
Aw! That could have
been such a cool moment!

160
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:17,780
[grunt]
[heavy breaths]

161
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:20,216
[cheering]

162
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:21,417
Nice, Bushy Brow!

163
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:27,223
So this is it...
I can't believe I...

164
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:29,092
Sasuke!

165
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:32,061
Naruto... I'll
never change...

166
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:34,364
And you better not
change either...

167
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,733
Watch out! He's
using Kirin again!

168
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,002
He's insane! Is
he planning on
self‐destructing!?

169
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:43,840
Sasuke!!!!

170
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,479
Giraffe.

171
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,297
(Tenten)
That's the end!!?
Are you kidding!?

172
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:18,908
Oh! Sakura...

173
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:21,033
Hey, Lee. So, you're
really leaving the
village, then?

174
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:21,850
Yes.

175
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,857
I want to become an
excellent ninja, even if
I cannot use ninjutsu.

176
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:29,861
And to do that, I
must continue to train
even harder than before

177
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:32,530
Yeah, I know...

178
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,869
So, Sakura, if I so train
hard and return a truly great
ninja, would you, uh, well...

179
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:41,639
Would you go out
for some curry with
me sometime!??!

180
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,509
Well... I...

181
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,711
I'm not good with
intense things,

182
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,781
but, keep it low
key and I'm in!

183
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:51,082
Does that sound good?

184
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:54,252
Ah... It sounds
amazing! thank you!

185
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:57,155
I swear I'll become
a great ninja! You
can count on it!

186
00:10:57,222 --> 00:11:00,458
Do your best,
Lee! See ya!

187
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,531
(Neji)
You're late, Lee.

188
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:09,000
We've been waiting
here forever.

189
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,536
(Lee)
Neji, Tenten,

190
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:13,538
Guy Sensei? What
are you doing here?

191
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:16,474
I told you before: my
dream is to see you grow

192
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,476
up to become a masterful,
full‐fledged adult ninja!

193
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:22,113
What kind of friends
would we be if we
just let you go it alone?

194
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,949
No matter where
we go, we're
always Team Guy.

195
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:31,089
You guys... fine
then... [weepy cry]

196
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,459
you are more than welcome
to come along with me
if you really want to!

197
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,397
Our battle has only
just begun! Onward!

198
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:42,233
Wait, why are we
cutting off the
second half here!?

199
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:20,577
(Narrator)
Spring is in full bloom
in the Hidden Leaf Village.

200
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:23,547
(Narrator)
But one person is in
a very somber mood.

201
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:27,384
Listen up, everyone.
I have an S‐rank
mission for your team.

202
00:13:27,384 --> 00:13:29,419
An S‐rank mission?

203
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:32,055
(Thinking)
S‐rank is the hardest

204
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:33,056
most dangerous class
of mission...

205
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:35,492
(Thinking)
What could it
possibly be?

206
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:37,060
The mission is...

207
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,297
...to prepare a
cherry blossom
viewing picnic.

208
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,798
[gasps]

209
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:45,402
Seriously? I mean, do
you really need us
for that kind of mission?

210
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:47,504
I'm certain something
of vital importance to

211
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:49,539
the village hangs in
the balance, here.

212
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:52,542
Hm. Very sharp
of you, Guy.

213
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:56,380
The true purpose of
this mission is...

214
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:58,081
...is what!?

215
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,817
To allow me to sit
and drink sake in peace!

216
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:02,652
Are you kidding me!?

217
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:05,055
(Thinking)
Even with all her respect for

218
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,057
Lady Tsunade, Tenten's bound
to be mad at this scenario.

219
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:09,960
Roger! You got it!
Team Guy will always

220
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,896
do anything you ask
of us Lady Tsunade!

221
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:14,297
‐Tenten!
‐Tenten!

222
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,573
"Our Final Mission
is S‐Ranked!"

223
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:27,811
All right! Is
everyone here?

224
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:29,880
Remember, Lee:
No mission should be
considered too trivial if you

225
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:33,050
treat it as training to become
a full‐fledged ninja!

226
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:35,552
Yes, Guy Sensei!
I will do my best!

227
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:38,488
First, I will hand
out lunches while
walking on my hands!

228
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:39,823
Completely
unnecessary!

229
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:42,959
Hey, check it out!
My lunch looks
like Bushy Brow!

230
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:44,461
He looks tasty!

231
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:45,762
(Choji)
Don't mind if
I do!

232
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:48,065
Argh! You went
straight for my
eyes!

233
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:49,132
[nom nom nom]

234
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,768
You don't care much
about presentation,
do you?

235
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:55,639
A special lunch for
me? It's gigantic!
No way I'll finish it!

236
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:57,407
I could! I'll trade
with you, if you like.

237
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:58,275
Eeek!

238
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:03,447
[groan]

239
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:06,049
That's just great!
What's wrong with you!?

240
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:07,517
Sorry about that...

241
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:09,619
The lunch boxs
are ruined!

242
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,221
(Neji)
Lady Tsunade...
I thought something

243
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:14,291
like this might happen,
so the Hyuga clan
prepared these...

244
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,459
Whoa! Look at that!

245
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:18,228
As you know, the
Hyugas are a clan
of means...

246
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,630
Something like this
is no trouble at all.

247
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:21,798
(Naruto)
The Hyugas are

248
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:24,768
pretty full of
themselves.

249
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:28,305
Ah! Finally
time for sake!

250
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:31,408
Lee, our training is
to catch these
falling blossoms!

251
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,742
You got it,
Guy Sensei!

252
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,744
Oops! Excuse me!

253
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:35,679
[glass smashing]

254
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:40,917
Oh no! I am so
sorry, Lady Tsunade!

255
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:44,254
Its fine... it's
no big deal, I've
got more.

256
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:46,389
(Guy)
Fine then. Let's
move over here, Lee.

257
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:47,124
[glass smashing]

258
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:49,192
(Lee)
Are you all right
Guy sensei?

259
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,128
(Guy)
Get the cloth! I
think I'm gonna...

260
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:52,129
Woooah!

261
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:56,199
Lady Tsunade!
Again, I
apologize! We‐‐

262
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:58,235
Every last bottle!?

263
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:00,637
(Neji)
Lady Tsunade...
I thought something like

264
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:04,641
that might happen, so the
Hyuga clan sent along this
bottle of "Chateau Chakra"

265
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:06,843
Talk about over‐
prepared, Neji!

266
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:09,112
The Hyuga are a clan
of means, remember?

267
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:11,748
Something like this
was also no trouble
at all.

268
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,450
(Naruto)
The Hyuga clan can

269
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,251
shove it where the
sun don't shine!

270
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:15,018
[sad whimper]

271
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:17,120
This!? This is‐‐

272
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,690
They ferment top‐quality
chakra for an extended
period of time...

273
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,526
...producing a smooth,
distinguished, delicious

274
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:24,528
flavor unlike anything
else!

275
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:26,863
...the legendary
"Chateau Chakra!"

276
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:28,698
(Tenten)
So, what it is?

277
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:31,868
I've always wanted to
try it, but to think

278
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,837
I'd finally have that
chance today...

279
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:37,474
Break this and I
will break you,
got it, dimwits!?

280
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:38,909
‐Y‐yes ma'am!
‐Y‐yes ma'am!

281
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,520
Lady Tsunade, I do hope
you enjoy your drinking,
but remember: be careful.

282
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,356
Don't forget that Lee's
mistaken sake for water

283
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:55,392
in the past, which
created tragic results.

284
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:59,963
He went on a drunken
rampage that completely
destroyed a restaurant.

285
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:01,965
That boy becomes a
demon when he drinks.

286
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:06,469
Huh. Well have no
fear. This is chakra,
it's non‐alcoholic.

287
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:08,271
Not even the PTA
crowd can complain

288
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:10,307
about us drinking
this one!

289
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:12,275
Excuse me, but,
what's a PTA?

290
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:13,977
Oh! Hey, Lee.
Come here!

291
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:16,513
You want a sip?
You should be able

292
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:18,515
to handle something
like this no problem!

293
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:21,518
[sniff sniff]
Ohh...

294
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:22,819
Huh??

295
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,688
What are you
looking at!?

296
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:25,789
What!?

297
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,991
Don't tell me he got
drunk off the fumes!

298
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:29,693
Come on! It's
not even sake!

299
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:32,028
Whoa, watch it,
Lee, take it easy.

300
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:33,930
Lady Tsunade!
Lee!

301
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,233
He's a master of
the drunken fist!

302
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,701
No!!!

303
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:40,370
He's gone completely
out of is mind! There's
no telling what he'll do!

304
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,571
[gasp]

305
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:44,874
(Tenten)
Sakura's in
danger!
[scream]

306
00:17:44,874 --> 00:17:47,711
[hiccup] Hey girl,
how you doin'?

307
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:50,013
He's hitting on her!
He's acting like
a horrible drunk!

308
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:51,715
Stop! Cut it out!

309
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:53,250
How about a
little kiss?

310
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:56,519
Lee! Come on! I
told you, knock
it off!

311
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,088
That's enough!!!

312
00:17:58,455 --> 00:17:59,322
Whaaaa?

313
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,424
Is that still
the drunken fist?

314
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:05,428
(Tenten)
Oh no! Now he's
after Hinata!

315
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,664
Lady Hinata!
I'll save you!

316
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:10,934
G‐gen‐ Gentle Fist

317
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:13,370
Twin Lion Fists!

318
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,838
And of course
it hits Neji!

319
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,509
The picnic's gonna
be completely ruined!
What do we do?

320
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:22,212
We'll have to join
forces to stop Lee!
Come on!

321
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,047
Fang Over Fang!

322
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,315
Rasengan!

323
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:27,217
Human Boulder!

324
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:29,352
There's no way
he can dodge that
three‐way attack!

325
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,892
No! They got sucked
into each other's
rotations!

326
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:39,562
Idiots! You're
nothing but idiots!

327
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:43,633
L‐Lady Tsunade?
Huh?

328
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:48,104
Ha! They look like
character lunches.

329
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,573
Lady Tsunade!

330
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:53,443
Move! I'll
handle this!

331
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:54,878
Guy Sensei!

332
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:58,348
Try this! Sixth Gate!
Gate of Joy! Open!

333
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:00,817
Asakujaku!

334
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:03,753
Guy Sensei!!!

335
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:06,389
Whoa! Now you're
starting to look
like Orochimaru!

336
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:07,324
[scream]

337
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:09,592
Why is the real
Orochimaru here!?

338
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:12,395
Lee, matching wits with
you time and again this

339
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:15,432
past year... it sure...
was fun...

340
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:17,567
He really likes
saying that, doesn't he?

341
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:23,006
[horrified gasps]
No! the cherry blossoms!

342
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:26,209
Enough! I've had it
with these shenanigans!

343
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:28,378
Summoning Jutsu!
Katsuyu!

344
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:29,879
Lady Tsunade?

345
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:31,247
Stop Lee!

346
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:32,215
Right!

347
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:37,153
Arghhhh!

348
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,154
(Katsuyu)
I've caught him!

349
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:39,489
Way to go!

350
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:42,992
Ew! There was no other
way to stop him!? That's
so disgustingly gross!

351
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:46,329
Well, that may be the
case, but either way,
Lee can't move now.

352
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:47,197
Huh?

353
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:50,066
(Tenten)
NO way! He's
absorbing Katsuyu!

354
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,335
[Katsuyu screams]

355
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:57,040
Where am I?
What is this place?

356
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,675
Wow. This is absurd.

357
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:01,211
At least now he
really can't move!

358
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:03,813
Pressure Point
Lightning Kick!

359
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:09,018
[gagging]

360
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:12,021
Katsuyus are flying out
of every orifice by the ton!

361
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:18,428
Well, it's finally
over, thank goodness!

362
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:22,632
Of course it
would get broken!

363
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,677
Lady Tsunade must be
furious, I can't look!

364
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:37,747
Lady Tsunade, why
are you helping?

365
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:39,416
Aren't you mad
at him?

366
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,518
Not at all. How
could I be?

367
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:43,853
I didn't want to have
this picnic just to

368
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:45,889
have an excuse to
drink, far from it!

369
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:48,925
I just wanted to spend some
time with the youngsters of

370
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:50,927
the Leaf before you all
finish growing up.

371
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:56,099
That's why, to me, this picnic
was every bit as important as
an S‐rank mission...

372
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,201
It's the reason I
wanted all of you
here!

373
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:01,371
A lot of things happened,
but I really enjoyed

374
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:04,407
myself today. I wouldn't
trade it for anything.

375
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:06,409
Lady Tsunade...

376
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:09,946
[groan] I am feeling
much better, thank you.

377
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:12,248
But... now...

378
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:15,251
After all the trouble
I have caused, all
the damage I have done...

379
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:17,720
The very least I
could do is clean
this mess up!

380
00:21:18,455 --> 00:21:20,557
Good idea, Lee!
I'll help too!

381
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:22,192
Count the rest
of us in as well!

382
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,526
Yeah!

383
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:25,295
Rasen Shuriken!

384
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:26,362
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

385
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:28,264
Butterfly Bomb!
Asakujaku!
Morning Chicken!

386
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:32,168
That's way overdoing it!
You cleared out the whole
forest!

387
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:35,772
You morons can't
do anything right!

388
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:37,507
I should've known
this would happen...

389
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:40,610
(Narrator)
Hey, everyone! Make sure

390
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,912
you behave yourselves at
your own picnics, okay?

391
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:50,954
I'm sorry. So
very sorry.

392
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:52,143
(Narrator)
The End.

393
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:29,252
(Yamato)
The next episode is: "Captain
Yamato and Graduation Day!"

394
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:31,688
(Yamato)
And, "Captain Yamato's
First Day of School!"

395
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:33,690
(Yamato)
I've spent so long not
speaking,

396
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,824
I've got a lot to
make up for!

397
00:23:34,824 --> 00:23:36,926
(Yamato)
These new stories will

398
00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:37,927
have your hair standing
on end!

399
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:39,295
(Lee)
Uh, Captain?

400
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:41,431
(Yamato)
Hidden Leaf Village,
prepare for Captain Yamato!

401
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:41,965
(Lee)
Captain!

402
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:42,832
(Yamato)
What!?

403
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:43,967
(Lee)
This is the last
episode!

404
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,378
(Yamato)
What!?
