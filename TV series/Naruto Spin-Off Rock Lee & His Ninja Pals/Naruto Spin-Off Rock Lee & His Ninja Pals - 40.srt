1
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,868
Happy New Year, everyone!
Out with the old, in with
the new! From Rock Lee and
all of us,

2
00:01:56,902 --> 00:01:59,087
We wish you another
great year!

3
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:08,120
<i>"A New Year's</i>
<i>Escape Clause."</i>

4
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:18,148
Now then, as we all now,
the best part of a kid's
New Year's celebration is
always the cash presents!

5
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:19,682
But what about
the adults?

6
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,082
[sigh]

7
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:22,715
What's the matter,
Lady Tsunade?

8
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:25,215
The year's off
to a bad start.

9
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:32,315
I had my traditional year-
end game night with friends.
The company was great, but
I lost. Big time.

10
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,948
Yes! I nailed it!

11
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:37,748
Naruto, Sakura, and
Kakashi. I have a full
Team Kakashi house!

12
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,148
Are you kidding?!
I'm doomed!

13
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:43,282
There's nothing left
in my wallet but some
lonely moths.

14
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:45,048
This happens to
you every year...

15
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:45,715
[gasp]

16
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,015
Hurry! Hide!

17
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:51,182
Yeah, so anyway, how
much did you get,
Bushy-Brow?

18
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:53,715
Actually, I am not
sure why, but...

19
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:57,415
Guy Sensei! I wanted
to wish you a Happy
New Year!

20
00:02:57,748 --> 00:03:02,315
<i>Oh! Sorry, kids! My son,</i>
<i>Guy, he, uh, he isn't home</i>
<i>right now!</i>

21
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,415
<i>I'm a bit too old and</i>
<i>sick to greet you outside!</i>

22
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:06,348
[laughing]

23
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:08,515
<i>You don't want</i>
<i>to catch this!</i>

24
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:11,182
So I have yet to
receive my present
this year.

25
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:16,182
Bushier-brow Sensei,
too? Kakashi Sensei and
the old man at Ichiraku
are also gone.

26
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:19,648
It seems a bit too
convenient to me that
all of them are busy
somewhere else!

27
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:23,415
You don't say? I'll
go one step further
and state they're
clearly avoiding us.

28
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:27,115
It's definitely too
quiet, considering the
usual New Year's
celebration.

29
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:31,382
<i>For now, we will just</i>
<i>have to keep our fingers</i>
<i>crossed that the adults</i>
<i>come back soon, and</i>

30
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:33,415
<i>that each one of them</i>
<i>has got our money.</i>

31
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:35,015
Argh! Those kids?!

32
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:38,248
Don't they realize their
Hokage's' constantly on the
brink of financial ruin?

33
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:43,015
You're blowing it out of
proportion. I wouldn't
call losing a few games
"financial ruin".

34
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:46,648
If I have to give them
cash presents, the
economy will completely
collapse!

35
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:50,382
Lady Tsunade, the only
thing collapsing around
here is your faulty logic.

36
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:52,648
And even if I were
to be honest about
it...

37
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:57,048
You can not get us
presents because you are
strapped for cash? What
a cop out!

38
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:59,215
Lame. Oldest excuse
in the book.

39
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:02,615
How shameful. You're
the Hokage. Get your
priorities straight!

40
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:06,482
I'm doomed! My
reputation as
Hokage is doomed!

41
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,082
<i>Excuse me,</i>
<i>Lady Tsunade?</i>

42
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,948
Oh no, it's Lee. He
and his buddies are
here to shake me down.

43
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:15,282
Shizune, quick! Make
something up! Get
them out of here!

44
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:16,648
Uh, seriously?

45
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:22,048
Good day to you!
And a Happy New
Year!

46
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:25,648
Oh! Thank you! A-And
the same to all of you!

47
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,715
Is Lady Tsunade
in, by any chance?

48
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:30,615
Uh, no! She's out
of the office, I'm
afraid!

49
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:32,215
Wow! Her, as well!

50
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:34,748
It's like the adults
vanished into thin air.

51
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:38,582
What a pity. And after
all the trouble we went
through planning the big
party.

52
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,415
Big Party?

53
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:44,248
Yes. We thought the
village was a bit too
quiet, you see, so we
wanted to throw a party

54
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:46,382
and get people in
the holiday spirit.

55
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:50,348
But we also knew a regular
old party wouldn't be enough
to get everyone to come!

56
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:56,182
<i>So as the main attraction,</i>
<i>we have created a little</i>
<i>something we like to call, the</i>
<i>Ultra-Serious Game of Life!</i>

57
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:59,482
Did he say the Ultra-
Serious Game of Life?

58
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:04,082
We wanted to get Lady
Tsunade's permission for
it, but if she's not here...

59
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,748
...Then I suppose we'll
just have to cancel it.

60
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:11,248
<i>I like the idea of a "Get</i>
<i>out of giving presents"</i>
<i>free card as a prize for</i>
<i>first place.</i>

61
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:14,748
That's a brilliant idea!
Everyone in the village
will be ecstatic!

62
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,282
She approves! It's so
obvious she just wants
the "Get out of presents
free" card!

63
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:21,048
Start setting things
up! I can't wait for
this shindig!

64
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:21,715
<i>Right!</i>

65
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:22,748
[chattering]

66
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:25,282
Are- Are you sure about
all of this, Lady Tsunade!

67
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:27,015
[laughing]

68
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:30,315
<i>Of course. Now I can</i>
<i>keep my cash without</i>
<i>tarnishing my reputation.</i>

69
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:33,182
Ooh, what a wonderful
idea. It's brilliant.

70
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,748
And what a wonderful
and brilliant attitude
you have.

71
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:39,148
That reminds me, everyone
else is hiding out and
laying low, right?

72
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:42,715
Yes, but once word gets
out about this party, who
knows how they'll react.

73
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:47,382
That's why you need to
play, too, Shizune. I
want you working behind
the scenes to help me out.

74
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:50,282
You do? Uh, okay.
If you insist...

75
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:51,615
And with that...

76
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:54,682
I'd say I have this
game in the bag!

77
00:05:57,448 --> 00:06:01,615
It's supposed to be a
big event, but will
anyone even show up
on New Year's Day?

78
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:11,282
<i>They did! All these pathetic</i>
<i>people were lured in just for</i>
<i>a chance at getting out of</i>

79
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:13,482
<i>giving presents!</i>
<i>What cheapskates!</i>

80
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:19,282
Welcome! It is now time
to begin the first annual
"Mega Ultra-Serious Game
of Life!"

81
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:24,415
We have got a wonderful
group of pure-hearted
adults competing today.
As a result, we have

82
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:27,715
modified the Game of Life
to be more contestant-age
appropriate.

83
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:32,548
Alongside me on color
commentary is Tenten
Straightman!

84
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:34,415
I'm not the straight
man, okay?!

85
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:38,915
Anyway, if you ask me,
this is going to be more
like a war, considering
the age of the competitors

86
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,748
and the contents of
the game today.

87
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:46,348
Nice, Lee! This was a
fantastic idea! I had
plans, but I couldn't
abandon my brilliant pupil!

88
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:50,282
<i>Yeah, right! What a</i>
<i>liar. All he cares about</i>
<i>is winning first place.</i>

89
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:56,115
Ah, so if we win, we
don't have to give the
kids presents? I had
no idea.

90
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,815
You're totally lying!
Don't try to fool us!

91
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:01,882
Damn it all! I didn't
expect them to show up!

92
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,715
Clearly not, it
would seem...

93
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:08,548
Ready, start!
First up is Teuchi!
He rolls the die!

94
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:14,115
Hnh?

95
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:17,682
Ayame? What're
you doing here?

96
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:21,315
Well, uh... There's
someone I want to
introduce you to, Dad.

97
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,182
It's a holiday! Who
could you possibly-

98
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:25,682
You wouldn't consider
it if it were any
other day!

99
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:30,615
Oh, foolish girl. You're
supposed to spend this day
with your family! I don't

100
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:33,315
wanna meet some guy I
don't know from a bum
on the street!

101
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:35,882
A bum on the street?

102
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:37,815
You jerk!

103
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:40,882
<i>Teuchi has a fight with</i>
<i>his daughter on New</i>
<i>Year's Day! He loses</i>
<i>a turn!</i>

104
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:44,248
Wait a minute! This
is what "Ultra-Serious
Game of Life" means?!

105
00:07:44,748 --> 00:07:47,215
Agh! Good! Now's
my chance!

106
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:53,782
Huh? What are you
guys doing here?

107
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:55,515
[laughing]

108
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:59,115
Listen, Kakashi Sensei, I'd
never have accomplished
as much as I have without
your help.

109
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:03,848
The New Year is a reminder
for us to take a moment to
tell you how grateful we are.

110
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,548
Y-You guys...

111
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:10,748
<i>Receive words of thanks</i>
<i>from your students. Nice</i>
<i>one! Roll again!</i>

112
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:12,315
Heh!

113
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:15,215
Sorry, Guy. I'm
leaving you behind.

114
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,015
Wha- Who're-

115
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:23,348
Mr. Kakashi, look! Why
don't you date this
girl? She's such a
lovely, nice, sweet lady!

116
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:26,282
I, um...
Sorry, ma'am.

117
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,848
Someone tell me why
I'm still doing this?!

118
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:33,182
Oh no! That classic scenario
where you are awkwardly
accosted by a nosy spinster

119
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:36,815
neighbor on the way
back to your house!
Kakashi loses a turn!

120
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,048
Since when is that
a classic scenario?

121
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:41,982
Finally, the time has
come! My turn!

122
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:48,215
What's my dream, you
ask? My dream is to turn
my student into a splendid
ninja... No more beer.

123
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:52,115
Guy Sensei drinks way too
much at a party with his
friends, passes out, does

124
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:55,015
not make it home for
New Year's Day, and
loses three turns.

125
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:56,182
That's gotta hurt!

126
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:59,782
Guy Sensei's whole
existence hurts! It's
just so painful!

127
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,148
My turn! I have to
win at all costs!

128
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:03,848
Oh!

129
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:07,215
Huh?

130
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:13,582
Maybe you're old enough
that you don't care about
marriage anymore, but your
mom's almost eighty.

131
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:15,948
Have you thought
about her?

132
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,348
Won't you at least think
about a woman's happiness
one more time? For your
family?

133
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:23,315
O-Okay...

134
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:29,715
<i>Oh, the pain of regret! Get</i>
<i>lectured by one's parents</i>
<i>on the meaning of happiness,</i>
<i>lose four turns!</i>

135
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:33,348
The themes in this game
are getting way too
heavy! Cut it out!

136
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:37,015
Dad, this is my boyfriend.
He doesn't have a job right
now...

137
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:40,148
...but he's aiming to
get into a visual kei
band! Isn't that cool!

138
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:45,015
Better for a man to chase
his dreams than to be bogged
down behind a desk. Am
I right, Dad?

139
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:48,615
Don't you dare call
me "Dad" you slacker!

140
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:51,082
My goodness! It is
pure carnage over here!

141
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:52,815
With that, you
lose five turns!

142
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:54,648
They're still on
that subject?!

143
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:59,682
Only Yamato has managed to
make it through the game
area unscathed. This will
be a sight!

144
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:04,115
After all this time, will
we finally hear his voice
in a victory interview?

145
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,382
<i>That's a sound,</i>
<i>not a sight!</i>

146
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:11,182
<i>Oh no! The powers that be</i>
<i>have decided Yamato will</i>
<i>have no speaking parts</i>
<i>for another year!</i>

147
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:14,282
<i>The shock is so great</i>
<i>he is eliminated outright!</i>

148
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:17,815
What is this?! It's not
even the Game of Life
anymore...

149
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:20,115
Just who will emerge
from the chaos?!

150
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:23,215
<i>Kakashi? Guy Sensei?</i>
<i>Teuchi, maybe?</i>

151
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:31,615
<i>Out in front, ignoring</i>
<i>the urgings of her parents</i>
<i>to marry despite her age,</i>
<i>it is Lady Tsunade!</i>

152
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,115
Stop it! We don't
need that kind of
analysis!

153
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:38,315
I don't care! Even if I'm
hurt, even if I'll never
find true happiness,

154
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:43,315
I will overcome the
challenge before me
right now! Bring it on!

155
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:47,882
<i>Put on expensive facial</i>
<i>products given to you by</i>
<i>an underling who went on</i>

156
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,748
<i>vacation! Advance</i>
<i>three spaces!</i>

157
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:57,015
<i>Get winning numbers from</i>
<i>an underling's New Year's</i>
<i>card! Advance three spaces!</i>

158
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:59,848
Go, Lady Tsunade!
You can do it!

159
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:02,115
<i>We believe in you,</i>
<i>Lady Tsunade!</i>

160
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,648
Almost there!

161
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,382
That's right...

162
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:11,948
I'd forgotten what wonderful
girls my subordinates are
So supportive and kind.

163
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:14,848
And here I am trying
to avoid giving them
gifts...

164
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:19,082
Still...I'm sorry,
everyone!

165
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:21,315
<i>Lady Tsunade closes</i>
<i>in on the goal!</i>

166
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:27,648
[gasp]

167
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:35,248
Come to realize how grateful
you are for the support of
your students and subordinates,

168
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:39,115
Trade places with the
person in last place?

169
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:45,315
Uhhh...

170
00:11:47,982 --> 00:11:50,015
<i>What?!</i>

171
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:59,215
<i>Shizune wins in spectacular</i>
<i>fashion! Her prize is the</i>
<i>coveted "Get out of giving</i>
<i>presents free" card!</i>

172
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:02,015
Sorry about that,
Lady Tsunade.

173
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:07,782
And so, the adults of the
Leaf Village learned that
there's just no getting out

174
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:10,048
of giving kids their
New Year's money.

175
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:27,423
As the New Year commences, we
resolve to better ourselves,
and in doing so, feel better
about ourselves.

176
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,356
[screaming]

177
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,289
I will take Sakura on
a date to Shinobiland!

178
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:31,789
Huh?

179
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:35,756
I will take Sakura on
a date to Shinobiland!

180
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:36,789
[screaming]

181
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,123
That's enough!

182
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:44,056
It's a new year. Stop
fighting already! We're
supposed to be getting
a fresh start on things!

183
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,789
Fish for sea beam on the
channel with Naruto.

184
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:51,723
Even so, someone still
looks rather uneasy.

185
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:01,689
<i>"Naruto Under Surveillance!"</i>

186
00:13:06,323 --> 00:13:07,289
Hmm...

187
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,756
Looking at Lady
Hinata's behavior...

188
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:16,289
It's clear that even in
this year of new beginnings,
she's got Naruto on her mind.

189
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:21,623
Naruto's a good guy.
There's no denying his
ability and perseverance.

190
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:26,323
And he's certainly got
guts. But there are still
some things I can't overlook!

191
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:30,823
Like, he isn't even a
chunnin yet! Plus, he's
a terminal klutz.

192
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:36,423
And on top of that is the
biggest problem of all!
Naruto's publicly declared
that he likes Sakura!

193
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,223
I really like you!

194
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:43,523
If somehow, against all
odds, Lady Hinata were
to start going out with
Naruto...

195
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,423
...If things went well
for them, he would
become Naruto Hyuga.

196
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:53,589
As the future head of the
Hyuga clan, Hinata couldn't
possibly change her name
to-

197
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:55,123
Stop that!

198
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:59,756
No love, no money, no
prestige, and above
all, klutzy! Never!

199
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:05,589
No matter how nice of a
guy he is, I couldn't leave
the Hyuga Clan in his hands
like that! Or can I?

200
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:07,389
It hurts to even
consider...

201
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:09,789
What's wrong?
Why the serious
face?

202
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:12,556
Ah, Miss Ayame from
Ichiraku Ramen...

203
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:15,156
You don't already
have problems this
year...

204
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,423
Well, no. It's not a
problem yet, anyway.

205
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:21,289
Oh, yes! In the
Game of Life...

206
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:24,489
Dad, this is my boyfriend.
He doesn't have a job right
now...

207
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:27,856
...But he's aiming to
get into a visual kei
band! Isn't that cool!

208
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:32,623
Better for a man to chase
his dreams than be bogged
down behind a desk. Am I
right, Dad?

209
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:35,123
Let me ask her.

210
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:36,823
So, uh...

211
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:39,756
Let's say that you
had someone you
wanted to marry...

212
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:42,356
Huh? Where'd that
come from?

213
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:47,489
And let's say your Dad
objected outright. Just like
in the Game of Life! What
would you feel.

214
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:49,756
Furious. I'd
loathe him forever!

215
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,456
Hey! What's the matter?

216
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:54,456
Nothing. Just felt
like I got pierced
by an arrow.

217
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:57,256
Wait. Hold on
a second!

218
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,323
Does that mean when I
stepped in thinking I
was in the right...

219
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:04,189
I'm furious. I'd
loathe you forever.

220
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:06,156
That was how she felt?!

221
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:08,089
[screaming]

222
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:13,489
What are some things he
would have to do to make
you not loathe him? What
steps could he take?

223
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:16,089
I'm talking about Mr.
Teuchi, of course.

224
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,723
Hm... Well, that's easy,
actually. Just have faith
in me, and accept whoever

225
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:23,289
I had feelings for
that I ended up
bringing home.

226
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:29,489
But what if the person
you chose was lacking
in certain areas?
Important areas?

227
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:32,589
One shouldn't be
so judge-y. Nobody's
perfect, right?

228
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:35,723
And besides, everybody's
got their good points,
don't they?

229
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:39,823
If he manages to find
those good points and
accept him, then everyone
will be happy!

230
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,823
Find the good points
and then accept them.

231
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:48,156
Cawppy New Year!
Cawppy New Year!

232
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:52,423
I think we should kick off
the new year with some team-
building sports! Everyone
up for some badminton?

233
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:53,489
Yeah!

234
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:56,156
Excuse me, Sakura. Will
you be my badminton
partner?

235
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,523
Back off, Bushy-Brow!
Sakura only needs one
badminton partner, and
that's me!

236
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:00,389
[growling]

237
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,789
Yeah, I think I'll
sit this one out.

238
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:07,089
Fine. Then I guess I'm
stuck with Neji or Tenten.

239
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:08,823
What do you mean
"stuck", you jerk?!

240
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,223
Hmm, who should I
play with then?

241
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:12,789
Um...I...

242
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:18,123
Well, I uh.. I..
just... N-Naruto.

243
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:19,456
Hold it, Naruto!

244
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:22,623
You will be my
badminton partner!

245
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:24,456
Neji? Why Naruto?

246
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:26,689
Yeah, what gives?
Why you being so
pushy?

247
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:30,489
It doesn't matter what
gives. You're playing
with me and that's
final!

248
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,323
Fine, fine, whatever
you say! Just drop
that stance already!

249
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:42,823
If I partner with
Naruto...

250
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:45,656
Hey! Are you okay, Neji?

251
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:47,156
Sorry...

252
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:52,123
Then maybe I can
find some of his
good qualities.

253
00:16:52,856 --> 00:16:54,656
Naruto! Neji!
Here it comes!

254
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,189
Whoa!

255
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:02,556
Keep at it, Naruto!
You can do it!

256
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:07,656
Hmm, I can see how
Naruto can be appealing
in situations like this
one...

257
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,323
It's like how the fast
kids are always the
popular ones in grade
school.

258
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:13,756
[cheering]

259
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:18,189
But fast or not, he's
no lightning bolt,
and never will be.

260
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:24,556
And speed's not enough
to convince me to leave
the Hyuga estate in his
care.

261
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,523
Uh?!

262
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:31,356
Well, good morning to
you, Neji! Now that
you're awake, maybe
you can cover me!

263
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:35,756
Don't cop an attitude with
me, you little jerk! If this
guy marries Lady Hinata...

264
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:40,856
<i>What the heck?! I told</i>
<i>you to wake me up if</i>
<i>I slept in!</i>

265
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,189
I forgot! I'm so
sorry, dear...

266
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,289
That little hothead
would start bullying
her for sure!

267
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:55,589
No matter how much she
may loathe me for it,
I'm going to have to
object to their marriage.

268
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:56,356
Huh?!

269
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:59,823
What's your problem?!
Do you even want to
play or what?!

270
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:01,356
[screaming]

271
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:05,189
Cool your jets,
Naruto. It's just
badminton, after all.

272
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:09,389
Yes, that's right. It's
just badminton. I can't
actually gauge Naruto's

273
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,589
good qualities with
such a simple game.

274
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:14,456
Yeah, Naruto.
Play nice, okay?

275
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:17,723
<i>Play nice?</i>
<i>Play rice...</i>

276
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:19,223
<i>That's it!</i>

277
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:20,823
Mochi!

278
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:21,756
Huh?

279
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:26,489
I don't get it. Why
are we making mochi
now?

280
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:32,289
You just cannot get any more
traditional than mochi. This
will really make it feel like
the New Year has begun!

281
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:34,723
Yeah, that's an
excellent point!
Good idea!

282
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:37,323
Naruto, I was
wondering if
you'd be-

283
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:38,489
Wanna be my partner?

284
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:40,289
Seriously, why do
you keep picking me?

285
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:41,656
<i>Making mochi.</i>

286
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:43,579
<i>This should give me</i>
<i>a chance to find his</i>
<i>good points.</i>

287
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,923
Hey, Neji. You okay?

288
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:48,989
Sure am! I'm ready
when you are.

289
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:51,289
[grunting]

290
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,489
[screaming]

291
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,956
What are you doing?!
Get in sync with me,
Neji!

292
00:18:56,556 --> 00:19:01,789
Get in sync with you?!
Of all the nerve. If he
started dating Lady
Hinata...

293
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:09,523
Oh, no! Hold on.
Wait, Naruto!

294
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:12,789
You slowpoke. Stop
dawdling and keep up.

295
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:17,823
He'll turn his back on
her! He'll leave her
behind! Perhaps I really
should object, even if

296
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,523
she loathes me for
it?! Decisions...

297
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:23,323
You move too fast,
Naruto. Take it easy!

298
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:25,923
It takes two to get
in sync, you know.

299
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,423
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>It takes two...</i>

300
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:29,356
<i>Yes...</i>

301
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:30,356
That's it!

302
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:31,089
Huh?!

303
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:36,156
Why're we having
another New Year's
party?

304
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:39,823
To make it feel even
more like the beginning
of a New Year has truly
begun!

305
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:42,323
Yep, sounds good
to me. Let's have
fun!

306
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:43,156
Hm?

307
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:47,256
Excuse me, Naruto. Would
you like a drink? It's
really delicious.

308
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:49,956
Naruto, old buddy!
Why don't you help
me entertain?!

309
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,256
Again, why me? Why
does it have to be me?!

310
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:58,189
If the two of us can
work together like this,
I'm sure I'll find some
good points to-

311
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:01,023
[groaning]

312
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,856
Knock it off already!

313
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:03,923
What now?!

314
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:06,523
Every step of the way,
it's just like I thought.

315
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:09,889
I won't accept anything
more than a platonic
friendship!

316
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:12,489
Seriously, what is
your problem today,
Neji?

317
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:16,356
Everything we've done so
far has been your idea.
Why do you keep getting
mad?

318
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:19,089
Did he say platonic
friendship?

319
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,889
<i>Wait...</i>
<i>Does Neji...</i>

320
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,156
I just don't get it!

321
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:28,956
What if- What if the
daughter's boyfriend
doesn't have a single

322
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:31,089
redeeming quality?!
What then?!

323
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:34,023
Not one? Well, maybe
not to a father...

324
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:35,723
[gasp]

325
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,989
But if I truly loved
him, then I wouldn't
give up. I'd train
my man to do better

326
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:40,123
until my dad eventually
accepted him.

327
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,123
Train him to...
Do better...

328
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:46,423
Naruto!

329
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:50,356
<i>N-Neji? What's with</i>
<i>the girly outfit?</i>

330
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:52,523
Look, I don't like it
anymore than you do...

331
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:57,856
But I must! Not only for
Lady Hinata, but for the
entire the Hyuga clan!

332
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:58,556
Sic 'em!

333
00:20:58,589 --> 00:20:59,456
[growing]

334
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:02,456
What the-?! Hey,
wait! Hold on a
second!

335
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:05,289
Follow me, Naruto.
I'll whip you into
shape!

336
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:07,189
Whhaaaaat?!

337
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:09,023
<i>You fool!</i>

338
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:13,056
You say, "Good Morning,
honey! I love you!"
every time you wake up!

339
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:16,189
Remember to always
hold hands in a crowd!

340
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:19,323
And what kind of person
are you if you don't
pick up the tab?!

341
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:21,289
It's just common sense!

342
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:25,289
Don't' you faint on me.
We're not done here!

343
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:26,889
Please, stop this!

344
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:29,123
Lady Hinata?

345
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,789
Neji, I'm sorry.
I never knew.

346
00:21:34,256 --> 00:21:38,256
Never knew what?
Listen, Lady Hinata!
This is all for-

347
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:39,156
I know.

348
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:45,356
You care for him! You
did all this just to
get closer to Naruto,
didn't you?!

349
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:48,856
Huh?

350
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:54,123
I understand why you
couldn't tell me, but
I'll show you. I'll get
closer to him than you

351
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:57,989
could ever dream of!
I won't back down,
you'll see!

352
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:00,489
<i>Whaaaa?!</i>

353
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:05,056
And so, Neji learned early
in the year that it's not
a good idea to stick his

354
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:07,389
nose into other people's
love lives.

355
00:23:48,371 --> 00:23:52,412
<i>The next episode is "An</i>
<i>Endless Nightmare" and</i>
<i>"A Robot from the Future!"</i>

356
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:54,671
Listen, Neji. I've
come to a conclusion.

357
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:56,171
<i>What is it,</i>
<i>Lady Hinata?</i>

358
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:59,771
You and I should compete
fair and square for Naruto's
favor. Shall we agree to

359
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:02,571
refrain from any backstabbing
or underhanded tactics?

360
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:04,604
<i>No, really, you've</i>
<i>got it all wrong. I-</i>

361
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:09,804
Please, hurry! I need you
to sign this contract before
I start hating your guts!
Quickly, quickly, sign it!

362
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:14,138
<i>Ah! All right! Talk</i>
<i>about an endless</i>
<i>nightmare...</i>
