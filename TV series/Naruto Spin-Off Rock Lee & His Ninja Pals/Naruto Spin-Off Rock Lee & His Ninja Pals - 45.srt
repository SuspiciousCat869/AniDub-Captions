(Shizune)
Lady Tsunade...
Please! You must
snap out of it!

4
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,922
Something the matter?

5
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:03,955
Take a look!

6
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:05,155
Guuuh!!

7

00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:08,455
What is it that
ails you, M'lady!?

9
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:11,155
This miserable weather.

10
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:12,922
It happens
every winter!

11
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:18,588
Day after day, being
cooped up inside, with
nothing to think about
except how broke I am...

12
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:22,322
...and how I've done
nothing with my life
but collect gambling
debts...

13
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:25,155
...and how long it
is 'til payday.

14
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:28,888
...I tell you, it
makes my heart
very cold and heavy.

15
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:32,922
As our Hokage, your
mood directly affects
the morale of the
village!

16
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:38,855
We can do noting about the
weather or your gambling
debts, however we'll soon
find a way to warm your heart!

17
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:40,388
Yeah... good luck
that that...

"A Fiery Snow-Sculpting Contest"

21
00:02:57,488 --> 00:03:01,455
Lady Tsunade herself will
be choosing the winner,
so give it all you've got!

22
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:07,055
Let's see which one of
you can make a snow
sculpture that will warm
our beloved Hokage's heart!

23
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:10,322
Yeah yeah, okay,
your beloved Hokage
is freezing her
beloved buns off!

24
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:12,488
So come on! Let's
get on with it!

<i>at her cold indifference!</i>
<i>Nothing we do can fix that!</i>

27
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:24,255
Yeah, that look she just
gave us lowered the
temperature ten degrees!

28
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,288
Trying to warm her
heart is going to be
an impossible mission.

29
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:30,222
Mission!? What mission!?
This isn't even a mission!

30
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:34,455
Well! It would appear you
all need some motivation!

31
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:39,422
Then I will have to come up
with a prize for the winner
that will really light a
fire under your posteriors!

32
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:42,888
Like what? A half-
price coupon for a
bowl-cut?

33
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,222
Even better!

34
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:48,955
Whoever makes the best
ice sculpture will win...

35
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:50,455
...a kiss...

36
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:54,455
Huh?

37
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:58,455
Exactly! The winner of the
contest will earn the right
to give a big kiss to whoever
he or she has a crush on!

38
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:04,155
Yes, for one lucky shinobi,
Valentines Day is going to
come a little early this year!
And if that doesn't li
ght a--

39
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:06,622
That's ridiculous!
Nobody's gonna--

40
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:10,855
I will win this contest
and earn the right to
kiss Sakura, even at
the cost of my life!

41
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:14,388
Sorry, Bushy Brow!
But if anyone's
kissing Sakura, I am!

42
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,855
That really worked
on you guys? I
don't believe it!!

43
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,288
I've got to win to
make sure neither
thing happens!

44
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:22,555
To kiss Naruto...
[sigh]

45
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,322
Don't even think
of it, Hinata!

46
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:27,522
Alright! Who's
ready to bring it
on and win it all?

47
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:28,555
Meee!

48
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,155
No!

49
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,922
And who wants
to win that kiss!?

50
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,022
Meeee!

51
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:35,188
Nooo!

52
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:37,888
So let the
battle begin!

53
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,322
Wow! They're already
going at it!

54
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:44,288
So, this is where
I belong. Right
here with these
guys... huh.

55
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:46,888
[groan]

56
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:49,622
For some reason, it
feels colder here
than out there...
[nervous laugh]

57
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:53,055
With their hearts and minds
a frenzy of emotions, the
competitors go at it!

58
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,855
Each trying to
out-do the other!

59
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,122
Huh?

60
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:57,788
[smooching sounds]

61
00:04:57,822 --> 00:05:00,022
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>What in the world</i>
<i>are Lee and Naruto</i>
<i>doing?</i>

62
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:02,422
Obviously they're
practicing their
kissing!

63
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:04,255
How gross it that!?

64
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:08,022
That's right! Use
that youthful passion!

65
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:09,855
Not in a million years!

66
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:13,855
<i>(Sakura)</i>
<i>No way I'm gonna</i>
<i>let one of them win!</i>

67
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:15,755
All done!

68
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:21,222
My sculpture is called,
"You guys are out of your
minds if you think I'm
going to let you kiss me!"

69
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,155
Sakura's sculpture
gives me shivers!

70
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:28,422
You can almost feel the
rage inside of her building
to one of her trademark
monster punches!

71
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:30,388
What do you think,
Lady Tsunade?

72
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:34,188
That's just what she
wants to happen...

73
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,055
[gasp]

74
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:41,055
A fine effort and a bold
artistic statement, but
I'm afraid it didn't
resonate with Lady Tsunade,

75
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:42,555
SO YOU LOSE!

76
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:44,088
AhhhH!

77
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:47,622
Finished! I call it...
Summertime!

78
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:51,622
Doesn't it make you think
of sun and sweat, and the
sun pouring down on your head?

79
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,422
Wow, it's straightforward.

80
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:55,288
Lady Tsunade?

81
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,388
He's just begging
for attention...

82
00:05:58,422 --> 00:05:59,455
[gasp]

83
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:02,588
Reminding her of
heat just amplified
the cold.

84
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:04,055
YOU LOSE TOO.

85
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:05,455
Guhh, rats!

86
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:07,888
[groan]

87
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:10,988
Wait! Don't give
up hope yet! It
looks like Hinata's
finished...

88
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:13,022
What could it
be, I wonder...

89
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:21,955
Well I feel that if you really
want to touch a person &amp; warm
their heart, the first thing you
do is try to understand them.

90
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:23,522
That's deep.

91
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:26,222
Huh. She's got
a point...

92
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:29,422
Whatever, I think we all
know who this is going
to be a sculpture of..

<i>to know you!</i>

[embarrassed squeal]

99
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:55,888
What the--!? I
thought for sure
you'd make a
statue of Naruto!

100
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:59,088
Oh I couldn't
possibly..!

101
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:05,588
But this old man
reminds me of a special
day, and the way Naruto
looked standing there...

102
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:07,222
That doesn't even
make sense!!

103
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:09,288
[whimper]

104
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:12,488
A good concept spoiled
in the execution by
your terminal shyness...

105
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:14,588
ANOTHER LOSER!

106
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:16,855
But I'll always
have the memories...

107
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:22,955
Enough of this! I'm colder
than ever! In fact, I'm
starting to lose the feeling
in my toes!

108
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:24,522
Wait M'lady! We
are not done..!

109
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:27,255
Yeah! You haven't
seen our sculptures
yet!

110
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:35,322
Okay, I really don't see
the point in continuing
this any longer...

111
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,188
But.. M'lady!

112
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:39,522
Alright! This
contest is over!

113
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:40,855
-No way!!!
-No way!!!

114
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:42,255
Are you giving up!?

115
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:44,455
What else can we
do, Guy Sensei?

117

I feel sorry for
Lady Tsunade...

118
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:51,555
She's reaping what
she has sown...

119
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:54,855
A shinobi gains wisdom
from the mistakes he
has made...

120
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:58,388
Is there nothing you
can learn from your
failure and the others?

121
00:07:58,422 --> 00:07:59,122
Let me see...

122
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,922
I'll try...

123
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:03,288
That's just what she
wants to happen...

124

heart, the first thing you must
do is try to understand them.

126
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:13,855
Huh. She's got
a point...

127
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,322
Hang on!
I've got it!

128
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:16,422
Naruto..?

129

He looks so pale...

138
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:40,388
Actually, that's pretty
much how Sai always looks.

Please! You have
to save him!

else I can turn to,
NOBODY!

Please! You gotta
save him! I'm

Very well..
I'll do everything
I can !

Bravo!

146
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:02,755
Wait, what's
going on?

147
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:06,388
Behold! The powerful
urge to heal a
patient in need!

148

Naruto's
long relationship

paying off!

He knows just how
to push her medical
jutsu buttons!

150
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:16,955
Is this still part of
the snow sculpture
contest..?

151
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:20,255
So that is his
game! Well two
can play at
that, Naruto!

152
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:23,955
Narubei, is Saijirou
going to be all right?

153
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:25,188
And you are?

154
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:27,188
And old friend of
the family's...

155
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:30,388
I have a little
medical training
myself...

156
00:09:30,422 --> 00:09:31,855
...let me
assist you...

157
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:35,355
Dear me! This
is awful!

158
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:37,088
-Why!? What is it!?
-Why!? What is it!?

159
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:40,088
This calls for a
very difficult
operation...

160
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,888
But it must be
done, or he will
not last the night.

161
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:44,322
Oh no! Nooo!

162
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:47,422
If we succeed, he will
make a full recovery...

163
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:50,255
But the odds are
fifty-fifty, at best.

164
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:53,022
The.. odds!?

165
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:55,222
That is right. This
operation is a gamble.

166
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:58,355
And I hear you are
not very lucky when
it comes to gambling.

167
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:00,022
That's not true!!

168
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:03,522
I always beat the
odds when lives are
at stake!

169
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:05,055
That'shis angle..!

170
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:07,188
Okay, I'll bite.
What's his angle?

171
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:09,888
A frontal attack on
her greatest weakness!

172
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:14,288
As soon as he said
what the odds were,
he ignited the gambling
demon that lies within!

173
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:20,888
What a clever move!
Lee knows Lady Tsunade
can never resist a bet.
Talk about pushing buttons!

174
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:23,988
So, we're just forgetting
all about the snow sculpting?

Heh heh! Nice one.

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,822
And fast! We've gotta think
of a way to get the topic back
on chocolate before Kakashi
Sensei gets here!

288
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:28,256
I'm hungry. Is
anybody else hungry?

289
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:30,322
[gasps]
Of course!!

290
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:31,556
[drooling]

291
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,389
(Thinking)
Only Choji could
get away with a
move like that!

292
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:38,722
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Yeah, when your stomach's</i>
<i>a bottomless pit like his,</i>
<i>you can always act hungry!</i>

293
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:42,189
<i>...without arousing</i>
<i>suspicion, no matter</i>
<i>how big a breakfast</i>
<i>you've had...</i>

294
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:44,056
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Could that be his</i>
<i>strategy..?</i>

295
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:46,722
You girls have
any snacks on you?

296
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:48,889
Sure! You want
some chocolate?

297
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:51,822
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>So simple, and yet,</i>
<i>so brilliant!</i>

298
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:54,389
[chomp]

299
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:59,789
(Thinking)
Genius move, Choji!
I'm starting to see
you in a whole new light!

300
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,222
[grunt]

301
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:03,289
-Go, Choji, go!
-Go, Choji, go!
-Go, Choji, go!

302
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:11,122
Anyone mind if I
eat lunch early?
[nom nom nom]

303
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,456
[screaming]

304
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:16,789
We'll just exchange
friendship chocolate!

305
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:20,289
Noooooooo!
I give up!

306
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:23,222
This beating around
the bush is getting
us nowhere!

307
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:26,222
If only we could just
come out and say the
word "chocolate"..!

308
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:30,889
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>I wish someone would say it!</i>
<i>I've been so looking forward</i>
<i>to Valentine's Day...</i>

309
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:33,322
<i>...but it's hard</i>
<i>to break the ice!</i>

310
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:35,356
<i>...if only someone</i>
<i>would just ask...</i>

311
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:40,989
Chocolate? Why, yes!
I have some right here!

312
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:44,856
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Then I could give my</i>
<i>chocolate away without</i>
<i>seeming pushy!</i>

313
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:49,122
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Wait... I wonder</i>
<i>if Hinata...</i>

314
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:55,356
<i>Yes..! I suspect she is</i>
<i>dying to give away her</i>
<i>chocolate, but she is held</i>
<i>back by that absurd shyness!</i>

315
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:59,189
<i>If I can get past that,</i>
<i>she could be the thin</i>
<i>edge of the wedge!</i>

316
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,922
<i>And if Hinata falls,</i>
<i>the rest will follow,</i>
<i>like dominos..!</i>

317
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:06,089
<i>I just need to</i>
<i>create the right</i>
<i>opportunity..!</i>

318
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:08,322
LIsten, everyone!

319
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:12,722
Instead of juts standing around
doing nothing, why don't we use
this time to stimulate a
dangerous mission scenario!?

320
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:18,289
Like... for example,
being lost in the
mountains in a blizzard!

321
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,956
Look! Is that a
cabin over there?

322
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:25,689
[groan]

323
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:27,789
Oh, Lee! Are
you alright?

324
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:31,756
Yes, but alas, I lost
the backpack with our
supplies!

325
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:34,822
We will have to break
into the emergency rations!

326
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:37,356
Yes, we will! I'll
pass them out.

327
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:38,922
Here's your
emergency ration.

328
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,356
Huh? What on
earth is that?

329
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,156
A jawbreaker!

330
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:44,922
[screaming]

331
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:47,322
What are you
thinking?!

332
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:53,856
Maintaining our stamina in high-
altitude, sub-zero temperatures
will require us to eat something
far more substantial than that!

333
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:54,889
Are you mad?!

334
00:19:56,356 --> 00:20:00,989
Excuse me, but I believe
jawbreakers are the
standard emergency ration.

335
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,122
What's the big
idea, Neji!?

336
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:04,956
Who's side is
he on!?

337
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:06,889
He betrayed us!

338
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:12,122
I want chocolate as much
as anyone! But I happen to
know that Hinata made those
with her own hands!

339
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:14,256
<i>She put her heart</i>
<i>and soul into them!</i>

340
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,756
Kinda looks like
rabbit poop.

341
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,889
I'm afraid you'll say
something stupid like
that and break her heart!

342
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:23,922
I will protect my cousin
form harm, no matter what!

343
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,756
(Thinking)
I don't understand
what's going on, Neji!

344
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:28,222
Don't stand in
our way..!

345
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:30,389
<i>We will take</i>
<i>them by force!</i>

346
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:32,089
<i>Just try it...!</i>

347
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:34,889
What tasty treat
starts with the
letter "c"?

348
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:36,456
Cantaloupe!

349
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:38,022
What is brown
and sweet?

350
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:39,289
Coffee with sugar!

351
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,856
[panting]

352
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:44,089
What did the Aztecs
think their gods ate?

353
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:46,122
Ooooof!

354
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:48,056
I don't speak Aztec.

355
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:52,156
his defenses are
unstoppable!

356
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:54,222
[groan] We must
keep trying!

357
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:57,922
What do you drink...
piping hot with marsh-
mellows in it?

358
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,089
You are choc full
of stupid!

359
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:02,456

Yes! Victory!

366
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:24,056
We did it! We
finally got someone
to say the word!

367
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:31,822
It wasn't easy! We stumbled, we
made mistakes, we got knocked
down, we were betrayed, but we
hung in there and we did it!

368
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,889
Try not to get
too emotional...
we still have not--
