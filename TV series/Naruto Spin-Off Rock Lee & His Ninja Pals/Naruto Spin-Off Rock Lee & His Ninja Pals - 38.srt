1
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:56,225
<i>In a rather stunning</i>
<i>development, today's</i>
<i>episode features an</i>

2
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:58,425
<i>appearance by that</i>
<i>organization!</i>

3
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,458
For this mission, we must
all exercise an extreme
level of caution.

4
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:06,158
This added attention is
due to the fact that
we've been assigned

5
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,558
to locate the
Akatsuki's hideout.

6
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:09,858
And who would they be?

7
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:13,725
I've heard that name
being tossed around quite
a bit lately.

8
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,658
They're dangerous.
Every member of that
organization is a

9
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:18,458
powerful S-ranked
criminal.

10
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:23,725
If left to their own
devices, they could pose
a huge threat to the Leaf
and all we represent.

11
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:25,658
You're saying they're
set up somewhere around
here?

12
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:31,192
I understand. I will hunt
down this evil organization
and give them a beating of
a lifetime!

13
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:33,125
Imbecile!

14
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:35,558
Looks like Lee was given
a beating first!

15
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:40,358
Each member of this
organization is
abnormally powerful. Any
individual attempt to

16
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:44,792
take them on is out of
the question. We are to
observe and report,
nothing more.

17
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:45,558
Yes, sir!

18
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:48,558
You have your orders.
scatter!

19
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,625
<i>Infiltrate Akatsuki's</i>
<i>Hideout!</i>

20
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:06,492
Apparently, these people
move around a lot... so
no matter how reliable
the intel gathered was, I

21
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:08,192
doubt that we'll be able
to find very much.

22
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:11,458
No. We will find them if
we look hard enough.

23
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,792
Byakugan!

24
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,192
That's not looking.
You're just making a
scary face.

25
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,292
I found it!

26
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:18,192
Huh?!

27
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,358
Over that way!

28
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:20,825
What way?

29
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:31,258
Oh, come on. A cave? You
gotta be kidding me. This
is such a cliche.

30
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,392
Huh.

31
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,725
What do you think this
is?

32
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:38,192
Huh? It looks like a
cloak.

33
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:41,625
It looks familiar.

34
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:43,158
Uh oh, Tenten.

35
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:43,792
Huh?

36
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,658
I have stumbled upon a
closet back here.

37
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,225
Look at all the spares!

38
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,358
Hold on, you don't
think that--

39
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:58,525
There is no doubt in my
mind. These people are
indeed--

40
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:01,158
[chatting]

41
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:03,558
Isn't this cloak
absolutely the cutest?

42
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:05,758
Sure is. I definitely
want one!

43
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,625
Me, too! Let's
all get one!

44
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:09,292
Sounds good!

45
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:11,392
--a group of
exceptionally
close friends!

46
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,758
That's not what I was
leading to at all!

47
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:18,758
Anyway, I've got a bad
feeling about this. Come
on. Let's get outta
here, okay?

48
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,658
<i>I know. And I'm saying</i>
<i>you're wrong!</i>

49
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:21,858
Huh?!

50
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,758
AGH! The second I
mentioned it, someone
showed up!

51
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:25,858
Just a minute, Tenten.
Calm down.

52
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,158
But we've gotta hide!
We're gonna get caught!

53
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:29,725
Hey, do not
worry.

54
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:31,625
Just let me handle this!

55
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:37,458
I'm not kidding. You
really have no idea what
true art is, Sasori, my man.

56
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:41,625
And you call those little
explosions of your art,
Deidara? Get real.

57
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:43,725
Absolutely. Hm?

58
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:50,225
[grunting]

59
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:54,758
<i>This is ridiculous!</i>
<i>Forget about hiding!</i>
<i>We're standing directly</i>
<i>in their path!</i>

60
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:55,825
I was just uh--

61
00:04:55,858 --> 00:04:57,425
Hey! I know you!

62
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,525
Huh?

63
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:09,692
Wait a minute... I've
seen this guy before!

64
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:12,258
What in the world is he
doing here?

65
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,858
That's the kid that foiled
my attempts to get into the
leaf village.

66
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:17,492
What's he doing here?

67
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:21,858
What a nice surprise! To
think that we would meet
again way out here!

68
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:23,358
Who's he?

69
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,558
[laughing]
Come here a sec.

70
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,392
Huh? Oookay.

71
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:30,192
<i>My shameful failure at</i>
<i>the hands of this kid and</i>

72
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:34,458
<i>his friends is a</i>
<i>disgraceful black</i>
<i>eye on my record.</i>

73
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:36,525
<i>I bribed Tobi so he'd</i>
<i>keep quiet,</i>

74
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:39,625
<i>but who knows what</i>
<i>everyone would say if</i>
<i>they found out about it.</i>

75
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:43,325
<i>Just being around him is</i>
<i>throwing me completely</i>
<i>off my game.</i>

76
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:46,558
<i>I'll throw him out</i>
<i>and everything will</i>
<i>be fine. Hmmph.</i>

77
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:49,225
What is it then, Mr.
Artist?

78
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:50,858
[gasping]

79
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,258
<i>That's right. He</i>
<i>thinks I'm an artist</i>
<i>or something. Okay, then!</i>

80
00:05:54,825 --> 00:06:00,158
To be completely honest,
you've found the main
office of the Ninja
Comedy Club I work at.

81
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,692
It's kind of like a
Ninja Laugh--

82
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:02,525
<i>[bird cawing]</i>
<i>Idiot!</i>

83
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:08,625
That's a completely
different universe! Wait,
so does that mean he's
a comedian or something?

84
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:11,258
<i>We sacrifice our lives</i>
<i>for our jokes</i>

85
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:17,592
<i>And so with an iron-clad</i>
<i>resolve, we spend our</i>
<i>days secretly honing and</i>
<i>mastering our material.</i>

86
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,525
<i>If the others find out</i>
<i>that a regular person</i>
<i>snuck in... well...</i>

87
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:23,725
Well, what?

88
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,358
Worst case, they
treat you as a spy who's
come to steal our material.

89
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:31,425
After that, they'd
force you to become
one of our Roadies.

90
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,825
And possibly remain one
for the rest of your
life.

91
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:36,692
No, please, anything but
that!

92
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:40,658
He's obviously making
all this up, so he's
definitely hiding
something.

93
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:45,125
I wonder what. Wait,
who cares? We just wanna
get out of here!

94
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:46,625
With that in mind, I'd
suggest that you-

95
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:50,425
I see! I bet you're
that new guy Zetsu's
been out scouting,
aren't you?

96
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,225
What? No, you must
be mistaken.

97
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:55,192
Come on, he's gotta be.
He's wearing our cloak
and everything.

98
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:57,358
Seriously? That
doesn't prove anything.

99
00:06:57,392 --> 00:07:00,458
Here's a test: What
does the word "art"
mean to you, newbie?

100
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:06,125
Give it up, my man. Art
is transient beauty that
lasts for but a mere
moment before vanishing.

101
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,792
In other words, art is an
explosion.

102
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,492
You're wrong.

103
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:16,258
Art is something that can
endure through the ages
and stand strong against
the test of time.

104
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,658
Eternal beauty is
what real art truly is.

105
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:22,192
Am I wrong?

106
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,292
His head did a 360!

107
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:30,392
You are. Art is silky
black hair and
spectacularly majestic
eyebrows stuffed into a

108
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:33,158
flattering set of
full-body tights.

109
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:34,858
Yeah, I don't
think so.

110
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:36,292
Heeargh!

111
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:39,225
[screaming]

112
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:42,858
What do we do? These guys
are definitely bad news!

113
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:47,592
This is no time to be
playing around. We've
got important matters
to discuss.

114
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,558
Art is all a
waste of time.

115
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:50,825
Hm?

116
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:54,458
There's no money in it,
so what's the point?
Right, Hidan?

117
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:57,558
What are you asking me
about it for, Kakuzu?

118
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:00,292
That's just great!
There's two more of
them!

119
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:04,125
<i>They just had to show up</i>
<i>now, didn't they?</i>

120
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,492
Who's this guy?

121
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,192
Oh, uh, he's--

122
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:09,592
He's the new
guy, right?

123
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,858
My man!

124
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,592
Ah. Well, I'm this
organizations treasurer.

125
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,425
Money is the only
thing you can count
on in this world.

126
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:22,758
I don't think I've
ever seen your face
before in the Bingo Book.

127
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:25,858
But if you've got a
large bounty on your
head, I warn you:

128
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:28,358
you'd better not
turn your back on me.

129
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:34,192
Oh man, this guy has...
ridiculously long armpit
hair!

130
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:37,225
It's not armpit hair,
you nincompoop!

131
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:41,792
<i>Does it really matter what</i>
<i>he's got? You've got bigger</i>
<i>problems, here.</i>

132
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:44,692
You're a riot, newbie.
Niiice ooone.

133
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,858
[gasping]

134
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,458
Hey, why don't you
follow the way of Jashin
like I do?

135
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:52,192
Faith is more important
than any worldly possessions,
if you ask me.

136
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:57,325
You are all very
unique...

137
00:08:57,358 --> 00:08:59,692
Honestly, he's the
most unique of us all.

138
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:02,892
And on top of that,
his wretched rituals
take forever!

139
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:06,425
Watch your tongue! You
stitched-up blasphemer,
you!

140
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:11,892
[gasping]
That is how
you pray?!

141
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:14,892
That's no prayer!
He's stabbing pressure
points!

142
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:18,625
When you break through
the pain, it turns into
ecstasy...

143
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,558
[drooling]
Oh, god... so good.

144
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,692
This guy is totally
freaking me out!

145
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:27,125
I will have to try that
method for myself.

146
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,225
Here.

147
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:35,592
Oh yeah, that
is the spot.

148
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,558
Come on! You just wanted
to make that weird face!

149
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:43,592
Don't forget what's
at stake, okay? You need
to get out of here before
the wrong person comes.

150
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,758
<i>What a ruckus.</i>

151
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,325
[gasping]

152
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:49,825
It would seem that
we're running a little
bit late for something,
Kisame.

153
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:54,158
That may be true,
but remember... it's
unhealthy to be in a
rush, Itachi.

154
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,892
They had to show up
the second I said it.

155
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,125
<i>It looks like another</i>
<i>pair has arrived.</i>

156
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:02,592
Hey, Lee, I know this
one. I've seen him in the
Bingo Book.

157
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,425
Huh?

158
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:10,825
Itachi Uchiha. That's
Sasuke's big brother.
The one who abandoned
the village.

159
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:15,692
He and his partner fought
Guy Sensei. They're
Akatsuki members!

160
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:18,892
[gasping] Why would that
guy be at a Comedy arts
school?

161
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:21,892
It's all a lie, you
idiot! He made it up!

162
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:26,325
I knew something was off.
There's no doubt about
it now! This is the
Akatsuki's hideout!

163
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:30,192
[nervous trembling]

164
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:32,358
<i>It is the</i>
<i>whaaaaaat?!</i>

165
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:49,794
<i>A Desperate Escape Plan!</i>

166
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:59,094
So-So what you are
telling me is that we are
completely surrounded by
members of the Akatsuki?!

167
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:00,894
Including you, Mr.
Artist?!

168
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,761
Whoa! Settle down!

169
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:07,194
What's wrong with you?!
Are you nuts?! Don't be
so obvious! He's gonna-

170
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:08,728
<i>Hey!</i>

171
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:11,228
What are you two
whispering about over
there?

172
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:13,128
Are you the new member?

173
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:17,228
The jig is up! We're
totally doomed! You look
just like Guy Sensei!

174
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,961
Do not worry! I just got
a brilliant idea.

175
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:23,961
What the heck?

176
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:26,661
You're just making a
weird face!

177
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:31,394
You remind me of a
bizarre beast I once
fought against.

178
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:34,194
I knew it! You didn't
fool him at all!

179
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,261
You know, there's
something fishy
about him.

180
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:37,828
[gasping]

181
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:42,728
<i>What an idiot! Even so, I</i>
<i>can't cover for him too</i>
<i>recklessly.</i>

182
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:47,761
Very well, then. I will
judge just how capable
you are. Prepare for the
initiation.

183
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:48,728
[groaning]

184
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,694
[struggling]

185
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:03,794
Oh, no! I have been
caught in a Sharingan
genjutsu. What now?

186
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:06,761
Idiot, idiot, idiot,
idiot.

187
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:12,828
If you wish to join our
organization, then you
should be able to resist
a genjutsu of this level.

188
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:16,061
Give me a break!
Those crows are
way too loud!

189
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:23,828
He's trapped in some
sort of illusion. I've
gotta slap him with some
chakra to release it.

190
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:28,994
<i>Thanks, Tenten. The</i>
<i>illusion has been broken.</i>

191
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:32,261
You broke my hold on you.
Impressive.

192
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:36,828
Forget me. What about all
that crow poop?! You are
covered in it!

193
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:37,694
Ah--

194
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:40,428
Looks like he survived so
far... Good.

195
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:41,861
Okay, newbie! Now I--

196
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,861
<i>I see everyone's here.</i>

197
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,228
Our Leader!

198
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,061
Did he say leader?!

199
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:52,628
Holy crap! You mean the
top dog is here?!

200
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:56,661
Tell me, Konan.
Where's Zetsu?

201
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:58,928
He said that he would be
late, Pain.

202
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:01,828
[grunting]

203
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:02,928
Who's he?

204
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:05,094
He's the new guy,
apparently.

205
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:06,961
A new member, huh?

206
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:14,894
<i>[panicking]</i>

207
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:22,828
Konan's too smart. She
won't be fooled.

208
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:29,061
[grunting]

209
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:35,294
[flinching]

210
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:37,128
What?

211
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:39,061
I welcome you.

212
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:42,694
What the-?! Sh-she is so
hard to read.

213
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:46,794
<i>Whatever. It's not like</i>
<i>I consider you a real</i>
<i>member or anything.</i>

214
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:48,294
Did I really just hear
that?

215
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,028
All that for some
flowers? This is so
awkward.

216
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:53,928
That was exciting, in
more ways than one.

217
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:54,761
Hey.

218
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:56,228
Oh, now what?!

219
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:10,894
My name is Pain.
I am God.

220
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:13,394
Huh--

221
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:16,228
I don't think you
can call yourself God
after a pratfall like
that.

222
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:20,328
Did you see that, Kakuzu?
Total dirt-eating
face-plant!

223
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,094
[grunting]

224
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,061
[grunting]

225
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,794
Oh, yeah?! Almighty Push!

226
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:24,828
[screaming]

227
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:27,894
Now you will know pain.

228
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:30,161
<i>Their leader's a real</i>
<i>jerk-face.</i>

229
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:35,328
By the way, Leader, may I
ask why you called all of
us to this meeting?

230
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:38,228
We're going to be
moving forward in
great earnest.

231
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:41,094
But before that, we
need to make some
preparations.

232
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:44,261
The preparations for my
ceremony are already
complete.

233
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:46,694
Another Almighty Push!

234
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:50,928
But first, we have
business. Hey, Newbie.

235
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:53,128
I wish to see your
abilities for myself.

236
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:55,094
[panicking]

237
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,361
He switched topics again!

238
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:01,161
I agree. We need a
good understanding of how
to use him in battle.

239
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:03,828
And now to pick...
his opponent.

240
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:06,128
Only one way
out of this.

241
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:08,194
Pick me! Let me fight
him!

242
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:12,161
Hm? Very well, then.

243
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:18,761
First we were not able to
sneak out, and now we are
locked in a one-on-one
fight!

244
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,228
<i>We're dead. This</i>
<i>can't possibly get any</i>
<i>worse!</i>

245
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:22,994
Psst! Hey!

246
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:24,728
Huh?!

247
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:27,194
Listen, get ready to make
your escape.

248
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,861
What?!

249
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:33,128
I'll make a smokescreen
with my bombs to blind
them. When they blow, you
run for it!

250
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:34,361
Mr. Artist, I--

251
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:36,628
Let's do this!

252
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:38,994
<i>Hold on! Not so</i>
<i>fast, you two!</i>

253
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:43,294
What the-?! Who's
this weirdo?!

254
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:45,428
And what's with that
ridiculous getup?

255
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:48,828
Allow me to explain
myself...

256
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,728
They're late. If they
missed the rendezvous,
they must have--

257
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:55,128
--been so motivated,
they explored further
than we agreed on!

258
00:15:55,161 --> 00:16:00,361
No, it's been too long.
Byakugan. Wait a minute!

259
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:04,928
What the heck is this?

260
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:08,394
They're all the same
cloak!

261
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:11,094
Oh, no! That's not
good!

262
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,928
Those guys
surrounding Lee...

263
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,128
... are all members
of the Akatsuki!

264
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:18,028
What?! In that case,
we've gotta call for
backup.

265
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,894
We can't! There's no time!
If we don't hurry, they'll
get hurt or something worse!

266
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:27,028
What's he hiding under
that cloak? No, Tenten!

267
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:31,161
This is bad. But it's
just the two of us. How
can we--

268
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:34,194
[chuckling]
Just leave
everything to me.

269
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,328
<i>Uh, why am I hiding</i>
<i>under the cloak again?</i>

270
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:43,694
As I'm sure you're
aware, the enemy knows
my face. The more I can
change my appearance, the

271
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:46,761
better chance we have of
tricking them. Clever,
huh?

272
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:48,994
So I'm just part of
your disguise?!

273
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:49,894
Let's go!

274
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,128
[grunting]

275
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:55,728
I feel like I've seen
him somewhere before.

276
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,661
Crap! They're on to us!

277
00:16:57,694 --> 00:17:00,828
That cloak would mean-
You're a new member,
too?

278
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:04,861
I am, indeed. Let me show
you what I'm capable
of, Leader!

279
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:08,694
Hoachaaa!

280
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,328
[struggling]

281
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:13,928
I knew that you would
come, Guy Sensei.

282
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:18,061
For sure. But we don't
stand a chance against
all of these guys at
once.

283
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:19,994
We've gotta find a way
to escape.

284
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:21,194
What is the plan?

285
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:24,028
Force our way through
with guts!

286
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:26,694
So what you're saying
is there is no plan!

287
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:30,728
They already know about
my super moves, so I'll
have to hide them.

288
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:31,894
Okay then!

289
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:35,028
Different Kujaku!

290
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:37,161
Different Chicken!

291
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:43,061
Saying "different" doesn't
hid them, they're the
exact same moves!

292
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:45,794
There's something fishy
about him, as well.

293
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:49,194
Looks like that's his
comrade.

294
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:50,628
[groaning]

295
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,994
Now's my chance!

296
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:53,861
Ah!

297
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:55,728
Hm?

298
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,361
Now you've gone and
done it!

299
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:02,328
Sorry, my man, it was an
accident!

300
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:08,461
No, it's fine. We'll
settle once and for all
whose art is superior!

301
00:18:08,494 --> 00:18:09,761
[grunting]

302
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:13,028
Hey, what happened here?
How'd my chakra threads
get snagged?

303
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:15,328
You idiot! What's your
problem?

304
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,694
That hurt! What is wrong
with you? Explain
yourself, now!

305
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:19,828
Are you insane?

306
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:20,928
[gasping]

307
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:24,128
Let me return the favor.
Tentacle Punch!

308
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:26,761
[struggling]

309
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:27,761
[grunting]

310
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:28,761
Uh, my bad.

311
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,028
Why you little---

312
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:34,228
I- I know pain.

313
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:36,194
Whoa! Stop this, now!

314
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:40,694
Hey, look! They're
distracted. Let's move!

315
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,261
I do not think this is
gonna turn out well.

316
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:45,628
Have it your way. Let's
rock 'n' roll!

317
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,128
You're on.

318
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:48,394
Dear me...

319
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,361
I have to stop these
guys.

320
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:54,328
It appears as though
everything's ready.

321
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,028
Aahhhhhhhhhh...

322
00:18:58,128 --> 00:18:59,194
Know Pain.

323
00:19:00,894 --> 00:19:03,361
That's a lot of chakra
they're building up
over there!

324
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:06,028
C-3!

325
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:08,894
Iron Sand Unleash!

326
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:12,861
Earth Grudge Fear:
Synchronized Arson!

327
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,394
Amaterasu.

328
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:19,861
My turn. Water Style:
Shark Bomb!

329
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,294
Sacred Paper Emissary
Jutsu!

330
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:27,794
Almighty Push!

331
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:32,128
Oh yeah... that's
the spot.

332
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:33,928
What is that weirdo doing
over there?!

333
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:36,128
This is no time for
stupid jokes! Run for it!

334
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:38,128
[fleeing]

335
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:56,828
[laughing]

336
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:08,361
[groaning] I should have
known. Nothing good ever
comes out of an encounter
with him.

337
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:13,094
But at least the Akatsuki
will continue to be
ignorant.

338
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,228
<i>Wow, what a mess. What</i>
<i>happened here?</i>

339
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:20,028
This is where the
hideout was, wasn't it?

340
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:21,961
What in the world?

341
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:27,928
I'll tell you what
happened. That new guy
you sent to us was
nothing but trouble!

342
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:32,161
New guy? I have no
idea what you're
talking about.

343
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:36,094
You photosynthetic
peabrain! It was some
thick-browed juice bag
with a bowl cut!

344
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:45,194
Thick-browed juice bag?
Bowl cut? Oh, I bet it
was the guy Deidara ran
into! Back when he tried

345
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:46,361
to infiltrate the Leaf
Village!

346
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:47,394
[grunting]

347
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:49,261
Hold on, what
did you say?

348
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:52,328
Oh, I'm not really at
liberty to say.

349
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:57,094
Deidara paid me to keep quiet
about it, so I shouldn't--

350
00:20:57,128 --> 00:21:00,328
Tobi! Zip it! Now!

351
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,028
I wasn't sure what was
going to happen there!

352
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:09,261
Still, we managed to
escape in all of the
confusion.

353
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:12,894
But with their hideout
destroyed, they don't
have a base of operations.

354
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:16,994
The Akatsuki will
be on the move again
as soon as the remaining
members return.

355
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:21,961
I am sorry. If I had just
kept my mind on the
mission, none of this
would have happened.

356
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:27,261
Don't worry about it. We
tangled with the Akatsuki
and came out alive. Even
in danger, we kept our

357
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:28,228
heads about us.

358
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:32,928
If you ask me, I'd say
that's a huge success.

359
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:34,961
Thank you, Guy Sensei!

360
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,428
Ohhh, Lee!

361
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,694
[crying]

362
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:43,861
<i>Somehow, some way, Lee</i>
<i>and his pals survived</i>
<i>their encounter with the</i>
<i>Akatsuki. But is this</i>

363
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:46,228
<i>merely the prologue</i>
<i>to a bigger battle?</i>

364
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:53,128
Wow... I can't believe
that Artist you knew was
in the Akatsuki.

365
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:55,694
I will not lose to them
next time.

366
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,328
No matter how peculiar
the people in the
Akatsuki are,

367
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:00,761
I will fight them
off by being even
more so!

368
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:03,128
There's no need for all
that. I think you're
fine.

369
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:06,728
Idiot! Idiot!

370
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:51,972
On The next episode:
"Christmas is the Last
Chance for Love!" and

371
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:54,905
"Cleanup is a Chance to
Wash Away the Past"!

372
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:59,672
<i>Cleaning, huh? Are you</i>
<i>going to make us clean</i>
<i>the toilet again? I'd</i>
<i>prefer not to.</i>

373
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,672
Yeah, no thanks.
Deidara's the one who
embarrassed us, so he
should have to do it.

374
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:07,539
Come on! Let's go tell
him the good news,
Kakuzu!

375
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:08,839
<i>Wait!</i>

376
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:09,739
Huh?

377
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:11,139
<i>There's no toilet to</i>
<i>clean.</i>

378
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:15,005
<i>Oh, right. We</i>
<i>need to build a</i>
<i>new hideout first.</i>
