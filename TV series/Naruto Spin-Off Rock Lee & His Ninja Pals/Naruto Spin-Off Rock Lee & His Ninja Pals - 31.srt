1
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:58,583
The colors of fall are now
at their most vibrant. That
means it's the perfect time
to relax at the hot springs!

2
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:01,150
[grunting]

3
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,550
It's useless! I can't
find a spring anywhere!

4
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,883
Wait, are you trying to
dig your own hot spring,
Orochimaru?

5
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:14,750
That's right! I've been
running myself ragged
digging around for one
all week,

6
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:16,850
but I still haven't
found one anywhere!

7
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:18,750
[chuckling]

8
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:22,316
Well, that settles it.
I'll just have to...

9
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,050
[laughing]

10
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,716
<i>"Nothing Beats</i>
<i>Mixed Bathing!"</i>

11
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:37,316
[sigh]

12
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,383
<i>I'm pooped.</i>

13
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,316
That mission was brutal.
I'm pretty worn out, too.

14
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,650
Less talking,
more sleeping.

15
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:45,383
I wouldn't mind a
bit of rest, myself.

16
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:50,683
This is no time to be
taking it easy! We must
hurry home and start
training feverishly so

17
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:52,683
that we will be ready
for the next mission!

18
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:56,583
Not this time. Don't
forget, warriors need
their rest, too!

19
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:58,050
Guy Sensei?

20
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,016
It's come to my attention
that a brand new hot spring
has just opened up.

21
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,150
Conveniently enough, it's
just outside of the Leaf
Village.

22
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:09,116
I think you should all
go check it out. Your next
mission is: "Give your body
a nice long rest!"

23
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:14,283
<i>And that's how Rock Lee</i>
<i>and his ninja pals found</i>
<i>themselves in front of the</i>

24
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:16,983
<i>newly-opened "Orochi</i>
<i>Hot Springs."</i>

25
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,783
Look at that!

26
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,783
It says that all the baths
here are from 100% natural
spring waters!

27
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:25,283
<i>Hm? "Orochi" Hot Springs?</i>

28
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:27,650
Oh, come on.
Not him again.

29
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,316
Yes! Him again! Who
else would it be?

30
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,350
[laughing]

31
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:35,283
Look at them. Those
fools don't suspect
a thing.

32
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:38,016
Are you kidding?
It's exactly the
opposite!

33
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,583
Lord Orochimaru
you've made them
more suspicious
then ever!

34
00:03:41,616 --> 00:03:44,116
Why did you have
to name this place
the "Orochi Hot
Springs?!"

35
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,783
It couldn't be
more obvious!

36
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:48,116
This must be one of
Orochimaru's traps!

37
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,750
I bet he's planning to
get us to relax, then
attack while our guard
is down!

38
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,550
What?! Curses!

39
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,816
Hold on a second.

40
00:03:56,616 --> 00:04:00,583
I welcome you, one and
all to the Okuchichi
Hot Springs!

41
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,050
Did you say "Okuchichi"?

42
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,150
Yes.

43
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:06,750
This isn't a "ro,"
it's the kanji that
reads "kuchi".

44
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,583
That's why were called the
"Okuchichi Hot Springs!"

45
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:11,716
[giggling]

46
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,250
That's way too far-
fetched. They'll never
believe it.

47
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:17,116
I see it now! It's
read as "Okuchichi."

48
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,816
What?! That's nuts!

49
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,150
Well, think about it.
If this was one of
Orochimaru's tricks,
he wouldn't be so

50
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:25,950
incredibly dense as to
actually use his own
name!

51
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,150
That makes sense!
He's dumb, but he's
not that dumb!

52
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:34,250
I have to agree! He may
be a failure, but it is
not like he is a complete
blundering idiot!

53
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:34,750
Right?

54
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:37,616
You'll pay for that!

55
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:41,850
Come now! Go relax and
enjoy our beautiful
outdoor bath!

56
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:46,816
Whoa! It is a-

57
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:49,850
It's a mixed
gender bath!

58
00:04:49,883 --> 00:04:51,983
What?! Seriously?!

59
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,116
As I'm sure you've gathered,
a mixed gender bath is set
up where the men and women
don't have separate bathing

60
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,316
areas. Instead, they bathe
and enjoy the water together.

61
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,183
Ahhh! M-M-M-M-M-M-
Mixed gender?!

62
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:05,750
A mixed gender
bath with Sakura?!

63
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:07,716
Sakura and I in
the same hot spring?!

64
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,816
[laughing]

65
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:12,950
What should we do?
Take turns bathing
or something?

66
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:16,283
We could, but there's
not much time left before
dinner, so...

67
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,916
I know! The Transformation
Jutsu will solve this!

68
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,883
Naruto!

69
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,916
On it! Check
this out!

70
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:25,950
Neji!

71
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:26,850
Hey, what do you
think you're-!

72
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:29,183
And finally me!

73
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:34,150
See? Look! We are all
girls! We can go in
the bath together!

74
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:35,416
Uhh, I don't
think so.

75
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,016
You know, in a weird
way, he might actually
be on to something.

76
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,916
Huh?

77
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,083
What if you and I
use the technique,
too?

78
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:44,583
[gasp]

79
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:47,216
Oh, I see! Nice!
Good thinking!

80
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,250
[sigh]

81
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,616
They had to put towels
on? It figures. I
shouldn't have gotten
my hopes up.

82
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,783
This plain setting is
far too dull for my
tastes. We should
have flowers.

83
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:06,616
But these outfits should
brighten up the shot.

84
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,050
They had to put on swan
tutus before we were
allowed to film.

85
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,350
If that's your idea
of a flower, I'm
outta here!

86
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:21,183
What if they wore those
swan tutus while washing
each other's backs at
the same time?

87
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,850
Wash, wash!

88
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,216
Rub, rub!

89
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:29,583
I'm not sure what I'm
supposed to be seeing
here. Who on earth does
this appeal to?

90
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:33,883
That was a relaxing
bath, was it not?

91
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,650
Man! You said it! And
the foods great here,
too!

92
00:06:36,683 --> 00:06:38,950
Plenty more where that
came from, so eat up!

93
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:43,216
And as your stomach's
take in this feast,
feast your eyes on the
dinnertime show!

94
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:47,983
How humiliating!
Why me?!

95
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:51,983
For some reason, I feel
a strong connection with
that dancing girl.

96
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:56,283
You look perplexed,
Neji. Has the dancing
girl managed to capture
your heart?

97
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,183
What?! No! Don't
be ridiculous!

98
00:06:58,216 --> 00:07:00,516
Oooh! He wants to
give her kissy kissy!

99
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:01,550
[chuckling]

100
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,183
I think the time
has finally come!

101
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,816
Oh? The time for what
has come exactly?

102
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,283
Wait a minute!
Is it time for
more food?!

103
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:09,450
Wrong! Neither!

104
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,883
The time has finally
come to punish you
pesky little brats!

105
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,016
Fooled you,
didn't I?!

106
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,116
Orochimaru?!

107
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,016
I knew it!

108
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,616
It's too late! You've
fallen into my trap!

109
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,050
You're all too relaxed
and loosened up being
at my luxurious resort!

110
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,183
That's what you
think! You're mine!

111
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:26,550
Rasengan!

112
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,616
[gasp]

113
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,983
[chuckling]

114
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,916
I see that my relaxing
hot springs really helped
your chakra unwind.

115
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,783
Chakra can't
unwind like that!

116
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:34,816
Byakugan!

117
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:37,950
No good. I can't
see what kind of
soup it is.

118
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,716
The soup's not
important!

119
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:44,283
He's right. The hot
springs relaxed our
chakra so much, we
can't use our jutsu!

120
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:47,683
Huh. I guess chakra
can relax. Who knew?

121
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:51,816
You're finished! You
think you stand a chance
against me without your
jutsu?

122
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,750
Ha! This hot spring
will serve as your
grave!

123
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:58,816
Since I have never had
my own ninjutsu, I can
still fight with tai-
jutsu!

124
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,583
Lee!

125
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:04,083
Do not worry, Tenten.
I have a secret fighting
style that is a perfect
fit for hot springs!

126
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:06,883
Karaoke-Fu!

127
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:08,716
What the-?

128
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,616
I think ping-pong
is more "hot springy",
personally.

129
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,816
Interesting challenge.
Yes! I'll play along
with it!

130
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:20,016
Looks like they're
out for blood.

131
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,283
Which one of them
do you think is
going to sing first?

132
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:24,050
And what song?

133
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:30,150
My selection will be,
the theme song to that
other famous ninja anime:
Play "Courage 200%"!

134
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:31,750
They're actually
gonna sing!

135
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:34,216
I foresee a 200%
chance of death.

136
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,783
What's gotten into you?!
Have you no pride as a
Leaf Village Ninja, Lee?!

137
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,783
But singing what he
wants is a small
victory! Go!

138
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:45,850
Hmph! Bringing out the
big guns already, huh?
No matter. It's nothing
compared to my selection

139
00:08:45,883 --> 00:08:48,016
of a song from that
famous idol group!

140
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,850
Heavy Boa-tation!

141
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:54,983
Lord Orochimaru, you're
risking defeat and a
lawsuit! Your voice will
tarnish the image of those

142
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:56,516
poor girls and their
music forever!

143
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,916
Wait just a minute!
Are you sure about
all this? If you sing
while on the air

144
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,616
without licensing
the songs first...

145
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,116
I am ready when
you are!

146
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,850
I'm going to
enjoy this!

147
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,216
[gasp]

148
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,216
Suddenly, the karaoke
machine mysteriously
exploded.

149
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,683
You see? Fate's
telling you not
to sing!

150
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:16,583
There are mysterious
forces far more powerful
than our own at work here!

151
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:20,816
It would appear that we
need to pick an alternate
way to fight that is still
theme appropriate.

152
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:25,950
I would have preferred
avoiding doing something
like this on a kid's show,
but here we are.

153
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,116
No way! You're
breaking the rules!

154
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,216
Baseball Fist!

155
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,316
Don't do it! Think
about it! Primetime
isn't ready for
something like that!

156
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,283
Stopping now is
not an option!

157
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,616
Orochi High vs. Leaf
Academy. It's 0-0, bottom
of the ninth, two outs,
and the bases are loaded.

158
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,216
Orochi High could end
the whole thing right
here.

159
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,616
Big brother...

160
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:51,050
The count's 0-2,
Will the next pitch
be the last?!

161
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:56,016
I have to win this game!
I have to win it for my
dear, beloved sick sister!

162
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,816
You have my empathy,
but regardless of your
circumstances. I will
not hold back!

163
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:09,683
At the mound, Rock
Lee winds up for
the pitch.

164
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:12,716
And throws!

165
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,683
No matter what it takes,
I will win this! For her!

166
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,850
And he's hit
by the pitch!

167
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,683
[screaming]

168
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,016
Yes! I won! I am
unstoppable!

169
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,850
What? No! That's not
how the game works, you
idiot! The bases were
loaded!

170
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,350
They scored!
My team won!

171
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:39,016
You cannot possibly be
serious! That was only
the outcome of the ball
game!

172
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,916
The real battle between
you and me is about
breaking the rules!

173
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,050
What the heck?!
You lousy cheater!

174
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,283
[laughing]

175
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:48,583
That does it!

176
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:50,516
Summoning Jutsu!

177
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:57,150
What now? Has this
turned into a giant
monster battle?

178
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:58,983
Orochimaru,
you coward!

179
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:03,116
Hnnh! I'll crush the
life out of you for
sure this time, Rock
Lee!

180
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,883
<i>Freeze.</i>

181
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,516
Who are you two?
What do you want?

182
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,683
From the cheapest day
spa to the most well
hidden gems throughout
the land...

183
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:15,750
We fight to protect the
healing waters and relaxing
atmosphere of all hot springs!

184
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:19,016
The hot spring inspectors:
The Spa Rangers!

185
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:23,950
The minerals in your
water...They were added
and not naturally occurring!

186
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,283
You're coming
with us!

187
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:25,950
Move it!

188
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:28,016
Huh? Hey, wait
just a second!

189
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,816
Justice is served.
Hi-ho Silver!

190
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:33,950
I won't forget this!
You're gonna pay!

191
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:35,916
Lord Orochimaru!

192
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:41,650
And that was that.
Orochimaru may have
won the battle, but
he lost the war.

193
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,250
Oh boy...

194
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:56,307
Today, Orochimaru is busy
plotting a way to defeat
our Rock Lee...

195
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,741
You don't say...

196
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:03,374
Take a look at this. I've
created a most dastardly
"Rock Lee Hotel", to trap

197
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,807
that eyebrowed eyesore
once and for all!

198
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:06,807
[chuckling]

199
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:08,807
Now what should
I use as bait?

200
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:12,774
A stamp card for a
curry restaurant that
needs just one more
free meal?

201
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:15,207
Or maybe an all-you-
can-drink on your
birthday coupon?

202
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:17,707
Oh, the very evil
things I come up
with!

203
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:18,707
[gasp]

204
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:22,641
You've got to be kidding
me! My own birthday was
the middle of last week

205
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:25,141
and I completely
forgot about it!

206
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:35,474
<i>"October 27th was</i>
<i>Orochimaru's Birthday!"</i>

207
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:36,407
[sigh]

208
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:39,407
Another year goes
by, another year
older...

209
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:44,407
My youth is over. I'm
aging. My skin isn't as
firm and radiant as it
once was.

210
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:48,841
Wait a minute! That's
not the real tragedy
here! The real tragedy
is that not one single,

211
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:52,474
solitary soul remembered
my birthday! How could
they?!

212
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,574
How could they, I say?!

213
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,207
Lord Orochimaru!
What's going on?!

214
00:12:57,241 --> 00:13:01,541
Kabuto! You callous
fiend! You've forgotten
something very, very
important!

215
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:04,741
Something of great
significance happened
last week! What was it?!

216
00:13:04,774 --> 00:13:06,641
I did? Great
significance...

217
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:11,541
Oh, that's right! Last
week was the premiere of
the first episode of "Make-
Our Fall in Love Picking

218
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:16,241
Chestnuts on Mount
Sarukani" and I forgot
to set my DVR! I need to
see if there's an encore!

219
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:17,374
Ahhh...

220
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:22,407
No, you twit! What happened
can't be compared to some
romantic rubbish on television.

221
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:29,441
Manda! I know you remember
what happened last week,
right? Something of absolute

222
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:32,207
and high-level importance
that starts with a "B"?

223
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,607
[hissing]

224
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:37,807
B Vitamins.

225
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:40,174
Not even close!

226
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:43,707
Hey, B vitamins are
important to a healthy
lifestyle.

227
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:48,174
I'm not talking about
health! This is ridiculous!
How could you be this far
off?!

228
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:51,307
Something that starts
with a "b" that's much
more important than
vitamins!

229
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:53,707
Bulbs? Bulbs
are important!

230
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:58,207
If you're going to bring
up lighting, at least use
LEDs! They use much less

231
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,307
electricity and they're
better for the environment!

232
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:05,407
It was my birthday
you idiots! It-Was-
My-Birth-Day!

233
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:08,207
Oh, is that right?

234
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:12,407
Ahh, wait a minute.
I'll make Lee suffer
the same anguish.

235
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:18,141
Let's see. Lee's birthday
is coming up soon. If I'm
not mistaken, it's November
27th.

236
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:25,207
He too, will suffer the
loneliness, the misery,
the agony, oh the anguish
of having his birthday

237
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,407
forgotten by every last
single one of his little
ninja pals!

238
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:30,541
[laughing]

239
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:41,507
Whoa! What in the
world are you wearing?

240
00:14:42,374 --> 00:14:47,207
Oh, you noticed that,
did you? I can't in good
conscience ask Kabuto for
any help, as that useless

241
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:52,707
nitwit forgot my birthday,
too. So now, I'll be playing
that fool's part along with
my own!

242
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:56,607
Lord Orochimaru. I think
that's enough exposition
for the time being.

243
00:14:56,641 --> 00:14:57,774
[laughing]

244
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:01,107
You're right. First,
I will need my time-
release chakra.

245
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:11,607
I'll hide it in his shoes
where it will wait until
it's time to strike. On
the morning of his birthday,

246
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:14,441
as he walks merrily
along, I'll have my
vengeance.

247
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:18,274
I am walking merrily
along! Happy Birthday
to me!

248
00:15:18,307 --> 00:15:18,807
Ow!

249
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:21,407
Oh, no!

250
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:25,641
After that agonizing
torture, I'll set a
black cat to cross
his path.

251
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:26,907
[meowing]

252
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,741
Impending doom
awaits me!

253
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,207
And finally, when he
looks up to the sky...

254
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:34,807
He'll see the bad-luck
star shining down on
him as clear as can be!

255
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:38,241
The bad-luck star
has cursed my
birthday!

256
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:41,707
He'll have the most
miserable birthday
morning of his life,
and he'll have me to

257
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,574
thank for it! Take
that, Rock Lee!

258
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:46,241
Your plan is so
boring it put me
to sleep.

259
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:50,441
Put a cork in it! Piling
up one annoyance after
another can do plenty of
damage!

260
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:51,841
[gasp]

261
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:55,574
Whoa! Orochimaru,
what the-?! Get your
pervy hands off my
shoes!

262
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:59,807
This is bad, my Lord.
If you're found out now,
the plan is ruined!

263
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:01,674
You've gotta talk
your way out of this!

264
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:07,407
Sorry! I was- It's
getting colder now, and
I was warming up everyone's
shoes. That way, you won't

265
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:10,174
catch a cold! Understand?
It's nothing "pervy".

266
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:13,141
That doesn't make
any sense at all,
you weirdo!

267
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:14,507
[screaming]

268
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,207
Those jerks are in for
a big surprise if they
think I'll give up that
easily.

269
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:24,107
I've still got lots of
other options. On the
morning of his birthday,
I'll make him step in a

270
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:25,674
pile of dog poo!

271
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:31,707
Are we clear? I want you
to squeeze out plenty of
land mines on Lee's morning
running course!

272
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,207
Drop as many squishy
deuces as you can!

273
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:36,174
And you're feeding
him a month out?

274
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:37,741
[growling]

275
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:40,207
[screaming]

276
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:47,207
I won't be broken.
Nothing will stop me!
I've got plenty more in
store for him.

277
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,407
Just you wait!

278
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,441
[snickering]

279
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:53,541
You happy birthday lands
on the anniversary of
Buddha's death!

280
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:55,307
And even worse
than that...

281
00:16:57,574 --> 00:16:59,707
Actually, that's
Friday the 13th.

282
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:02,141
[laughing]

283
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:06,807
Lord Orochimaru. If
it's the 13th, then
technically it's not
even his birthday.

284
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:07,774
Understand?

285
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:11,041
What else would ruin
someone's birthday?
If only there was an
easily accessible

286
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:16,407
resource I could- I've
got it! I'll search the
internet for the answer!
Genius!

287
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:19,141
Worst birthday
memories ever.

288
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:25,274
Let's see here... Hah!
Here we go! "None of my
subordinates remembered
my birthday this year.

289
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:29,674
Even when I asked,
"Hey, didn't you forget
something important?"
They were still stumped.

290
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:33,141
All they could talk
about were vitamins and
light bulbs and other
stuff...

291
00:17:33,474 --> 00:17:36,774
Wait a minute, this
is my blog! I hate
everything right now!

292
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,474
Lord Orochimaru!
Do you really have
a blog?!

293
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:44,874
Ah, I see. It makes
sense now. Of all the
terrible things that
can happen on your

294
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:48,141
birthday, this is
the absolute worst!

295
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:55,507
Thank goodness! The
wait is finally over!
We are back onscreen!

296
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,641
Tell me about it. I
wasn't even sure we'd
show up again.

297
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:01,674
Hey, check it out!
A new restaurant's
opening up soon!

298
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:04,341
Sweet, it's a
ramen place!

299
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:10,541
Open November 27th. The
first 10 customers get
all-you-can-eat ramen!
Awesome!

300
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:13,641
I'm lining up first
thing that morning!

301
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:16,774
And with that,
it begins.

302
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:20,374
You know, I bet Choji
will want to come
along, too. We should
invite him.

303
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:24,274
No can do, Choji said
he's going over there
that day. Take a look!

304
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:29,774
Whoa! Another promo
on November 27th?
How odd.

305
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:33,741
Wait. We're talking
about November 27th?

306
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:35,807
Yes, we are.
What is up, Neji?

307
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:40,341
Huh. That's funny. The
Hyugas are holding a
memorial service that
very day.

308
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:43,807
It should've been the
day before, but for some
reason, they weren't able

309
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:46,574
to book the venue
and had to push
it back. Odd.

310
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:50,807
Wait a second. Now that
you mention it, Lady
Tsunade's "Ladies' Get
Together" is that day,

311
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:54,507
too. I was planning on
attending it. I knew that
date sounded familiar.

312
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,574
So everyone has
plans that day?

313
00:18:56,607 --> 00:19:00,841
This doesn't make any
sense. What's so special
about November 27th?

314
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,874
[laughing]

315
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:07,707
I'll tell you what's
special about November
27th! It's Fishing Day!

316
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:09,074
Fishing day?

317
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,507
Yes! It's the fishiest
day of them all! The
village fishing holes
are letting us catch

318
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,407
as much as we want
that day!

319
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:19,407
I see. So there's
another thing on
the 27th!

320
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:24,841
Actually, I invited Kakashi
along, too. But he's lining
up for this particular
event, instead.

321
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:28,474
I can't believe so
many things are
happening on that day.

322
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:30,707
Agh!

323
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:33,174
I almost completely
forgot about another
thing that happens
that day!

324
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:34,807
November 27th is
my birthday!

325
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,574
That means... Do
not tell me that
you all...

326
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:38,807
[chuckling]

327
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:42,174
That's right. I'm
behind every last one
of these events.

328
00:19:42,774 --> 00:19:48,174
Now no one will be able
to attend your birthday
party. They've all made
plans already! You'll

329
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:52,374
be all alone, crying
tears of loneliness
into your crummy
birthday cake!

330
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,207
That means... Do not
tell me that you all...

331
00:19:55,574 --> 00:20:00,441
You all conveniently
made unbreakable plans
for that day so that
Sakura and I can spend

332
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:04,407
my birthday together,
just the two of us,
like some kind of date?!

333
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:08,574
Agh! What's wrong
with you?! Why are
you so positive?!

334
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,107
And on the night of my
birthday, when Sakura
and I are all alone...

335
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:15,107
It will be like the
pages of those
risque manga...

336
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:20,841
Hey, Lee. Happy
Birthday, lover.
I'm your present.
Unwrap me!

337
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:26,307
I have to admit, I am
a bit embarrassed! But
I am also so, so very
happy!

338
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:29,507
That's crossing the line,
Bushy-Brow! Sakura would
never do something like
that for you!

339
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,174
Not even on your
birthday!

340
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:35,307
What do you know?
Lee's birthday is on
November 27th, as
well. Imagine that.

341
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,541
[laughing]

342
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:39,174
Enjoy yourself while
you can, Rock Lee.

343
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:40,474
Because...

344
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:46,374
Well, let me put it
this way. You'll get
a present, but it won't
be that Sakura girl!

345
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:50,474
It will be me!

346
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:58,274
I see. So you arranged
to be delivered to him
on the 27th? Very
clever, my Lord.

347
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:02,707
Indeed! At the height
of his despair. As Rock
Lee is crying, Orochimaru

348
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,441
will pop out of this
present and cheer him
up!

349
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,376
[laughing]

350
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:09,315
What's this package?

351
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,749
<i>I heard something</i>
<i>laughing inside.</i>

352
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:12,382
Must be some
kind of prank.

353
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:14,649
<i>Ah, it's creeping me</i>
<i>out. Let's just trash</i>
<i>it!</i>

354
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:16,049
Hnh?!

355
00:21:16,082 --> 00:21:16,782
Agh!

356
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:22,415
Hey! What are you
doing! Stop it! I'm
not garbage! Quit
knocking me around!

357
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,615
[screaming]

358
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:30,749
Huh?

359
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:37,082
Surprise! I know it's a
little late, but still.
We all wanted to do
something extra special

360
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:41,449
for you. Happiest of
Birthdays, Lord
Orochimaru! We wish
you all the best!

361
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,682
Kabuto... What's the
big idea? Why didn't
you do this on the
right day?

362
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:49,382
Because you were
out wandering that
day, my Lord...

363
00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:52,449
You were in the
mountains looking
for a hot spring.
Remember?

364
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,515
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>where you were!</i>

365
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:56,682
Ohh...

366
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:04,049
Well, like they always
say: all's well that ends
well, right, Orochimaru?
Happy Birthday!

367
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:07,515
Thank you so
much, everyone!

368
00:23:46,382 --> 00:23:52,182
<i>Next time we have "Sakura's</i>
<i>My Nurse!" and "One Vote</i>
<i>For Rock Lee!" I hope that</i>
<i>you enjoy them!</i>

369
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:56,549
Hey, Lord Orochimaru's
supposed to be doing the
preview, don't cut him
off like that!

370
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:57,649
<i>It's all right.</i>

371
00:23:57,682 --> 00:23:59,882
Eh?

372
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:05,454
<i>We're celebrating my</i>
<i>birthday, remember? I'm</i>
<i>so happy. I want everyone</i>
<i>to share in my joy.</i>

373
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,554
<i>Just this once.</i>

374
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:09,854
Lord Orochimaru,
that's not how a
villain should talk.

375
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:12,487
<i>Wait. I'm the</i>
<i>villain?!</i>
