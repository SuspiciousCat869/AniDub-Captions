1
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:02,664
We're in the midst of a brutal
heat wave! Just thinking about
these temperatures makes me
break into a cold sweat!

2
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:09,297
Our heroes are suffering,
along with everyone else.
They can barely eat their
popsicles!

3
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,864
It's so hot. It's
been so hot even
at night!

4
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:16,364
I know! We need air-
conditioning or
something!

5
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:19,497
We're a sorry group
of ninjas if we need
air-conditioning to
survive!

6
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,697
Neji is absolutely correct!
We should solve this problem
like real ninjas...

7
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,730
...with wind-
style jutsu!

8
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,830
[screaming]

9
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:32,097
Hey. This wind is
pretty refreshing!

10
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,697
Nice job there, Lee!

11
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,464
But why is it so wet?

12
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:38,897
Oh yuck! That
stuff is sweat!

13
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,464
Cut it out, Lee!
This is gross!

14
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:42,697
This isn't ninjutsu!

15
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,464
Really! It
doesn't even
exist!

16
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,864
You're getting everyone
worked up! Cut it out!

17
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,397
Alright, Lee!
Enough!

18
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,397
We're just gonna have to
beg Guy Sensei to get an
air conditioner installed!

19
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,964
<i>Denied.</i>

20
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,930
There are countless ways
to cool off without air-
conditioning, and we're
going to try one of them now.

21
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:06,797
That outfit gives
me a bad feeling.

22
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,597
Oh yes, a summer ghost
story! Tonight, we'll all
tell scary tales and in
the process, everyone's

23
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,364
spine will be full
of chills!

24
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:18,897
I call this little
exercise my 'I-swear-
it-really-happened'
ghost story training!

25
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,697
What?! You do ghost
story training?!

26
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,664
Interesting...

27
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:24,397
Oh! Keep it
to yourself!

28
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,564
Beg your pardon.

29
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:35,364
<i>A Hot Night for a</i>
<i>Chilling Tale.</i>

30
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:45,897
Alright, we're all in our
places, with bright shiny
faces. We'll start with
you, Lee. Tell us a story

31
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,330
so scary, it will make
our teeth chatter!

32
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:49,497
As you wish...

33
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,730
I have given this some
thought, and I have decided
to tell you the gory details
of something awful that

34
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:56,697
happened to me just
the other day.

35
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,797
This story centers around the
discovery of one particular
video tape. I hope your hearts
can handle it!

36
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,697
[screaming]

37
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,264
Zip it!

38
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,197
Let me ask something...

39
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,630
This video is it the kind
of thing where you die one
week after you view it?

40
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:17,630
No, that is kid's stuff.

41
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:22,664
The horrors I endured
were much more scary.
But as I look back on
the incident...

42
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:25,964
...I realize how lucky
I am to still be alive.

43
00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:36,297
It was a dark and stormy
night. I had finally gotten
around to cleaning my room.

44
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:44,864
While going through my
closet, I came across a
very old VHS tape, way
in the back.

45
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:47,097
What the heck
is that?

46
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,764
As I knelt there, a
feeling of foreboding
crept into my heart.

47
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:55,597
There was no
mistaking it...

48
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,964
I remembered that tape!

49
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:07,330
It was one I had rented
over three years ago,
and still had not returned!

50
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:10,364
[crying]

51
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:13,864
I'm telling you, the late
fees are going to bankrupt
me!

52
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,864
Just thinking about
returning it terrifies
me!

53
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:19,664
That's not the kind of
scary we were looking for.

54
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:22,897
Oh. Did I misunderstand?
Let me just take a look
in here.

55
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,097
Material for jokes?!

56
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:34,264
That night, after putting it
off for months, I finally got
around to cleaning out the
refrigerator. Suddenly, I saw

57
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:37,964
something deep in the
rear of the veggie drawer.
It was a year-old potato!

58
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:39,664
[screaming]

59
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:41,130
Wrong again!

60
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:43,097
You really do not
believe that is scary?!

61
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,897
Of course not!
Are you nuts?!

62
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,330
I am not talking about
nuts here, my friend!
Do you have any idea
how terrifying a year-

63
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:54,264
old potato can actually
look?! Have you ever seen
one up close and personal?
It is all wriggly and squishy

64
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:57,697
and yucky, let me tell
you, it is absolutely
horrifying!

65
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,164
Regardless, it's not
the right kind of scary!

66
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:03,897
We need to hear about
ghosts, and monsters,
and that kind of stuff!

67
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,864
She's right, Lee! Just
because it's something that
might have scared you, doesn't
make it a ghost story.

68
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:10,197
You're next, Naruto.

69
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,764
<i>Tell us your story.</i>

70
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,130
Alright, but thinking
about it really freaks
me out.

71
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:21,097
In fact, I nearly put it
out of my memory. This
happened a few years ago,
but it seems like it took

72
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,297
place only yesterday.

73
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:27,864
It was late at night,
and I had to hit the
bathroom...

74
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:31,130
[groan]

75
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:36,097
Suddenly, I heard a
sad voice moaning in
pain! I was petrified!

76
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,664
[groaning]

77
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:46,364
It wasn't going away!
Slowly I turned, and
looked out the window.

78
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:52,897
And then I saw it! There
were tears streaming down
the carved face of the
old Third Hokage!

79
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:56,364
[screaming]

80
00:06:56,397 --> 00:07:00,164
And that's my scary
story! It was pretty
freaky, don't you think?

81
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:02,730
Uhh... That was
me, Naruto!

82
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:03,597
What?

83
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,897
I had been up there.

84
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,830
[grunting]

85
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:10,130
I really had a
challenge that
night.

86
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,197
I was doing ten thousand
pull-ups on the Stone
Faces, and boy was I
sweaty!

87
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,330
It was nothing more
than your grunts and
sweat?!

88
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:22,130
You fail, Naruto. That
was not a scary ghost
story. Next up is
Konohamaru!

89
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:26,797
Alright, I'm ready! Listen
up, I've got a really scary
story for everybody!

90
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:31,897
It was the day we all
went to the opening of
that new curry restaurant!

91
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:39,697
Only three of us went in to
eat, but for some mysterious
reason, the waitress served
us four plates of food!

92
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:43,197
You mean to say there
was someone invisible
sitting next to you in
the booth?!

93
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,197
What was it,
a hungry ghost?!

94
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,330
Would you mind
letting go of me?

95
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:48,997
<i>Oh! Sorry about</i>
<i>that, guys!</i>

96
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,864
I guess I accidentally
put in that extra order.

97
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:53,164
It was you again?!

98
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:57,297
Sorry, but I'm afraid
that's not a ghost story
either. You're up, Sakura.

99
00:07:57,897 --> 00:08:01,030
I don't really have
a story. But I want you
to look at something.

100
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,830
It's very interesting.

101
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:10,330
It's a picture taken of all
of us from the day we went
down to the beach.

102
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:12,364
<i>Ooohhh!</i>

103
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:14,164
Is that a spirit I see?

104
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:14,897
<i>Whoa!</i>

105
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:17,364
Sorry folks! I guess
that was just me farting!

106
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,297
[laughing]

107
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,230
You mean you actually
fart visible clouds?!

108
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:25,030
How gross! So that's
what that smell was!
I remember now!

109
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:26,764
Is everything around
here, Bushy-Brow's fault?!

110
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:31,964
So much for scary tales. This
whole thing is turning into
some kind of bad comedy act.

111
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:33,164
[sigh]

112
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:35,864
It's your turn,
Tenten. Go for it.

113
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:37,864
Uh...

114
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:43,197
Well, alright, I'll take a
shot. This didn't actually
happen to me, but Lady
Tsunade once told me a story.

115
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:49,797
If you go up to the girl's
bathroom on the third floor
of the Academy building,

116
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,330
you'll find there is
a row of mirrors...

117
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:00,164
At 3:33 am, if you look
into the third mirror from
the back, something strange
will happen...

118
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,130
You'll see a face
that's not your own!

119
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:08,830
[screaming]

120
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,364
You mean that's
really true?!

121
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:13,997
W-Wait a minute! Are
you saying there's a
ghost in there?

122
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,030
Was it you again, Lee?
Come on, tell the truth.

123
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:21,830
Oh no, even for me, that
is too much. I do not hang
around girl's bathrooms in
the wee hours of the morning.

124
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:22,797
Then what?!

125
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,730
Hmm...

126
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:30,830
With no other explanations,
do you think it could have
been a real spirit?

127
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:38,230
We should go find out.
It's almost 3:33 right
now.

128
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:40,630
How do you feel about
a test of courage?

129
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:41,297
Are you up for it?

130
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,197
What?!

131
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:47,164
Now that I've thought
about it, I think we
should go back.

132
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:51,164
It is pretty creepy
wandering around here
in the middle of the
night.

133
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:56,230
Also, apart from the creep
factor, it's hotter than
blazes up here.

134
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:59,897
You're right. And all this
running around isn't making
it any better.

135
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:10,797
[screaming]

136
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,964
What was that noise?

137
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:14,364
Sorry, that was just
the sound of me
sweating again.

138
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:16,030
Who has loud sweat?!

139
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:16,930
[groaning]

140
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:20,264
Okay, this is the
girl's bathroom.

141
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:23,564
First, I had better
use my Sexy Jutsu.

142
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:26,597
I'm sure that's
quite unnecessary!

143
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:32,030
Go ahead, it's the
third mirror from
the back.

144
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,197
Guys, do you really think
we'll see someone else
in that mirror?

145
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,697

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,797
Wait! Did we vote? Why
does it have to be me?
Stop!

147
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,297
You have gone this far,
do not chicken out now!

148
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,697
<i>The clock says it</i>
<i>is almost 3:33!</i>

149
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,230
Stop it, Lee!
I don't wanna!

150
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:50,697
[screaming]

151
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,664
Well, so far, all I
see is the two of us.

152
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,864
Me, too. Guess it was
just another tall tale.

153
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:59,630
Lady Tsunade was sure
she saw something!

154
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:00,964
Lady Tsunade?

155
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,064
[screaming]

156
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:03,664
Oh!

157
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,197
I have it figured out!
Lady Tsunade must have
gone to the bathroom at
that very early morning

158
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,097
hour, and caught a glimpse
of her own face without any
makeup!

159
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:12,864
[screaming]

160
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:17,764
I hear someone
talking about me!

161
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,697
What about my face?

162
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,364
Is that Lady Tsunade?!

163
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,297
Oh my god,
the horror!

164
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,097
[screaming]

165
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:33,130
It is weird, but now I
definitely see a face other
than my own in the mirror.

166
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,064
All the ghost stories
turned out to be nothing
but duds.

167
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:41,930
Trust me, humans are
the scariest creatures
you'll ever meet.

168
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:44,730
Apparently, there's no
such things as ghosts,
after all.

169
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:47,230
You are the only one
who has not gone yet.

170
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:49,130
Uh, right.

171
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:52,964
In that case, it's
your turn, and you're
our last hope.

172
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:57,764
Show everyone how it's
done, and tell us a
terrifying tale that will
chill us to the bone!

173
00:11:57,797 --> 00:11:59,864
Yes, of course.

174
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,297
This is my chance to come
through. I really need to
nail it. But I don't know
any truly scary stories.

175
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,630
It's just not my thing.
Where do I begin?

176
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,097
You can do this!

177
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:18,797
Yeah! Go for it!

178
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,764
My friends...

179
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:24,097
That's it! I've got a
story! I remember now!

180
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,964
The question is, should I
go ahead and tell them?
There'd be no taking it back
afterwards, that's for sure.

181
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:35,130
I can do this! This is
no time to waver! I need
to be strong!

182
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:44,230
This is a story I was told
years ago when I was a
child, about a wolf-man.

183
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,097
Uh... Did you say
wolf-man?

184
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,797
[nervous groans]

185
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,197
Once, on a night with
a full moon...

186
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,130
...a man whose wild, unkempt
hair blew in the wind, took
a comb from his pocket and
howled...

187
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,830
[nervous groans]

188
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:06,730
I'm shedding!
I'm shedding!

189
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:10,797
Agh...

190
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,964
So awful.

191
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:19,297
Even though it's a sweltering
night, everyone in the room
is frozen in fear. But what
happens next?

192
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,797
<i>Please! Don't</i>
<i>punish me!!</i>

193
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:41,632
Summer is the season for
adventures! And with each
season and each adventure,
young boys climb the steps

194
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,166
toward manhood!

195
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:51,832
My dream is simple. I want
to become the youngest
Hokage in history!

196
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:08,899
<i>The Hokage's Tears</i>
<i>Aren't for Decoration!</i>

197
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,499
Time for a pop quiz,
everyone! In the first
half of the episode, it
seemed Lee was behind all

198
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:22,632
the scary happenings in
everyone's ghost stories.
But actually, one phenomenon
was real! Did you notice

199
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,566
which one?

200
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:30,699
The answer is right in
front of you! But for those
of you who missed it, we'll
take another look. Lee, as

201
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:35,332
you may remember, was
doing pull-ups on the
First Hokage's eye as
part of his training.

202
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:36,866
Naruto then said
the following...

203
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,632
There were tears streaming
down the carved face of the
old Third Hokage!

204
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:45,399
Wait a minute! You're
telling us the Stone
Face was actually crying?!

205
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:49,932
I remember 'The Tears of
the Great Stone Faces' was
one of the 'Seven Mysteries
of the Leaf' we learned

206
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,832
about when we were
back at the Academy.

207
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:55,232
Perhaps this was a
real paranormal event,
after all.

208
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,299
[nervous groans]

209
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:57,732
[crying]

210
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,466
It's time we stopped
the ghost stories, okay?

211
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,666
I'll solve this mystery,
once and for all!

212
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:07,632
The narrator even said
that the summer is the
season for adventure.

213
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,632
Konohamaru, you
are not scared?

214
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:14,232
Well of course not! He may
have died, but the Third
Hokage's still my grandpa!

215
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:18,499
I could get to see him
again, and if he's upset
for some reason, I'd want
to help!

216
00:15:18,532 --> 00:15:22,366
I hadn't thought about
it, but it's possible
his ghost is trying to
tell us something.

217
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,366
Seriously, can we cool
it with the ghost talk,
guys!

218
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,532
<i>Actually...</i>

219
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,366
[screaming]

220
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,299
Tsu-! Tsu-!

221
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:30,466
Lady Tsunade?

222
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,366
I saw it myself,
last night.

223
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,832
I got up to go to
the bathroom again...

224
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:37,566
And then...

225
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,799
Huh?! What?!

226
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:41,466
The eyes were flashing!

227
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,766
[screaming]

228
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,666
[scared cries]

229
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,599
[scream]

230
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,566
What is wrong, Naruto?

231
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,932
The Third Hokage's
eye! I saw it move!

232
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:00,332
You sure about that?

233
00:16:01,532 --> 00:16:03,632
I don't see
anything strange.

234
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,832
You are becoming a real
scaredy-cat, Naruto.

235
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:08,832
Ah! I'm telling you I
saw it move! You've gotta
believe me!

236
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:13,966
Yes, the eye definitely
moved, as I'm sure you
noticed. But I'm here to
tell you, it was not any

237
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:19,599
kind of paranormal event!
It was all because of this
man. Say, what are you doing
here, anyway?

238
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:24,299
What does it look like?
I'm setting up a base,
here on the edge of the
Leaf Village!

239
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:29,832
From here, I can observe Rock
Lee and his friends, and then
attack them the second they
let their guard down!

240
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,199
[laughing]

241
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,432
I feel much better!

242
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:40,866
Excuse me, do I have this
right? Is it possible the
Hokage's tears are nothing
but toilet water?!

243
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,599
Oh my goodness!
Look, he's crying!

244
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:44,866
I told you that's
what was going on!

245
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,799
Ah! What in the
world is this?!

246
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,166
Hey, come back here!

247
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:50,799
Are you going where
I think you're going?!

248
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:52,532
No one's going
anywhere without
me!

249
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,166
Good luck, everyone.

250
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,932
What is it, Lee?!

251
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:04,866
Is the Third Hokage
watching shows on
this TV?

252
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:07,566
Finally saw Muben's
Elevation of the Boss.

253
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,299
<i>That's it, boy! Keep</i>
<i>wagging that tail for me!</i>

254
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:12,299
You really lost it, Lee!

255
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,399
Quit joking around!

256
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:15,432
Sorry, guys.

257
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:18,499
Anyway, we should check
out the stone faces.

258
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:24,466
So far, I don't see
anything unusual.

259
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:26,432
[screaming]

260
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:27,632
What is it?!

261
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:30,266
Is that snot
dripping on you?

262
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,932
Sorry about that. I
seem to be sweating
quite a lot.

263
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,832
What, again?!
Really, again?!
You're doing
that again?!

264
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:40,466
I do apologize, but on the
plus side, I found something
really amazing in here!
Come and look!

265
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,632
What in the world?

266
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,666
Is this a natural cave?

267
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,332
<i>Hey, Naruto...</i>

268
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,299
What's up, Bushy-

269
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,866
[screaming]

270
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:53,299
Enough! Both
of you!

271
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:57,599
Oh, darn it! My front-
line base was just days
from being finished!

272
00:17:57,632 --> 00:17:59,599
You're telling me
this isn't done yet?

273
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:00,666
Of course not!

274
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:06,399
Open your eyes and take a
look around. Tell me what
you see! I want to have a
trendy urban space, not

275
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,332
some crude cave!

276
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:14,899
A 37th-floor penthouse, a
beautiful night sky. High-
end furniture and high-
end wine. And of course,

277
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:17,599
a robe made entirely
of real silk!

278
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:20,566
Sounds great, but isn't
it a little fancy for a
hideout?

279
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,932
There's only one way to
protect this space. I'll
just have to scare them
off!

280
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,732
<i>Let's see how</i>
<i>they like this!</i>

281
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:28,232
[whimpering]

282
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,166
Yam paste?

283
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:33,466
Yam paste hit you. So
you know what is coming
next, right?

284
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,799
I haven't got a clue.

285
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:37,299
You have to undergo
a boiling bath!

286
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:39,299
What in the world are you
talking about?!

287
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:42,166
[yelling]
The boiling bath is the
traditional punishment!

288
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,666
Wait a minute! How in the
world did this even get
in here!

289
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:48,399
I've got this.
Byakugan!

290
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:52,332
Hmm...

291
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,732
Lavender Bath Bombs!

292
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,232
You're adding
bath salts?!

293
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,366
[screaming]

294
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:04,532
What is this place,
a haunted house?

295
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:05,699
Sure seems like it.

296
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:07,199
<i>Let's keep going.</i>

297
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:14,932
No positive results, I'm
afraid. Only one of them
was even remotely scared.

298
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:19,299
Those accursed brats! I
guess now I'll be forced
to use my secret weapon!

299
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,899
Let's see how they
deal with this!

300
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:22,532
[gasp]

301
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,899
Where in the heck
did this tape come
from?

302
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,732
My lord, is that one of
those tapes you have a
week to return?

303
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,632
Yes it is.

304
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:38,299
If you don't get it back
to the store at the end of
that one week, it will start
to accure late fees!

305
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:41,866
I rented it over
three years ago and
completely forgot
about it!

306
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:43,866
[screaming]

307
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:47,966
Excuse me, but there's no
point in you being scared!
Is what's on the tape going
to frighten these kids?!

308
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,666
Umm, we already used
this bit earlier...

309
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:53,932
I wonder what
could be on it.

310
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:55,699
Neji, if you please.

311
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,332
Byakugan!

312
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,499
Good god! It's the
'Make-Out Tactics'
movie!

313
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:06,532
The Byakugan can even
see what's on the tape?!

314
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:11,799
I can't believe you rented
that one. I've been trying
to see it for years, but
every time I go to the video

315
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:14,766
store, they tell me their
only copy is still checked
out!

316
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,366
So it's been all because
of you, damn it!

317
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,732
Wow...

318
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,566
I think you've seen
enough of this!

319
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,899
It was just
getting good!

320
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:23,399
Hey! We can watch
it at my house!

321
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,666
It's not going
to your house!

322
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:28,499
This sure doesn't feel
like much of a summer
adventure.

323
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:29,732
No peeking, Neji!

324
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:31,132
[gasp]

325
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,899
Well, I'm down to my last
option! No more time for
playing around!

326
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:38,666
[gasps]

327
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:40,499
Darn it!

328
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:42,166
What's going on?!

329
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:45,499
Are you okay in
there?! Talk to me!

330
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:48,632
<i>Konohamaru! Go get</i>
<i>Guy Sensei and the</i>
<i>other teachers!</i>

331
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,332
Alright! Just hang
tight, I'll be back
soon!

332
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:53,799
I think not.

333
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:56,299
You're the one who's
behind this, aren't you?!

334
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:57,866
[laughing]

335
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:00,632
And the way things are
going, my secret base may
not even need renovating!

336
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,532
You are all finished!

337
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,366
No! Lemme go!

338
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:07,566
You've got them now,
Lord Orochimaru!

339
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,632
And they're all going
to pay the price!

340
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:10,732
What's that?!

341
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:13,166
I'm not sure...

342
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:14,499
Fireballs?

343
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,699
Don't look at me! I'm
not the one who's doing
this!

344
00:21:17,732 --> 00:21:19,566
What is going on here?!

345
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,232
Grandpa?!

346
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:29,632
[gasps]

347
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,199
Look out below!
Here we come!

348
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,532
I don't know how he was
able to do it, but
grandpa saved me...

349
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:39,599
[gasp]

350
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,732
And another Orochimaru
plan goes up in smoke!

351
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:50,466
Considering how things
turned out, maybe spirits
do exist!

352
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,532
Mmhmm!

353
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:56,347
<i>Keep watching over me,</i>
<i>grandpa, and I'll be Hokage</i>
<i>one day, and make you proud!</i>

354
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:52,089
We have been assigned student
teaching positions! I cannot
wait to teach the students about
ninjutsu! It will be great!

355
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:55,022
<i>I'm sure we'll be fine,</i>
<i>but I am a little concerned.</i>

356
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:59,622
Do not worry! It is simple.
We will simply teach the kids
everything we have learned
ourselves!

357
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,555
<i>I feel better now.</i>

358
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:08,622
<i>On the next episode:</i>
<i>'Always Do Your Homework at</i>
<i>the Last Minute!' and 'Class-</i>
<i>Three Lee! We Are a Team Guy!'</i>

359
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:14,722
<i>I gotta tell you, someone</i>
<i>who says, always do your</i>
<i>homework at the last minute
makes me a little uncomfortable.</i>
