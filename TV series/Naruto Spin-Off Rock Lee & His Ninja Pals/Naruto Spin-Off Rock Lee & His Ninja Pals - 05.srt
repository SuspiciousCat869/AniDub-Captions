00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:54,349
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>It's another day of</i>
<i>training hard for Rock Lee!</i>

2
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:57,383
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>There are 20 leaves</i>
<i>falling through the</i>
<i>air right now.</i>

3
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:00,116
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>If I can grab all of</i>
<i>them before they hit</i>
<i>the ground...</i>

4
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:08,083
<i>...I will take Sakura</i>
<i>on a date to that fancy</i>
<i>restaurant with a view</i>
<i>of the night sky...</i>

5
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:09,849
<i>But if I fail...</i>

6
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:13,116
<i>...I must go to the</i>
<i>restaurant alone...</i>

7
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:16,349
<i>...and bungee jump off</i>
<i>the top five times!</i>

8
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:18,683
[gasp]

9
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:21,316
(Lee)
Konohamaru?

10
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,383
Nice, big brother
Bushy Brows! You
saw right through
me, didn't you?

11
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:34,783
<i>"I'm going to teach</i>
<i>Konohamaru Kempo"</i>

12
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:38,583
Listen, I have a really
big favor to ask you.

13
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,283
Would you be willing
to train me?

14
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:43,649
I do not understand.
Why do you want me to
train... Argh!

15
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:47,449
I know! I mean, if
anyone's going to
train you then it
should be me!

16
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:49,016
Big Bro Naruto!

17
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,283
Check out this
sweet move!:
Sexy Sakura Jutsu!

18
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,016
[screaming]

19
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:00,149
That's the most
critical critical
hit I've ever seen!

20
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:04,049
But anyway, you
cheated, Naruto!
The real Sakura's
not that busty!

21
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,849
[angry cries]

22
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:09,349
Yeah! But don't you
get it, Konohamaru?
This version's better.

23
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,349
Uhhh...

24
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:15,749
Sorry, Sakura...

25
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:19,016
Stop messing around
with your stupid
perverted jutsu!

26
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,183
Huh. It's funny you should
say that, because you didn't
mind when I used my Sexy Man
Jutsu the other day...

27
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,716
[excited shriek]

28
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:33,149
What are you talking about!?
I'd never get worked up over
something as immature as that!

29
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:35,616
Really? 'Cause I have
an even more exciting
one...

30
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,249
Ah! More exciting!?

31
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:42,249
Watch! Sexy Manly
Man Jutsu!

32
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:43,483
[grunt]

33
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:48,316
[horrified scream]

34
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:52,649
Argh! My eyes!!

35
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:55,349
Your jutsu has amazing
destructive power!

36
00:03:55,383 --> 00:04:00,783
But if you possess fearsome
weapons like that in your
arsenal, then why do you
need me to train you?

37
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:04,016
You must know already
that I am not able
to use ninjutsu...

38
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,116
But that's just it!
I don't need you to
train me in ninjutsu!

39
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:09,616
I want you to help with
hand-to-hand combat!

40
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,183
Taijutsu?

41
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:15,449
Yeah! I heard that we're
going to have a test of
our kempo combat skills.

42
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:18,683
Actually, I remember
Kakashi Sensei talking
about that, too.

43
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:23,483
Something about how they
want to do a yearly exam
to make sure everyone's
in good shape or something.

44
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:26,283
Oh, I understand. It
all makes sense now.

45
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:29,583
And I will be
happy to help you
out however I can!

46
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:37,016
Nothing days "training"
better than sitting
under a waterfall...

47
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:39,083
Yeah, it's one of
the classics, right?

48
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:40,749
Now let us begin,
gentlemen!

49
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:43,449
Say hello to my
helpers, Neji
and Tenten!

50
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,949
Helpers..?!

51
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:49,249
Listen, Lee... Do
we really have time
for this? We need
to prepare, too.

52
00:04:49,283 --> 00:04:51,349
I don't know if we
should be teaching
someone else.

53
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:55,816
No! I would never
have become a chunin
if it were not for
Guy Sensei helping!

54
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:00,049
And now it is time for
me to start helping the
next generation of Ninja!

55
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,249
The most important
part of hand-to-hand
combat is speed!

56
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:11,383
Even if you cannot use jutsu,
if you are fast enough, then
you will be able to produce the
same effects as any ninjutsu!

57
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,983
For example, the
Transformation Jutsu!

58
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,116
Oooh!

59
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,949
One step further...!

60
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:21,349
Grrr.

61
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:23,983
Wow! You changed
him so fast!

62
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:26,483
(Thinking)
Why do I keep agreeing
to these things!?

63
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:30,249
The key to this technique
is not to get embarrassed,
no matter what happens!

64
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:34,483
But as you can see,
Neji still needs some
training in that regard!

65
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:38,816
Go for a lap around
the village in this
outfit! That should
help you improve!

66
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,149
Forget it!!!

67
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:42,649
That's not the
Transformation Jutsu...

68
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,383
Yeah. He's just
changing his clothes.

69
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,383
Huh?

70
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,683
Let us move on!
If you move
quickly enough...

71
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:54,316
He moved so fast he
heated up the water!
I guess he really is
hot-blooded.

72
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:59,416
Also... You can
use... Clone Jutsu...

73
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,016
[groan]

74
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:02,483
He made himself dizzy.

75
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:04,183
And overheated.

76
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:06,449
You really think that's
as good as the jutsu?

77
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:10,683
Enough with the
fake ninjutsu,
already! Just teach
the kid some kempo!

78
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:18,683
Finally, the time has
come for me to teach
you my greatest kempo
move...

79
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:22,583
A strike so powerful
it can even counter
the Rasengan Naruto
uses!

80
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,949
Woah! No way!
My Rasengan?

81
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:28,449
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>The Rasengan is high-level</i>
<i>attack where the user rotates</i>
<i>chakra in his palm at high</i>

82
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:32,849
<i>speeds, compresses it into</i>
<i>a ball, and slams it into the</i>
<i>enemy and then brags</i>
about
<i>it for months.</i>

83
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:39,183
Woah! That is some
winning spinning!

84
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:44,116
Ha ha ha! I call
this the "Rasenken!"
Now you two give
it a try!

85
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,683
Alright!

86
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:48,916
Not bad! But not
up to my level!

87
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:52,116
I'm not gonna let
you show me up,
Bushy Brow!

88
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:54,616
Faster! Faster!

89
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,683
I'll show you!

90
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,449
[yelling]

91
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,116
[barfing]

92
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,249
They're so dizzy
they got sick!

93
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:06,149
Ooof. My plan
worked perfectly.

94
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:10,516
I will use this
dizziness... Who
do you think you
are looking at!?

95
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:11,449
Drunken Fist!

96
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,383
I am... Business Man!

97
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,349
Why is his tie
around his head?

98
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:19,649
Yeah, and why does
he have a box of
take out sushi?

99
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:22,683
Inside there are
gourd and squid rolls!

100
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:25,983
Stupid boss... thinks
he is so great...!

101
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:30,216
But all he does during
meetings is pick his
nose, and then try to
pick <i>my</i> nose!

102
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,916
He isn't even
fighting, he's
just plain drunk!

103
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:35,116
One more round...
Naruto old friend!

104
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:38,183
All that he's teaching
with this training is
how to act strange!

105
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:39,883
And they don't
need help with
that!

106
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,316
That jerk boss...
Who does he think
he is!?

107
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,916
[yelling]

108
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:49,616
I'll get you for
this, Bushy Brow!

109
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:56,283
Konohamaru, now it
is your turn! I think
we should start out
with the Rasenken!

110
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:57,816
Are you sure?

111
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:01,416
What is the matter?
Is starting with
the big moves too
much for you?

112
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,949
Uhh...

113
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,216
Now, first I will
teach you how to
get the most out
of your training!

114
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:08,849
Guy Sensei himself
taught me this trick!
The self-imposed rule!

115
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:10,683
Self-imposed rule?

116
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:12,983
Correct!

117
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:17,649
You have to come up with a
handicap for yourself during
your training sessions and then
stick to it no matter what!

118
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:26,549
If I can complete
this training session,
then I will go on my
first date with Sakura!

119
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:32,016
<i>If I complete this training</i>
<i>session, then we will watch</i>
<i>out first movie together</i>
<i>at her house!</i>

120
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:38,549
<i>If I complete this training</i>
<i>session, then we will go</i>
<i>on our first overnight trip</i>
<i>to a hot springs!</i>

121
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:45,116
<i>If I complete this training</i>
<i>session, then I will buy an</i>
engagement ring that costs what
I earn in 3 months and propose!

122
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,683
<i>If I complete this training</i>
<i>session, I will hold a press</i>
<i>conference to announce our</i>
<i>marriage!</i>

123
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:58,449
<i>If I complete this training</i>
session, Sakura and I will have
twins so disgustingly cute that
<i>they will make everyone hurl!</i>

124
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:04,283
Of course, all this only
happens in my head, but
there we have been on 3
wonderful dates!

125
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:08,483
We've gone as far as
holding hands in front of
the giraffes at the zoo
inside of my head!

126
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:10,849
That is really
creepy, Bushy Brow.

127
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,383
Now, Konohamaru,
let us get to work!

128
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,849
Yah!

129
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:17,849
Are those..?

130
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:21,416
His eyebrows!? He's spinning
those massive eyebrows around
like they're a buzz saw!

131
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:23,549
Ha ha! Yes!

132
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,883
By opening the internal
limiters known as the
Eight Gates, I can
summon amazing powers!

133
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,616
For this move, I
released the limiters
on one part of my body!

134
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,983
You can do this if you
master taijutsu combat, too!

135
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,483
Still creepy!

136
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:41,183
Arghhh! Hey! Stop
brow-beating me!

137
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:42,783
[yelling]

138
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,783
Konohamaru!

139
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,483
Konohamaru!

140
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:53,149
Huh?

141
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,783
What is wrong,
Konohamaru?

142
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:57,349
Sulking out here is not
going to help you grow.

143
00:09:57,383 --> 00:10:00,549
You came to me for
help, and I will not
let you quit now!

144
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,149
The truth is...
I'm kinda scared.

145
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,983
Hm?

146
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,349
I keep hearing these
frightening rumors about
how tough the exam is.

147
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:16,649
I don't know if I'll
be able to do it...
And my confidence
is shaken...

148
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:22,149
Listen, Konohamaru.

149
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:26,416
No amount of hard work
will help a man who will
not believe in himself!

150
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,916
[gasp]

151
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:32,449
Listen, I cannot tell you
how many times Guy Sensei
said those words to me.

152
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,583
Ohh...

153
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:40,783
He repeated it over
and over. Eventually
I understood how important
belief in yourself is!

154
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:45,416
It is thanks to his
words that I was able
to become a chunin.

155
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:47,016
And so...

156
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:47,849
Uh!

157
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,316
You can do it! You
will fight your way
through just fine,
Konohamaru!

158
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:56,949
Just have confidence
in yourself. The
same way I did!

159
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:01,316
[determined grunt]

160
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:06,749
If I pass the test, then
I vow right now that I
will become Hokage!

161
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:11,816
Or I'll run 500 laps
around the village,
backwards! That will be
my self-imposed rule!

162
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:17,349
That is the spirit! Now,
before you go, how about
you and I have a quick
sparring round!?

163
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:24,516
You're going to get
it! Check out my brand
new Harem Jutsu!

164
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,149
Ah! He has a new
Harem Jutsu!?

165
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:30,516
I wonder what this
one will be like...
Perhaps it will be...

166
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:34,116
Sexy Manly Man
Madness Jutsu!

167
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,649

170
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,949
Yeah! I did it!

<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Konohamaru overcame a</i>
<i>huge obstacle and</i>

172
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,583
<i>And at last, the day</i>
<i>of the exam arrived...</i>

173
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:57,416
This is the
examination room.

174
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:00,383
What's going on?

175
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,149
I thought this was
a combat examination!

176
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:08,016
Combat? What are you
talking about? Not
combat... body fat!

177
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:10,049
We gotta make sure
we're all healthy!

178
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,349
[horrified screams]

179
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:15,983
[horrified cries]

180
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:17,683
Lee?

181
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:32,124
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Yes, the test was actually</i>
<i>a physical- and Lee also</i>
<i>has to take it!</i>

182
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:36,124
First we're going to
need a chakra sample
from each of you to
run tests on.

183
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:37,457
Chakra sample?

184
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,524
That's right! You
should've filled a
container with your
chakra!

185
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:43,090
They'll use it to run tests
to determine your health.

186
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:45,524
Seriously!? They can
do that with chakra?!

187
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,457
Of course, Tenten.
You really didn't
know that?

188
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,890
Then again, I suppose
that nobody knew about
it since they only started
doing it this year...

189
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:56,057
I got this one
all filled up, Doc!

190
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,757
That's ridiculous!

191
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,490
Now, everyone make sure
that you're only handing
in your own chakra!

192
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:05,857
No using your dad's or
your dog's chakra if you
can't make any yourself!

193
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,324
I'm looking at
you, Kiba!

194
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:11,724
If you forgot a sample,
you can leave one now.

195
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,957
Just put the container
in this box.

196
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,424
(All)
Yes sir!

197
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:17,957
I had no idea that
chakra's like that!

198
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,724
How freaky!

199
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,790
"I Save My Lucky Undies
for Physicals"

200
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,957
What's the holdup, Lee?

201
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,624
Just give them a chakra
sample like everyone
else so we can move
on to the physical.

202
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:41,457
I cannot... I am afraid
it is no use...

203
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,924
Even if this is supposed
to be for a health exam...

204
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,190
I just... cannot!

205
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:54,424
Don't tell me! There's
something really wrong
with you that you haven't
told us about, isn't there?!

206
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:59,024
It is true... I did not
take a bath yesterday...

207
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:05,824
Before physicals I take a bath,
have a nice chat with my friend
rubber ducky, and change into
clean underpants, but I forgot!

208
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,357
Are you kidding?
That's it?

209
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,590
I get it, Lee!

210
00:14:09,624 --> 00:14:13,224
The only thing more important
than wearing the right underwear
into battle is wearing the right
underwear to the doctor!

211
00:14:13,257 --> 00:14:14,757
Yes, exactly!

212
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,657
In fact, it reminds
me of a story I read
a long time ago...

213
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:32,257
[sigh] Tomorrow they are
doing physical exams at
the castle, but I have no
underpants to wear!

214
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:38,157
This tattered old pair
is far too embarrassing.
I would not be able to
face the doctor!

215
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,790
Who are you?

216
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:42,157
<i>Wait! The Wizard,</i>
<i>Guy Sensei!?</i>

217
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,857
Have no fear, Lee! I'm
here to help you!
Pippity Poppity Poo!

218
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:54,390
[gasp] No way! These
boxers are so
incredibly stylish!

219
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:58,824
With those, you'll be the
belle of the ball- er, I
mean, belle of the physical.

220
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,757
However, the spell will
only stay in effect
til midnight.

221
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,424
After that, they'll turn
back into your old briefs
with so many holes they're
basically one big hole.

222
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:07,590
Understood!

223
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,257
Oh! I will meet
the famous doctor!

224
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,890
Soon, she will put
her stethoscope on
my chest...

225
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:22,157
All right! Next..!

226
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,390
Hello my love!

227
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,357
[clock chiming]

228
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,224
No! It is
midnight already!?

229
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:28,290
Ah!

230
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,457
Hey, wait! Come
back here!

231
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,957
Doctor Sakura!

232
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,924
Are these..?

233
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:44,157
And after that encounter,
the doctor wandered the
country, far and wide-
and tall!

234
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,257
...searching for the
one man who fit
perfectly into the
boxers left behind.

235
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,657
When at last she
found him, the two
lived happily ever
after.

236
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,657
Come on! That book's
never been written!

237
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,090
What do we do? I had
no idea that we were
going to be having a
physical today!

238
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,857
Konohamaru, you
mean, you too?!

239
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,157
My only chance is
the Sexy Jutsu!

240
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:08,124
Hey! Not me!

241
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:12,057
You have it wrong,
Konohamaru! You look
more stylish than the
real Tenten.

242
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,490
Ughh...

243
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:16,257
Naruto told me that
it's a good thing to
embellish the truth
sometimes!

244
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,757
Grr!

245
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,957
I've heard everything
you've been talking about.

246
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,524
Guy Sensei!

247
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:24,857
Now, I can't just
magically conjure
you up a pair of
fresh underwear...

248
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,424
But here's the
next best thing...

249
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:28,890
...My freshly laundered
traditional fundoshi!

250
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:31,590
Wow! Thank you so
much, Guy Sensei!

251
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:34,190
I'll put it on
right away!

252
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,590
Not while you still
look like me you won't!

[groan]

254
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:42,790
First up is
the eye exam!

255
00:16:42,824 --> 00:16:44,690

Right!

259
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,724
And here?

He got all of
them wrong!

264
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,957
No, wait! I get what's
going on here! He's

Okay! Right, left,

Left eye clear at
38,701.

That is nice
work, Neji!

272
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,757
Okay! Next, a
hearing test.

273

No, not sparring!
Are you nuts?!

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,057
Oh, my mistake.
Very well then.

277
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,557
Guts!

278
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,090
It's "hearing!" And
you stretched the joke
too far, even for you!

279
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:53,990
We're going to test
how well your ears
work, you understand!?

No! Not butt temperature!

288
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:27,790
What kind of physical is
this, anyway!? It's more
like a sketch comedy test!

289
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,324
Now we'll measure
you're height!

Alright! I bet I
can beat you in

00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:41,290
If I can beat Naruto, Sakura
will perform my physical in a
fancy exam room with a view
of the night sky!

293
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:46,490
Heh heh! I'll beat
Bushy Brow this year
for sure!

294
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:48,290
[groaning]

295
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:52,890
That is a bold move!
But I will not be
left behind by him!

296
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,324
[shouting]

297
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:58,690
[woozy groans]

298
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:00,324
Try to beat that!

299
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,824
Oh, I will!
It's on now!

300
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:07,357
[grunting]

301
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,290
[gasp] I have
to push myself!

302
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:16,490
[woozy groans]

303
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:17,624
One more!

304
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,724
[woozy grunts]

305
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:25,357
Hematomas don't
count, you two fools!

306
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:30,924
You got more lumps than
me, Naruto. I admit you
are a strong competitor.

307
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,524
Next is a health
survey.

308
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:38,190
It's about time!

309
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:39,757
Sakura!?

310
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,457
They must be having you help
with the physicals because
you know medical ninjutsu!

311
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,657
Or cause you have your
own steth-o-thingie.

312
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,624
Sakura is going
to do my exam!

313
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:51,590
Okay, maybe it's not a
fancy room with a view,
but still...!

314
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,424
She is finally going to
listen to my heartbeat!

315
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:57,657
And at last she will hear
that it beats only for her!

316
00:19:58,624 --> 00:19:59,890
You're up, Lee!

317
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:00,957
Right!

318
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,624
{stretch]

319
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,924
Okay, take a deep
breath for me.

320
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,624
[inhaling]

321
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:13,957
No, Lee, not that
deep! Just breathe
like a normal
person, would ya!?

322
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,890
Okay!

323
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,324
[inhale]

324
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:21,157
Huh? Wait...
Is that...

325
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,024
The Make-Out Tactics
Theme? It's, "I only
wanna make out with you?"

326
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:29,190
I will express my feelings
for Sakura with the rhythm
of my own heartbeat!

327
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:32,324
Wow, he is rocking
some pretty phat beats.

328
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:39,557
Hm, looks like they really are
holding physical exams today,
after all. This is our chance!

329
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,724
Man, that guy is
such a doofus!

330
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:45,957
We're not concerned with
them! We're just supposed to
steal their chakra samples!

331
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:50,357
Thanks! We'll be
taking that box
of chakra!

332
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,190
That's right! Fresh chakra
will bring us a pretty penny
on the black market!

333
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:56,490
People buy and
sell chakra, too?

334
00:20:56,524 --> 00:21:03,224
You're not taking anything..!
Woah... I used up too much
chakra this morning. I have
hardly any energy left at all!

335
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:06,024
Me too, I must have
given up too much...

336
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:09,524
Neji! No!

337
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:13,324
Heh! Thanks for the
free chakra, suckers!

338
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,190
Get back here!

339
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:15,824
Leave it to
me, Sakura!

340
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:23,057
Quick, Konohamaru! The
time has now come to
put all of your combat
training to work!

341
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,857
Right! The Rasenken!

342
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,224
Naruto! Throw us like
you would a Rasengan
Shuriken!

343
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:32,090
Oh? Yeah!

344
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,124
Rasenken!!!

345
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,790
[running]

346
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:42,790
[screams]

347
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:44,957
Yeah! We got em!

348
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,724
Yes!

349
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:49,890
Sakura! We have retrieved
all of the chakra samples!

350
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:53,357
Ahh! But what happened
to them all!?

351
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,324
Smushing 'em together and
carrying 'em back in one
big lump was easier!

352
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:02,624
<i>(Narrator)</i>
Afterward, the village enacted a
<i>rule that no chakra samples</i>
could be bigger than a spoonful

353
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:06,824
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>And once they enacted that</i>
<i>rule, all was well in the Leaf.</i>

354
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:50,665
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Guy Sensei, what's with the</i>
<i>tent? Are you camping out for</i>
<i>the next training session?</i>

355
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:56,831
<i>Nope, next week is- "The Leaf</i>
<i>Village Sports Meet" and</i>
"Chicken Fights are Part of the
<i>Thrill of Youth."</i>

356
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:59,131
(Guy)
I have but one job!

357
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,765
(Tenten)
To prepare for the meet?

358
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,831
(Guy)
No! To stay up all
night preparing myself to
see my pupils victorious!

359
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:05,906
<i>Please wait! Guy Sensei, if you</i>

360
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:07,928
<i>Guy Sensei,
if you are not here,</i>

361
00:24:07,928 --> 00:24:12,365
<i>who will make my special lunch
with the little octopus made out of sausages!?</i>

362
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:15,498
(Tenten)
Um, well I guess
I could...
