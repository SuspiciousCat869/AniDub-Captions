1
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:57,343
<i>It's getting colder every</i>
<i>day. I hope no one's</i>
<i>gotten sick!</i>

2
00:01:57,543 --> 00:02:01,576
<i>[coughing]</i>

3
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,543
Whoa, what's the matter
with you, Lee?

4
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:09,643
I--I think I might
be coming down with
a cold.

5
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:13,210
That's peculiar. Seemed
like you were fine
yesterday.

6
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:16,410
Yeah, really. Didn't
you eat two bowls of
ramen, a plate of fried

7
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:17,876
rice, and grilled liver
yesterday?

8
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,543
I, uh...

9
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:21,910
<i>Then you took a nap and</i>
<i>did a thousand sit-ups</i>
<i>after you woke up?</i>

10
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:23,276
Well, you see...

11
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:26,910
Last night, as part of my
training, I ate a bunch
of ice cream while

12
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,643
standing naked under a
waterfall.

13
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:33,310
What kind of training is
that? And why do that at
this time of year in the
first place?

14
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:37,243
I think it is because
I peed on an earthworm
on the way home from my
training.

15
00:02:37,276 --> 00:02:41,243
Are you crazy? That has
nothing to do with catching
a cold or training!

16
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:45,676
Whatever the cause may
be, the fact is my cold
is only getting worse! I
need to lie down in the

17
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,810
warm, sterile office of a
doctor and recuperate!

18
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:48,710
Huh...

19
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:50,443
If you say so.

20
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,443
<i>Sakura's My Nurse!</i>

21
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:05,910
I apologize for taking
time away from your
training. I appreciate
your help.

22
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:10,443
But I can make it on my
own from here, Tenten.
You should go home and
keep honing your skills.

23
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:14,443
Nonsense. I've come
this far. I'm more than
happy to stay with you.

24
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:19,210
No way! Training time is
much too valuable, I
could not bear to impinge
on it! Please!

25
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:23,176
You're acting strange.
Is there some reason you
don't want me to be here?

26
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,610
Oh! No! Of course not!
Don't be silly! [coughing]

27
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:29,476
Then what's the big deal?

28
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,410
I'll go get you checked
in. Be right back.

29
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,176
<i>Next patient, please!</i>

30
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:37,743
Oh! Lee and Tenten! Hi!

31
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,376
Sakura? What're you doing
here?

32
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,210
Well, Lady Tsunade is out
today. So I'm working
as the nurse on duty
in her place.

33
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:46,710
Oh, really?

34
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:48,243
Sakura!

35
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:49,810
<i>Lee, what's</i>
<i>wrong with you?</i>

36
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,143
Well, you see...

37
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:57,776
Unfortunately, I seem to
have come down with a bad
cold. [sneezing]

38
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,743
You too, huh? Seems to be
going around.

39
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:02,143
It does?

40
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,610
<i>Naruto?</i>

41
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:09,843
Hey there, Bushy-Brows.
[coughing]

42
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:16,276
<i>So level with me... Are you</i>
<i>faking this whole being sick</i>
<i>thing just so you can hang</i>
<i>out with Sakura?</i>

43
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,576
How could you even
suggest something like
that? I would never do
such a thing!

44
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,510
<i>You mean to imply that I</i>
<i>sat naked under a</i>
<i>waterfall eating ice</i>
<i>cream for reasons other</i>

45
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:28,743
<i>than serious training?</i>
<i>And then went out of my</i>
<i>way to pee on a night</i>
<i>crawler for some</i>

46
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:31,410
<i>unscrupulous motive?</i>

47
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:35,243
And then the next day I
somehow awoke still
feeling perfectly healthy?!

48
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:39,710
Where I was left with no
choice... but to skip
training and fake being
sick in a last-ditch

49
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:41,643
effort to have Sakura
care for me?

50
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:43,443
Is that what you're
saying?

51
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:45,643
You totally just
confessed.

52
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:47,843
No! I completely blew it!

53
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,743
Great minds think alike,
it seems.

54
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,810
So you are not really
sick, either?

55
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:55,410
[chuckling]
Well, maybe.

56
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,743
What're you two chatting
about?

57
00:04:57,776 --> 00:05:00,710
[coughing]
Nothing! Nothing!

58
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:06,743
Just lying here, being
sick! Tenten, you should
really get back to your
training! [coughing]

59
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,343
I'm getting the feeling
that I'm not wanted
here.

60
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,810
Oh! No! Of course not!

61
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:16,676
We are in serious trouble
here, Naruto. I think
Tenten suspects that we
are not really sick!

62
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,710
If the truth comes out,
we're dead!

63
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,610
We have to keep up this
charade!

64
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:24,710
Agreed! No matter what it
takes! No matter what it
costs!

65
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:28,676
Let's see if you've got
fevers. Time to take your
temperature!

66
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,176
Our temperature?

67
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,843
<i>We will now take your</i>
<i>temperature!</i>

68
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,576
Those with normal temps
will be taken in for
questioning!

69
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,376
Here it comes. The first
checkpoint you stumble
across on "Faker's
Highway."

70
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,276
Checking the body
temperature!

71
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,210
Many who have attempted
to travel down Faker's
Highway met their untimely
demise at this place!

72
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,143
36.2 degrees? Ignorant
simpleton!

73
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:54,576
No one with a normal
temperature may pass this
checkpoint! Got it?

74
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:59,910
One needs to have a
temperature of at least
at 37 degrees... before
they may even glimpse at

75
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,310
the promised land!

76
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:03,310
[panicking]

77
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:07,310
We need to think of
something fast! We
can't allow them to see
through our clever plan yet!

78
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:10,876
Ninja Art, Thermometer
Friction Fire!

79
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:14,176
<i>Be honest: we've all done</i>
<i>this at least once,</i>
<i>right?</i>

80
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,276
That should do it!

81
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,243
Wow.. 37.8, huh... Yep,
you're a little feverish.

82
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:23,610
Okay, Lee. You're next.

83
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:28,543
<i>Didja see my amazing</i>
<i>ninja art, Bushy-Brows?</i>
<i>Totally worked! So,</i>
<i>what've you got?</i>

84
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:32,510
I will not give up so
easily! Now, for the
moment of truth!

85
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,376
[straining]

86
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:45,210
Nice one, Bushy-Brows!
You raised your temperature
with the fire of burning
passion!

87
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:48,543
A fever like that is much
more serious than just a
common cold!

88
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,710
Idiot! Idiot!

89
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,676
Hey, guys! What's up?
How you feeling?

90
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,143
<i>Whoooooaaa!</i>

91
00:06:55,176 --> 00:06:56,410
We just stopped by to
check in.

92
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:58,210
This melon looks
delicious!

93
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,043
Aww, thanks you guys!
You shouldn't have!

94
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:04,676
I didn't really want to,
it was kind of a drag.
But Choji wouldn't take
no for an answer.

95
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,343
Yeah, I thought we
could all split it.

96
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:08,810
It will be tasty! Thank
you!

97
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:10,510
<i>What's going on?</i>

98
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:13,210
These two clowns seem
pretty healthy to me.

99
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:16,510
You're right. They
certainly have a healthy
appetite.

100
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,343
Oh, crap!

101
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:24,743
<i>Fictitious Labyrinth! A</i>
<i>maze many heroes have</i>
<i>entered, never to return!</i>

102
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:28,943
Within lies a trap of
epic proportions: The
Friendly Visit!

103
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:31,776
<i>If you choose to reach</i>
<i>for the delicious</i>
<i>melon...</i>

104
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,910
Then you've proven how
eager you are to eat,
which means you must be
faking!

105
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:37,210
[gasping]

106
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,876
What a complete draaaag!

107
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,243
If our illusion is
revealed, then it's game
over!

<i>Shikamaru is a genius</i>

109
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:53,710
Looks like we'll just
have to endure this
visit.

110
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:55,510
<i>Hold on. What if--?</i>

111
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,143
Well, if you're not
hungry, we'll just eat
it ourselves.

112
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:01,176
Don't wanna let that
baby go to waste, you
know?

<i>...Choji will eat the</i>

114
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:05,776
Uh, well, I--

115
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,376
I would like a piece of
that melon.

116
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,210
What did you say? No!
Wait1 It's too dangerous!

117
00:08:11,243 --> 00:08:13,743
Ah! So you do have an
appetite.

118
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:19,443
To be honest, no, not
really. But I want to do
my best to get over this
cold as soon as possible.

119
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:24,143
And that means I need to
give my body the proper
nourishment it deserves
whether I like it or not!

120
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:25,743
Whoa! Are you serious?

121
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,176
So give this sick man
some melon! Now!

122
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,376
Eeeek!

123
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,810
Idiot! Idiot!

124

<i>My melon.</i>

Come on, stop crying.
Just let it go.

126
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,776
Yup! Gotta stay
nourished, even when you
don't wanna eat, you know?!

127
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,210
Indeed. I have zero
appetite, but the body
needs nutrients to heal
itself!

128
00:08:45,243 --> 00:08:47,276
The sacrifices one makes!

129
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,443
Hey, is it just my
imagination or do the two
of them seem like they're not
the least bit sick at all?

130
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:57,143
Now that you mention it,
there's something I wanna
confirm.

131
00:08:57,176 --> 00:09:00,510
I think we are in the
clear now, Naruto. We did
it!

132
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:05,176
We sure did! Now we just
need to wait and let
Sakura wait on us hand
and foot.

133
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,343
<i>Hey, guys! How're you</i>
<i>two doing?</i>

134
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:08,610
Feeling any better?

135
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:12,910
Maybe, but we are still
in no condition to be out
yet.

136
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:17,910
Yeah, I feel terrible. We
need Sakura to nurse us
back to health.

137
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:21,310
Oh, is that so? Well, if
you want to be on the
road to recovery...

138
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,643
... then you're both
gonna need your shots.

Did you say shots?!

140
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:26,610
Huh?!

141
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:27,910
[evil laughing]

142
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,510
It won't hurt. Not
much, anyway.

143

00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:39,876
Naruto, please. Stay
calm.

145
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,210
If we back down now, then
all our hard work will
have been in vain! Focus!

146
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:46,310
But we're seriously
facing needles here!

147
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:48,176
Yes, I know.

148
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,576
But even when facing
needles, we must stick to
our plan. If we do not
stick out, we will be

149
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,843
safe from any harm.

150
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,876
Huh? What do you mean by
that?

151
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,576
<i>[bell ringing]</i>

152
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,710
Okay, class. Who knows
the answer?

153
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,643
Me! Me! I do! I do!

154
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:09,176
Man, I have no idea. But
if I don't raise my hand,
I'll stick out and she'll
pick me. Then again, if I

155
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,410
do raise it she could
call my bluff and pick me
anyway.. Bushy-Brow?

156
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:18,843
Whoa! He's got his hand
at just the right height.
I can't tell if he's
raising it or not!

157
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:21,610
There's no way she'll
pick him. Brilliant!

158
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:22,876
[grinning]

159
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,443
Remember: If we do not
get caught, we do not get
shots!

160
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:29,476
I love this plan. I am so
in.

161
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,443
Yes? What's your
answer, Hinata?

162
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:34,243
Yes!

163
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:37,510
Okay I see how it works!
If we don't get caught...

164
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,343
... then we do not
get shots!

165
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,710
<i>Ah, that makes sense.</i>

166
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:42,476
Yeah. Good plan.

167
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,843
Too bad... it'll
never work!!

168
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:50,176
[trembling]

169
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,676
[screaming]

170

<i>Properly faking an</i>

<i>challenge for anyone.</i>

171
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:59,276

<i>imitate these two!</i>

172
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:12,153
[chatting]

173
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:17,953
<i>Everyone's seen a display</i>
<i>like this before, right?</i>
<i>Yes. These are campaign</i>
<i>posters.</i>

174
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:21,820
<i>And from the looks of</i>
<i>them, I'd say it's</i>
<i>election time in the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf.</i>

175
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:29,086
That's right! The
long-awaited voting for
the Leaf Village Popularity
contest, takes place tomorrow.

176
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,353
Earlier today, our
network took a poll of
likely voters to see where
everyone currently stands.

177
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:39,986
In first place, with a
commanding lead over the
second-place candidate...

178
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,720
Sasuke!

179
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:45,986
There's no doubt he'll
place extremely high when
the actual voting takes
place tomorrow.

180
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,120
<i>What the heck?!</i>

181
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,153
I am the main character
here! Sasuke has been in
the show only a couple
of times!

182
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:52,486
Why is he in
first place?!

183
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,053
Well, I suppose it's
because he's just that
cool? Know what I mean?

184
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:01,353
Fine! Whatever! So what
place did I come in, huh?

185
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:05,853
Looks like you didn't
rank.

186
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:11,253
[groaning]
You have to be
kidding me!!

187
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,953
<i>One Vote for Rock Lee!</i>

188
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:29,386
I call to order the
traditional meeting of
experts on the night
before voting day.

189
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,953
Any opening thoughts?

190
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:35,353
My first thought is this:
Sasuke Uchiha placing
first is a problem,
is it not?

191
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:40,453
Indeed! He hasn't been a
resident of our village
for some time now! It
doesn't make any sense!

192
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:45,286
This is a popularity
contest, gentlemen.
There's no rule stating
that the candidates have

193
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,353
to live in the village.

194
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:49,386
What about the rumors
that Orochimaru is
running?

195
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,353
Rock Lee didn't even rank
in the polls! It's a huge
issue!

196
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:57,020
Agreed. I can't believe
our main character's this
unpopular.

197
00:12:57,053 --> 00:13:01,820
<i>I hate to suggest this,</i>
<i>but perhaps it's time we</i>
<i>considered replacing him.</i>

198
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,553
Regretfully, I concur.

199
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:06,320
No. Such a knee-jerk
reaction is too rash.

200
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,820
He doesn't take his
position seriously
enough!

201
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:13,695
Oh, really?! Sponsors will
be dropping like flies if
we don't make an adjustment!

202
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:14,720
No! This is awful!

203
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,220
If this keeps up, I will
lose my job!

204
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:20,186
The fact that you
didn't even rank is
a bad sign.

205
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,153
How long a show lasts is
tied directly to the
popularity of its main
character.

206
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:29,520
I do not understand it.
Why am I so unpopular?
Wait a minute!

207
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:33,453
Does my campaign poster
make me look stupid?

208
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:35,253
What the heck is this
monstrosity?!

209
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:37,986
Couldn't they have
taken a better picture?
Geez.

210
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:42,320
The flash was so bright,
I could not help but
squint the whole time.

211
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:44,553
This was the best one
they were able to get.

212
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:46,586
You should've just kept
them shut.

213
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,853
Hey, Tenten, your
picture...

214
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:52,553
<i>You look a lot cuter here</i>
<i>than in real life.</i>

215
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:54,353
Now that you mention
it...

216
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:57,153
<i>Was this picture,</i>
<i>uh, well...</i>

217
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:58,086
... processed in some
way?

218
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,953
I, uh, well-- Maybe, but
so what if it was?!

219
00:14:02,986 --> 00:14:06,253
I'm a girl. I'm allowed a
few digital enhancements,
aren't I?

220
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:08,953
It's not like I'm
completely unrecognizable!

221
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:10,386
A few?!

222
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,620
Oh, just shut up and
leave me alone!

223
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:16,520
It appears they made your
Leaf symbols bigger. Those
enhancers do some amazing
work!

224
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:19,086
That's not what they
edited, you idiot!

225
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,286
And it's a subtle
difference, but your hair
buns are smaller, too.

226
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,186
That's not it either!
What's wrong with you?

227
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,586
Tenten, I must ask: are
you aiming for first
place so that you can
take my job away from me?

228
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,486
No, of course not!
Don't be silly!

229
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,920
<i>Ding ding ding!</i>

230
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:34,486
Huh?

231
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,786
Naruto!

232
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:39,886
I hate to break it to
you, Bushy-Brow, but
every character wants
the lead role.

233
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,253
No way. You too, Naruto?

234
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:46,853
Wait a minute! Are you in
danger of losing the
coveted lead role in the
main series?

235
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,953
Kakashi's really popular
these days.

236
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:50,153
Yes. Itachi is, too.

237
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:53,320
Don't say another word!
I'm gonna take over this
show, too!

238
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:55,453
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me!

239
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:57,953
Keep the seat warm for me
until tomorrow!

240
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,053
[growling]

241
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:04,253
I have to come up with a
way to win this contest!
My honor and my job are
at stake here!

242
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,886
<i>The next morning, the</i>
<i>villagers lined up and</i>
<i>the voting began.</i>

243
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,386
<i>Naruto! Naruto!</i>

244
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,986
Naruto Uzumaki! That's
Naruto Uzumaki! Cast your
votes for Naruto Uzumaki!

245
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,086
Of course his campaign
would be really loud and
flashy. That's just like
him.

246
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,920
So that is his game, huh?
If Naruto is going to be
loud and flashy,

247
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:25,553
I will fight back by
relating to the common
man!

248
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,186
That'll be 530 yen.

249
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,186
Oh, uh...

250
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,220
Huh? Uh, gee, give me
just a moment, please.

251
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:35,053
Come on! Hurry it up,
will you?

252
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:36,353
What's going on?

253
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:37,986
I am so sorry!

254
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:42,320
There it is. I have a
coupon I wanted to use.

255
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:47,086
Sorry, sir. Read the fine
print. That coupon
expired yesterday.

256
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,986
[groaning]

257
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,320
I admit that's a common
and annoying occurrence,
but it's got nothing to
do with the contest!

258
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:55,086
Then my new plan will be
to compete on policy.

259
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,453
What do you mean by that?

260
00:15:56,486 --> 00:16:01,286
Yeah! When I am voted the
most popular character in
Leaf Village...

261
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,086
I will increase ratings
to 200%!

262
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,586
What the heck does that
even mean?! That's
mathematically
impossible!

263
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,320
I will make the comic a
bestseller!

264
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:14,420
And it will win the
Akutagawa Award, the
Naoki Award, and the
Nobel Prize for Literature!

265
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:18,886
Those prizes and awards
are for novels! Comics
don't even qualify for
them!

266
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,386
Every DVD of the show
will be absolutely free!

267
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,920
Nu-uh! That's definitely
not happening!

268
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:27,486
So this plan of yours is
to just make a bunch of
promises you can't
possibly keep?

269
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,186
Well, yes. From what I
have seen, I thought that
is what everyone does.

270
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,086
Careful. If any actual
politicians heard that,
they'd be pretty
miffed.

271
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Huh?

272
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:40,620
We're here in front of
the polling station with
our first report of the
Popularity Contest.

273
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:45,353
Whoa! What the heck is
going on here? The picture
shrank and there is a blue
border!

274
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:49,853
We're using this ticker
to report th
e updates and
results of the voting as
quickly as possible.

275
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:53,286
So no matter what show is
airing, people can just
look at the bottom of the

276
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,886
screen to see who's
winning, huh?

277
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,986
Aahh! Well, that is neat
and all, but do you not
think it is a bit too
cramped?

278
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,186
You're not supposed to be
on that part of the
screen, idiot!

279
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,586
Candidate Lee is in a
real pinch.

280
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,120
What's that? Oh! It
seems we're getting an
update!

281
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,320
<i>The results are in</i>
<i>already?</i>

282
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:14,553
W-Wow!

283
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:17,886
<i>We are predicting that</i>
<i>Candidate Neji Hyuga will</i>
<i>take fourth place!</i>

284
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,886
That was fast!

285
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:23,953
Fourth place, huh...
That sounds about right.

286
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:28,120
That seems quite
ambitious! How can they
predict that when the
polls just opened?

287
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:30,086
Could it possibly
be...?

288
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,486

We are here to prove that
this TV station is in
possession of a time
machine!

291
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,286
You moron! Time machines
don't exist! And stop
rifling through people's
drawers already!

292
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,086
<i>She's right, of course.</i>
<i>There's no time machine</i>

Wait, I get it!

295
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:03,053
Basically, they round up
all the money and gift
cards they get over the
holidays, and then

296
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:06,253
carefully plan out what
they can buy with it.
Brilliant!

297
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:11,120
<i>That would be a smart</i>

<i>not what's happening</i>

298
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:14,120
Whoa! Naruto's
popularity is shooting
way up!

299
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:15,453
Yikes! It is?!

300
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:20,086
[chuckling]
My, my. Things aren't
looking so good for you.

301
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,053
As expected from the main
show's main character.

302
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:24,986
Seriously. No surprise
there.

303
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,386
Is this one of your
campaign fliers?

304
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:36,853
Scantily clad bikini
girls? I see... So this
is the secret to your
popularity.

305
00:18:36,886 --> 00:18:39,153
Uh, does that really sway
anyone?

306
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:43,453
I am sure there is a
sizable demographic who
would vote for stuff like
this.

307
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:48,320
However! While this may
help you win their votes,
it will never help you
win their hearts!

308
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:49,320
Wow, Lee...

309
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:51,120
Bushy-Brow...

310
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:57,420
I want to win supporters
honestly by being myself
and showing them I am a
man of the people.

311
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:02,320
Ha! Is that so? Let's see
what you've got, then!

312
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:05,520
You sure talked a big
game. Do you have a plan
to back it up?

313
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:07,053
You bet I do.

314
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:12,153
Look at this! I was able
to get some coupons for
several of the major
village shops and

315
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:15,986
included them with my
campaign flyer. The
people will love me
for this!

316
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,853
What do you think?!

317
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,520
There's not an honest
fiber in those coupons!
That flyer is completely
against the rules!

318
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:24,486
Well said!

319
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,253
Huh?

320
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:27,220
Hyyyaaahhhh!

321
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:28,986
Lee! You fool!

322
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,886
Guy Sensei! What
is wrong?

323
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,553
Lee! Why did you become a
ninja?

324
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:35,786
Huh?

325
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,853
Have you forgotten? A
ninja lives his life in
the shadows.

326
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:44,453
Even though he is
completely unseen, his
worth is measured by his
ability to do his duty

327
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:45,953
and complete the mission.

328
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:49,820
Oh, Guy Sensei... I was
wrong! I see now!

329
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:55,520
I will never be a great
ninja if I run around
worrying about silly things
like popularity contests!

330
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:56,520
That's right!

331
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:58,120
Thanks, Guy Sensei!

332
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:04,020
<i>And so, Lee forgot all</i>
<i>about the vote that was</i>
<i>going on and went back to</i>
<i>training.</i>

333
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:11,320
<i>But the contest</i>
<i>continued.</i>

334
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:17,186
We're here with
bittersweet news for
places 3 through 10.

335
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:21,886
So, Miss Katsuyu... Do
you have anything to say
about your placing 6th?

336
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,353
How in the world could I
rank lower than a slug? I
mean really?!

337
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:30,986
We've just tallied the
last votes for Candidate
Rock Lee. He ranks...

338
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,886
First! Incredible!

339
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,453
[OM laughter]

340
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:38,086
Yeah! All right, Lee!

341
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
You did it, Lee!

342
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:40,186
Woo hoo!

343
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,586
[cheering]

344
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,420
Why'd his popularity
shoot up so much?

345
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:53,553
Why do you think? The
sight of Lee working so
hard to better himself
moved the people.

346
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,553
He won their hearts.

347
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:59,286
We interviewed some
voters. Here's what
they had to say:

348
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,886
<i>"All that footage of Lee</i>
<i>training in the background</i>
<i>was really impressive!"</i>

349
00:21:05,053 --> 00:21:08,186
"He looked really cool
flitting in and out of
the shot!"

350
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,253
We heard similar things
from many others.

351
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:14,220
So you were trying to be
popular after all!

352
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:15,520
Very nice job, Lee!

353
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:16,886
Thank you, Guy Sensei!

354
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,053
Breaking news! In regards
to the voter tally
accumulated for Rock Lee,

355
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:26,386
it seems that an
egregious error has
taken place!

356
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:31,553
The correct results are
now in, and first
place...

357
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:36,253
Candidate Sasuke Uchiha!
Sasuke wins the
popularity contest!

358
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:41,920
Oh, wow... Was I really
that low?

359
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:46,853
Rock Lee ranked... well,
uh-- it seems he didn't
rank.

360
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,520
Un- Unranked...

361
