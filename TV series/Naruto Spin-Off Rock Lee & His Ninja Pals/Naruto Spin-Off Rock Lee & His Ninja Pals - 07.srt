00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:02,916
[growling]

2
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,649
Lord Orochimaru! What
happened-is something
wrong?!

3
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:14,916
It's finally ready. At
last, my new jutsu's
complete.

4
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:18,516
Well then...

5
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:24,849
We'll set out to crush
the Leaf, once and for
all!

6
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,616
<i>Listen up, everyone!</i>

7
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:42,282
Our mission today will be
guard duty!

8
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:43,716
<i>Oh? How come?</i>

9
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:48,682
The Village has been
pretty peaceful
lately. We're seeing
more tourists than usual.

10
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:52,849
So you three have been
chosen to help beef up
security at the entrance!

11
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,616
Yes, sir!

12
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:58,849
It will be hard
distinguishing potential
threats from ordinary
people based on sight alone.

13
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:02,216
Stay vigilant, but make
the people feel welcome,
too!

14
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,416
Understood!

15
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,582
And actually, I have an
idea!

16
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:08,249
Idiot! Idiot!

17
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:12,682
So, Lord Orochimaru...
What exactly is this new
jutsu?

18
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:16,849
This.

19
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:17,849
What is it?

20
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:21,382
A crystal orb linked to
an alternate dimension!

21
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:30,149
I need only release it
within the Hidden Leaf,
and the village will be
obliterated in mere moments!

22
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:32,682
Heh. How sublime.

23
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:37,716
<i>For those out of the</i>
<i>loop, this is Orochimaru.</i>
<i>He was once held in high</i>
<i>regard within the Leaf as</i>

24
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:44,682
<i>one of the Legendary</i>
<i>Sannin. But he was</i>
<i>eventually corrupted, and</i>
<i>no</i>
w uses his skills for evil!

25
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:46,282
Take a gander.

26
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:50,582
<i>Hey may not look like</i>
<i>it, but he's actually</i>
<i>crazy strong.</i>

27
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:51,516
[gasping]

28
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,749
[chatting]

29
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,749
What's going on around
here?

30
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:00,882
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

31
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,949
Okay! If I could please
have your attention for a
moment, I need Leaf villagers

32
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:06,882
to join the line
here on the left!

33
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,516
And if you are a visitor
or tourist, please step
over to the right!

34
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:13,516
It looks like they're
running everyone who
wants to enter the

35
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,782
village through
security checks, now!

36
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:17,649
What's the meaning of
this?!

37
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:22,282
We know. Why do it this
way, you're asking.

38
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:27,882
We figured splitting the
groups up was the best way
to ensure a painless screening
process for everyone.

39
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,682
Whatever hoops they've
set up couldn't
possibly be worse than
going through all the

40
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:33,582
customs rigmarole at the
airport.

41
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:38,549
We don't have airports
in this anime... You're
breaking the established
conventions of the show,

42
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,182
ya know that right?

43
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:44,549
If we disguise ourselves
as tourists and blend in,
they'll wave us right
through.

44
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:48,416
Gotcha. So all we have
to do is act casual and
we're in.

45
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,916
[chatting]

46
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,916
It's like we're
invisible.

47
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,916
This is your idea of
acting casual, huh?

48
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,749
Look at how casually I'm
wearing this hibiscus
flower!

49
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:04,216
<i>I don't think that word</i>
<i>means what you think it</i>
<i>does.</i>

50
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:07,882
At any rate, we'll be
fine if we follow this
guidebook.

51
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,416
<i>Um, excuse me.</i>

52
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,282
<i>Are you two gentlemen</i>
<i>trying to enter the Leaf</i>
<i>Village?</i>

53
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:15,182
Oh, crap! We need a
cover story!

54
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:17,749
I'd...like to try your
tourism, please?

55
00:05:17,782 --> 00:05:20,816
<i>Smooth move... What, did</i>
<i>ya get that in your</i>
<i>guidebook?!</i>

56
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:22,949
Little vacation,
that cool?

57
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:25,716
I think Orochimaru's
brain is on vacation.

58
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:28,916
I don't like how this
other guy keeps mumbling
to himself...

59
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:32,249
Okay, okay, no problem at
all!

60
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:35,282
Welcome, gentlemen, to
the Hidden Leaf Village!

61
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:38,882
<i>This kid's dumb as a</i>
<i>brick. We might actually</i>
<i>pull this off.</i>

62
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,882
Oh, sorry. Need to see
your passport, OK?

63
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,582
<i>What's a passport?</i>
<i>Whatever it is, we</i>
<i>don't have one.</i>

64
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:49,482
Of course, my
Passport. How silly of
me. Here you go.

65
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,882
That's a video camera!
We don't have those
here!

66
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,282
Ahem. Sorry, my friend
doesn't travel much.

67
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,782
No worries. We will just
need to check you before
you can enter the
village, OK?

68
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:05,349
We have had some trouble
lately with illegal
ninjutsu users, as well
as a rash of pirated

69
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:07,582
taijutsu and genjutsu.

70
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:12,782
I completely understand.
A rash of any kind is no
laughing matter.

71
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:18,482
Now before you try to
come up with a punchline,
we have a no joke policy
in the security line!

72
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:23,382
Rule number one, we do not
allow anyone to carry
lighters or matches past
this checkpoint.

73
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,482
You should also know we
have a strict limit of
ten kilograms of chakra
per person.

74
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:30,516
Wait, wait hold up a
second, is that a little
or a lot?

75
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:32,749
I mean, seriously,
can chakra even be
weighed?

76
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:36,582
Please separate all
ninjutsu into
250-milliliter
containers!

77
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:40,949
You gotta put ninjutsu in
containers?! This show
doesn't make any
sense!!

78
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:43,649
Heh. Guess we have
no other choice.

79
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:47,416
And why do you have it
all prepared like you
expected this?!

80
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,916
Oh, boy. Am I the only
person here who hasn't
the faintest idea what's
going on?

81
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,349
For crying out loud!
You're ALL idiots!

82
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,249
Idiot, idiot!

83
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,749
And last but not least,
we need to scan your
luggage over here.

84
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,516
Uch, there are no words
for how low this show has
sunk.

85
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,416
Byakugan!

86
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,882
Then why do we even have
a conveyor belt?

87
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,582
I will not be outdone!

88
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:10,616
Byakugan!

89
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:13,182
Knock it off, Lee,
that's never gonna
work!

90
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,449
Just a moment, something
has set off the sensor!

91
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:21,416
Bleh-it was
probably this.

92
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,582
You can't bring that
blade into the village!
And why was it in your
mouth, anyway?!

93
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:32,682
The orb is in my
suitcase, but these
goodie-goodies will have
no idea what it really is!

94
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:36,316
Just a minute.

95
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:42,816
Did you honestly believe
you'd be able to fool me?
What exactly are you
hiding?

96
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:44,816
Does he suspect the
orb?!

97
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:49,816
Or has he seen through my
disguise?!

98
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:56,516
You can confess, or we
can do this the hard way.

99
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:01,449
Looks like the jig is
up..!

100
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:08,616
Yes, I am Orochimaru.
I commend you for catching
me, but playtime is ove--

101
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:09,916
I said, what is this?

102
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,516
I... only read it
for the articles?

103
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,449
That was it?!!!

104
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,449
I mean--uh--uh--

105
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,249
Idiot, idiot.

106
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:25,516
[chatting]

107
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:29,316
Apologies, my lord. That
was all my fault.

108
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:31,816
What's done is done.
However...

109
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:36,482
We've one more
card to play.

110
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,549
Huh?

111
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,582
Is this really going to
work?

112
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:50,482
We've got no luggage to
check, and I've hidden
the orb in my pocket.
It'll be fine.

113
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:54,182
Excuse me, sir. We will
need to do a security
inspection.

114
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:59,416
I am a ninja from the
Hidden Ridge Village,
traveling all the nations
as part of my training.

115
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:00,682
Can we see your luggage?

116
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:05,216
I need no luggage for
this journey. Please,
allow me to pass.

117
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,882
W-wait! Just a moment!

118
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,649
What?

119
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:12,816
We're not just scanning
luggage here, sir.
We'll need to check
your person as well.

120
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:17,816
<i>Check my person..?? Ah</i>
<i>crud, they'll find me</i>
<i>under the coat for</i>
<i>sure..!</i>

121
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,316
We've had a lot of issues
with Counterfeit ninja.

122
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:25,816
<i>What's a counterfeit</i>
<i>ninja? What is he talking</i>
<i>about?</i>

123
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:28,882
So as a real ninja, you
should be capable of
basic techniques.

124
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,716
We will need you
to show us one.

125
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:35,216
<i>They said they were going</i>
<i>to check our person, not</i>
<i>give us a pat-down...</i>

126
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,516
<i>We just need to show</i>
<i>we're a real ninja.</i>

127
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,582
Ok! First off..! Fire
Style..!

128
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,816
... Matchmaking!

129
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,182
That's not a fire
technique, you just threw
lit matches..!

130
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:51,649
Fine. I'll show you my
ninjutsu!

131
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:55,882
Ouch! Ouch!

132
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,882
Hot..! Hot foot, Lord
Orochimaru!!

133
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:06,182
You should be aware that
we don't allow anyone to
bring lighters or matches
into the village.

134
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:10,182
Are you crazy, forget
about the matches, he's
actually on fire, Neji!

135
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:11,616
We have to put it out!

136
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:14,482
Water Style! Public
Waterway!

137
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:16,616
Agh! Don't get that on
me!

138
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,216
Huh..?

139
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:24,749
What are you looking
at?! I just spilled the
chakra while you were
hopping around, okay!

140
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:31,182
I'm sorry, how does one
spill Chakra exactly..?

141
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:35,716
Please separate all
liquids into
250-milliliter
containers.

142
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:37,916
Let us get you
dried off!

143
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:41,749
Wind Style: Evaporation
Rotation!

144
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:45,316
That move would really
help me dry off..!

Ok then! You're a bona

to release the orb within
the Leaf Village!

Oh, thank you.

Obviously, the plan
backfired and I
wound up here.

167
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:41,248
What kind of plan ends
with a mailman getting
thrown out with the

It was those wretched

Wait, those same three
again? I don't believe
it..!

No. I'm still conducting

them.

We'll see, then,
won't we?

178
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:26,215
I'll just have to expose
their weak points myself,
the little vermin.

179
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:31,715
They are obstacles
standing in my way... And
they must be obliterated.

180

Today's training will be
tough, everyone, so psych
yourselves up and follow
my lead!

Do we really have enough
free time to be training
right now?

Oh it'll be okay.

184
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,148
Naruto's team is covering
our shift for us today.

185
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:49,881
Since when do we work in
shifts?

186
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:53,381
As long as we've got the
day off, we should train
our butts off!

187
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,248
Then it's not a day
off!

188
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,581
There they are.

189
00:13:56,615 --> 00:13:59,881
What do you know. So
they're Might Guy's
students, are they?

190
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:03,815
Well then, no wonder
they're a pack of
raving eccentrics.

191
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:05,415
Okay, Lee...

192
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:09,681
Give it all you've got.
If you can land even a
single blow on me, then
you pass.

00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:10,881
Yes, Sensei!

Oh man, Lee looks ready
to rumble, huh.

195

He and Guy Sensei haven't
faced off in a while.

"... Looking forward
to seeing you soon."

right?

00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:23,381
Oh please, I'm not
jealous, are you crazy?!

00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:25,715
He can do whatever he
wants! I don't care!

help me here or what?!

off!

225

00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,915
You're too gullible, Lee!

[groaning]

228
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:50,981
Unfortunately, that's
what happens when you
drop your guard within
range of the enemy.

229
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,448
Sorry, Lee.

230
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:56,315
No way. You planned that
whole thing out?

231
00:15:56,348 --> 00:16:00,415
That's right. It was
all part of the new move
I've been developing.

232
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:03,248
The Smooth Operator Fist!

233
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:04,215
[grunting]

234
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,348
What... was I...
just... looking at?

235
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:11,315
Dunno. Maybe it was
some kind of sketch
comedy.

236
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:16,215
The Smooth Operator Fist
is a high level move,
Lee. Not only does it use
your power, but your

237
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:17,815
comrade's as well.

238
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:20,381
Woah! Guy Sensei, you are
incredible!

239
00:16:20,415 --> 00:16:25,881
Now listen, Lee, if you
really want to be a
strong ninja despite your
lack of ninjutsu, you

240
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:30,415
must make this move your
own and then refine until
it shines brighter than
the noon day sun!

241
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:34,415
Y-Yes, sir...

242
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:39,115
The main takeaway is that
the boy can't use
ninjutsu. Good to know.

243
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:44,815
He'll hardly be a
problem if his only
defense is taijutsu.
He'll fall to pieces

244
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:47,448
when he realizes who
he's up against.

245
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:50,081
Idiot..Idiot...

246
00:16:51,415 --> 00:16:57,815
How does Sensei expect me
to improve on that move
of his? There is no way.

247
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:58,850
Huh?

248
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:06,215
"Dearest Lee. I have
been admiring you from
afar for a very long time
now?!"

249
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:10,315
"... I'll be waiting for
you up on the mountain.
Counting the minutes
'til we talk!"

250
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:13,148
I-is this Guy Sensei
testing me again?!

251
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:20,715
Gwaauughhh!!! Then maybe
this one's from Sakura!

252
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,748
Does anybody know where
Lee went?

253
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:28,748
Gotta get there quick!
Please wait for meeeee!

254
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,348
Huh?

255

260
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,881
That's it. I'm Orochimaru!
Did you already forget?!

261
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,881
Oh! I am sorry! What are
you doing here?

262
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:56,348
Give that letter a read
and you'll understand.

263
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:58,015
This letter..?

264
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:02,148
Oh yeah! You didn't
happen to see a pretty
girl with pink hair
around here, did you?!

265
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,715
She wanted to talk to me
about something!

266
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:07,915
How can you be so
oblivious?!

267
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:09,315
What is that supposed to
mean?

268
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:14,415
It means Lord Orochimaru
was the one who sent that
letter, obviously.

269
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:15,815
[gasping]

270
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:18,915

understand.

00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:21,248
Yes

272
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:24,748
I am sorry! I already love
someone else!

00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:28,981
That's what you think
is going on here?! That
I have a thing for you,
you cretin?!

274
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:33,881
My ambition is to destroy
the Hidden Leaf Village,
and the first step in my
plan is to get ride of

275
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:35,981
you right here and now!

276
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,715
Not if I can help it!

277
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:41,281
A boy without any
ninjutsu is hardly a
match for me.

278
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,981
Well, we will see
about that. Watch this!

279
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:45,981
Snake Fist for the win!

280
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:51,848
Can your Snake Fist

Hey, DJ, gimme the mic!

295
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,915
[sighing]

296
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:43,981
Here I--

297
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:51,181
Even my Drunken Fist is
not enough...

298
00:19:51,215 --> 00:19:52,881
[chuckling]

299
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:55,915
How were you able to
summon a whole karaoke
bar?

300
00:19:55,948 --> 00:19:59,181
Well, that was fun, now
to enjoy my meal.

301
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:03,281
<i>I cannot give up yet.</i>
<i>There must be a way!</i>

302
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,981
<i>Lee.</i>

303
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:11,981
... If you really want to
be a strong ninja despite
your lack of ninjutsu,
you must make this move

304
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:16,948
your own and then refine
until it shines brighter
than the noon day sun!

305
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,048
<i>But how?</i>

306
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:23,181
You ran out of luck the
moment you opened that
letter.

307
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:28,148
Never fall prey to sweet
talk, it always ends
badly... As you can
see!

308
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:29,681
Wait, that letter!

309
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:32,248
Fall prey to sweet
talk?!

310
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,215
[gasping]
I have got it!

311
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:38,248
[roaring]

312
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:40,748
[screaming and grunting]

313
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:44,815
What is this?

314
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:47,248
Heh.

315
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:57,081
"I've admired you from
afar for a long time. I'll
be waiting for you behind
the gym after school."

316
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,397
Hmph.

317
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:03,915
Gym, auditorium, what's
the difference-- it's all
the same crock of---

318
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:07,181
Uh--

319
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:11,448
The Smooth Operator Fist
is all about camouflage!
I used the distraction to
call in back up!

320
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:14,681
Behold! Guy Sensei's
move, born anew!

321
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,715
The "Sweet Talk and Sour
Grapes Fist!"

322
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:20,881
[grunting]

323
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:23,281
Team Guy, let's give
Lee a hand!

324
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,181
Yes sir!

325
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:27,015
W-W-Woah woah woah wait!

326
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:29,348
[screaming]

327
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:36,981
I feel so ashamed. I
tried to refine Guy
Sensei's attack, but I
still needed help.

328
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:38,948
<i>Don't sweat it, Lee.</i>

329
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:43,715
No one ever became strong
overnight. Keep improving
one step at a time.

330
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:46,248
Your moves... and
yourself.

331
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:48,415
Right!

332
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:52,381
This from the guy in the
schoolgirl outfit.

333
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:54,181
[laughing]

334
00:21:54,215 --> 00:22:01,748
Just you wait. I'll
make that little
round-headed twit cry!!!

335
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:06,648
<i>And so, Lee and</i>
<i>Orochimaru take their</i>
<i>relationship to the next</i>
<i>level.</i>

336
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:50,716
We've taken over the
preview, Kabuto!

337
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:52,382
<i>Indeed.</i>

338
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:57,716
<i>Next time: "Even</i>
<i>Hokage's go bald" and</i>
<i>Orochimaru is persistent".</i>

339
00:23:57,749 --> 00:24:00,549
Me? Persistent?
Unthinkable!

340
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,516
<i>Of course not, my lord.</i>
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

341
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,282
I'll show those accursed
brats... I'll make all
their days a living
misery!

342
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:09,882
And you will help
me, Kabuto!

343
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:14,116
<i>As you wish, my Lord.</i>
<i>Persistent is an</i>
<i>understatement.</i>
