<i>to use ninjutsu, I cannot</i>
<i>afford to lose to anyone!</i>

6
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,556
Aw man, I wish
the boss were here.

7
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:22,123
I know.

8
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:27,556
No matter who I may
face, if I can defeat
all these ninja, no
one can stop me!

9
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:31,723
Even my genius teammate
Neji would have a hard
time defeating all of them!

00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:36,156
[gasp]

11
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,356
ARGHHH!!

12
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,356
-The boss!
-The boss!

-Sorry! We're going!
-Sorry! We're going!

Huh? What's
the matter, Lee?

15
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:55,623
Quality over
quantity!?

22

I did not need any
help. I could have
defeated that boss
on my own!n Huh?

00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:28,356
Tenten..?

24
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,389
Where could it
be, anyway?

25
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,556
What is the problem?

26
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,189
Oh, I just
dropped an important
picture around here.

27

Oh no, that's
terrible! We
will look!

28
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:40,989
Yeah, or I could just
ask Neji. He'll find
it in a snap with his
Byakugan!

29
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:43,256
Gah!

Neji again!?

34
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:55,456
That's right.

35
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,556
No! Please, just
leave this to me!

36
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:00,089
Actually, I possess
the Byakugan, too!

37
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:00,689
What?

[determined grunt]

39
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:07,456
Byakugan!!!

40
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:10,589
Just taping your eyes
open like that doesn't
let you use the Byakugan!

41
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:14,023
Huh? It is Sakura
and Naruto!

42
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:18,256
Hey! Alright, confess!
Who are you, you weirdo!?

43
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,423
Uhhh what!?
But I am me!

44
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:23,689
Yeah, cause that'll
convince him...

45
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:27,889
Look, Lee, just
drop this! You know
that you can't use
the Byakugan.

46
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:30,623
I mean, you can't
even use ordinary
ninjutsu!

47
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:33,489
Besides, Neji's a
straight up genius!

48
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,156
Yes, I know that.

49
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:38,989
That is why I have
struggled so hard
to perfect my Taijutsu
fighting skills...

50
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:42,923
None the less...
I will find a way
to defeat Neji!

51
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:44,156
Lee...

52
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,756
Bushy Brow?

53
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:49,356
I wondered where you
guys went. What are
you doing here?

54
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,523
Neji! I was just
looking for
something that
I lost.

55
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:55,689
(Thinking)
I must find that
picture before
Neji does!

56
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:57,689
This it? I
found it.

57
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:58,523
ARGHHH!!!!

58
00:04:58,556 --> 00:05:00,656
Wow! That
was so fast!

59
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:03,556
Hey! It's an old
picture of your team!

60
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,156
No way! Let
me see!

61
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,689
I'm going to
go home now.

62
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:15,089
Boy, Neji was such
a brat back then...

63
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:18,856
(Lee)
I remember. His words
were like a knife,
sharp and painful!

64
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:23,389
Nitwit, without
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu,
you're hardly a ninja.

65
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,289
Hm?

66
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,689
So, what,
you stupid?

67
00:05:26,723 --> 00:05:28,523
He said a lot of
stuff like that.

68
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:30,523
I did not mean
that! Ugh!

69
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:36,189
Nitwit, without a
credit card, you're
hardly a ninja.

70
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:39,623
So, what? You a
middle schooler?

71
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:43,023
He never said that!
And ninjas don't have
credit cards in the
first place!!

72
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,156
He sure has changed
since then...

73
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,923
Nowadays, Neji is a
much more considerate
and well-adjusted person.

74
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:51,023
He's become a very
dependable teammate.

75
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:53,689
Even back then, he was
already a prodigy...

76
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:58,356
And when he overcomes
his issues, I'm sure
he's going to go on
to achieve great things!

77
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,556
It's really cool!

78
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:01,189
-What did they say!?
-What did they say!?

79
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:04,923
Why must they make such
a big deal out of him
being such a big deal!?

80
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:09,356
Let's follow him around
and keep an eye on him.
We'll find out what a big
deal he really is!

81
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:13,789

He really is
a big deal...

86
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,056
Just another gift
the gods bestowed
upon him...

87
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:39,789
What are you talking
about!? What is going
on with you two!?

88
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:45,089
Neji wears boxers, and I
am still stuck wearing
tighty-not-so-whities!

89
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:48,156
That's what's bothering
you!? Then just go buy
your own boxers!!

90
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,523
And, he's more
of a man than me!

91
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:54,123
Forget manliness, you
should be worried that
you've lost your minds!

92
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:57,023
No! I will not
admit defeat yet!

93
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:59,789
I have only one
choice left...

94
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,789
Neji! I want to
fight you!

95
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:03,356
You what?

96
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,456
Despite your gifts,
I am not yet convinced
that you are superior
to me!

97
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:09,823
Come on, Lee. Stop
this foolishness.

98
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:13,123
I see... you are
just afraid that
I will win!

99
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:16,723
Afraid?

100
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:19,189
[chuckle]

101
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:21,189
Alright, bring
it on!

102
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:24,689
Do you really believe
that you can defeat me
without any ninjutsu?!

103
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:26,289
Absolutely!

104
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:28,689
(Thinking)
I think they're
going to fight
for real...

105
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:30,689
(Lee)
We fight in
one week!

106
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:32,856
Any time! Any place!

107
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,623
I will win!

108
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:36,789
You gonna be
okay, Lee?

109
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,189
I do not know.
But I have one
whole week to
train!

110
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:43,189
And in that time I
am certain I can make
myself stronger!

111
00:07:43,223 --> 00:07:46,956
I will prove that with
enough hard work, one
can even surpass a genius!

112
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:51,423
Yeah, right! Now that's
what I'm talking
about, Bushy Brow!

113
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:55,856
And I'll tell you what!
Just this once, I'll help
<i>you with your training!</i>

114
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,056
Thanks, Naruto!

You got it! Now
let's do this!

119
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:11,123

I know that Lee said he
could get stronger, but he's
only had a week to train!

120
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:14,823
How much could he
possibly improve
in such a short time?!

<i>Sorry I am late!</i>

ARRGHHH!!

123
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:24,289
What in the world
happened to you!?

124
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:29,689
I underwent grueling
training with Naruto!
And every day I grew
a little bit more!

125
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:32,356
Boy, you're not
kidding! You sure
grew all right!

126
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:35,023
Well then! Do I
look any different!?

127
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,223
Just a little!

Really!?

131
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,623
Naruto too!?

132
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,156
Why'd only one
arm get big!?

133
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:49,056
Think you guys! I
only said I'd help
with this training!

134
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:52,123
So I figured that
I'd just do half as
much as he did!

135
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,689
But why!? It doesn't
make any sense!

136
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:57,689
Come on! Tell me,
do I look different?

137
00:08:57,723 --> 00:08:59,356

All that extra bulk
you've added has
slowed you down!

00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:53,007
I just think that boys
should protect girls!
That's what's important
here!

299
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,540
We should...
protect them?

<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>This is it! The Five Great</i>
Nations Cup Championship is all
<i>down to the last penalty kick!</i>

301
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:05,307
(Narrator)
Everyone in the stadium
is on the edge of their
seat!

302

<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Tenten! Watch this!</i>

303
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,740
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Hyuga's got the ball!</i>
<i>He shoots!</i>

<i>the other way!</i>

306
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:16,740
<i>(Narrator)</i>
[gasp] He kicked it! He
blocked the ball with
his foot!

307
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:19,207
I said protect
"girls," not goals!

308
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,373
No! But that was the
heartwarming story of a boy
keeping his promise to a
girl by defending the goal!

309
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,840
He was protecting
her heart! It works
on many levels!

310

<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Enough!!</i>

311

We've... failed...

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
My groin... I
cannot feel my
groin...

313
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:36,607
Men. It must be
so nice being such
simple minded creatures.

314
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,607
Hold on! That is it!

315
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,007
Huh?

316
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:45,040
All that we have to
do is make you into
a boy!

317
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:47,340
Actually, that does
make a lot of sense!

318
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:49,307
Then let us
get to work!

319
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,540
You simply must
have a mustache!

320
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:52,340
Mustache!?

321
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:53,940
Yes! And a
comb-over, too!

322
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:54,840
Comb-over!?

323
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,407
And the coup de grace:
Old man smell!

324
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,073
Fewf! Now you
look perfect!

325
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:01,307
Hm!

326
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,407
(Lee and Neji)
Classic Style!

327
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:08,940
That's pretty good.
You'd have to be a complete
idiot to mistake me for a
chick at this point!

328
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,807
No way!! You two
are the idiots, here!

Alright, I get
it, okay?

331
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:21,973
I guess I should just
stop caring that you two
guys are never gonna
treat me like a woman.

332
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:24,507
It's my own fault
for getting so upset.

What's that?

335
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:33,073
Tenten, I've
always depended on you
because I know how
truly strong you are!

336
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:36,273
But you say I should
be protecting you instead!

Tenten!

What did we do
wrong, Neji?

341
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,973
No clue!

Wait! This is bad!

What's wrong?

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,373
I have forgotten the
most important part!

345
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:54,940
We simply cannot
allow Tenten to be
seen in that outfit!

Or we're gonna mess
you up seriously bad!

You're those guys

Oh my! It's the little
girl from earlier!

353
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,240
Let me guess, you got so
mad that the boys ignored
you, that you decided to
turn into a boy yourself!

354
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:24,707
Whatever! Yeah, sure,
I'm a guy now!

355
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,807
I can fight on my
own! I don't need
anyone protecting me!

Well, we'll see
about that, won't we?

Huh?!

We forgot to give
you that underwear!

on, you will now
be all man!

laughing stock!

Hey...
Gasp!

379
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,307
Get over yourself!

380
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,140
You ugly old hag!

381
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:36,035
What.

382
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:42,007
Don't you even think
for a single minute of
putting me on the same
level as you!

[screams]

384
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:52,473
But why!? I don't
understand! Women have
a right to be protected
you know!

385
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:55,007
No. We're not
entitled to anything.

386
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,873
Man or woman, you only
deserve what you work for.

387
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:01,007
And my goal's to
become a strong ninja!

388
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:07,840
You know, you haven't told
us to act more gentlemanly
toward you in quite a long
while now, Tenten...

389
00:21:07,873 --> 00:21:10,840
No, of course not. It's
simply not in your nature.

390
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:13,273
It'd be like asking
a tiger to change
its stripes.

391
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:16,140
But I think I can
deal with you guys
just the way you are.

392
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:18,040
I believe that it is
better this way.

393
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:19,873
I like the real
Tenten best.

394
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:21,807
The strong, independent
Tenten!

395
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,940
But what made you change
your mind about wanting
us to protect you?

396
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,540
Well, actually...

397
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:30,807
Tenten, I've
always depended on you
because I know how
truly strong you are!

398
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:34,407

Do you really not
know, Neji!?

399
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,373
Huh?

400
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,640
It is obvious!

401
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:37,973
What is?

402
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:41,173
That attacks which are
fatal to men do not
affect women, of course!

403
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:42,473
What?

404
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:44,373
It is simple!

405
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:48,340
Those soccer balls to the
crotch revealed to Tenten
that women are actually
stronger than men are!

406
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,107
Of course! And that's
why she doesn't need
us to protect her!

407
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,373
You know, now that I've
learned boys can't endure
that much pain, I'll just
have to protect the both of you.

408
00:21:57,407 --> 00:22:01,973
