1
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:58,089
We open in a certain
mountain town.

2
00:01:58,122 --> 00:02:02,849
The atmosphere
here is quite odd
and unnerving...

3
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:11,816
Well, looks like
we made it in.

4
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:12,749
Yeah.

5
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:15,449
As long as we continue
to keep a low profile,

6
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:19,916
we should be able to
track down this illegal
chakra-trading ring, and
arrest the perpetrators.

7
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:25,916
Ah-ha! "We made it in."
"A low profile." This
must be an undercover
operation.

8
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:30,582
Any idea what
happened to Lee?
Was he able to
sneak in, too?

9
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,616
I don't know.
I haven't seen
him.

10
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:35,349
(Rock Lee)
Tenten! Neji!
There you are!

11
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:39,416
Looks like we all
managed to sneak in!

12
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:43,316
You didn't sneak in
You stick out like a
big sore thumb! Huh?

13
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:57,316
17 Nights of Staying
Out of Sight

14
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:08,849
We were really lucky that
Guy Sensei and the others
were right there to back
us up when they did.

15
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:12,549
With you drawing so much
unwanted attention, I wasn't
sure what was gonna happen!

16
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:18,649
Sorry. When did it all start
going so wrong? I was sure I
I had the perfect cover for
the mission.

17
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:20,849
Are you kidding?!
You couldn't have
been more obvious!

18
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:24,316
Lee innately stands
out in pretty much
every situation.

19
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:30,116
So I stand out, do I?
Hmm, I suppose...

20
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:39,549
The show is in its
fourth season now...

21
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:42,782
If my presence did
not carry so much
weight and gravitas..

22
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:46,282
..then I would not have
survived as a prime
time TV character for
a whole year!

23
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:48,682
Yeah, sorry.
That's not the
real issue here.

24
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:52,549
But Neji's theory that
you naturally stand out
could certainly mean
a lot of trouble.

25
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:54,449
Huh? What do you
mean by that?

26
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:56,582
Think about it
for a second.

27
00:03:56,616 --> 00:04:02,149
Mission or not, the core of
being a ninja is concealing
yourself. It's never okay to
draw attention to yourself.

28
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:04,849
It goes against
everything you
represent.

29
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:06,682
I see what
you mean.

30
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:09,916
Especially considering
I am one who cannot
use jutsu.

31
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,782
If I am standing
out instead of staying
undercover, like I should...

32
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:16,682
Then this is a
fatal weakness!

33
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,216
Yes! Understood!

34
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:21,916
I will work my tail off
to erase every trace of
my conspicuousness!
[yells]

35
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:25,816
No, no, no!
That hot-blooded
enthusiasm is at the
root of the problem!

36
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,716
Lee! Get
back here!

37
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:28,716
Lee, wait!

38
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:30,216
[chuckling]

39
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:32,749
Kabuto. Did you
hear what I just
heard?

40
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:34,316
I sure did.

41
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,249
I admit, Lee certainly
is in the top tier of
conspicuous characters
on the show.

42
00:04:38,282 --> 00:04:42,149
Honestly, I'd put you
one level above him,
Lord Orochimaru.

43
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,182
Speaking from my
wealth of experience..

44
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:49,349
..it's obvious that Lee is
going to do some kind of
special training regimen to
learn to erase his presence.

45
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,449
And speaking from my
wealth of experience..

46
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:54,782
..it's obvious that
you're going to try
and interfere with
that at every turn.

47
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,182
[snickers]

48
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,316
If I can sabotage his
training long enough..

49
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:01,582
..even his inexhaustible
positivity will eventually
crumble.

50
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:04,749
"It is hopeless.
I am not fit to
be a ninja!"

51
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:08,516
The fool. I can hear
his pathetic uncontracted,
whining now!

52
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:12,582
Try not to to be so
positive about it,
Lord Orochimaru.

53
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:16,649
With his annoying
self-confidence
eradicated, Lee will
be easily defeated.

54
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,716
I just don't get it.

55
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:23,716
Why can't you see that if you
acted like you do in the main
series, you could defeat Lee
any time you wanted.

56
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:27,649
Very soon, Rock Lee
is going down!

57
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:29,182
(Rock Lee)
Then it hit me.

58
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:33,149
If I could just get
Sai to help, he could
train me in the art of
blending in.

59
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:34,582
Nice! Good
thinking.

60
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:36,516
With Sai being
from the ANBU..

61
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:42,316
..it makes sense that hiding
his presence and blending in
with the background would be
his specialties.

62
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:47,882
I appreciate the praise
and your faith in me. But
I'm not sure anyone could
help you become inconspicuous.

63
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,549
Please, Sai!
I am begging you!
Help me!

64
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:52,816
All right.
Let's see
here...

65
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:56,416
I want you to picture
these situations in
your mind...

66
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:59,449
A boy who always
sits in the back
of the class...

67
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:02,382
Who disappears from
the classroom during
breaks...

68
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,249
And walks home
from school all
by himself.

69
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,382
Got it! So I need
to put myself in
that kind of mindset.

70
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,649
I will use my
specialty genjutsu!

71
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:12,482
You mean skits.

72
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:15,149
Always sit in the
back corner, check!

73
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:17,549
Disappear from the
classroom during
breaks, check!

74
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:20,482
And walk home from
school all by myself,
check-checkity-check!

75
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:22,249
How did I do, Sai?

76
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:27,249
Well Your vigorous recreation
of those scenarios makes you
even more conspicuous than
usual.

77
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:29,516
This is utterly and
completely hopeless!

78
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:33,482
If my genjutsu does
not work, what else
will help me understand?

79
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:35,049
Imagine this,
instead...

80
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:39,249
Tenshinmen, a crab omelet
with gravy over noodles, on
a Chinese restaurant menu.

81
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:45,382
It's positioned all the way
on the end, forgotten, to the
point where you think, "Has
anyone ever even ordered that?"

82
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:50,649
Oh, I see. No one who came
in wanting ramen would order
tenshinmen. They would not
consider it.

83
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:54,816
And if they wanted crab
and eggs, they would
probably just go with
a crab omelet instead.

84
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:59,582
So tenshinmen basically
has no real presence on a
Chinese menu. I've never
thought of it that way.

85
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:02,582
I just need to
understand how
tenshinmen feels!

86
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:10,716
How am I
doing, Sai?

87
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:14,749
Poorly. Again, you fail
for unnaturally recreating
the scenario.

88
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,416
[yells]

89
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,816
Blending in with the crowd
and not reacting to anything
are what make you inconspicuous.

90
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:22,549
The less attention you
draw to yourself, the
better.

91
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:23,982
Ah, I see...

92
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:28,249
Start by wearing only ordinary,
everyday clothing. Avoid unusual
attire.

93
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:34,349
That business suit might be
what normal people wear. But
nobody wears stuff like that
in this show's universe!

94
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:39,449
Next, you must learn to
control your reactions
no matter what the
situation is.

95
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:45,349
I don't know what universe
you're in, but this situation
is completely out of control!

96
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,449
[sigh]

97
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:56,882
Even though I realize this is
part of your training, I feel
disturbed that you can simply
chose to ignore me.

98
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,482
And why in the world
is Neji upset about it?

99
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:04,182
Oh, the humanity! I had no
idea masking one's presence
was such a painful process!

100
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:07,616
It's painful, alright.
It hurts me just to
watch this mess.

101
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:13,516
And so, Sai's strange
training and lessons
continued.

102
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:19,716
Your final task lies right over
there. You must eat a meal at
that soba restaurant, alone,
without anyone noticing you.

103
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,749
What?
But that's
so normal.

104
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:26,282
Exactly. Acting like a normal
person is how we'll make him
stop standing out.

105
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:28,249
Go for it, Lee!
Good luck!

106
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:36,382
Welcome! I'm afraid
you'll have to share
a table.

107
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,716
One soba
with eggs.

108
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,216
Coming
right up.

109
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,916
One with eggs!

110
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:46,682
[devious laughing]
Just you wait, Lee.

111
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:51,216
Your frenetic efforts to mask
your presence and blend in
with the crowd around you...

112
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:56,616
...are going to be ruined by
none other than yours truly!

113
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,149
I get it.

114
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:04,282
Lord Orochimaru is going to be
even more anonymous than Lee,
right in his face.

115
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:09,416
He is even more anonymous
than me! I have lost this
battle!

116
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,582
Nothing could be more
humiliating for him in
this situation.

117
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:18,416
[devious laughing]
Now, observe and despair!
Prepare to meet your doom!

118
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:19,549
Huh?

119
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:23,782
[slurping]

120
00:09:23,816 --> 00:09:25,916
(Lord Orochimaru)
Huh? What's
going on here?

121
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:29,349
(Kabuto)
How strange. Lee
isn't reacting at
all.

122
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:32,716
Oh noooo!

123
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:35,616
Wait! Of course!

124
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:41,382
Orochimaru cannot get the better
of Lee unless Lee first realizes
that he is in fact Orochimaru!

125
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,482
And to do that...

126
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:48,382
He'll have to do something
to stand out, ruining the
anonymity contest in the
process!

127
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:54,216
I didn't realize that.
So this is what it means
to be hoisted by your own
petard!

128
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:56,882
You've been hoisted
clear across the planet!

129
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:02,916
[groans]
This is driving me crazy!
I want him to notice I'm
here! Notice me, senpai!

130
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:08,249
You can't, Lord Orochimaru! It
would defeat the entire purpose
of coming here! Everything would
be for naught!

131
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,749
Meanwhile,
Lee is thinking...

132
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:13,216
Huh. What is
Orochimaru
doing here?

133
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:14,916
Ah.. he did notice.

134
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:15,916
Normally...

135
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,282
Orochimaru! What are you
doing here?! Answer me!

136
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:22,182
Or something
like that.

137
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:24,849
Reacting makes you
stand out. You must
control yourself.

138
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:28,516
Sai was very clear
on that point.
[groans]

139
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:33,716
[yelling]
I want to react so bad!
But I cannot! What do
I do?! What do I do?!

140
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:39,649
I want him to notice me so bad!
But I can't make him! What do I
do?! What do I do?!

141
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,516
[yelling]

142
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:44,282
This'll be a big risk,
but it's my only option!

143
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:46,349
What are you going to
do, Lord Orochimaru?!

144
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,249
[gasp]

145
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:54,482
Pardon me. May I
use the seasoning?

146
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:59,416
No freakin' way! He didn't
notice even me when I asked
him for the shichimi?

147
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:05,816
In this situation, that was
a borderline illegal move, and
it still didn't work?! I don't
get it!

148
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:09,216
Why doesn't he
notice me?!

149
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:11,249
I want to
react so
badly!

150
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:13,516
[slurping]

151
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,216
I cannot take
it anymore!

152
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,349
(Naruto)
Hello there!

153
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:19,449
Huh?

154
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:21,882
One tempura
soba, please!
Huh?

155
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:27,916
Bushy-brows and Orochimaru?
Why're you guys dressed like
a couple of businessmen?

156
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:28,882
Uh...

157
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,849
No reason...

158
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:33,249
[slurping]

159
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:36,716
[sigh]

160
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:43,316
And so, Lee and Orochimaru
learned just how difficult
it can be to go unnoticed
and blend in with the crowd.

161
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,982
What about this?

162
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:49,749
I can hide my presence by
making everyone else even
more outlandish than me!
Genius!

163
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:52,282
This is so wrong.

164
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:53,649
Well?

165
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:56,349
I definitely don't
stand out as much
like this.

166
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,682
You know, something
tells me we'll never
get back ontrack.

167
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:02,349
[laughing]

168
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:05,282
It appears there is
still a long road ahead.

169
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:20,656
The bathroom, the kitchen,
the laundry room. So many
rooms we use day in and
day out.

170
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,456
But the most important
one of all is...

171
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,156
The bathroom?

172
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,523
Yes, that's right. Lately
people have been leaving
the public bathroom a
complete mess.

173
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:31,623
Graffiti,
poor hygiene,
disgraceful.

174
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:38,123
That's why you're here.
Your mission is to clean the
bathroom from top to bottom.
I want it shiny and spotless..

175
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:39,456
..I'm counting
on you!

176
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,523
Right!

177
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,056
Cleaning the Bathroom
Cleanses the Soul!

178
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,490
Good, you're all here.
I trust you understand how
important this mission is?

179
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:57,956
Yes, of course!

180
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,423
As the old saying goes,
"everything begins and
ends with the toilet."

181
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:06,123
That's not it at all!
It's "everything begins
and ends with family!"

182
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:10,123
Keeping things clean and
tidy is just basic common
sense. It is easy!

183
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,223
[pained yell]

184
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:13,090
You fool!

185
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:14,523
Why'd you hit him?

186
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:16,723
Listen up, Lee!

187
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:21,656
Keeping the bathroom spotless
and clean is the exact same
thing as keeping your soul
spotless and clean, understand?

188
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,990
As you scrub and disinfect the
toilet, think of it as polishing
and perfecting your skills!

189
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,956
You don't have to force
the metaphor anymore!

190
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,190
I had no idea that cleaning
the bathroom was so meaningful!
I have been such a fool, Guy
Sensei!

191
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:37,690
It's okay.
You understand
now.

192
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:38,756
[crying]

193
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,356
Yeah, yeah,
now can we please
get to work already?

194
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:46,356
And so, the team cleaned the
bathrooms until they were
spotless and shiny. But then...

195
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,490
(Guy)
Wait, what?

196
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:49,656
You mean they're
all filthy again?

197
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,390
We did such a good
job yesterday.

198
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:55,323
It's crazy.
I can't believe
it got this bad
in one night.

199
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,623
I don't get it.
What could've
happened?

200
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:59,256
Hmm...

201
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,056
[laughing]
Everything went
according to plan.

202
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,590
Ah. These two,
of course.
Who else?

203
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:10,423
We'll mess up the
Leaf's bathroom!
That's my latest
ingenious plan.

204
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:15,156
..Rumors will spread
about how disgusting
and filthy they are.

205
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,923
Fewer and fewer people
will come to the village..

206
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,623
Eventually, people
will leave this place
all together.

207
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:23,423
..And the Leaf will be
on the path to ruin!

208
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:27,156
Lord Orochimaru's imagination
is the only thing on the path
to ruin.

209
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,423
In this plan, everything
begins and ends with the
toilet.
[chuckles]

210
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:33,923
Now! Scream in
despair, fools!

211
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,156
What should we do
now, Guy Sensei?

212
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,556
Well, there's always
the chance that this
could just be some
kind of evil prank.

213
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,590
Right! The plan is to
guard this place and
see if we can uncover
the truth. Got it?

214
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,590
Got it!

215
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:51,623
Oh no! Regardless of how good
or bad the plan is, if they
start setting up watch and
guarding the place,

216
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:54,323
Lord Orochimaru won't
have an opportunity
to carry it out!

217
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:55,556
[chuckles]

218
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,990
Gotta pee,
gotta pee!

219
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,656
Whew! Didn't think
I was gonna make it!

220
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:18,590
[sigh]

221
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:21,290
Impossible. Sakura,
how could you?

222
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:23,523
Lady Hinata.
No way!

223
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,490
Why're you two so
depressed? Did you
think they were
above this?

224
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:31,623
It's never easy for a
man to accept reality.
Sometimes the truth rips
through to the soul.

225
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,590
What's that
supposed to
mean?!

226
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:39,056
Anyways, Naruto, Sakura,
and Hinata all showed a
complete lack of manners,
so we know it's not a prank.

227
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,223
They're just
inconsiderate.

228
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,156
Hm..

229
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,690
Really? That's incredible!
Lord Orochimaru didn't have
to do anything?

230
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:48,623
Everyone in the Leaf's
just gross and leaves
a huge mess behind?

231
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,056
Elementary,
my dear Kabuto.

232
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,456
Being the true genius
that I am, I created
the "Mess up the Leaf
Bathroom" jutsu..

233
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,323
..a terrifying mind-control
technique that perfectly
complements my plan!

234
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,656
Whoa! You created a
mind-control jutsu?!

235
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:07,556
It's like this, anyone
under its influence will
be compelled to leave the
bathrooms a complete mess!

236
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,490
Pretty amazing,
wouldn't you agree?

237
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:10,690
Incredible!

238
00:16:10,723 --> 00:16:14,090
If he can really do
something as amazing
as mind control..

239
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:19,056
..then why is he wasting time
with this bathroom plot and not
planning something significantly
bigger?!

240
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:25,090
Normally I'd yell at him, but
I'm too impressed with Lord
Orochimaru! He's on to something
with this one!

241
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:27,390
And that's not
the end of it.

242
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,056
[gasp]

243
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,990
It not only leaves the bathroom
a disgusting mess that must be
cleaned over and over..

244
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:38,990
..but by giving Lee and his
pals a harsh dose of reality,
it sends them into a deep
depression, too!

245
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:43,390
When a man is forced to
acccept the reality tha
even his perfect little
idols must take a 'idiot'..

246
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:48,690
..it sends their minds
into a fiery hell from
which there is no return!
[laughing]

247
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:53,190
This is so cool! I mean,
what he's saying is kinda
messed up and demented..

248
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:56,256
..but he hasn't been
this on the ball since
the series began!

249
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,556
(Rock Lee)
No! Impossible!

250
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,956
Huh?

251
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,523
Sakura does not-
Sakura does not drop
'idiot'! I refuse to
accept that!

252
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:07,123
I really don't see
why you have to get
so worked up about
all this.

253
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:11,690
He's right! Lady Hinata
would never ever take a
'idiot'! It's beneath her!

254
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:12,956
Come on!
Not you,
too!

255
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,923
Sakura and Hinata
are not behind this!
It must be someone else!

256
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:20,490
Huh? But we saw them go
in and out. We confirmed
it just moments later.

257
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:24,256
It is not like them.
I feel the culprit
must be him!

258
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,523
Yes, I agree, Lee.
I was just thinking
only he could be behind
something so diabolical.

259
00:17:29,556 --> 00:17:31,123
Huh?
"He" who?

260
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:32,390
Who do
you think?

261
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:34,456
It is Orochimaru,
for sure!

262
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,523
Whaaaat?!

263
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:41,390
Knowing him, he must have
created some kind of new
jutsu that makes the victim
want to mess up the bathroom.

264
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:42,523
Exactly.

265
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:45,223
What else would explain
Sakura taking a huge
'idiot'?!

266
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:49,123
That's right! Neither
she nor Lady Hinata
could possibly 'idiot'!

267
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:53,056
[groans]
We underestimated
their delusional
tendencies.

268
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,656
They're so determined not to
face reality that even with
absolutely no evidence, they're
blaming Lord Orochimaru.

269
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,090
And on top of that, they
made up an excuse that
happens to be his exact
plan!

270
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:08,490
This is just like, when a girl
with a difficult personality
who isn't popular with boys
says something like...

271
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:11,923
I just can't seem to
find myself a boyfriend.
It's weird, right?

272
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:15,423
It must be because
they're all too nervous
and afraid to ask me out.

273
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:21,190
Completely missing the point,
yet at the same time, absolutely
correct! It's the exact same
situation!

274
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:23,456
Wh- What do we do,
Lord Orochimaru?

275
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,623
Everything's
fine, Kabuto.

276
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,156
Huh?!

277
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,256
It doesn't matter that
those idiots were lucky
enough to figure out my
jutsu.

278
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,956
They still have no
way of stopping it.

279
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,590
The only thing they can
possibly do is sit back
and watch their bathrooms
be ruined..

280
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:40,690
..knowing there's nothing
they can do about it.
[chuckles]

281
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:43,590
However, a few
days later...

282
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,356
I see...

283
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,623
So the bathroom problem is
solved, then? It looks like
Team Guy did a good job on
this one.

284
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:54,590
..Maybe I'll give them
a bonus for a job well
done.

285
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:56,256
Uh Wait, what
did she say?

286
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,356
The bathrooms
aren't dirty?

287
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,423
Impossible!
That can't
be true!

288
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:02,923
Could the jutsu
have somehow
lost its effect?

289
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:05,323
You mean some sort
of stupid oversight?

290
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:08,290
That's so contrived it
sounds like something
right out of a comedy
anime..

291
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:12,156
..where they completely
make up terrible reasons
for the villain to fail
just to end the episode!

292
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,023
That's exactly what usually
happens to us, but I'll bite
my tongue this time around.

293
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:22,156
I added a special ingredient
to the jutsu that causes the
effects to continue on for a
whole month.

294
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,323
We'll just have to
see what's happening
for ourselves.

295
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:27,623
Make way!
Gotta pee,
gotta pee.

296
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:29,956
Everything seems
to be good so far.

297
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,423
Easy!
No running!

298
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:32,356
Huh?!

299
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,623
Huh?

300
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:36,123
Now listen here,
Ms. Toilet.

301
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:40,523
This school has a long,
celebrated history of
producing gentle,
refined women!

302
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:45,523
Every one of our students
toils day in and day out to
become pretty, well-mannered
household fixtures..

303
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:48,623
..so that they can
graduate and proudly
function in society.

304
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:52,356
You need get your
priorities together
and start acting like
you belong here!

305
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,056
Ew, I don't want
to be near Toilet.
She's so gross.

306
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,190
She's all dirty
and nasty.

307
00:19:57,223 --> 00:19:59,523
[laughing]

308
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:02,990
Ma! Why do I
have to be a
toilet?!

309
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:07,990
Why couldn't I be born
clean and pretty, like
Ms. Sink or Ms. Bathtub?
It is not fair!

310
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:14,190
My dear child, within every
single toilet there is a
beautiful porcelain god.

311
00:20:14,223 --> 00:20:18,256
If you keep the toilet
clean, you keep your
soul clean, too.
Understand?

312
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,356
It cleans..
your soul, too?

313
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,356
Don't worry about silly
outward appearances.

314
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,523
You grow up to be a
toilet with a beautiful
soul, okay?

315
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:31,190
Ma...

316
00:20:31,223 --> 00:20:36,490
After that day, I made it
a point to start being nice
to everyone I meet, no matter
what.

317
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:42,690
Even if they bullied me,
insulted me, or were rude
to me in any way, I was
nice to them all the same.

318
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:47,490
To help make
myself beautiful.

319
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:53,423
Today, things are a lot
different than they were
back then. I'm dating an
amazing five-star hotel.

320
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:57,423
He says the thing he
loves most about me
is my beautiful soul.

321
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:03,623
I feel like if people
learn to keep the toilet
clean, anyone can be
beautiful.

322
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,423
[crying]
Oh, man! What an
emotional story!

323
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:13,423
I'll make sure to
leave the bathroom
clean from now on!
[crying]

324
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:17,290
Damn them!
They used a clever
genjutsu against me!

325
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,390
Lord Orochimaru,
that was just a skit.

326
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:22,223
Fine then!
They leave me
no choice!

327
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:23,390
Huh?
Orochimaru?!

328
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:26,690
He's gonna try
to mess up the
bathroom!

329
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:29,490
If you want something done
right, do it yourself!

330
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:38,256
Huh? What the..
This feels like...
It can't be...
Could it be?

331
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:45,323
A water-style
jutsuuuuuooohoooo.

332
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,056
Phew.

333
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,990
Huh?

334
00:21:50,023 --> 00:21:53,323
You win.

335
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,423
Lord Orochimaru, wait!

336
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:02,323
And so, with Kakashi's
chakra powering the
water-style jutsu..

337
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:06,323
Orochimaru was moved
beyond words to a
state of clean euphoria.

338
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:07,356
[laughing]

339
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:54,538
The next episode is "The Staff
Will Eat the Beans Afterwards!"
and "The Raikage is Under
Attack!"

340
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:57,838
Lord Orochimaru,
the Raikage is
being targeted.

341
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:01,538
I think maybe we should
start with the Hidden
Cloud and then move on
to the Leaf-

342
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:03,238
No!

343
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:06,638
I'm staying by the Leaf!
No matter what happens,
I will claim that bathroom
for myself!

344
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:10,405
Oh, come on.
You just want to
use that toilet
again.
