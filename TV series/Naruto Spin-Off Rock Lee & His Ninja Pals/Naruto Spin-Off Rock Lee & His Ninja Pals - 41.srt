1
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:57,811
Orochimaru has slammed the
Hidden Leaf Village with a
blizzard, with temperatures
at 140 degrees below zero!

2
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:01,344
(Orochimaru)
The Hidden Leaf Village
has been obliterated!

3
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:08,744
Trapped by Orochimaru's fearsome
attack, our hero, Rock Lee, has
been shackled to a stone, and
is about to meet his end!

4
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:12,444
So.. are you ready?
I'm going to take my
time torturing you!

5
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:15,744
What exactly are you
going to do to me?!

6
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:18,844
For starters...

7
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:19,711
[fearful yell]

8
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:22,344
[chuckles]
What do you
think of this?!

9
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:24,311
[panicked yell]

10
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:29,711
There! You've been marked
for life, so start dancing,
clown!
[chuckles]

11
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:35,711
Orochimaru finally achieved
his life goal. He conquered
the Leaf Village and lived
happily ever after.

12
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:45,111
An Endless Nightmare!

13
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:51,144
[chuckles/snoring]

14
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:52,844
Is something wrong,
Lord Orochimaru?!

15
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,178
Nom nom, wonderful...
Huh? Kabuto?

16
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:02,144
Huh?! What? You've got
to be kidding me! You mean
it was nothing but a dream?!

17
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:04,478
It appeared that you
were talking in your
sleep, m'lord.

18
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,778
Curse your bones, Kabuto!
You've ruined a wonderful
fantasy!

19
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,711
You're not supposed
to wake someone
when they're having
a good dream!

20
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:15,744
I'll let it slide.
The truth is, that dream has
given me an incredible idea!

21
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,578
Just you wait...
Rock Lee!

22
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:25,344
[heavy breathing]

23
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:28,144
[sneeze]
It's freezing
out here!

24
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,844
He's right, the
temperature has
really dropped.

25
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:32,311
The forecast predicted
record lows today.

26
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:35,111
With these conditions,
we should probably head
to the village.

27
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:39,678
No way! In this situation,
we should train ten-- No,
wait, I take that back..

28
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:42,444
We should be training
a hundred times harder!

29
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:45,211
We have to conquer
these conditions!

30
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:52,311
You think you're tough?
Let's see how long you
can endure this blizzard!
[chuckles]

31
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:54,744
[groans]

32
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:59,478
It's getting worse!
Let's take shelter
in that cave!

33
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,811
[heavy breathing]

34
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:08,311
(Sakura)
Doesn't look like
it's gonna let up.

35
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:10,211
I may freeze
to death!

36
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:11,944
Let me handle
this situation!

37
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:16,744
I will start my workout
with ten thousand squats,
and after that, I am going
to speed up!

38
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:20,511
Lee's hot-bloodedness
comes in handy in times
like these!

39
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:21,844
Huh? Ew!

40
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:25,611
Ew! It's so cold,
his sweat is freezing
before it hits the ground!

41
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:27,344
[grossed groan]

42
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:30,211
Id...iot...

43
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:31,378
[grunt]

44
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:34,478
I have to tell you, doing ten
thousand of these squats...

45
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:38,411
...and over thirty-thousand
Shimura-style forms has
completely wiped me out.

46
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,778
It has made me
really sleepy...

47
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,144
No, Lee!
If you fall asleep,
you'll die!

48
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:46,578
I hear you. The only way to
save myself is to count sheep.

49
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:49,611
...A sheep doing
fence hurdles!

50
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,744
One.. two..
and three.

51
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:53,778
That is not how
you count sheep!

52
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:56,278
Now I'm getting
kinda sleepy, too.
[yawn]

53
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:58,011
No, Sakura!

54
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:01,744
I have an idea. Why don't we
tell each other funny stories,
to keep our minds off the cold?

55
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:03,411
Funny stories,
you say?

56
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:05,644
Fine. No problem,
I have lots of them!

57
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,744
Stop me if you've
heard this before!

58
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,278
[gasp]

59
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:11,278
Hey, did I tell you
what happened?

60
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,878
I was in the corner store,
doing a little shopping,
When a bear walked in and
bought all the toilet paper!

61
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:19,744
That was no bear, Charlie!
That happened to be my wife!

62
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,678
We're all gonna
freeze to death.

63
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:28,478
It's getting
a lot colder.

64
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,344
We only have
one option left.

65
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,811
It is the last resort for
stranded mountain climbers!

66
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:36,511
We have to do
naked snuggling!

67
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,378
We will use our natural
body heat to keep warm!

68
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:41,411
Who is it you're
planning to
snuggle with?!

69
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:43,778
Come, Sakura!
Leap into my
bosom!

70
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,811
Yeah, like that's
gonna happen! You
need a reality
check, Bushy-Brows!

71
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:48,778
(Sakura)
I'm here, Lee!

72
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:51,411
Huh?

73
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:54,211
And I'm ready!

74
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:56,878
Goal!

75
00:05:56,911 --> 00:06:00,311
Hey, that's no goal line!
What is all this madness?!

76
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:03,378
I had no idea you
were so warm, Lee.

77
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:07,544
Sakura, the very thought
of you makes me even
hotter than normal.

78
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:09,378
[small gasp]
You know, Lee..

79
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,511
I've always had
such loving
feelings for you.

80
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:16,544
Sakura, if we get out
of this situation alive,
we should go get married.

81
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:18,378
Yes. That
sounds perfect.

82
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,178
I can't believe what I'm
hearing! It's impossible!

83
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:24,111
Sakura, are you aware
that you just agreed
to marry Bushy-Brows?!

84
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:28,211
This isn't a genjutsu,
but honestly, something
tells me it's very wrong.

85
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:30,344
You're wrong,
everything's fine!

86
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:33,244
It just so happens
that I'm terribly
in love with Lee!

87
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:36,711
It suddenly occurs
to me that this all
might be Lee's dream.

88
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:40,144
You may be right.
I can't see this
happening in real life.

89
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:44,744
So, are you saying that I fell
asleep in real life, and this
is nothing more than some kind
of hallucination?!

90
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:48,378
And if that's truly the case,
you could easily freeze to
death in this blizzard!

91
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,378
AGH! Then someone
wake me up, for
heaven's sake!

92
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,144
I'm on it!

93
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,678
Eight Trigrams,
Sixty-Four Palms!

94
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:56,611
[pained groan]

95
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:58,444
Ouch!
[gasp]

96
00:06:58,478 --> 00:06:59,911
Are you all
right, Lee?

97
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:04,144
I guess so. I must have
been dreaming. But you
know, that was a close one.

98
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:08,411
The blizzard's not letting
up out there and it seems
like we're all reaching our
limit.

99
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:11,378
I know I'm getting
pretty hungry.

100
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,311
[gasp]

101
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:15,478
That smell!
Are you kidding?!
It can't be!

102
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:17,744
Naruto, where do
you think you're
going?

103
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:18,811
After him!

104
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:24,844
[small gasp]
It is!

105
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,178
Have a seat!

106
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:30,644
Old man! One deluxe miso
ramen, with buttered corn
and extra pork!

107
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:31,644
It's ready
to go!

108
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:33,544
Great! It smells
wonderful!

109
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,878
A bowl of this will hit
the spot! It should warm
me right up!

110
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:36,744
(Tenten)
Hold on!

111
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:37,778
Huh?

112
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:39,211
This isn't a genjutsu,
but something's very
wrong!

113
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:42,844
Like, what in the world
is a ramen stand doing
in the middle of a cave?!

114
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:45,844
It suddenly occurs to me
that this all might be
Naruto's dream.

115
00:07:45,878 --> 00:07:48,778
You're right. I can't
see this happening in
real life.

116
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:53,144
Whaaat?! Are you saying
that I fell asleep in real
life and this is nothing
but a hallucination?!

117
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:57,444
If that is true, that is bad!
You could very easily freeze
to death in this blizzard!

118
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,411
[screams]
Then someone wake
me up, for heaven's
sake!

119
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:01,478
I'm on it!

120
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:03,478
Eight Trigrams,
Sixty-Four Palms!

121
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,511
[pained groans]

122
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:07,444
Ow! That hurt!

123
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:09,744
Are you all
right Naruto?

124
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:14,244
I guess I am. I must have
been dreaming. That was a
close one, ya know.

125
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:18,578
The blizzard is not letting
up out there. Before long,
we will have to do something.

126
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:24,244
Huh? Where's
that sound
coming from?

127
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,644
Uh! Neji!

128
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,144
Wait, where are
you going?!

129
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,378
What in the world?!

130
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:37,378
Hey! She just won a new rice
cooker! The grand prize is a
Hawaiian vacation! Come and
try your luck!

131
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:38,144
We're saved!

132
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:40,344
Not unless we have
a raffle ticket!

133
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:42,744
Well! We're in
luck, I have one!

134
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:47,744
I got it with my deluxe
miso ramen, with buttered
corn and extra pork!

135
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,311
[grunt]

136
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:56,178
Byakugan!

137
00:08:58,178 --> 00:09:00,678
That's it!
Come ooonnnn!

138
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:08,244
Congratulations!
You win the grand prize,
the Hawaiian vacation!
[cheers]

139
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:13,311
Yes! It's like summer in
Hawaii! We're all gonna make
it out of here in one piece!

140
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:25,278
Thank you
very much.

141
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,811
Wait! This is
wrong, too!

142
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:29,444
It makes less sense
than Naruto's fantasy!

143
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:33,278
Yeah! It suddenly occurs
to me that this all might
be Neji's dream.

144
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:34,111
Naruto?

145
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:35,611
Don't worry,
I'm on it.

146
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:36,578
Hm?

147
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:37,644
Rasengan!

148
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:38,478
Wait a--!

149
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,411
[pained groans]

150
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:43,444
I guess I must have
really been dreaming.

151
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:46,511
(Naruto)
Dreaming or not,
I gotta tell you,
this is a great pool!

152
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,178
Huh?

153
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,278
What?!

154
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,644
The fact is, the blizzard's
not letting up out there.

155
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:53,878
And the best part of
the whole thing is,
I get to talk to you,
Sakura!

156
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:56,378
Why is everyone
a capybara now?

157
00:09:56,411 --> 00:10:01,411
Do not worry yourself.
Even though capybaras
all look the same, you
are still clearly a female!

158
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:05,111
That doesn't matter!
The question is, why are
you all wearing costumes
in a hot spring?!

159
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:07,611
By the way, what do
we have on underneath?

160
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:10,411
Just a suggestion.
Why not take a look
and find out?

161
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,344
Maybe I will!
Byakugan!

162
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,178
What?!
You're alpacas?

163
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:17,644
[chuckles]
Sakura is super-cute,
no matter what!

164
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:19,711
This whole thing
is madness!

165
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,278
Here I come!
Ready?!

166
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,444
Lesser...

167
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:24,478
Huh?

168
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:25,111
..Punch!

169
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:26,178
[pained yell]

170
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:28,144
Attacked by a
lesser panda?!

171
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,478
It's Guy Sensei!

172
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:35,378
It's time to wake
up, you fools!

173
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:38,844
This isn't working!
Y'all keep waking
up in one another's
dreams!

174
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:42,478
You need to wake up
for real, and soon
or you're going to
be dead!

175
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:45,711
So, are you telling
us that this is just
another dream?

176
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:47,144
[gasp]

177
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:48,544
Hey! What in
the world?

178
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:49,778
So cold!

179
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:52,344
Enough, already!
Whose dream is
this?

180
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,811
We have to wake
up before we turn
into popsicles!

181
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:56,811
Don't look at me!
This isn't my dream!

182
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,244
It is not
me, either!

183
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:01,544
And just for the record,
I have nothing to do with
it. It's not my dream!

184
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,478
If it is not ours
or the narrator's...

185
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:10,244
..then whose?!
Who is causing all
of this to happen,
and why-y-y?!

186
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:16,778
So far, so good.
Now fall into eternal
slumber Rock Lee.

187
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:19,211
Now I see who
was responsible.

188
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:23,544
What is Orochimaru doing
out here, sleeping in the
middle of a blizzard?

189
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:25,678
Well.. snakes do
hibernate, don't
they?

190
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:32,578
Hold on a second. Something
just occurred to me. Is it
possible that you, the viewers,
are dreaming all of this?

191
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:38,344
And that begs the next question:
Is anyone awake out there?

192
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:53,519
To everyone watching out there,
let me ask you a question.
Do you know what you want
to be when you grow up?

193
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:58,552
Cleaning The Great Stone Faces!
I mean, what could be more fun?!
And then...Huh?

194
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,352
[gasp]
Excuse me!
Who are you,
mister?

195
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:12,652
Hi I happen to be
the future Rock Lee!

196
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:15,119
[fearful scream]

197
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:25,219
A Robot From the Future!

198
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:30,219
I have to tell you the truth.
I never would have guessed
that about the First Hokage's
nostril.

199
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:33,219
It is a time tunnel that
leads thirty years into
the future?

200
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:39,152
Exactly right! And also
after all this time, I
am still a ninja who is
unable to use ninjutsu.

201
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:42,685
On top of that,
I never got it
together and
married Sakura.

202
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:45,385
Hey! Take it easy.
Get ahold of yourself!

203
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,419
Tell me something.
Are you sure you
are my future self?

204
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:53,285
Oh, there is no mistake!
I only ended up as this
pathetic, middle-aged
man because of you!

205
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:58,419
The fact of the matter is, if
you had been able to get your
act together back in the day,
I would not be such a loser!

206
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:00,685
Hindsight is
twenty-twenty.

207
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:04,552
Yes, and that, my boy is
why you are going to start
working hard, right now!

208
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:07,752
Huh?
Who is that?

209
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:13,319
Greetings, everyone!
I am Kabuemon, a robot
from the future!

210
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:14,852
Kabuemon?

211
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:18,319
Yes. And if you ever find
yourself in a tight spot,
you do not have to worry.

212
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,752
He will step up and
save you with his
future ninjutsu!

213
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:23,219
Farewell, my boy!

214
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:31,119
Wha..?
Huh?

215
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:34,185
For now, you will have
to live in my closet,
Kabuemon.

216
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,385
Thank you, Lee.

217
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:43,152
I have to say, my future self
certainly set me straight.
I will be careful not to end up
as such a pathetic old man.

218
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:46,719
[laughing]

219
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:50,185
I knew there was something
wrong, deep in my gut!

220
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:54,252
The plan is very simple.
Lee takes in the mysterious,
helpful robot.

221
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:58,552
They make friends and
then, the moment his
guard is down we strike!

222
00:13:58,585 --> 00:14:04,319
Why am I the one that
has to do this? Normally,
Lord Orochimaru is the
man in the suit.

223
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:06,352
Oh! Kabuemon,
anything wrong?

224
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:12,785
No, no, everything's fine!
I was just thinking, if
there's anything I can help
you with, just let me know.

225
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,852
Remember, I'm
your best friend!

226
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:21,285
Then again, this is the first
time Lord Orochimaru has given
me such an important role.
I can't screw this up!

227
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,819
Idiot...Idiot.

228
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:25,785
Hello there.
I'm Kabuemon!

229
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:31,452
I'm a robot from the future.
For those of you who don't know
me, my favorite food is grilled
tuna heads!

230
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:32,619
Wow! It can talk!

231
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:35,152
So it's independent?
It moves on its own?

232
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:36,285
Yeah, absolutely!

233
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,385
And you're saying it
came from the future?

234
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,385
Tell us what our future
selves are like!

235
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,952
Uhh, well...

236
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:45,685
No! Please don't say
anything! I don't want
to know what my future
will be like!

237
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,352
I agree.

238
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:50,419
To be fair, though..
It's not that hard to
predict how Bushy-Brow's
going to turn out.

239
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:53,052
He's gonna be a pathetic,
middle-aged old man.

240
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:58,185
I plan to train hard and change
the future! And you, Kabuemon,
are gonna help me do that!

241
00:14:58,219 --> 00:14:59,319
Kabue-mon!

242
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:01,185
Nine-thousand
nine-hundred
ninety..

243
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:03,452
Nine-thousand
nine-hundred
ninety-one..

244
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,085
Nine-thousand
nine-hundred
ninety-two..

245
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:09,619
I don't understand why a robot
has to do push-ups! But I
can't arouse any suspicions.

246
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:16,519
The success of this mission
requires that I be a helpful,
cheerful friend at all times,
no matter what the situation!

247
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:20,119
Are you sure you can
handle this? Your form
is really terrible!

248
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:24,119
Oh believe me, it's nothing!
I just suddenly had a craving
for grilled tuna heads!

249
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:27,519
[laughing]
You really are a
big eater, Kabuemon!

250
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,752
When we are done with the
training, I will treat you
to you much as you like!

251
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:32,485
Next, we practice
the Rasengan!

252
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,519
Whaa?

253
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:36,585
To do it, just spin
your body like me!
[spinning]

254
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,719
I have to do
this, too?

255
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:41,485
Come on,
Kabuemon!

256
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,452
Okay, here goes!
[spinning]

257
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,552
That is the spirit!

258
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:47,152
I'm gonna die!

259
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:48,419
Kabuemon!

260
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:51,385
(Naruto)
Nothing's better than
a bowl of post-training
ramen!

261
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:56,752
They only serve ramen here,
so we will get you those tuna
heads when we finish our
training later this afternoon.

262
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:59,119
Seriously, he's
still not done?!

263
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:01,519
Um, are you sure
he can handle it?

264
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:04,519
If you push him too hard,
he could very easily break
down.

265
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:10,652
Are you absolutely certain
he's a robot from the future?
I have to say, he doesn't look
all that futuristic to me.

266
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:14,819
How would we know?
I can tell you that,
for a robot, he reacts
like a human.

267
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:17,419
He almost collapsed
after the training
session this morning!

268
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:19,585
At the very least,
he is realistic!

269
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:24,785
He said something earlier about
mysterious future ninjutsu.
I wonder what he's able to do?

270
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:31,485
I bet there is all kinds of
incredible ninjutsu in the
future! Stuff we cannot even
imagine today. Am I right?

271
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,519
This is bad. I didn't have
time to come up with a
vision of how things will
eventually operate.

272
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:40,285
I need to think of
something futuristic..
Really futuristic.

273
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:42,485
Do you have
some examples,
Kabuemon?

274
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,119
Well, there are all kinds
of future ninjutsu!

275
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:50,585
Just an example, instead of
the Transformation Jutsu,
we use the Plastic Surgery
Jutsu!

276
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:53,719
Cloning techniques have
advanced to the stage of
genetic cloning.

277
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:59,319
The Sharingan now has video
recording capabilities, but
it has a limit. It only works
ten times.

278
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,519
Plastic surgery and genetic
cloning sound much more
complex than today's jutsu.

279
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:06,219
Interesting, and the
Sharingan only works
ten times?

280
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:08,752
I gotta say, the future actually
sounds kinda lame.

281
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:11,585
Not really! In fact,
there's plenty more...

282
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,252
...like Internet-style!

283
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:15,652
(Rock Lee)
Internet-style?!

284
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:19,752
Before, there was wind-style,
fire-style, water-style, and
earth-style.

285
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:23,419
Now, we've added
the newest element,
Internet-style!

286
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:27,585
You can communicate with
friends, associates, and
family, across great
distances!

287
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,185
[slurping]
That's surprisingly
boring.

288
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:33,452
Well, uh...

289
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:38,719
He's in trouble!
I'm gonna need
to bail him out!

290
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,685
Well, you see...

291
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,585
Huh?

292
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,385
So you want to know
about future ninjutsu?

293
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:44,819
Whew!

294
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:45,985
It is future me!

295
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,152
That's what you're
gonna look like in
thirty years, Lee?!

296
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:52,085
[chuckles]
What did I tell you?
You do look like a loser!

297
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,652
Where did you come
from, exactly?

298
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:57,585
You may not know this,
but there is a time-tunnel
in the back of this ramen shop.

299
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,752
I'm here to save
you, Kabuto.

300
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:00,785
Hm?!

301
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:03,552
So what other kinds
of future ninjutsu
are there?

302
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:06,219
[chuckles]
Future ninjutsu, eh?

303
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,052
It is...

304
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,285
...all about
Space-style!

305
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,152
[gasp]

306
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:11,452
What is Space-style?

307
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:14,252
I gotta say, it sounds
futuristic and cool!

308
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:17,085
Oh believe me,
it is far beyond
cool!

309
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,252
You have my permission!
Show them, Kabuemon!

310
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:22,519
It is now time
for me to leave!

311
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,452
Are you kidding me!?

312
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:28,052
Oh man! I really can't
wait to see some
Space-style techniques!

313
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:32,119
If we learn how to use them
effectively the Hidden Leaf
will be nearly invincible!

314
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,652
This is so exciting!
Can you demonstrate
for us?

315
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:37,419
I can't just create a new
element out of the blue!

316
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:42,052
Well, now uh..
Space-style is..
it's.. uhh...

317
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:43,419
Hmm?

318
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:44,952
Hmm?

319
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:51,552
It's no good! I've got nothing!
All our hard work is about to
go up in flames!

320
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:54,052
Wait, Kabuemon!
I have an answer!

321
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:54,652
Oh uh?

322
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:56,852
Space is infinite.
Right?

323
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:03,819
So that means, even in faraway
places we cannot see from the
earth, there are stars shining
brightly in the darkness!

324
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:07,152
So when you think about
it, that means space is
the future!

325
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:12,319
Um.. oh yes, precisely.
Good analysis, Lee!

326
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:12,685
Huh?

327
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,819
Whaa?

328
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:18,119
I realize that the future
holds infinite potential.

329
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:22,785
Let us go, my friend
to the other end of
the time tunnel!

330
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,319
[yanked yelp]

331
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:26,452
Hey, get back
here, Lee!

332
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:30,419
Oh no! They're coming out
here! I'll have to invoke
a genjutsu!

333
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:31,452
Ha!

334
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:34,252
Huh?

335
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:42,052
You mean this
is the future?

336
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:44,119
The whole thing
seems very weird.

337
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:46,385
So! Welcome
to the future!

338
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,652
Hm?!

339
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:50,419
I ate so much ramen
over the years, it
made me obese, ya know!

340
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:52,219
That's my
future?!

341
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:55,319
I found another
wrinkle today!

342
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:56,719
That cannot
be me!

343
00:19:56,752 --> 00:20:00,285
My heavens!
You boys are
cute!

344
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,385
Excuse me, but why
am I an old woman?!

345
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:04,185
[flirty moan]

346
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:05,285
[gasp]

347
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:10,485
And I am the future
version of Orochimaru!
[laughing]

348
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,352
Hey, how come you're
the only one who looks
futuristic?!

349
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:16,119
The future you is
still up to no-good!

350
00:20:16,152 --> 00:20:19,552
It is not my past self's
fault that my future self
is a loser.

351
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:25,052
The only way to save the
future is to defeat the man
who controls it, which appears
to be Future Orochimaru!

352
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:27,719
I am going to need
your help Kabuemon!

353
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:28,152
What?!

354
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,519
Let us
do this!

355
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:30,185
Huh?!

356
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:33,419
You have
no chance!
[growls]

357
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:36,152
Stand still, you!

358
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:37,585
Why are you waiting,
Kabuemon?

359
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:41,152
Remember your training!
It is time to use the Rasengan!

360
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:42,185
Uhh...

361
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:43,219
Hurry!

362
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,685
R- right!

363
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:48,685
Rasengan!

364
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:55,652
Forgive me, Lord Orochimaru!
But you did say to maintain
my position as his friend,
at any cost!

365
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:57,452
Here we go!

366
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:58,552
Right!

367
00:20:58,585 --> 00:21:01,519
Super Move!
Double Rasengan!

368
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:05,052
Wha--?
What's going on,
Kabu--?

369
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:10,685
Noooo!

370
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:15,519
We seem to be back in the past!
Do you have any idea what
actually happened here?
Whats going on?

371
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:21,819
Grilled fish heads I know
these are your favorites!
So dig right in, my friend!

372
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,619
Oh, thank you
so much, Lee!

373
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:29,719
Kabuemon, I cannot wait
until our next adventure!
You are definitely one of
my best friends!

374
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,052
Friends!

375
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:34,052
I like the
sound of that!

376
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,752
Hmm.

377
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:44,152
And so, in spite of the
incredible odds, Kabuto's
valiant effort has finally paid
off, and his plan is a success!

378
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:47,219
However, nothing in
this life goes as
smoothly as one hopes.

379
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,585
Kabuemon?

380
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:50,119
Yes, Lee...

381
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,385
[gasp]

382
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:57,652
A zipper?

383
00:21:57,685 --> 00:21:59,385
[gasp]

384
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:05,152
Uh, oh!

385
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:07,485
Well, this
is awkward!

386
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:54,023
Next time on Rock Lee,
'Shino Loves Insects', and
'Tenten Fights A Maiden's
Battle'!

387
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,757
(Orochimaru)
Oh, yuck!
No, not bugs!

388
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:01,090
(Kabuto)
What are you so afraid of?
Earlier, I saw you squashing
them with your bare hands!

389
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:05,090
Hey, don't give the audience
that information! You're going
to screw with my agenda!

390
00:24:05,123 --> 00:24:09,623
This is my
'Show-the-new-viewers-
another-side-of-Orochimaru
and-get-more-popular' plan!

391
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:15,823
I have no idea what's
going on in your head
these days.
