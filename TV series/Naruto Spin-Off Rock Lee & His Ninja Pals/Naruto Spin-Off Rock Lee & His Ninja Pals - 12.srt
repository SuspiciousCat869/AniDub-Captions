1
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:52,736
(Sakura)
It should be ready!

2
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:53,869
(Naruto)
Finally..!

3
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:56,536
It's time to
chow down!

4
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:59,003
[freaking out]
Hot! Hot! Hot!

5
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,703
You have to let it
cool down for a
little bit first,
you idiot!

6
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:03,736
Alright, only one
thing to do...

7
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:11,003
Rasengan Mini!

8
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:15,636
There! Now that
oughta take care
of it! [slurps]

9
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:29,736
"The No-Ninjutsu Lifestyle"

10
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:37,536
Hmm, it seems like
lately they've been
using ninjutsu a lot...

11
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,169
<i>...but only for</i>
<i>the most trivial</i>
<i>reasons...</i>

12
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:44,236
[groan] What should
I do about it?
<i>(Guy)</i>
<i>What should I do about it?</i>

13
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:45,269
Huh?

14
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,536
<i>(Kakashi)</i>
<i>Guy..?</i>

15
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,203
That's the question...
What to do...

16
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,936
Is something
wrong, Guy?

17
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:56,669
No, it's really
nothing. Nothing
to worry about
at all!

18
00:02:56,703 --> 00:03:01,203
If that's the vase,
then please... go
and wash the curry
off your face!

19
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:02,169
Huh?!

20
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:05,169
Well, actually,
Lee...

21
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:10,936
[gasp] Oh no! This
curry is going to
leave a hard-to-remove
stain!

22
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:14,936
Ahhh! Great Leaf
Hurricane!!!

23
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:19,203
I didn't give him all
of that training so he
could use his moves
inappropriately like that.

24
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:21,236
Seriously, just
clean your face.

25
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,269
Although, I have to
admit, Lee's hard
work is paying off!

26
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:27,736
Lately his moves are
looking as sharp as
a knife with another
knife taped to it.

27
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,769
Guy, for real.
Your face is
covered in curry.

28
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:32,769
But still! It's the
principle of the matter!

29
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:35,869
I feel as though
he's merely taking
his abilities for
granted...

30
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:40,969
He's out there using his
strength as a ninja for the
most trivial tasks instead
of for important deeds!

31
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:44,636
The words of an old
man who reeks of
curry don't carry
much weight...

32
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:46,969
Did you just say
I've got old man
stink!?!

33
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:50,003
Enough already,
Guy!!!

34
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:55,603
Uh, [clears throat]
I can sympathize. I
was just thinking
the same thing.

35
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,669
You were?
Seriously?

36
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:02,803
I'd like to find a way to
teach out pupils to have a
little more appreciation
for their ninja skills.

37
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:05,169
Well, we're just
going to have to
be blunt with them.

38
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,736
Convince them they
can't become elite
shinobi or Hokage
that way!

39
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,603
But they're not
kids anymore.

40
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:14,969
It's gonna take more
than a pep talk to hook
them in and get them to
change their ways...

41
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:16,836
Hook them in..?

42
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:19,803
That's brilliant!
It just might work!

43
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:21,403
What..?

44
00:04:21,436 --> 00:04:24,536
Just leave everything
to me! They'll fall
for this plan, hook,
line, and sinker!

45
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,803
[birds chirping]
Idiot. Idiot.

46
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:29,936
(Kids)
Real world
experience?

47
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,103
Just think of it as
a social studies class.

48
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:35,269
It sounds
interesting!
I cannot wait!

49
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:37,903
Yeah, but, why us?
What are we supposed
to be learning?

50
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:40,203
I don't see Guy
Sensei anywhere
either...

51
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:42,669
Well, he...uh,

52
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:47,069
Guy had something come
up, so he asked me to
chaperone all of you.

53
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,136
Okay. Where are
we going, anyway?

54
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,236
Ummm...

55
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,669
We'll make them all
do hard labor, without
letting them use any
of their ninjutsu!

56
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:59,969
And the absence of
their special powers
will make them appreciate
their gifts even more...

57
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:03,003
You think they'll
bite? I mean,
those guys...?

58
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,869
Oh they'll bite
alright! Because
they'll be fishing!

59
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:08,536
Fishing...?

60
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,036
We're going to spend the
day on a fishing boat!

61
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:17,003
<i>In my experience, exper</i>
<i>-iancing a little honest,</i>
<i>hard work is an excellent</i>
<i>learning experience.</i>

62
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:20,236
Are you kidding me?
This is such a drag.

63
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:21,936
Now don't be
like that...

64
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:24,969
Uh, Sensei? Can we
bring a few bananas
for snack time?

65
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:27,969
Yeah, Sensei! And a
cup of ramen for lunch?

66
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:30,536
And locally-sourced
delicacies for my rice?

67
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,103
Ia food all you
guys think about?

68
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:43,536
Guy said to leave
everything to him...
But I wonder if he'll
actually show up.

69
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:44,803
Huh?

70
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,936
Oh, boy, don't
tell me...

71
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:54,636
Ahh... So
you're here!

72
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:55,969
It's Guy alright.

73
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:59,603
This is ridiculous!
They'll see right
through that disguise!

74
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:03,203
Hey, what exactly is
is going on here,
Kakashi Sensei?

75
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:05,303
I can tell that he
is no fisherman.

76
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:08,003
I mean, come on!
It's so obvious,
even to us!

77
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,769
[weary sigh]
I knew it.

78
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,569
With that hair,
he surely must
be an ex baseball
player!

79
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:17,269
That hair means
he's a boxer!
Ding ding ding!
Ya know?

80
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:22,603
Technically, that's
a fro. With hair like
that, he must be a famous
Japanese ballad singer.

81
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:24,869
Can we have
your autograph!?

82
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:26,669
Oh come on! Don't
ask him that!

83
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:30,169
Thank goodness,
they can't tell...

84
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:33,136
Thank you so much
for having us onboard
your ship!

85
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,636
Just one thing
before we set
sail...

86
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,669
While you're on
board my ship, none
of you are allowed
to use ninjutsu!

87
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:42,736
(Thinking)
Perfect... if
this works...

88
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,736
Boy... this really
is very difficult.

89
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,936
I haven't even
gotten a nibble
today...

90
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,303
This is just
impossible
without ninjutsu!

91
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:55,536
You see? Now do you
understand just how
lucky you are to be
able to use it at all?

92
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:59,103
From now on, make
sure you use ninjutsu
more responsibly!

93
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:01,569
Oh, Kakashi Sensei!

94
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:03,303
[pleased chuckle]

95
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:06,536
This is ridiculous!
Why aren't we allowed
to use ninjutsu?

96
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,169
Yeah! This
isn't fair!

97
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:09,869
Well, you see...

98
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:11,103
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>That's enough!</i>

99
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:11,669
Huh??

100
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,236
I'll tell you
all why!

101
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:17,136
It happened back
when I was only
sixteen years old...

102
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:17,836
What!?

103
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:22,936
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>I was a juvenile delinquent</i>
<i>with a bit of a reputation</i>
<i>in this harbor town...</i>

104
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,203
Wassap!?

105
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,903
What kind of origin
story is this!? And
who is that!?

106
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:34,236
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>Back then, 'bout all I thought</i>
<i>was "I wanna get out of this</i>
<i>one-boat hole of a town..."</i>

107
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:38,769
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>But my dad had other ideas.</i>
<i>He wanted me to take over</i>
<i>the family business...</i>

108
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:41,169
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>So we had a big</i>
<i>fight, and I ran</i>
<i>away...</i>

109
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:45,736
<i>(Kakashi)</i>
<i>Guy, er, fisherguy. We don't</i>
<i>need to know what happened</i>
<i>before you left!</i>

110
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,703
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>Flash forward to five</i>
<i>years later...</i>

111
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:51,736
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>It's Spring, and I've made</i>
<i>my home in the capital.</i>

112
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:55,169
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>But I was living paycheck</i>

<i>direction in life...</i>

113
00:07:55,203 --> 00:08:01,269
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>Then one night, I ate the most</i>
delicious boiled squid I'd ever
<i>had, and it made me homesick.</i>

114
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:06,803
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>Then I noticed that everyone</i>
else was eating the same thing,
<i>and they all looked so happy.</i>

115
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:09,103
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>Then I understood...</i>

116
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:14,603
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
I thought he was just a two-bit
fisherman, but my dad... he was
<i>accomplishing something big.</i>

117
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:17,669
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>Making so many people</i>
<i>happy by catching</i>
<i>those fish...</i>

118
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:25,169
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>By the time I made it back</i>
<i>to my hometown, my dad was</i>
<i>ill and on his deathbed.</i>

119
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:30,269
<i>(Disguised Guy)</i>
<i>Ever since, I've been on this</i>
<i>boat, catching fish and doing</i>
<i>something good with my life...</i>

120
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:34,836
I'm bringing joy to
others, just like my
dear old dad did!

121
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:38,569
That had nothing to do
with ninja at all!

122
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:41,736
What happened to
explaining why they
can't use ninjutsu?

123
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:45,569
[crying]
That was such a
beautiful story!
Huh?!

124
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:47,736
Yeah, sure was!
You're a great man!

125
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:49,603
I'm gonna start
bawling!

126
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:52,169
Tryin' to be such
a strong guy can
be such a drag...

127
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:54,869
That boiled squid
sounded so tasty...

128
00:08:54,903 --> 00:09:00,136
I think I speak for everyone
when I say we will respect
your wishes and refrain
from using our ninjutsu!

129
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:01,336
-Yeah...
-Yeah...

130
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,603
Wait... what!?
Am I supposed to
do the punch-
lines today?

131
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:08,136
This boat's
so rocky!

132
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:11,203
Are we gonna be
okay if we can't
use our ninjutsu
at all?

133
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:16,703
Of course! This is
the perfect opportunity
to learn the physical
limits of your bodies.

134
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:21,236
Remember, this fisherman
does his job every day
without any ninjutsu.

135
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,203
Indeed!

136
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:23,536
Huh?

137
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:28,769
Now... the first thing
to get used to is, the
movement of the boat.

138
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,536
Why don't you
get used to it
first??

139
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:33,703
Everything's okay.
I can handle it.

140
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:35,969
Alright, folks.
Let's catch some
fish!

141
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:37,269
<i>The bait's</i>
<i>over there...</i>

142
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:38,903
Huh?

143
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:41,169
What!? Are you
insane!? That's
the bait you're
eating!!

144
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:43,736
I'm hungry! Besides,
it's good enough
for the fish!

145
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,769
Yes, I hear
you. How tasty!

146
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:47,869
Being on a boat
works up an appetite!

147
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:49,169
This isn't
bad at all!

148
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:51,769
What!? Seriously!?
Not you guys too!

149
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:55,936
Hey! All of you
guys stop fooling
around on my boat!

150
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,803
Maybe they would if
you hadn't set such
a bad example!

151
00:09:59,003 --> 00:09:59,836
Oh, hee hee!

152
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,136
Don't "hee hee" me!

153
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:03,236
We don't have
any more bait
to fish!

154
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,603
<i>Never fear!</i>
Huh?

155
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:05,436
[shouts]

156
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,169
We've got
bait costumes!

157
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:09,669
What good will
it do us if
you're the bait!?

158
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:11,903
Ah ha! So we still
have that option!

159
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:12,636
[groan]

160
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:13,869
[groan]

161
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:16,169
But what could we
possibly catch
with those things!?

162
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:21,869
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>I was thinking we would land</i>
some of those fangirls that are
into guys who look kinda tough!

163
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:25,236
He does make a good point.
Girls these days are really
into that kind of look.

164
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:29,669
Exactly! Girls of
every generation like
a guy who's not afraid
to show some skin!

165
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:31,269
Isn't that,
right Sakura!?

166
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:32,969
Uhhh...

167
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:37,903
Actually, I think what
girls truly prefer is a
guy who has muscles!
Correct, Sakura?

168
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,203
Not that again!

169
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:42,736
You're wrong!
Women prefer a
man in medieval
underwear!

170
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,236
No! No one
prefers that!

171
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:07,136
Alright! We caught
a ton of fish!

172
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:10,669
It's so much easier
with ninjutsu. It's
really the only
way to go!

173
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,069
I know! Besides,
we had no other
choice! We didn't
have any bait left!

174
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:17,803
[sigh] I guess
it's hopeless.

175
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:18,569
Huh?

176
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:20,103
Huh!? What's that!?

177
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:21,769
[screams]

178
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:26,236
No way! What is
that huge thing?

179
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,803
Giant boiled squid!

180
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:28,936
No, it's stuffed squid!

181
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,136
It is ink-redible
dried squid!

182
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:35,036
You're all completely wrong!
Can't you guys ever think
about anything besides food!?

183
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,503
[screams]

184
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:42,236
[shouting]

185
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,269
We gotta calm
that thing down!

186
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,836
But the boat's rocking
too much for us to use
ninjutsu against it!

187
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:50,136
This trip is turning
into a real drag.

188
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:53,003
We're just gonna have
to give that thing a
good pounding then!

189
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:54,303
Right! Count me in!

190
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:56,503
I guess we have
no choice...

191
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:57,869
(Disguised Guy)
Wait!

192
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:04,203
I told you, no one
is going to use
ninjutsu while they're
on board my ship!

193
00:12:06,303 --> 00:12:07,869
Guy Sensei!?

194
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:09,969
Now, watch
closely.

195
00:12:10,003 --> 00:12:13,069
Yooowww!!!
Hiiieeeyya!

196
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:14,836
He's nuts!

197
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,636
Shrimp Tossing High
Jump Tornado Punch!

198
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:26,836
[stunned awe]

199
00:12:27,303 --> 00:12:29,703
Guy Sensei!

200
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:30,636
Guy..?

201
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:33,903
Hiiiyaaahh!

202
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:35,203
Woooah!

203
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:36,236
Guy Sensei!

204
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:37,936
What are
all of you!?

205
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:39,403
Huh?

206
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:43,736
You're ninja! You
shouldn't abuse your
powers to accomplish
trivial tasks!

207
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,769
[gasps]

208
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:49,903
To be truly strong shinobi,
you must only use your
abilities to achieve big
important accomplishments!

209
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,203
You understand?!

210
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:53,903
[gasp] Yes!

211
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:03,836
Now... Hot!!!
We're gonna have
to find a way to
cool this off.

212
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:06,803
I guess so. It
looks like we're
back to square one.

213
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:08,136
Sakura, we are not.

214
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:12,603
Ninja must never
use their powers for
small insignificant
things!

215
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:17,869
Instead we must only
use out incredible
abilities for big,
important tasks!

216
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:19,703
Yeah! You got
that right, Lee!

217
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:22,036
You know this
isn't what he
meant by "big,"
right?

218
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:27,869
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>And so, Naruto and Lee aim to</i>
achieve bigger and better things
<i>using their ninja abilities.</i>

219
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:32,236
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Of course, bigger</i>
<i>isn't always better.</i>

220
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,136
Well, I guess
that's not such
a bad ending.

221
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,502
Oh!

222
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:55,469
Hi Sakura!

223
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,869
Huh? Oh! Lee!

224
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,469
Waiting for
the rain to stop?

225
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:00,602
Hah, yeah,
unfortunately.

226
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:02,902
Wait, you don't
have an umbrella
either?

227
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:05,369
This is just
another form
of training!

228
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:06,969
Oh, I see.

229
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:07,902
Huh?
[humming]

230
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:10,835
Hey, Naruto! Let me
share your umbrella!

231
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:12,635
Well, see ya later,
Lee!

232
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,969
Oh...

233
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,769
Thanks, I really
appreciate this!

234
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,769
No problem! Anything
for you! C'mon, I'll
walk you home.

235
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,935
(Sakura)
[giggle]

236
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:29,835
"I Want to Share an
Umbrella With Sakura"

237
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:35,735
Huh?
Is something
wrong, Tenten?

238
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:38,569
Is that... Lee?

239
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:42,635
Hmm... I cannot
decide whether I
like that pattern
better...

240
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:43,802
What do you
mean, Lee?

241
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:46,802
I mean the umbrella
in back that has the
floral print...

242
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:50,369
[screams]

243
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:52,302
Please do not
scare me like that!

244
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:54,835
I'm the one who
should be saying
that to you!

245
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:56,735
Lee, what are you
up to, anyway?

246
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,635
I uh... Well,
I... Um...

247
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:02,335
What's going on?
You're acting really
weird right now.

248
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,669
[sigh]

249
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,835
Hm?

250
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:09,202
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Oh... I see.</i>

251
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:13,702
You're upset because
you missed a chance
to get close to Sakura
under an umbrella, right?

252
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:16,902
I wouldn't worry if
you didn't have an
umbrella this time
and missed a chance.

253
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:20,635
It's the rainy
season, after all. You
should have plenty
more opportunities.

254
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,669
That's not the problem,
Guy Sensei gave Lee an
assignment a while ago...

255
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:31,369
Listen, Lee, you never
can tell when it might
suddenly become rainy
or windy during battle.

256
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:35,602
So to prepare yourself
to deal with adverse
weather, I want you not
to use an umbrella!

257
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,902
Yes! I understand,
Guy Sensei!

258
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:41,802
La la la la!!

259
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:45,235
Remember, going out
without an umbrella
will be training, Lee!

260
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:46,369
Let's roll!

261
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:47,335
Right!

262
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:50,402
Laa la la la la!

263
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:54,635
Oh give me a break!
Forget training, you
guys are just goofing
off in the rain!

264
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:58,802
I could never just
ignore a training
mission from Guy
Sensei...

265
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,835
But still... I
want to...

266
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:04,869
<i>...I want to smuggle</i>
<i>with Sakura under an</i>
<i>umbrella!</i>

267
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:08,935
Wait, did you just
say, "smuggle?" It's
"snuggle," numbskull!

268
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:13,235
Listen, if you're
that upset, why not
just go talk to Guy
Sensei?

269
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,869
I bet if you asked
he'd let the umbrella
thing slide,

270
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:17,602
Do you think so?

271
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:21,435
Well it couldn't be
thatimportant, he
didn't tell us not to
carry them after all...

272
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:24,635
And besides, Guy
Sensei isn't some
heartless ogre.

273
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:28,769
Oh, yes! You
are right!

274
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:31,535
<i>(Guy Sensei)</i>
<i>You fool!</i>

275
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,469
[crying in pain]

276
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:35,435
[gasps]

277
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:39,402
If you were merely some
ordinary ninja, then I'd
have no problem at all with
you carrying an umbrella.

278
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:44,535
(Guy)
But Lee... You cannot use
ninjutsu. If you want to
become an elite ninja...

279
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:47,369
...ordinary every day
activities must become
training!

280
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:50,535
And if you aren't
able to understand
that, then you're
hopeless!!

281
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:53,735
I am sorry...!

282
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:04,302
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Look how sad</i>
<i>he is...</i>

283
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:07,735
We really messed
this one up, don't
you think?

284
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:11,335
If you ask me, Guy
Sensei's being too
strict about this
whole thing...

285
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,702
I mean training is
important, but...

286
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,869
That's it! It's
training!

287
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,169
Training?

288
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:23,869
Yeah! If we can turn carrying an
umbrella into training somehow,
Guy Sensei shouldn't have any
objections to you using one!

289
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:24,902
It makes sense!

290
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:27,702
So c'mon! Cheer
up, okay?

291
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:29,769
We'll start using
umbrella training
right away!

292
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:32,902
And I suppose I'll
help out, too!

293
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:38,235
Congratulations!
Nice umbrella!

294
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:40,002
Not like that!!

295
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:44,402
Tenten, this is the
only kind of umbrella
related training that
I could think of!

296
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:46,435
Look, this isn't
a broadway show!

297
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:48,902
You're not even the
one who's using the
umbrella, Lee!

298
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,202
Then...

299
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:57,502
Cha-- Shu--!!!

300
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,769
No golfing on the
train platform!!

301
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:01,702
Now get serious,
would you?

302
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:03,469
I really was
being serious!

303
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:07,635
But try as I might,
I just cannot think
of a good way to train
with an umbrella!

304
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,569
Okay fine, I'll
help out....

305
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,635
Wait, how 'bout
we try...

306
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:16,235
Whew! A weighted
umbrella!

307
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:20,402
Just holding this massive
thing is training, no
matter how you slice it!

308
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:23,269
No no no no!
That is easy
for you to
say, Tenten!

309
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,702
But this is
impossible!

310
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,335
Look! Just quit your
griping and pick it
up already!

[weeping]

312

[groaning]
So... heavy!!

313
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:35,569
Neji... catch!

314
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:38,369
Why!? Why is it
always me!?

315

[groaning]

316
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:43,902
This one is...
far too heavy!

317
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:45,002
Stop your
whining!

318
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:47,669
Hard work's supposed
to be your trademark,
isn't it!?

319
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:51,602
Oh, that is right!
Hard work is my
trademark!

320
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:54,569
I understand now!
I will do my best!

321
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:56,869
Well it appears that
he's finally back to
normal.

322
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,202
Mhm!

323

324

Hey! Steady!
You're wobbling!

325
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:07,902
If you can't walk
straight then Sakura
will get soaked!

326
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:08,602
Right!

327
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:12,502
Come on, come on!
Just be glad those
weights aren't any
heavier!

328
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,402
Again! Lift it up!

[grunting]

330

reach the top!

gotten pretty good
at holding that one
up, Lee!

00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,469
No more, catch!

Ow! But why!?
Why always me!?

[straining]
Sakura, would you
like to take a
walk with me?

That voice... Lee?

[screaming]

338
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:39,935
Heavy! Ugh!

339
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:43,535
You can't ask her
with that look on
your face!!

340
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,435
You could just tell me
that instead of
smashing me...

341
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:49,202
You know, Tenten,
I think you're
overdoing things
a bit...

342
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:50,369
Grrr!

343
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,235
Alright, fine. I'll
handle things from
here on out!

344
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,802
[jumbled speech]
Sakura, would you
like to take a
walk with me?

345
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:57,969
That voice... Lee?

[screaming]

00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,902
Eight Trigrams!
Sixty Four Palm!

And you call that
handling it!?

[panting]

356
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:16,335
You did it!

357
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:19,735
Yes! You're holding
that heavy umbrella
in the air like it's
nothing at all!

358
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,702
And your invitation
to Sakura is really
smooth now!

359
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:25,969
Uh, Lee? What's
the matter?

360
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:28,835
Well... Neji...
Tenten...

361
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:33,969
Thank you so much!
I really appreciate
you doing all this
for me!

Are you crying?

364
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:41,869
No way! I simply have
a little mucus coming
out of my eyes right now!

365
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:44,435
You could have
just said it was
sweat, ya know.

366
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:46,002
Pretend I did!

367
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:49,402
Listen, you'd better not
look this pathetic when
you approach Sakura tomorrow!

368
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,969
I will not!

369
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,935

my best!

Well, Lee, can
we all share
your umbrella?
