Summer has finally arrived! And
<i>today is the day the Leaf</i>
<i>Village pool finally opens!</i>

2
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:58,108
I have been waiting for
this all year!

3
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:02,941
I am ready for intense summer
training, right at the poolside!

4
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:05,741
I am absolutely on fire!

5
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:09,641
Cool it, Bushy-Brow. We don't
need anymore heat around here.

6
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:10,541
Huh?

7
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:13,975
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

8
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:18,975
Ahh!

9
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:23,241
What are you doing, Neji?! You
are a man so change your clothes
like one!

10
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:24,275
Huh!

11
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:25,208
Hmph!

12
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,275
Hah!

13
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:28,308
Just like that!

14
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:30,175
That is almost <i>too</i> manly!

00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:31,808
[Chuckles]

16
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,241
Check it out, boys! This is the
new swimsuit I bought for
training on days like this!

17
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:36,941
Huh?

18
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,975
That means it's time for the
Sexy Jutsu!

19
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:43,875
And guess what? I've also got a
killer swimsuit ready!

20
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,341

No way! I will not lose!

Oh, please!

[Boys Yelling]
Those boys are so loud!

28
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,608
What in the world are
they doing over there?!

29
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:06,808
<i>I'm telling you right now,</i>
<i>Sakura would never wear a suit</i>
<i>like that!</i>

30
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:07,263
Huh?!

31
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,175
Alright, then how bout this?

32
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,708
<i>Sorry, shells aren't</i>
<i>a swimsuit!</i>
[Grunting]

33
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:13,808
<i>I think they set</i>
<i>off my pink hair!</i>

34
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,708
That's it!

[Heavy Breathing]

38
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:29,108
So that is the suit
she picked out?

39
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,108
It's a lot plainer than I
expected!

40
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,075
What in the? Excuse me?

41

[All]
Aww!

43
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,475
There's no water in
the pool!

44
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:50,608
This is completely crazy, Guy
Sensei! What is going on?!

45
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:54,975
Disaster! Every year at this
time, Kakashi has been given the
responsibility...

46
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,575
...of filling the
pool, using a water-style jutsu!

47
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:59,775
My goodness! Is Kakashi
Sensei hurt?!

[Inhales]

00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,675
Not yet, anyway.

50
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:08,275
He left this note, and
disappeared without a trace!

51
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:12,941
"I'm off on a journey to find
the latest book in the
'Make-Out' series."

52
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,841
<i>That's</i> his reason?!

53
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:19,041
The "Make-Out" series is Kakashi
<i>Sensei's favorite literary</i>
<i>collection.</i>

54
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,475
It's a little risque and geared
<i>toward adults.</i>

55
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:24,941
Apparently, every bookstore in
the entire village was sold out.

56
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:27,808
We had no idea. It looks like
he's been gone for a week.

57
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:31,808
This is most upsetting, Guy
Sensei. Could it take that long
to find a book?

58
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:34,641
[Chuckling]

59

[Giggling]
<i>Aha, the plot thickens!</i>

61

A co-ed chicken fight, only
shells for swimsuits! 'Suddenly,
she fell into his...'

My apologies, sir!

70
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:05,808
The main phase of the
plan has now begun.

71
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:08,908
While Lee and his gang are angry
about the pool being empty...

72
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:13,975
...we'll lure everyone to come
to the brand-new Super-Happy
Orochi Pool Park!

<i>I'll have Manda set up to look</i>
<i>like a huge water slide!</i>

<i>and out of our hair forever!</i>

you get them to think about
your park as an alternative?

00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,341

Good morning, I'm from the
Orochi Newspaper.

81
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,275
Would you care to sign up for a
trial monthly subscription?

82
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:46,808
It includes a free detergent
sample, and a discount off
tickets to the Super Happy
Orochi Pool Park!

83
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:51,008
You're offering the tickets at a
discount, not for free?

84
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:54,941
Hello there, friend! Would you
like to buy the Orochi Times?

85

Thanks anyway, I already
get the Mongoose Times.

<i>into account.</i>

I guess I should have offered
him better incentives.

89
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:06,908
Somehow I don't think that was
the real issue.

90
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:10,741
It appears we're gonna need a
back-up plan if we hope to
get this pool open!

91
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:13,775
I'm making it your next
assignment! Figure out how to
solve this!

92
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:15,541
An assignment for us?

93
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:20,408
That's right! I want you to work
together as a team and figure
out a way to fill it to the top!

94
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:21,741
That makes sense!

95
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:25,575
It is water-style training, and
we will be able to kill two
birds with one stone!

00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:27,441
What a drag.

It's gonna be a drag, but round
up Nakamura and Yoshimatsu from
Teams Two and Three...

114
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:19,608
Also, Mizuno from Team Four, and

They're rain men?

Can you fill a pool with
rainwater?

Impossible! It would
take about <i>forever!</i>

I think the pool's gonna be

Well we have to try something

That's not a water-style jutsu,
Lee! All you're doing there is
sweating!

128
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:02,241
I dried up and ran out of sweat
before I could even fill the
shallow end!

And it doesn't smell too good!

00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,041
You're out of your mind! No
one's gonna swim in a pool of

Yeah. Hey, wait a minute!

pure, sparkling, sweat, I think
<i>we would be okay!</i>

They don't have a prayer of
filling that pool. Now is my
chance to try again!

138
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:33,741
Too bad. I guess we will have to
give up swimming for a while.

139
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,408
Step right up, ladies and
gentlemen!

140
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,541
Are you sure about this?

141

This time it'll work,
for sure!

142

Look at that! Fifth prize is a
pool pass!

143
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:46,541
We will all be able to go
swimming if I win!

144
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:49,341
They're walking right into
my trap, those fools!

145
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:52,308
That would be great, but they
have no tickets for sale.

146
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:52,875
Huh?

147
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:54,441
Forget something, m'lord?

148
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:57,241
Too bad, it would have solved
all our problems.

That's the way it goes.

to pay for this trip?!

00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:40,408
Sorry that was a mistake! Take
one more spin!

I would have preferred free
passes, but I suppose it's
better than nothing.

We should try at least one more

again.

169

It would be more convenient.

There is only one option left! I

Would you please explain how
this is a Water-Style jutsu!?

You can't possibly fill a pool

Aha!

The important thing is...

230
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,400
We have to write out our wishes
and post them in public...

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,833
Without calling attention to the
<i>issue, you must quickly and</i>
<i>discreetly remove the piece or</i>
<i>pieces with ninjutsu.</i>

300
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,033
That seems to me to be
very good advice.

301
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:23,067
I have never done it before, so
I need to practice my technique!

302
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,567
I understand the need, but why
must I wear a bikini?

303
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,100
It looks good on you.

304
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:32,033
There we go. All set. But I can
not use ninjutsu.

305
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:35,367
Instead, I will use a series of
discreet strikes!

306
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,033
[Screaming]

307
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,000
This is your subtle technique?

308
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,367
My teeth are going to fall out!

309
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,333
[Laughing]
I did it!

310
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,533
[Grunting]

311
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:46,100

312
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,467
That guy's getting on my nerves!

313
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,100
Be patient a little while
longer. We'll destroy him on his
date.

314
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,300
This is exciting! I have
mastered Rule One of a good date
at the pool!

315
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,233
Well, well. What a surprise to
find you all here.

316
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:01,267
Huh?

317
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,333
[Gasps]
What the...?

318
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,033
What's wrong? Why all the
weird faces?

319
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,300
That is frightening!

320
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,467
<i>The pool water washed off</i>
<i>most of her makeup!</i>

321
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:15,267
<i>I had no idea what she looked</i>
like under that veneer! Is that
<i>face even human?!</i>

322
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,067
Huh? What's wrong?

323
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,200
[Frightened Squeals]

324
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,067
We'll take a short break to let
Lady Tsunade fix herself up, and
<i>preserve her dignity.</i>

325
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:26,067
Let me get this straight! The
Star Festival's not really like
Christmas?

326
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,200
<i>Okay, that's enough time.</i>
<i>She's back!</i>

327
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,533
You're practicing for a date,
huh? Very interesting. That
really sounds like fun.

328
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,433
How 'bout if I teach you some
dance moves?

329
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,133
I am not sure...

330
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,967
Come on now Lee. Line
dancing, Disco, I can teach you
anything you want to know!

331
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,967
Thanks but, I am not sure that a
single woman in her 50's can
offer me advice on dance <i>or</i>
dating moves.

332
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,633
I am afraid your ship has
passed.

333
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,933
Quiet down, Lee!

334
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,033
You're on thin ice!

I'm...gonna kill him!

338
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:04,867
All in good time, Kabuto. We
just have to get through today.

339
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:09,333
We'll ruin his life when he's on
his special date. [Grunting]

340
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,167
So! You guy's ready to enjoy
this water park?

341
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,900
I have been enjoying as much as
I can stand.

342
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,400
I bet you haven't tried
everything!

343
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:18,933
Did you know they have a huge,
twisty water-slide here?

344
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,100
It's over a hundred meters long!
I really want to ride it!

345
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:26,033
The presence of a slide brings
us to Pool Date Rule Number Two.

346
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:31,500
An embarrassing but happy,
accident can occur when
swimsuits get pulled up, or <i>fall</i>
<i>off</i> during a ride!

I don't want to see <i>your</i> suit go
anywhere, that's for sure.

349
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,200
This is very interesting! I must
see if it really works!

350
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,433
Not yet! What if they find out
the slide is really Manda?!

351
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:43,300
<i>Wait!</i>

352
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,400
This is kind of a weird
water-slide, that is for sure!

353
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,933
Hold it!

354
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,633
So, you ready to jump in?

355
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:50,433
Yep!

356
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:52,567
<i>Wait a minute you two!</i>
<i>Don't do it!</i>

357
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,400
Excuse me?

358
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:57,233
The slide's being worked on! You
can't ride it yet!

Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.

Are you okay
Lord Orochimaru?

363
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,167
I'll never forgive him!

364
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:17,233
It's not fair! I didn't sign up
to be a punching bag for this
kid!

00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:20,233
Just watch! I'll ruin his life!

<i>The Star Festival has finally</i>

<i>I have practiced the perfect</i>

<i>Festival.</i>

368
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,100
<i>Now all I have to do is ask</i>
<i>Sakura out.</i>

369
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,400
Here she comes.

370
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,633
Time to man up!

371
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:42,167

Uh, Sakura?

374
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:49,433
What's up?

375
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:54,400
I was wondering, um...Can I talk
to you about my wish for the
Star Festival?

376
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:55,833
You mean <i>you</i> have a wish?

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,267
Well, they asked me to write it
down, so I was hoping...

378
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,433
What I mean to say...
Yes?

379
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:03,933
I put it on this card!

380
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:05,300
Here.

381
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,333
Okay.

382
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,167
Did I mention I had a wish, as
well? <i>My</i> wish was to pass my
level three medical ninjutsu
exam.

383
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,167
I'm on my way to the test site
right now!

384
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,082
Oh.

385
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,233
I've been so scared I'd fail, I
put off taking it 'til now.

386
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:24,500
But Guy Sensei helped me decide
to go for it! He said I have to
make my wish come true on my
own!

387
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,233
He is right, you know.

388
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:27,533
Now what was your
wish, Lee?

389
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,867
Well, my wish...

390
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:36,633
Actually, my wish was...uhh, you
know, it is kind of funny, now
that you bring it up, it is a
little hard to read...

391

[Sigh]

I am sure you will have no
trouble. You will pass that test
with flying colors!

A show about cooking? Sounds

<i>Typical male reaction. Tell me</i>
<i>something, Shikamaru.</i>

<i>everything into a pot and boil</i>
<i>it?</i>

404
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:07,050
That's not my style. I prep
all my ingredients the day
before. I simmer the broth over
night.

405
00:24:07,084 --> 00:24:09,350
Then I add subtle
seasonings to bring out the

<i>Now that sounds like a drag!</i>
