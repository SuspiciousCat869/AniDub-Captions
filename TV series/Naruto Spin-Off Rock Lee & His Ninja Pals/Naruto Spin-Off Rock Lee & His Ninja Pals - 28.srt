1
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:58,323
Matsutake mushroom rice,
steamed matsutake mushrooms,
grilled matsutake mushrooms,
matsutake mushroom tempura!

2
00:01:58,356 --> 00:02:01,889
Ah, autumn! Such a
fragrant and tasty
season!

3
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:04,556
Oh, autumn! Autumn!

4
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:06,556
Finally, a matsutake
mushroom hunt!

5
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:07,756
It's been so long.

6
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:10,856
Guy Sensei and
Kakashi Sensei are
both on cloud nine.

7
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,123
Of course! We are here to
pick matsutake mushrooms!

8
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:16,556
Hunt, hunt, hunt!

9
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:17,723
[screaming]

10
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:20,589
Stop, Lee! Do you
have something
against me? Stop!

11
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:24,189
Lee's got the right
spirit but entirely
the wrong place.

12
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,823
Huh? Weird, what
was that?

13
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,756
<i>"Hunting for Matsutake</i>
<i>Mushrooms!"</i>

14
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:43,623
There aren't any
mushrooms anywhere!

15
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:47,223
I don't understand
it! Where did they
all go!

16
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:49,623
And we came all this
way to gather them.

17
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:55,656
Well, unfortunately, we
had an unusually hot
summer. So we didn't have
the conditions we need

18
00:02:55,689 --> 00:03:01,623
for them to grow well.
As you see, this is the
only one we've found after
looking for the whole day.

19
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:07,289
Full course!
Time to eat!
Nom nom, slurp,
huff and puff, burp!

20
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:12,689
Even the local restaurants
have had to get the supplies
for their matsutake mushroom
dishes imported from grocery

21
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:14,523
stores outside the
country.

22
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:18,923
We came all this way,
but there is nothing to
be found but junk from
other villages!

23
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:20,889
Why is it junk just
because it is imported?

24
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:25,656
I guess there won't be
any new mushroom dishes
at the local restaurants
in the Hidden Leaf, then.

25
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:28,356
We have no choice.
We'll just have to
head back.

26
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,123
Uh...

27
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:30,856
That's Hinata...

28
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:32,723
Hey, Neji, look!

29
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:33,556
Hm?

30
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:37,723
Hinata!

31
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:38,856
[screaming]

32
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:42,156
Oh, hey, Neji.
Hello, Tenten.

33
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,456
What are you doing
all the way out here
in the forest?

34
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,223
Oh, what a coincidence!

35
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,889
I'm just here to
landscape the
mountainside.

36
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:51,289
That's some
coincidence...

37
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:55,889
A girl in this day and
age cutting grass on a
mountainside by herself
with a traditional scythe.

38
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:57,689
Is something
wrong, Hinata?

39
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:59,723
[sigh]

40
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:01,423
Uh...

41
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:04,823
You were following us?

42
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:10,489
Yes. I saw everyone
leaving to go look for
matsutake mushrooms, so
I tagged along.

43
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:15,723
I have the day off,
too. And you looked like
you were having so much
fun that I couldn't resist!

44
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,889
Maybe I shouldn't have
but I ended up following
your group.

45
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:21,856
<i>Just 'ended up', huh?</i>

46
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,589
But you do realize that
you didn't have to follow
us in secret, right?

47
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:27,856
You could've called
out to us at any time!

48
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:30,356
Oh, I, uh...

49
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:34,889
Hinata wasn't following
us, she was following
Naruto! That's why you

50
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:37,123
didn't try harder to
get our attention,
isn't it?

51
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,289
Um... Well...
You know, I kind
just, um...

52
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,789
Gotcha! Then let
us help you out,
okay?

53
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:45,889
Huh?

54
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:48,556
<i>Of course, it's entirely</i>
<i>up to you whether or not</i>
<i>things work out with</i>
<i>Naruto...</i>

55
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,123
But maybe we can help
you overcome some of
your shyness.

56
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:53,489
Right, Neji?

57
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:57,523
Sure. If this is something
that will help Hinata,
then you can count me in.

58
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,823
Wow, you guys.
Thank you so much.

59
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:02,889
Oh...

60
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,489
You guys! Where
have you been?

61
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:08,789
Sorry, Lee! We
had something to
deal with.

62
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:10,056
Oh! Hinata!

63
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:13,289
Oh! Hey, there, Hinata!
What are you doing way
out here?

64
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,489
Naruto... I, uh...

65
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:18,156
Relax, relax!

66
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,156
And just try to
act natural!

67
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,723
N-Natural...

68
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,123
I came up here to the
mountain to do some
laundry.

69
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:27,856
What's natural
about that?!

70
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:30,956
Well, I was using this
outfit to symbolize
Mother Nature.

71
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:33,789
That's the wrong kind
of acting and the wrong
kind of natural!

72
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,356
I can see you're as
natural as ever,
Hinata!

73
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,089
I'm natural?

74
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:43,456
I just knew it! I
should've symbolized a
big natural monument
like the Jomon Cedar!

75
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:46,956
Right now, all you're
symbolizing is the
loss of your mind.

76
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:50,823
It's hopeless! Her brain
just doesn't function
correctly when she's
around Naruto.

77
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:53,423
Hey, whatever happened
to the matsutake mushroom
hunt?

78
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:58,189
We have all been talking
about it, and unfortunately
it appears that we will have
to call it quits.

79
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:01,856
We've only found one
this whole day! Maybe
I'll just go grab some
ramen.

80
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,789
Yeah, I think I'll
head back and get
some lunch, too.

81
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:05,989
[sigh]

82
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:07,989
Oh well, that's
too bad!

83
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:11,223
Oh, no! We just got
Hinata to join
everyone!

84
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:14,823
If we don't do something
as a group, Hinata will
never come out of her shell!

85
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:18,289
Guy Sensei, hunting for
matsutake mushrooms is
great training!

86
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:21,489
We should continue the
hunt for them! There's
just no question about it!

87
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:24,189
<i>Well, I really am</i>
<i>craving some...</i>

88
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:27,156
Going home without
gathering some
would be a shame...

89
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:30,989
All right, everyone!
We're going to have
a competition to see who

90
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,989
can find the most
mushrooms!

91
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:34,323
[sigh]

92
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:38,089
So the search for
matsutake mushrooms
begins, but...

93
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:42,356
Yeah, but if you ask me,
without question the best
way to serve mushrooms is
in ramen!

94
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:45,489
C'mon Hinata, just
go and talk to Naruto.

95
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,856
Um, yeah, okay...

96
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:51,156
Naruto, do you think
that maybe we could-

97
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,123
Sakura! Since this is
a team competition,
let's team up!

98
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:56,223
[whining]

99
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:59,156
He's not listening
to me!

100
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:04,856
We've got no choice
but to gather more
matsutake mushrooms
than them!

101
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,056
If we win...

102
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,456
I didn't know matsutake
mushrooms were this good!

103
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,056
You're so awesome,
Hinata!

104
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,823
Yeah! And then that self-
confidence will help her
finally start talking to
Naruto!

105
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:26,123
Let's go for it, Hinata!

106
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:28,356
Uh... Right!

107
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,056
Everyone is so
motivated to
win this!

108
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,823
Then I will have to
do my absolute best!
So...

109
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:51,956
Come on, everyone,
let us go!

110
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:53,423
What's with
that outfit?!

111
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:56,923
I figured that this would
be the bare minimum required
to go out on a hunt!

112
00:07:56,956 --> 00:08:00,456
You're just wasting time
and energy! And that's
the wrong kind of hunt,
anyway!

113
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:04,356
And why did you have to
make Hinata and me both
dress up like hunting
dog as well?!

114
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,723
Okay, then what
about this?

115
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:11,889
It is seven o'clock!
Time for the show to
begin! Say hello to
Kyouko!

116
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:13,389
That's the wrong
kind of hunter!

117
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:15,489
No, I was focusing
more on the idea of
confidence!

118
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:21,156
You're getting way to
obscure! And that would
interest moms more than the
kids who are watching this!

119
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:22,356
Fine, then!

120
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,956
How about a few
monster hunters!

121
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,223
The show's sponsors
aren't paying me
enough to deal with
this!

122
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:29,423
All right, that's it!

123
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,789
I've had enough of this!

124
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:35,056
[screaming]

125
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:39,789
Since this is our
first hunt, I don't
actually know what
the best strategy is.

126
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:42,256
Let's go check
out what everyone
else is doing.

127
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,156
Here goes!

128
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:48,223
Ugh! I haven't
found anything!

129
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:51,289
Man, these matsutake
mushrooms sure are shy!

130
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:05,489
It appears that Shikamaru's
group has been utilizing
Ino's Mind-Transfer Jutsu.

131
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:07,456
Yeah, with that...

132
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:10,489
<i>Ino can take over the</i>
<i>minds of animals and</i>
<i>have them do what she</i>
<i>wants.</i>

133
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:11,989
Wait, the mind...

134
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:14,056
Of course, that is
it! The mind!

135
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:15,623
Huh? What's
that mean?

136
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:19,089
In order to figure out
how to coax the mushrooms
out of hiding, we need to

137
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:21,489
get inside their heads
and think like they do!

138
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:25,223
Neji, Hinata, I will
need you to help me out.

139
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:26,756
Hey, what about me?

140
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,089
<i>You would be useless!</i>

141
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:29,623
I'd be useless?

142
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,556
No offense. I only
need Neji and Hinata
for this job.

143
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,689
What? You need me?

144
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,523
What the-?!

145
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:43,956
Hey, Matsuko, I am going
to a party with some
people from Mountain Yam
University tomorrow!

146
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:49,456
Nameko and Donko are
already coming, as well.
But we really need to
bring along one more.

147
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,556
Hey, so, would
you come with us?

148
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:55,856
Oh, come on, Matsuko,
do not be that way.
Quit acting so shy!

149
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:59,423
If you came along, you
would be the life of the
party, I just know that
you would!

150
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,423
Lee! What are
you doing?!

151
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:07,923
I was only trying to think
like a shy matsutake mushroom
and to create an inviting

152
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,489
atmosphere where they
would be comfortable
with joining us.

153
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:15,156
If that was all it took,
then every last college in
the country would be filled
to brim with mushrooms.

154
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,956
And why did you have
to make us dress up
yet again?!

155
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:21,023
<i>We three are the only</i>
<i>ones who have mushroom-</i>
<i>shaped heads!</i>

156
00:10:21,056 --> 00:10:22,889
Hey, don't call us
mushroom-heads!

157
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,056
Oh, Matsuko,
you poor baby!

158
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:25,823
Huh?

159
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:27,489
You...

160
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:31,023
I know exactly how you
feel deep down inside...

161
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:34,156
I really don't like
it when girls are so
tentative!

162
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:38,856
I know because I'm very
shy, as well. And I just
can't stand it!

163
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:40,856
<i>Hinata...</i>

164
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:43,123
She's talking
about herself...

165
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:46,423
I'm going to try my
absolute hardest to be
as brave as I can.

166
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,889
And I'm finally going
to talk to Naruto, too!

167
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:50,389
<i>Talk to me about what?</i>

168
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:53,523
I was about to head
back. What are you
guys up to?

169
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:56,089
Oh, well, you know, we
were just kind of...

170
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,789
[screaming]

171
00:10:58,823 --> 00:10:59,723
Hinata!

172
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:00,456
Hinata!

173
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:01,756
Naruto, you idiot!

174
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:03,689
What's wrong?
What did I do?

175
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:08,223
I don't care anymore!
I just can't do it!

176
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:09,956
Wow, what an
incredible tumble!

177
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:12,489
It's kinda like a
metaphor for her
life right now!

178
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,089
Hinata, hang on!

179
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:20,589
[groaning]

180
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:23,189
[gasp]

181
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,156
That's...

182
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,923
Well, bon appetit!

183
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:30,189
Too bad Hinata was the
only one who ended up
finding a mushroom.

184
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:33,056
It's good thing that
even one is plenty
delicious, then!

185
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:35,156
You did awesome,
Hinata! Great job!

186
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:37,723
Thanks, Naruto...

187
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:44,956
And so, the kinda successful
hunt for matsutake mushrooms
granted Hinata a little
more courage.

188
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:48,123
You know, Hinata, I've
been meaning to tell you
something for a while now.

189
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:49,123
[gasp]

190
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:50,723
You have?

191
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:53,989
With your hairstyle and
personality, you're
starting to remind me
of Bushy-Brow.

192
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:54,823
Oh...

193
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:00,823
Huh? What's the matter?

194
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:01,489
[growling]

195
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:02,856
<i>Naruto!</i>

196
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,689
What?! What
did I do?!

197
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:18,930
Everyone, no matter
how calm, gets angry
sometimes, right?

198
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:19,930
[yelling]

199
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:23,563
I've had about all I can
take from this village!

200
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,363
So give me some money
and safe passage to
another one, pronto-
or else!

201
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,363
Help me! Someone
do something!

202
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,597
<i>Do not worry!</i>

203
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,763
Huh?!

204
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:35,663
We are on the scene,
so relax! You will
be safe now!

205
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:38,430
Hey, that's the ninja
who can't use ninjutsu,
isn't it?

206
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:40,563
How can he save
that guy?!

207
00:12:40,597 --> 00:12:46,763
Easy! I do not need to
use ninjutsu to stop a
petty criminal such as this
one! I will use genjutsu!

208
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:49,630
Genjutsu?!
Oh no, not
again.

209
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:53,930
Come on now, buddy, stop
being unreasonable and
think of your poor mother
back home!

210
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:55,497
Just what would
she say?!

211
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,463
<i>I knew it.</i>

212
00:12:56,697 --> 00:12:57,797
Huh?

213
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,797
It is not too late!
Do not make her suffer
anymore!

214
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,297
Please ma'am, come
over and talk to him.

215
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,930
No way... My
mother is here?

216
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:08,463
Why does it always
have to be me?

217
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:13,697
Just look at her! Do
you not see how depressed
this poor old woman is
feeling right now!

218
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,963
It is your fault!

219
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:16,363
It's your fault!

220
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:20,730
[groaning]

221
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:28,730
<i>"Lee and Neji Part Ways"</i>

222
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,897
<i>I've had enough!</i>

223
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,030
In every single episode,
you subject me to the
worst humiliations!

224
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:38,630
Neji...

225
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:40,297
Please, calm
down, Neji!

226
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,830
How can I calm down?!

227
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:47,697
On the matsutake mushroom
hunt alone, you made me
dress up like a 70's singer,
a dog, some monster hunter,

228
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,597
and even a mushroom!

229
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,597
But that was not just
any mushroom! It was
Matsutake Matsuko's
good friend and fellow

230
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,563
sophomore from
Toadstool University!
And her name was Donko
Shiitake!

231
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:02,563
That is not the issue!
Forget it! I'm done
with all this silliness!

232
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:05,530
Neji...

233
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,763
Wow, I never thought
Neji would do that.

234
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:12,063
It sounds to me like
he's really angry.

235
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:14,930
To be perfectly honest,
this entire time...

236
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,730
...I had no idea
he felt that way.

237
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:19,763
What?! How could you
not know that?!

238
00:14:21,497 --> 00:14:25,330
In every single skit you've
ever done, you've put him
in silly roles and weird
costumes!

239
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:27,330
He's just been
putting up with it!

240
00:14:27,363 --> 00:14:30,297
I always thought he was
on board with everything
we did.

241
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,030
If only you'd take some
of that endless optimism
and apply it to some more
noble pursuits, Lee.

242
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:40,530
I know what I must do!
I will keep him out of the
more colorful roles and cast
him as the main character!

243
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:41,897
You're not getting it!

244
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:45,363
Wouldn't it be better
just to apologize, Bushy
Brow?

245
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:48,630
Yeah, it seems like
you're risking the loss
of a close friend here.

246
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:49,863
Perhaps...

247
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,597
I know what I must do.
I will apologize then seal
away my genjutsu forever!

248
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,863
They're just skits.

249
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,497
Did you hear
that, Kabuto?

250
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,497
Yes. Every word.

251
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,563
Lee's actually going
to choose to seal away
his genjutsu techniques!

252
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:08,930
But they're not genjutsu,
they're just skits, Lord
Orochimaru.

253
00:15:08,963 --> 00:15:12,997
It's infuriating how
many times that genjutsu
has defeated us.

254
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,397
<i>You're starting to</i>
<i>infuriate me, Lord</i>
<i>Orochimaru.</i>

255
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:23,797
But without his genjutsu,
Lee would be nothing more
than an old man at a bar
bragging about his glory days.

256
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:26,697
<i>That doesn't even</i>
<i>make any sense!</i>

257
00:15:27,397 --> 00:15:29,930
This is going to
be just perfect!

258
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,397
Meanwhile, at
Neji's house...

259
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:39,630
That Lee! I can't
even stand to look
at him now.

260
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:40,763
<i>N-Neji...</i>

261
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,763
Hm?

262
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,363
Yes, Hinata? What
can I do for you?

263
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:48,430
Um... Actually, I
have a big favor
to ask you.

264
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,697
A big favor?

265
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,530
Yes.

266
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,830
I want to learn how to
stop being so introverted
and shy. And I could use
your help with that.

267
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:59,663
Why, of course,
Hinata. It's my
pleasure.

268
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:02,430
Simply tell me
what it is that
you'd like me to
do.

269
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:05,263
I realized something
on the matsutake
mushroom hunt.

270
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,997
When I'm able to project
myself into something
external, it's easier to
say what's in my heart.

271
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:15,397
That day, the external
thing was just a mushroom,
and yet...

272
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,830
Uh, okay...

273
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:19,030
But still, if I use
that as a starting
point...

274
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:23,097
Then I believe that I
can finally learn to
overcome my shyness!

275
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,563
Again, what
exactly do you
need from me?

276
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,430
Please...

277
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:30,463
I want you to be my
acting partner, Neji!

278
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:31,497
[groaning]

279
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:41,197
Listen closely, Lee.
You need to apologize
to Neji and bury the
hatchet with him or

280
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,197
you might lose him
as a friend forever!

281
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,597
[sigh]

282
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,263
Yes, she is right.

283
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,997
<i>Aw, you seem sad.</i>

284
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,030
Wait, that voice!

285
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:51,297
Orochimaru! Why
are you here?!

286
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:55,597
Come on! Have you
forgotten my character's
motivation?

287
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,530
I'm here to destroy
the Leaf, of course!

288
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:02,630
You've forgotten that
more than anyone else in
recent memory Lord
Orochimaru.

289
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:06,963
I never learn, do you?
I will not let you harm
the village!

290
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:12,397
Impressive confidence.
But do you truly believe
that you have what it
takes to stop me?

291
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,563
Absolutely!

292
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,630
[charging yell]

293
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,530
[grunting]

294
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:19,097
That is enough!

295
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,463
Great Leaf Hurricane!

296
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:26,363
[grunting]

297
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:29,063
[screaming]

298
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:30,663
How can this be?!

299
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:33,463
Lord Orochimaru was
pulled in so easily!

300
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:35,030
<i>Don't worry, Kabuto.</i>

301
00:17:35,063 --> 00:17:35,563
[gasp]

302
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:36,530
[gasp]

303
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:43,663
Ah! This is genjutsu!

304
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:44,963
Uhh, a skit?

305
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,230
If you really think you
stand a chance, go ahead.

306
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:52,397
But I know you're nothing
more than a little baby
who hates his vegetables!

307
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,363
Ugh! There is only
one way out of this
now!

308
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:59,563
I really do have to try
to increase my daily
fiber intake.

309
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:03,330
Because that is the
hidden secret to a
truly successful diet.

310
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:06,397
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

311
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:12,463
But, I have forsaken
genjutsu so that I can
patch everything up with
Neji! I cannot fight back!

312
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:19,297
<i>It actually worked!</i>
<i>Without his ridiculous</i>
<i>skits, Lee has lost his</i>
<i>ability to fight!</i>

313
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:24,563
Without his genjutsu
he's nothing! Now I just
have to deliver the
finishing blow!

314
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,863
<i>Tenten, Neji...</i>
<i>What do I do?</i>

315
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:32,497
<i>You need me?</i>

316
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,363
Yes.

317
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:36,197
Please, Mr. Mayo, I
need you by my side!

318
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,197
What are you
talking about?

319
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:43,597
How can you say that you
need me when you and
Saucestein of the Sauce
Clan are inextricably linked!

320
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,063
Plus everyone knows that
<i>you've also been with Bono</i>
<i>the Bonito and Sean the</i>
<i>Seaweed since forever.</i>

321
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:50,263
Yes, but...

322
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,663
<i>Konomi...</i>

323
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,930
Huh?

324
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:56,063
Please, don't try to make
me stray away from you
anymore. Bye.

325
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:57,163
<i>No!</i>

326
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,997
I've always wanted to
say this to you, but I've
just been to afraid to!

327
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:06,030
I never ever stopped
thinking about you!

328
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,130
Konomi...

329
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:13,330
<i>What the heck is this</i>
<i>scene?! What are we in,</i>
<i>some kind of soap opera?</i>

330
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:18,097
<i>And why would there be</i>
<i>drama between mayonnaise</i>
<i>and an okonomiyaki?!</i>

331
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,497
<i>Even if it is for Hinata,</i>
<i>the writing in this scene</i>
<i>is just awful!</i>

332
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,930
That was so
wonderful, Neji!

333
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,297
What?!

334
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,297
I don't think I could've
made so much progress if
you weren't so good.

335
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,963
I'm just not used to
this kind of stuff.

336
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,263
Yes, I understand.

337
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,963
Someday I want to be
able to actually say
all that to the actual
person...

338
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:43,563
...instead of just
saying it to a bottle
of mayonnaise.

339
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:47,263
But, anyway, thank
you very much for all
of your help, Neji!

340
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:48,563
Sure, Hinata.

341
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,463
And I'm going to have
to give my thanks to
Lee and Tenten the

342
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:53,297
next time I see
them, too.

343
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,997
What? Those two?

344
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,597
Oh yes! I never would've
been able to ask this favor
of you just a couple of
years ago.

345
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:05,463
Building closer relationships
with all your friends has made
you so much more dependable
and so kind.

346
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:06,530
[gasp]

347
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:10,230
Neji, can we do the
scene one more time?

348
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:11,463
I'm sorry, Hinata.

349
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:12,397
Huh?

350
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:17,563
I just remembered
something I have
to do.

351
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:19,997
Oh! Sure, go
right ahead!

352
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,397
And now, it is time
to finish this!

353
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:27,530
Lee!

354
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,630
Just what are you
doing?! You should've
ended this with genjutsu
in a heartbeat!

355
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:36,363
Neji...

356
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,430
But I swore that I would
seal away my genjutsu.

357
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:42,030
This isn't like you.

358
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,630
But if you're still
willing to let me
help you...

359
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:49,263
Then I'll be more than
happy to pitch in and
do whatever I can.

360
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:52,363
I just... had a
little thinking
to do.

361
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:53,397
Neji...

362
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,330
Neji!

363
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,330
I'll just help you
out a little bit here
and there. It's no
big deal!

364
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:02,597
Oh, Neji!
Thank you, Neji!

365
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:11,930
My eyes! It's
in my eyes!

366
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:13,063
No! Lord Orochimaru!

367
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:14,163
<i>Mayo on my veggies!</i>

368
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:17,363
Even a little baby
like me will eat
his veggies now!

369
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:20,097
Whatever! Let's
just take these
guys down, Lee!

370
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,930
Right!

371
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:21,930
Let us go!

372
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:25,463
[screaming]

373
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:31,563
Neji...

374
00:21:31,597 --> 00:21:33,397
Don't say anything.

375
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,563
I'm...I'm sorry.

376
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:42,997
Neji!

377
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:49,630
And so, Neji showed Lee
that he'd come to understand
his genjutsu, at least a
little.

378
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:55,597
Come on, buddy! Just
think of your poor mother
back home, worrying!

379
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:56,863
Please, ma'am...

380
00:21:56,897 --> 00:21:59,263
Come over here and
talk to him, would you?

381
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,230
But as nearly everyone
else thought would happen,
Neji ended up regretting it
almost immediately.

382
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:07,430
Ugh... I should've known.

383
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:54,023
<i>The title's for next time</i>
<i>are: "We are Here to Welcome</i>
<i>Gaara!" and "The Ultimate</i>
<i>Autumn Diet!"</i>

384
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:56,690
Neji, let us keep our
momentum going!

385
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:58,823
<i>Looks like I won't</i>
<i>have to dress up</i>
<i>at all!</i>

386
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:02,623
You could not be more
wrong! For certain scenes
to be conveyed properly,

387
00:24:02,656 --> 00:24:06,690
we need Nejie, Nejio,
Nejitine, Nejinia.

388
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:09,690
I have about eight
hundred characters
lined up for you to
play!

389
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:12,856
<i>But why?! Why do</i>
<i>they all have to</i>
<i>be girls?!</i>
