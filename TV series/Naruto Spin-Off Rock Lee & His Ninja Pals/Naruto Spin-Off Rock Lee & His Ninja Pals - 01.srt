00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:58,971
Welcome to the Hidden Leaf
Village. As you all know,
it's the home of the legendary
Naruto Uzumaki. But today, a

2
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:01,638
very unique ninja takes
center stage.

3
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,038
Idiot... Idiot...

4
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,005
Ahhhhh!

5
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:07,538
[gooney laughter]

6
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:08,671
Agh!

7
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:09,871
Go away!

8
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:10,905
[evil laughter]

9
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:13,571
Oh, we'll leave. As soon
as you give us the money!

10
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:15,505
Fork it over and
nobody gets hurt.

11
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:17,505
That's what you get
for borrowing it!

12
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:18,538
Leave me alone!

13
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,071
We'll be outta your
hair as soon as you
pay up!

14
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,905
Give it up and
this'll all be over.

15
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:24,038
You shoulda paid
us back sooner!

16
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,438
But, I can't!

17
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:28,038
We'll be up in your face
until we see the cash!

18
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,538
Then you won't have to
bear the embarrassment
anymore!

19
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,671
This is the perfect
crime, guys!

20
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:33,771
That is enough out of you!

21
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:34,471
Huh?!

22
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:35,038
Wha-?

23
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:35,738
Who said that?!

24
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:36,771
[excited gasp]

25
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:37,505
Ugh!

26
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:43,538
Lowlifes like you need
to be taught a lesson!

27
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,038
Huh?!

28
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:46,605
Who are you?!

29
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:51,038
As much as I would love to
tell you that I need no
introduction, it would be
rude of me not to provide

30
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,405
you a name. Even though you
three are wearing masks!

31
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:56,771
Get ready, because here
comes the intro!

32
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:58,905
No one can deter
me from my path!

33
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,671
My favorite words are...

34
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:05,038
Effort and guts!

35
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:08,438
I am a ninja who
lives for love!

36
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:10,638
The name of your foe...

37
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:13,038
Hah! Ya-gi-gi-gah!

38
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:16,038
...is Rock Lee!

39
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,638
Rock Lee is a ninja who
can't use Ninjutsu.

40
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:21,805
Idiot...Idiot...

41
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:24,771
[crowd chatter]

42
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:29,905
If you really think I am
going to let a trio of
thugs pick on a helpless
little girl, think again!

43
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:32,705
Scram, half-pint! This
ain't none of your concern!

44
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:37,071
You wouldn't be talking all
tough if you knew who we
were! I hope you like knuckle
sandwiches!

45
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:39,471
Don't say we didn't
warn ya, buddy!

46
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:44,505
Then you leave me no choice!
If talking will not fix this,
then punching will have to do!

47
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,538
Bring it on!

48
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,005
[attacking yell]

49
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:49,005
[barking]

50
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:50,538
[pushing grunts]

51
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:54,538
Ahhhhhh!

52
00:03:55,971 --> 00:04:01,305
Doooooggg doooooo!

53
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:11,471
[attacking yell]

54
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:15,805
Ahhhhh!

55
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:22,971
[hysterical laughter]

56
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,705
Ooh! Nice undies, bro!

57
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:25,205
That's hot!

58
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:26,805
Polka dots are in!

59
00:04:26,838 --> 00:04:29,805
You jerk! I'm gonna
get you for this!

60
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:31,538
That ninja is
pretty awesome!

61
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,705
Give it up! All he
did was fall down!

62
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:34,671
Huh...

63
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:37,605
That maybe how it looks
to the untrained eye...

64
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:43,938
...but, to those in the
know. That move lets one
win a fight without
hurting the other guy!

65
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:46,771
Elimination by
Depantsification!

66
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:49,038
No way! That
sounds so fake!

67
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,405
He just tripped over
dog poo, that's all!

68
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:54,505
He made them leave me alone,
and he didn't even have to
hurt 'em!

69
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:59,138
I can tell by the hearts
where your eyes should be,
that you are impressed by
my prowess!

70
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,671
Give me your hand.

71
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:01,407
Okay!

72
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:02,038
Give me a break!

73
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:02,838
Ahhh!

74
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:09,805
Tenten? Neji?

75
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:11,838
Look who left us
behind again!

76
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:16,638
We're supposed to be a
team, y'know! Which means
you can't just ditch us
whenever you feel like it.

77
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,005
Now, let's get going.

78
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:22,805
Sorry, but, could I get a
little more help before
you take him away?

79
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:23,971
Of course!

80
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:26,371
Idiot...Idiot...

81
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:27,971
<i>Lone sharks, huh?</i>

82
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:31,938
Yeah. They're picking on
me to get my dad to pay
back what he borrowed
from them.

83
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:37,005
Paying back a debt is
important, but picking on
those who are weaker than
you is not honorable!

84
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,338
Hm! That's a good
way to put it!

85
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,405
A friend of mine owed some
money to some people once,

86
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:44,805
and all they did was
bug him day and night!

87
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:49,071
Sir, the movie you rented,
After school Escapades, is
now overdue.

88
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:54,405
Sir, the movie you rented,
After school Ecstasy, is now
overdue.

89
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,905
Sir, you might as well
just buy the movie.

90
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:58,371
Ahhhh!

91
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:02,538
Overdue movies have
nothing to do with loan
sharks, you big dummy!

92
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:04,771
Do go on.

93
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:09,438
My dad's been working extra
hard to make enough money to
pay them back, but that's
not enough. If we don't

94
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:13,038
give them ten times as much
as he borrowed, they're
gonna mess up our house!

95
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:16,805
That's awful. Having
loan sharks threaten
your family like that.

96
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:21,905
The whole reason I came
to this village was to
hire a ninja to protect
my family from those thugs,

97
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:24,405
but then they caught
up with me on the way.

98
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:27,338
I'm just glad this nice
man was here to save me!

99
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:29,905
Save you? All he did
was pants a guy.

100
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:33,405
Please, Mister. You
wouldn't leave us high
and dry, would ya?

101
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:37,071
Do not worry! I am on it!

102
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,938
Uh, what are you
talking about, Lee?

103
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:41,605
Yes. We're already on
a mission, remember?

104
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:43,871
We will just have to
make room for this,
as well!

105
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:45,338
Do you mean it?!

106
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,838
Those thugs are toast! And
I am the toaster who will
bring them to justice!

107
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:50,138
Ahhhh!

108
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:53,738
You're not a toaster, you
dummy! That simile makes
no sense!

109
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:54,971
It's a metaphor.

110
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:57,538
Idiot...Idiot...

111
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:01,771
Hey, could you maybe
not walk like that
all the time?

112
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:04,405
What?! And ignore my
training?! No way!

113
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:06,705
We're here, you
guys. That's it!

114
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:10,638
Aha! Indoor plumbing dead
ahead! I really have to pee!

115
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:12,871
Uh! Be careful where
you're walking!

116
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:14,505
They set boobie-traps?!

117
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:18,738
Even worse! A stray dog
totally pooped out front!

118
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,605
Ah!

119
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:23,571
Noooooot agaaaaaain!

120
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:29,438
Ow!

121
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:33,971
I did not touch it.
That is all that
matters.

122
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:37,638
If our team ever has to
fight in a dog-park,
we're done for.

123
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,638
Are you okay,
mister ninja?

124
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:45,505
It looks as if those
villains have really
cleaned this place out.

125
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:51,771
Not just that. They've
turned off the electricity,
gas, and water, too. So all
I can offer you is cold tea.

126
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,505
Hold on. Do houses in
our world have utilities
like that?

127
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:58,671
Fear not, lacking hostess!
I will just have a coffee!

128
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,805
You dummy! She can't
make anything!

129
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:04,705
I shall pass on the tea,
also. Unless it's green
tea, then yes.

130
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:06,471
Why does no one
listen to me?!

131
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:11,671
Hold on! Rock Lee can
heat up the kettle for
us with ninjutsu! He can
shoot fireballs at it

132
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:13,038
or something, right?!

133
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:15,471
Fireballs are not
going to happen.

134
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:19,805
Huh. I'm sorry. Your powers
are way too important to
waste on tea.

135
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,538
Trust me, that
is not it.

136
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:26,005
I cannot use ninjutsu
ever! Get it?

137
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,538
Huuuuuhhhh?!

138
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:34,338
Whaddya mean you can't
use ninjutsu?! You said
you were a ninja! You are
a ninja, right?!

139
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,805
Totally. I just do
not have ninja powers.

140
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:40,805
Then, what was that
special attack you used
to save me earlier?!

141
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:45,405
Yeah, about that. I was
just dodging the dog doo
but it all worked out, so
I rolled with it.

142
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,838
More like rolled in
it, you goofy klutz.

143
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,905
A ninja that can't
use ninjutsu...

144
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:51,905
I will explain if
you give me a second.

145
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:57,738
When you said you'd make
room on the plate for my
problem, I thought you were
a ninja, not just some guy!

146
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:02,071
Stop yelling and I think
you will remember how
impressive Depantsification
was in action.

147
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:05,238
Just give it up!

148
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:08,671
You're nothing but a
liar, Rock Lee. If that's
your real name!

149
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:13,871
Please, you have to believe
me! I never meant to mislead
you! And besides...

150
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:14,838
Huh?

151
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:20,371
I cannot help that I am
the man you fell in love
with.

152
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:21,371
Oww!

153
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,471
We're not in a soap
opera! This is anime!

154
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:29,005
C'mon! I still bring a
lot to the table! Just
not, ninjutsu!

155
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:31,505
Get outta here,
you big faker!

156
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,605
[sigh]

157
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,538
She is really mad, huh?

158
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:37,038
Well, nothing you can
do if she's made up
her mind.

159
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:38,671
Guess we'll have
to move on.

160
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,071
Stupid liar!

161
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:43,005
Hm?

162
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:44,538
Him again?!

163
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:46,538
I told you to get
outta here!

164
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:48,938
Hiya, twerp!
Didja miss us?

165
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:52,671
The coast is clear! No
weirdo with a bowl-cut
this time.

166
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,605
It's time for the
finale, you guys.

167
00:09:54,638 --> 00:10:00,505
You caused me a lotta
grief. It's okay, though.
Instead of paying me back,
I think I'll just take ya

168
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:02,971
with me! Bwhahaha!

169
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:04,571
[menacing laughter]

170
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,871
[scared whimper]

171
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,438
Oh no! This is it!

172
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:09,638
<i>I think not!</i>

173
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:10,671
Huh?

174
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:12,338
Him again?!

175
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:17,605
I was hoping you had
learned your lesson the
last time, but oh well! If
you do not want trouble...

176
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:18,805
Uh! Ugh! Ah!

177
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:20,838
...Leave that girl
alone already!

178
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,338
You got a lotta nerve,
trying to act like you're
a ninja!

179
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,538
Just hold on! Let
me explain myself!

180
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:30,105
Fake, huh? I thought there
was something fishy about
that pants attack!

181
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:33,971
If you can't even use
ninjutsu, we've got
nothing to worry about!

182
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:35,671
Ooh! This is gonna be fun!

183
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:37,738
Enough talk! Get 'em!

184
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,071
[evil laughter]

185
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,905
I do not need flashy
ninjutsu moves to win.
I have moves of my own!

186
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:43,805
Huh?!

187
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:45,571
Hah!

188
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:48,405
Leaf Crap Shoot!

189
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:53,605
Morning Coffee!

190
00:10:55,605 --> 00:10:56,838
Ahhhh!

191
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:59,005
Raining Nosebleed!

192
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:05,638
Not bad, kid! But you're
gonna need more than
teakettles to beat me!
Bwahaha!

193
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:06,571
[fighting grunt]

194
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:08,705
[attacking grunts]

195
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,871
He's too good for
you! Run away!

196
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,771
No I can take this guy!

197
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:17,538
Oh, did I hurt you,
ninja without ninjutsu!
Mwheheh!

198
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:23,938
There's no way you can
beat this guy. Any ninja
who can't use ninjutsu
is just an ordinary person!

199
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:24,871
You're wrong.

200
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:28,938
Rock Lee doesn't need the
bells and whistles of a
ninjutsu to be special.

201
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:30,905
That's right.

202
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:35,005
Lee's worked really hard
on his hand-to-hand fighting
skills, but even that's not
what makes him unique.

203
00:11:35,038 --> 00:11:37,471
He's one-of-a-kind
because of his willpower.

204
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:39,571
He never throws
in the towel.

205
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:41,705
Aghhhhh!

206
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:42,771
You idiot!

207
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:43,671
Hahhhh!

208
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:44,505
Hykahah!

209
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,071
Take this!

210
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,971
Did you just trip
yourself on purpose?

211
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:49,838
Hiyahhh!

212
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:52,571
[horrified scream]

213
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:55,871
Elimination by
Depantsification!

214
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:57,771
Ahhh! You little!

215
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:01,005
[panic gasps]

216
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:05,671
You win, little girl! No
amount of money is worth
this embarrassment! We're
never coming back here,

217
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:06,171
you guys!

218
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,305
Wait for us, boss!

219
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:10,005
[chuckling]

220
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:12,938
When it comes to using
ninjutsu, I stink.

221
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:17,838
However, I'm going to
be a great ninja someday,
with or without it!

222
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,738
I will never give up
until I reach that goal!

223
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:23,571
Now I know...

224
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:25,538
I was wrong!

225
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:27,738
I'm so sorry!

226
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:34,605
[dark barking]

227
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:35,871
[pushing grunt]

228
00:12:38,705 --> 00:12:39,405
Ahh!

229
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:43,438
C'moooon, agaaaiiinn?!

230
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:48,938
Ahhhh!

231
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,671
[embarrassed gasp]

232
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:03,971
Ahhhh!

233
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:05,871
Ahhhh!

234
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:08,005
Idiot...Idiot...

235
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:13,871
Rock Lee wants to become
a great ninja, but he can't
even use the power that
defines them. Get comfy.

236
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:16,571
I think this is gonna
take a while.

237
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:34,648
To become a great ninja,
even without ninjutsu.
That's Rock Lee's goal in
life, and he works towards

238
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,248
it tirelessly.

239
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:40,714
When you said you had a
new training method, I
thought it was something
useful.

240
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:43,981
Of course it is useful!
What if you have to
slither up a tree?

241
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:48,448
Thanks, but no thanks.
And in case you'd
forgotten, I can use
ninjutsu.

242
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:53,914
I bet I could pull off
Naruto's transformation or
Shadow Clone Jutsu if I
really put my mind to it.

243
00:13:55,314 --> 00:14:01,448
But! I want to do things
my way! I want to become a
great ninja without needing
ninjutsu, no matter how

244
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:02,614
long it takes me!

245
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:04,248
<i>Lee! Neji!</i>

246
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:07,348
We just got a new
mission, so get ready!

247
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:18,781
<i>Rock Lee's Rival</i>
<i>is Naruto.</i>

248
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:21,214
Wait. Baumkuchen?

249
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:25,481
Yep. Our client this
time around is a rich
old lady with a sweet
tooth.

250
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:31,548
She said the baumkuchen they
bake in the village is super-
popular, but they only make
fifty of them a day. Our

251
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,448
mission is to grab her one.

252
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:35,848
And how is this a
mission fit for a
ninja?

253
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:40,881
Hey! Every assignment is a
learning experience somehow.
We will give it our all!
Right, guys?!

254
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,348
Stop it! That is
totally weirding
me out!

255
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,348
Idiot...Idiot...

256
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:46,548
Whoa!

257
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,814
Look at this line!

258
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:53,848
We only make fifty baumkuchen
a day and fourty-nine of them
are spoken for! Somebody'd
better grab this voucher!

259
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:55,581
That's the final voucher!

260
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:56,781
Fly like the wind!

261
00:14:57,748 --> 00:14:58,848
Mister! I really need-

262
00:14:58,881 --> 00:14:59,814
Give it here!

263
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:02,014
Ahhhhh!

264
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:03,481
Bushy-brow!
It is Naruto!

265
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:09,681
This is Naruto Uzumaki,
in case you didn't know.
He's not always the sharpest
kunai in the pack, but he's

266
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:15,314
just as determined as
Lee to succeed! Above
all, he's a really strong
shinobi! And when he's not

267
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,881
guest-starring here in
chibi form, he's the lead
on his own show.

268
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:21,948
You are here for the
baumkuchen, too?

269
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:25,681
That's right, but not for
me. I'm just picking it
up as part of a mission.

270
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,548
Same as us, then.

271
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:34,048
I am sure Naruto needs
the last voucher and all.
I would step aside, but the
team's mission comes first!

272
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:37,581
Lee's a nice guy. I
would just let him
have it, but...

273
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:38,814
[fighting growls]

274
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:40,981
<i>This is a mission!</i>
<i>No mercy!</i>

275
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:42,981
So, the voucher?
Who wants it?

276
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:44,614
I do! Hand it over!

277
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:47,814
I am not trying to be
a jerk about it, but I
really need that
baumkuchen!

278
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,348
Not as much as I do!

279
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,348
I cannot back down
and neither can you!

280
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:54,681
Looks like we're gonna
have to settle this the
old-fashioned way!

281
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,048
[sighs]

282
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,014
Idiot...Idiot...

283
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,014
The rules are
simple enough!

284
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:04,814
Whoever grabs the
voucher first gets
to keep it!

285
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:06,714
That's it? Piece of cake!

286
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:09,814
Lee! You know he has
skills, right? This
won't be easy!

287
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:13,548
He's silly and forgetful
and clumsy and cheap and
perverted and greedy and
full of himself and an

288
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:15,414
all-around butthead and
dork, but he's a top-
notch ninja!

289
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:17,381
Why would you even
say all that junk?!

290
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:18,014
Now that's going
too far, Tenten!

291
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:20,648
I will give
it my all!

292
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:23,414
He is not someone you
can defeat without
proper training.

293
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,614
<i>Not what I meant,</i>
<i>but whatever...</i>

294
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:29,648
And his ninjutsu is at a
much higher level than an
ordinary ninja's would be!

295
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,514
<i>That was just a</i>
<i>lame magic trick!</i>

296
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:37,514
He has fought so many
villains. Here and a
long time ago, in a
galaxy far, far away!

297
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:40,981
Okay, that never happened.
Let's keep this in our
world, okay?!

298
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:43,014
Idiot...Idiot...

299
00:16:43,048 --> 00:16:46,648
On you mark...
Get set...
Gooo!

300
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:48,048
[charging growl]

301
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:49,581
That baumkuchen
is mine!

302
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:50,881
Keep dreaming!

303
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:53,681
Ahhhh!

304
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:56,314
Bad luck there! I
guess it was not
meant to be!

305
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,281
[angry growl]

306
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:58,681
Sexy jutsu!

307
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:05,614
For reasons that are
pretty obvious, Sexy
Jutsu is one of Naruto's
most effective moves.

308
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:06,581
Ahhh!

309
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:12,348
I had a hunch Naruto's
ninjutsu would give him
an advantage!

310
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:15,048
Whatever! He lost the
lead because he was
being a perv!

311
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:20,781
That is not the case,
Tenten! It was because
I am the type of man who
lives by his instincts!

312
00:17:20,814 --> 00:17:24,448
Spare me the lame excuses,
Lee! Stop twirling already

313
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:25,460
and get that voucher!

314
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:25,914
[painful grunt]

315
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:26,748
Ahhh!

316
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,781
Hey, Lee! Thanks
for the lead, sucker!

317
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:34,948
He is not the only one
who has got the Sexy
Jutsu up his sleeve.

318
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:38,414
Can he really imitate
any move, when he's only
seen it one time?

319
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:38,914
Hah!

320
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:41,881
You just changed
into a bikini!

321
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:44,448
This look will stop my
opponent dead in his
tracks!

322
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,648
You don't wear that
under your jumpsuit
all the time, do you?!

323
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:49,581
That's what
surprises you?!

324
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:50,648
[painful groan]

325
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:52,814
Not bad for your
first time out!

326
00:17:52,848 --> 00:17:54,948
Would you two stop
drooling all over
each other?!

327
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:58,614
Nah. The nosebleed's from
hitting my head on this
branch when I jumped.

328
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:01,614
Honestly, I think you're
actually dumber than Lee!

329
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,748
I disagree!

330
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,748
It is time to make
my comeback!

331
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:06,014
Oh no you don't!

332
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,514
That cake is mine!

333
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,348
Here's another classic
Naruto move, the Shadow
Clone Jutsu. But you
knew that!

334
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:15,248
He's really beside himself.

335
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:19,381
What's the point of copies?
Having a bunch of himself
running around won't help
him win the race.

336
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:23,648
So that is how it is!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

337
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:27,414
That's incredible! Did
Lee really just-

338
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:33,914
Running fast to give the
illusion of multiple clones
is not Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Cut it out already!

339
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,548
That is it! I
will combine them!

340
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:38,781
Harem Jutsu!

341
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:40,548
Ahhhhh!

342
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:42,181
Ugh! The humanity!

343
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:47,681
Huh?! Neji fainting
doesn't give us any
cake! I'm tired being
the voice of reason!

344
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:51,614
Rasengan!

345
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:53,781
I won't let you win!

346
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:58,014
Too slow, two-piece!

347
00:18:58,448 --> 00:18:58,914
[shocked gasp]

348
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:00,614
Nooooo!

349
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:07,348
That's all she wrote. I
got to the voucher first,
Bushy Brow! Better luck
next time!

350
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:12,681
I knew Naruto was good,
but even so, I guess I
have no choice but to
give up!

351
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:13,681
Huh?

352
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:19,349
No. I cannot quit.
If I quit now...

353
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:21,681
[baby crying]

354
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:23,581
Aww, please do
not cry.

355
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:25,514
Do I have to be
in this skit?

356
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:27,648
It is okay, Nejiko.
Be strong.

357
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:30,481
But this problem
is so hard, Mama.

358
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:34,614
That is no reason not
to try. Keep working,
you will figure it out.

359
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:35,848
Okay...

360
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:41,981
She is the best daughter a
mom could want, but she's
so quick to give up whenever
the going gets tough...

361
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,948
i wonder... where does
she get it from?

362
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:51,281
The other day, Sakura, this
girl who sits next to me
at school, was telling me
all about a cake she had

363
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:52,648
called a baumkuchen.

364
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:54,514
Oh? Is that so?

365
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:58,948
All the girls in class
were raving about it.
Ino's going to buy one
after school tomorrow!

366
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,014
Really...

367
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:05,581
Not that I want one or
anything. They cost too
much, and you already
work so hard for us, Mama.

368
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:11,781
Nenkinya baumkuchen.
Fifty made a day, 5,000
yen each.

369
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:14,414
Fancy store, charging
an arm and a leg.

370
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,714
We cannot afford it.

371
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:23,281
I am sorry, darling. I
had hoped we would never
have to spend this money.
She already goes without

372
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:24,481
so much.

373
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:26,490
I want her to have this.

374
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:31,581
Why are you making me a
baby in this dumb skit?!

375
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:33,948
This is no skit. It
is real life, Tenten.

376
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:38,448
How can you say that,
Lee?! You're not our mom,
I'm not a baby, and Neji's
not a girl!

377
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:42,981
Tenten, don't you get it?
I just wanted Naruto to
see how desperately we
needed the voucher. Go

378
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:44,981
for the heartstrings.
That was the plan!

379
00:20:45,014 --> 00:20:48,648
No way is this silly soap
opera gonna change his
mind! I mean-

380
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:52,581
[sobbing]

381
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:54,514
He's crying his eyes out!

382
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:59,414
Bushy-Brow! I didn't see
how badly you needed that
baumkuchen before, but
thanks to your skit, now

383
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:00,248
I know!

384
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:04,681
Go on! Take the baumkuchen
voucher. No hard feelings.

385
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:07,314
That was all fake. You
do know that, don't you?

386
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:11,514
And, you know I used
ninjutsu, so I guess
that you won.

387
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:14,781
Naruto, I...

388
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,014
Well, see ya!

389
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:19,714
You know...

390
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:22,648
...that Naruto is a
real stand-up guy!

391
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,714
Well you got the
voucher, so at least
there's that.

392
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:29,814
Maybe I won the
baumkuchen, but as a
ninja and a gentleman...

393
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:31,981
...Naruto won,
hands down.

394
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:35,848
But the next time we
square off, I shall be
the victor!

395
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:41,514
Rock Lee wants to become a
great ninja, but he can't
even use the power that
defines them. Not only

396
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:44,848
that, but now he wants
to surpass Naruto, too!

397
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:46,381
Idiot...Idiot...

398
00:21:46,414 --> 00:21:47,648
Ahhhh!

399
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,714
Sorry, we're out!

400
00:21:48,748 --> 00:21:52,514
I called fifty a bunch
of times, but nobody
came up!

401
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,548
No baumkuchen!

402
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:55,581
We failed...

403
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,981
<i>What do you mean "we"?!</i>

404
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:58,481
[sigh]

405
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:04,914
Surpassing Naruto without
ninjutsu, huh? His path
will be an interesting one,
that much is certain.

406
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,314
Idiot...Idiot...

407
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:48,843
Today was a disaster!

408
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:52,610
<i>What do you mean? I</i>
<i>thought it was our</i>
<i>best episode yet! Sure,</i>
<i>it has been our only</i>

409
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:54,210
<i>one so far, but still!</i>

410
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:57,043
Best of one doesn't
count! What's wrong
with you?!

411
00:23:57,077 --> 00:24:03,410
<i>Not to interrupt but,</i>
<i>next episodes titles are,</i>
<i>"Love is a Part of the</i>
<i>Springtime of Youth," and</i>

412
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,810
<i>"Love Makes Both</i>
<i>Sides Crazy."</i>

413
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:13,677
<i>Love, huh? I take that</i>
<i>stuff very seriously!</i>
<i>Just you wait!</i>
<i>Sakura, my darling!</i>

414
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,177
This is gonna be
a mess.

415
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,143
See you next time!
