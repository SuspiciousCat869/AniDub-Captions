1
00:01:55,794 --> 00:02:02,227
Well, look here! The Leaf
is being paid a visit by the
Sand Village's Kazekage, Gaara!

2
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:05,994
Hmm...Something about
him seems off, though.

3
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:12,294
Have you folks out there
been paying attention? Do
you see what's different?

4
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:14,361
He does not seem
like himself.

5
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:16,327
You're right. He
hasn't said a word.

6
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:17,727
Hm?

7
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,627
Wait, look at that
character on his
forehead!

8
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:22,627
It's not the word 'love'!

9
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,761
It is more like the
word 'romance'!

10
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,361
<i>"Gaara's First Date"</i>

11
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:38,394
What's gotten into Gaara?

12
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:42,327
Is he changing his
look? Or maybe could
it be-?

13
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:45,494
There is no maybe
about it! It could
not be more obvious!

14
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:49,127
Our friend, Gaara, has
got a crush on someone!

15
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:51,527
If so, who could it be?

16
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:55,727
Well, he traveled here,
so I presume it's someone
from our village, right?

17
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:57,527
I wonder if it
is Sakura...

18
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:02,727
If that is so, he has
become my rival in love.
And when you add Naruto
into the equation...

19
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,727
...we have one messy
love rectangle!

20
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:11,361
I just thought of something!
What if the powers behind this
series, have decided that a hot-
blooded ninja gag anime show,

21
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:17,094
cannot remain popular as it
is, and are now trying to
change the series into a
trendy love story?!

22
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:20,394
<i>'In the Name of Love- Tokyo</i>
<i>Lovin' 101, A Summer Love's</i>
<i>Tale.'</i>

23
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:23,461
<i>Episode 1, A Meeting</i>
<i>and a Reunion.</i>

24
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,661
[laughing]

25
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:37,027
I am lost! I never watch
romantic dramas, and as a
result, I have no idea of

26
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,227
what to say in a
situation like this!

27
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,494
And for once in this
series, could I just
play a man?!

28
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:44,994
Idiot! Idiot!

29
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:49,594
These people are late.
What could be taking
them so long?

30
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:55,794
<i>Ah, it's Orochimaru in</i>
<i>one of his disguises</i>
<i>again. Why are you</i>
<i>dressed like Gaara?</i>

31
00:03:55,827 --> 00:04:02,127
Isn't it obvious! Rock
Lee and his little pals are
forced to tread carefully
around the Kazekage.

32
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:06,094
The moment they leave
themselves open, I'll
be able to rip them to
pieces!

33
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:10,394
I get it now. And since
Gaara is naturally quiet,
there's nothing suspicious

34
00:04:10,427 --> 00:04:12,427
about you not
talking very much.

35
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:16,494
They've been gone a
long time, though. What
in the world could they
be up to?

36
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:20,161
Hm! I wonder if they
saw through my disguise?

37
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:23,261
I do not understand. If
it is not Sakura, then
who?

38
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:25,027
Believe it or not,
it could be Tenten.

39
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:29,427
Are you serious? You
really think it's me?
I don't understand, this
is all so sudden!

40
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:31,061
Maybe it is Hinata.

41
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:31,761
Agh!

42
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:36,427
That will only happen
over my dead body!

43
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:37,161
[gasp]

44
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,527
Hey, maybe it's
Lady Tsunade!

45
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,294
I don't know. That's
a pretty big age gap
there.

46
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:44,261
Agh! Wait, I
have got it!

47
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:48,061
I bet Gaara fell in
love when he visited
the other time!

48
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,227
What other time?

49
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:52,161
Do you remember the
summer barbecue from
a few weeks ago?

50
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:54,061
<i>The one Guy Sensei</i>
<i>put on?</i>

51
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,394
The way I figure it,
Gaara must have thought
Neji in drag was an actual

52
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:59,661
girl, and he fell head
over heels in love!

53
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:01,494
That is ridiculous!

54
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:04,194
What makes you think
that's possible?! Why
would he have fallen

55
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:06,494
for a guy in drag, over
a real girl, like me?!

56
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:11,427
I have no answer for
that. But this is the
Kazekage. We could cause
a diplomatic crisis with

57
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:12,727
the Hidden Sand Village.

58
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,994
<i>We need to move</i>
<i>carefully, and send</i>
<i>Neji in.</i>

59
00:05:15,394 --> 00:05:16,427
Say what?

60
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:23,327
Go ahead, Neji,
talk to him!

61
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:26,094
Um, Lord Gaara. It's
nice to meet you.

62
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:29,761
Uh, I'm aware that we
don't really know each
other very well...

63
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:32,561
So maybe we could just
start off being friends.

64
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:34,427
Eghh...

65
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:39,061
That said, I thought it
would be better if we
started off with some
group dates.

66
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:42,394
<i>Is that why we're</i>
<i>tagging along?</i>

67
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:46,327
I guarantee you, someone
like Gaara has never been
on a date before in his
life!

68
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:50,294
And there is much less
pressure when that first
date is a double-date
with friends.

69
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:55,627
Why are we having Neji
go on this date? We should
have just had him refuse
it and tell the truth!

70
00:05:55,661 --> 00:06:01,227
No, Tenten. A man's heart
is a fragile instrument.
A flat-out rejection could
have serious consequences.

71
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:01,994
It could crush him!

72
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:04,061
Are you sure this
plan will work?

73
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,527
[chuckling]

74
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:07,527
Do you know why I
picked this park for
their date in the
first place?

75
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:13,461
The lake is supposed to
be jinxed. It may be the
curse of the lake's spirit,
or a jealous goddess who is

76
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:18,294
green with envy, but any
couple who rides a boat
across this water is
guaranteed to break up.

77
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,661
<i>You're pinning</i>
<i>everything on this</i>
<i>curse being effective?</i>

78
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,227
Oh yes!

79
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,694
How did everything
get off track?

80
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:27,527
[gasp]

81
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:34,027
I knew it! He's got
the wrong character
on his forehead!

82
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,627
<i>You just noticed that?</i>

83
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:39,494
Well guys, that is
it for step one!

84
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,027
The next part of the
plan. A takoyaki snack!

85
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:46,194
Takoyaki? For...
what reason?!

86
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:51,461
Thought you would never
ask. So you get lots of
seaweed stuck in your teeth,
and look really disgusting.

87
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,861
Why do I want that?!

88
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:56,761
To make yourself
unattractive, so that
Gaara will initiate
a breakup!

89
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:59,394
I tell you, this is
guaranteed to work!

90
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,527
That's it? Come on, Lee!
Try something else!

91
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:10,261
Come on, stop resisting!
This is guaranteed to work!
A little more on your teeth,
and some up your nose! Yeah!

92
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:12,361
Hang in there...Neji.

93
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,761
How do I get myself
into these things?

94
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:17,994
Well, this is awkward.

95
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:22,727
It is working great! Now,
to seal the deal, you need
to rip a huge fart!

96
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:24,627
On command?!

97
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,261
If you cannot
handle it...

98
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:28,361
Then I will
cover for you!

99
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:33,461
Neji, you really should
be ashamed of yourself!
Very unladylike!

100
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,794
Why? Why is it
always me?

101
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:39,061
I don't know which
is worse, the smell,
or the acting.

102
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:44,327
I wish I knew the right
way to react. I didn't
think very far ahead when
I put on this getup, and

103
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:49,394
bottom line is, I don't
have a very good grasp
of the character. How
would this guy react to

104
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,694
getting gassed
on a date?

105
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:52,127
Lord Orochimaru...

106
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,961
Kabuto?

107
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:57,161
You put the wrong
character on your
forehead and apparently,
they've misinterpreting it.

108
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:58,761
It's wrong?

109
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:00,027
Time to go, Gaara!

110
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,661
Just give me a
moment...

111
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:05,727
I don't understand how
this could happen! What
character was supposed
to be there?!

112
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:07,127
Uhh...

113
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:08,961
It says 'odd'.

114
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:11,127
You mean it doesn't
say 'romance' anymore?

115
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:12,794
Well then, you
should have...

116
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,694
Do not fight, this will
only take a second!

117
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:17,961
<i>Odd...Ball.</i>

118
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:19,794
This is so humiliating.

119
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:22,694
Lord Orochimaru! That
thing is still wrong!

120
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:24,394
You're absolutely
sure about that?

121
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:27,694
If it's not 'romance'
or 'odd', I can't
remember what it is.

122
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:34,094
You forgot?! This is no
time for a memory lapse!
You're way off! Think
back, it will come to you!

123
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,394
Not skimming the surface,
but something deeper!

124
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:38,994
Deeper? You mean
like underwater?

125
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:43,061
I don't mean you're
some kind of fish!
Next think, you'll be
thinking you're the

126
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:45,127
main course at a
sushi joint!

127
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,661
By the way, it's
read as 'tuna'.

128
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,494
Oh, does that mean
he's craving tuna?

129
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:54,627
We should all go get
sushi once this is over.
You started this, so it's
your treat, Gaara!

130
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:55,327
Yes!

131
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:57,294
Kabuto, I need
some help!

132
00:08:57,327 --> 00:09:02,027
Come on, please don't
make me say it. But the
clue is, it's that feeling,
that makes your heart pound.

133
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:04,994
A feeling of desire
that makes your heart
pound...

134
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:06,961
Lust?

135
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,261
It says 'lust' now?

136
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:10,394
Are you saying it is
like the 'Sexy Jutsu'?

137
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:13,827
Really? Oh my
goodness! And this
is just the first
date!

138
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:16,227
Come on! You can't
be serious?!

139
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,761
Neji, you know there
is no turning back.

140
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,661
No! Please, no!

141
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,827
Noooo!

142

00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:37,827
It's- It's not lust.
It's something more
important, more dear
to the heart!

147
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,894
Something important?
Could it be a grandchild?

148
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:46,127
How could it be grandkids?
You haven't even brought
up the subject of marriage!

149
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:47,294
So I'm wrong again?

150
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:51,894
It's a much sweeter
guess, but in spite
of that, it's still
the wrong character.

151
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:53,861
Here we go!
How about this!

152
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,927
<i>Ohh! How cute!</i>

153
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,194
How about this one?

154
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,327
Uh-huh!

155
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:00,627
Tell you what. How
about you hold him
for a while?

156
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:01,194
Huh?

157
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:02,927
[arguing]

158
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,661
I am in hell.

159
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,327
<i>Don't try this</i>
<i>at home, kids!</i>

160
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:10,727
Now that I think about
it, maybe this means
the plan is actually
working at some level.

161
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:15,294
Those idiot will do whatever
Lord Orochimaru forehead
says! Now's our chance!

162
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:22,794
Indeed! I'll use my forehead
to control Lee and his pals
like puppets on a string!
My first goal is to rip Lee

163
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:28,261
into shreds. Then I'll
pound Naruto to a pulp,
and maybe turn that Sakura
girl into my servant.

164
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:33,827
After that, I'll shave the
heads on Mount Hokage,
conquer the Hidden Leaf,
and turn it into the Hidden

165
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:37,094
Snake! Oh yes, the
sky's the limit!

166
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:40,194
[laughing]

167
00:10:41,294 --> 00:10:45,294
Now how do I express
all that in a single
character?

168
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:53,727
There's no way to do
it! It's completely
impossible!

169
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:57,127
Lord Orochimaru, I
believe I have an idea.

170
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:57,861
Huh?

171
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,727
Do you not love
our grandkids?

172
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,794
Oh, I sure do, gramps!

173
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,194
No more grandkids!

174
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,127
Huh?

175
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:07,027
This, my friends, is
my true heart's desire.

176
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:07,827
<i>What?!</i>

177
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,694
Hey! It changed! It
is some kind of
encoded text!

178
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:14,894
We absolutely have
to decipher it. Neji!

179
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:15,827
Got it!

180
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:17,227
Byakugan!

181
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:26,261
My first goal is to rip
Lee into shreds. Then I'll
pound Naruto to a pulp, and
maybe turn that Sakura girl

182
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:30,294
into my servant. After
that, I'll shave the
heads on Mount Hokage,
conquer the Hidden Leaf,

183
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:32,294
and turn it into
the Hidden Snake!

184
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,727
Uhh...

185
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:40,127
You're Orochimaru,
aren't you?

186
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:42,194
Zoinks! I've been
foiled again!

187
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:43,661
Ahhh!

188
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,294
That was close!

189
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:55,427
<i>In the end, that symbol</i>
<i>on his head just spelled</i>
<i>'defeat'.</i>

190
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:08,315
Our next story begins
with a wrapped present.

191
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,615
[alarm ringing]

192
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,848
It is another
beautiful morning!

193
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:15,282
Huh?

194
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:20,482
Wha- What is this?!

195
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,415
To Lee. From
Sakura Haruno!

196
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:25,315
[gasp]

197
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:30,048
Sakura dropped off a
present for me? This
is amazing! I cannot
believe it!

198
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,515
Lee doesn't realize it
yet, but this incident
is about to mark the

199
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:36,082
beginning of a
terrible catastrophe.

200
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:46,382
"A Gift from Orochimaru."

201
00:12:46,748 --> 00:12:48,715
This is amazing!

202
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:53,382
It is the latest model
training gauge!

203
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:57,848
It is an incredible piece
of technology! You just
wear it while you train,
and afterwards...

204
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,782
...it notes how you
have improved!

205
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:02,882
I am constantly
impressed by
Sakura's mind!

206
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,748
I have an idea!
Let's train together!

207
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:07,815
I am all for it, Sakura!

208
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:09,448
[laughing]

209
00:13:09,482 --> 00:13:12,582
I am so impressed with
your dedication! We should
do this more often!

210
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:15,582
Ahhhh!

211
00:13:15,615 --> 00:13:17,582
[fighting grunts]

212
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:22,515
You are good, Sakura,
but I will not lose.
Keep an eye on me, I
am unstoppable!

213
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:24,982
Hey, Bushy-Brow!
Training hard again
today?

214
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:29,848
Yes I am, and it is all
because of Sakura! Thank
you, I am putting your
gift to good use!

215
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:31,715
What gift are you
talking about?

216
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:36,415
She's never given me
any presents! I can't
believe it! There's no way
you would get one first!

217
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,048
But, if she did not give
it to me, who did?

218
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:40,515
<i>[chuckling]</i>

219
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,515
You can thank me
for that gift!

220
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,348
Orochimaru?
You again?!

221
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:49,048
If I were you, I'd keep
on exercising. It would
be bad for your health
if you were to stop now.

222
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:51,348
Wha- What are you
talking about?

223
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:54,848
That gauge will explode
if you stop moving for
any length of time!

224
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:56,848
It's rigged to blow?!

225
00:13:56,882 --> 00:14:01,115
You sealed your fate
when you began working
out earlier, Lee. It is
programmed to explode the

226
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:05,748
moment you stop your
activities. If you try
to take it off, pieces
of you will be scattered

227
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:09,748
to the four winds. In
other words, you have
to keep training until
you die!

228
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,515
What?! Are you serious?!

229
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:15,082
You love training so
much, it's only natural
you die doing it!

230
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,782
[laughing]

231
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:19,382
I don't believe this!

232
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:21,848
Don't stop, Lee! We'll
both try to figure
something out!

233
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:23,848
We better go get
some help!

234
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:24,615
<i>Right!</i>

235
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,048
You're saying he
planted a bomb
on Lee?

236
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:31,315
Neji, what's with
those sunglasses?

237
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:34,148
These? Oh, right,
they're a present
from Tenten.

238
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:34,982
<i>What?</i>

239
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:38,415
Sorry Neji, but I didn't
get you any presents.

240
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:40,248
What's going on
with that hat?

241
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:43,182
This? You're the one
who got it for me,
don't you remember?

242
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,982
That's silly! Why
would I get you
something like that!

243
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,448
Then where did
it come from?

244
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:48,548
Once again...

245
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:49,348
[chuckling]

246
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:50,582
It came from me!

247
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:52,148
Him again?

248
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:56,115
That hat's really a
bomb, rigged with
chakra designed to
respond to reactions!

249
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,415
Hold on, how is
that even possible?!

250
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:03,548
If you happen to react
to any jokes, it will
trigger the explosive tag
inside. And of course, if

251
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:07,115
you try to take it
off, it will blow as
well. So have a nice
day!

252
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:08,948
What kind of
chakra does that?!

253
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:09,882
An uneducated-

254
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:12,015
If you say a punchline,
you'll blow up!

255
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:13,982
Horrible! He
booby-trapped her!

256
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:16,948
Now that you know, you
have to be careful what
you say.

257
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:17,748
Oh, for cryin'-

258
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,182
These sunglasses
are also rigged?!

259
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:22,548
It's a simple bomb,
loaded with chakra
that reacts to cross-
dressing.

260
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:24,182
What?! Cross-
dressing chakra?!

261
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,115
Chakra can do just
about anything.

262
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:31,182
Try to take them off, or
slip into a dress, and the
paper bombs will ignite.
Then it's 'bye-bye, baby'!

263
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:32,615
He can't even put
on a dress?!

264
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:36,148
Don't worry about it!
That's the least of my
concerns, believe me!

265
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:41,915
We'll see how long you can
hold out, my friend! I can't
wait to discover which one
of you blows up first!

266
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:44,348
[laughing]

267
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:47,548
Idiot! Idiot!

268
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:52,415
That monster! How dare
he keep Neji from cross-
dressing, or Tenten from
over-reacting!

269
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:53,982
What do we do now?!

270
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:57,882
I'm not so worried about
them. Your body giving out
is the most pressing concern!

271
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:02,448
Do not worry about me,
Sakura! I am in such good
shape, I can train for
a week straight!

272
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:05,582
[grunting]

273
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:09,882
Forget it! Even if
you can handle it,
just watching you is
exhausting us!

274
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:14,415
There's only one way to
handle this. We'll have to
keep Lee out of the main
shot as much as possible.

275
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:15,582
Mr. Cameraman?

276
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:17,382
[grunting]

277
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:19,982
Next, I will do ten-
thousand pull-ups!

278
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:23,148
This may be our only
chance. Let's find a
way to defuse that bomb.

279
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:28,215
Good idea, but how can
we possibly pull that
off with Lee flying
all over the place?

280
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:33,515
Orochimaru said the bomb
will blow if he stops
training. But there are
different ways to train.

281
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:38,282
That's true. He doesn't
necessarily have to wear
himself out by going through
his entire-

282
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:39,348
Ughh!

283
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:40,615
Can you keep it down?!

284
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:43,148
Sorry. I will train
more quietly.

285
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:47,915
Come to think of it,
there are ways to train
while standing still.
Like flower arranging.

286
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:51,615
That's perfect! Flower
arrangement will conserve
Lee's strength and stamina!

287
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:54,348
And also give us a
chance to defuse the
device!

288
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,948
This is not working!

289
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:12,148
[grunting]

290
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:15,582
Darn it! That wasn't
active enough! What if
he pops this bubble wrap?

291
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:17,082
What's that good for?

292
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:29,082
My head will pop next!

293
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,215
[grunting]

294
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:32,448
Hey, what about this?!

295
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:33,615
What is that?

296
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:36,115
He can lick this
jawbreaker until
it's completely gone!

297
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:37,282
You think that
will be enough?

298
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:39,015
How bad can
it be? Try it!

299
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:51,482
[groaning]

300
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:52,915
Sweet plan goes sour!

301
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:55,515
I won't! Ugh!
I- Argh!

302
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:57,082
She's really upset.

303
00:17:57,115 --> 00:17:59,615
I bet she wanted to
deliver that reaction
herself.

304
00:18:00,282 --> 00:18:03,215
No. That's not really
what's bothering me.

305
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,982
I just thought Neji's
delivery was a little,
how can I say this...
Weak.

306
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:08,982
[groaning]

307
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:11,482
You think I'm not a
very good straight man?

308
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:15,448
Well, it seems to me
the delivery could have
used a little more punch.

309
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:17,615
And you're usually
better at setting
up the jokes.

310
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:20,948
So I'm just the set-
up man? Why am I
constrained to this
fate?!

311
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,615
Uhh, Neji, I think
you're over-reacting.

312
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:25,048
[growling]

313
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:28,615
I have a suggestion.
Why don't I handle the
reactions, in Tenten's
place?

314
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:30,548
Mr. Narrator?

315
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:34,148
Don't worry. I may not
sound like it, but I was
part of a stand-up comedy

316
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:36,582
team once. Reactions
were my specialty!

317
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,448
Is that right? Really,
I never would have
guessed.

318
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:44,382
Oh yes. It was about
twenty years ago, give
or take a decade. We
performed under the name

319
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:49,882
'Caltrop &amp; Trip' and at
the time, we were the
best in the world at what
we did. We packed them in!

320
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:51,882
[laughter]

321
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:57,182
But fame, as we discovered
to our horror, is fleeting.
Eventually, tastes changed,
and our brand of humor

322
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:02,915
wasn't popular anymore.
As time went on, we found
we couldn't get any work.
So after a few years, we

323
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:05,115
decided to go our
separate ways.

324
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:12,382
My set-up man went on as
a solo act. I tried opening
up a Korean barbecue, but it
didn't work out. Then I tried

325
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:17,382
running a bed and breakfast
in Okinawa, and when that
failed, I took this job
as a narrator and now-

326
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:19,615
Hold it! We don't
care about your
failed past!

327
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:21,315
Control yourself,
Tenten!

328
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:25,215
Your bomb's
beeping!

329
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:25,848
[screaming]

330
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:27,248
I need to do
more push-ups!

331
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:28,448
[grunting]

332
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:31,182
Alright, wise-guy!
Was any of that
stuff even true?!

333
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:35,015
Oh, I'd say thirty
percent. Sorry, I got
carried away and started
making stuff up.

334
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,082
We need to defuse Bushy-
Brow's bomb, and fast.

335
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:39,882
The question
is, 'how'?

336
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:43,882
You can do it! I have
confidence in you! It
is just like that movie
we all watched the other

337
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:48,382
day, 'Charleston's Angels',
Where the three beautiful
spies defused a bomb in
Area 51...

338
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,382
...and saved the world
from destruction!

339
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:52,582
I can do it like
they did in the movie!

340
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:59,615
I have to disarm this,
but what do I pull? The
red explosive tag, or
the blue one?

341
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,282
Don't pull anything
until I can cross-
dress again!

342
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:07,548
Alright, then what about
that other show we were
watching, on late-night TV,
where the supermodel idols

343
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:11,015
dress up like pirates and
discover a bomb in the
bathroom of the space
station?

344
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:13,115
<i>Oh yes, I remember</i>
<i>that one now!</i>

345
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,382
I have to disarm this,
but what do I pull?
The red explosive tag,

346
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:20,448
or the blue one?

347
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:22,182
<i>What did I just say?!</i>

348
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:25,015
I'm not able to cross-
dress, or I'll blow up!

349
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,015
So what are we
gonna do?

350
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:28,448
I don't know.
We're screwed!

351
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:30,915
[growling]

352
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:35,115
I don't know. This is
just a thought. Maybe
you could defuse the bomb
without cross-dressing.

353
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:36,582
S'cuse me?

354
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:39,915
Or here's another idea.
Wouldn't it be faster to
just use your Byakugan to

355
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,382
figure out how to
dismantle the bomb?

356
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,148
Where do you
get this stuff?

357
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:45,148
That sounds good
to me, Neji!

358
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:46,848
Byakugan!

359
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:50,415
[grunting]

360
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,482
These sunglasses
are just too dark!

361
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:56,948
There's no point in
clear sight if you
blow up!

362
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:59,048
Cut it out, Tenten!
No reactions!

363
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:00,215
They're gonna blow!

364
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:01,482
[screaming]

365
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:05,215
[arguing]

366
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:11,848
I gotcha, Lee! You and
your pals are about to
be blown to smithereens!
Right... Now! Ha Ha Ha...

367
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:13,982
Why aren't you
exploding?

368
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,815
<i>Lord Orochimaru!</i>

369
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:21,248
I was finally able to get
a whole box-full of paper
bombs! Now we can finish

370
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:23,015
off those booby-traps
you set!

371
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,148
Wait a minute, are
you telling me...

372
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:28,615
The explosives were
never inside the gifts
in the first place?

373
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:33,282
[growling]

374
00:21:33,315 --> 00:21:34,915
[growling]

375
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:37,215
Yes, that's right.
Why do you ask?

376
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:38,482
Well, uh, because...

377
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:44,382
[growling]

378
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,548
[scared groans]

379
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:51,948
[screaming]

380
00:21:51,982 --> 00:21:55,648
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

381
00:21:55,682 --> 00:22:01,315
Talk about just desserts!
Our heroes have rigged these
two with a bomb that will
explode the moment either

382
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:06,482
of them comes up with
a stupid plan! I'd say
their chances are about
fifty-fifty!

383
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:52,164
<i>On the next episode,</i>
<i>'The Green Flame, Dodge</i>
<i>Lee, and 'The Yes-Man</i>
<i>Says No!'</i>

384
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:55,664
Apparently, we are all
in competition playing
games with each other.

385
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:59,797
<i>I'll just make a bunch</i>
<i>of clones, and beat</i>
<i>everyone with superior</i>
<i>numbers!</i>

386
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,297
You can try, but Neji
will knock them all
away with his Air Palm!

387
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,230
<i>Not if I use the</i>
<i>Rasengan, as well!</i>

388
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:10,697
If you do that, Tenten will
summon a bunch of weapons,
knock them all away, and
claim the win for us!

389
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,530
<i>At that point it</i>
<i>becomes a ball game,</i>
<i>not a ninjutsu battle!</i>
