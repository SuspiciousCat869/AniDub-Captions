<i>Today's Rock Lee is starting!</i>
<i>But this episode has a bit of</i>
<i>a different flavor...</i>

2
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:59,957
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>So buckle up, because</i>
<i>today's show is tying</i>
<i>in with that hit new movie-</i>

3
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:04,291
This is bad! I
totally forgot
to buy this week's
issue of Jump!

4
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,457
I hope they
still have some!

5
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:09,824
[gasp]

6
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:16,424
Yes! There is
one left..!

7
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:19,924
Oh! Tenten!

8
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:21,557
Lee, you too?

9
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:25,824
It's a good thing it
was you I ran into!

10
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:29,224
Anyone else, and it
would've been a
serious tug-of-war.

11
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:34,291
Agreed! Talk about good
luck-- Now we'll both be
able to read it! Here,
let me take a loo--

12
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:34,891
[smack]

13
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:36,624
What was that for?

14
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,291
My question exactly!
Ladies first, Lee.

15
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,924
You'll have to
wait until I'm
done with it!

16
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:44,624
What the--!? You are
the one who is always
saying that gender
shouldn't matter!

17
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:46,624
You're gonna read
it on the toilet..!

18
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:49,324
So what!? You're
gonna read it in
the bath!

19
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:51,291
Better than
stinking it up!

20
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,757
I am not reading a
water damaged comic!

21
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,757
oh would you let
go!? This issue
has info on the
movie!!

22
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,324
I know! That is
exactly why--

23
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:02,691
I want the latest
details now!!

24
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:05,924
Ahhh!

25
00:03:13,357 --> 00:03:14,624

[groan]

28

What just happened?
It felt like the
world turned inside
out...

29
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:38,724
Do not panic, Tenten!
Believe me, this has
happened before!

30
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:44,091
[panting]

31
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,157
Let us just stay calm
and find some water!

32
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:50,357
No no no,
you just had
heat stroke.

33
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:52,424
Hey, what are
you two doing
here?

34
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:56,157
Shino? Boy, good
timing. Something
really weird just
happen--

35
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,791
Not as weird as
your outfit!!!

36
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:02,057
What do you mean
by that? I'm just
being FABULOUS as
usual.

37
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,857
I may be a ninja
but I don't blend
into the background!

38
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,291
That's the kinda
man I am!

39
00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:10,291
I am green with
envy! You are out-
pizazzing the star
of the show!

40
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:14,491
Lee, you and Naruto
are all the pizazz
this show can handle.

41
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:17,524
So like, did Shino
get a concussion or
something..?

42
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,257
Don't...stare...

43
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,057
Something wrong..?

44
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:22,491
You're not usually
so shy, Kiba...

45
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:23,757
Huh!?

46
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,791
For goodness sake,
I'll answer for you!

47
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:28,324
But don't think I'm
doing it to be nice
though, you guys!

48
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:31,791
I can't depend on
anyone else here, so I
don't have a choice!

49
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:33,391
Hinata is snapping
a people!?

50
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:36,124
That's impossible!
What's wrong with
everyone!?

53
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,724
Shikamaru! Oh thank
goodness you're-- Huh!?

54
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:51,924
Oh jeez, how am I
s'posed to be the
straight man...anymore.

55
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:54,824
What a day!

56
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:57,091
I mean, did I
clean up in
there or what!?

57
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:00,357
Yay! We're off to
make the world a
better place!

58
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:02,757
We're off to fight
evil, doncha know!

59
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,491
What's next? The
whole world's gone
topsy turvy...

60
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:10,057
I know what to
do! At times like
this, there's only
one way out!!

61
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:10,757
Huh?

62
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,724
Alrighty then.
Night-night.

63
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:16,924
We're not in a
dream Leeeeee!!

64
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:19,224
Indeed.

65
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:22,057
Be serious! This is
not a normal crisis!

66
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:25,957
If we don't find
out what happened
we could be stuck
here forever!!

67
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,757
Right! Let's
move out then!

68
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,524
Where to?

69
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:30,957
To find Neji!

70
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:34,024
(Lee)
We will need help if
we are going to figure
out what happened!

71
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:35,857
Yeah, but...

72
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:40,724
It is okay! No matter
how much the world's
changed, our friendship
is unshakable!

73
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:44,224
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Not a chance</i>
<i>in hell!!</i>

74
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:45,391

Huh!?!?!?

75
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:48,257
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>The Dark Emperor</i>
<i>appears!</i>

76

Me and my friends
from a previous life
must face him in
battle!

77
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:55,191
I can't abandon this
fight-- the fate of
the world hands in
the balance!

78
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,757
Our...friendship...

79
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,791
I can't believe
Neji's angsty
teen gamer...

80
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:02,891
This is a dead end!
We'll have to look
for clues on our own!

81
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,857
(Hizashi Hyuga)
Neji, I'm leaving
your dinner out here!

82
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:12,791
[gasp]

83
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,391
Hold on a minute!
I am just realizing
something...

84
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:17,957
What are you
talking about?

85
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,124
I knew it!
Neji's ramen!

86
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:22,157
<i>It is exactly</i>
<i>the same!</i>

87
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:24,391
What?

88
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:28,757
And the bizarre situation we've
found ourselves in, it's all
just like the promotional
material for the movie!

89
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,791
So you're saying...

90
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,424
I do not know
how or why...
but in that
instant...

91
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:39,224
...our wish to know
what the movie would
be like was granted
by this issue of Jump!

92
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:43,857
<i>Maybe we've been</i>
<i>transported into</i>
<i>the world of the</i>
<i>movie!</i>

93
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,191
You really think
it's...possible?

94
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:49,924
You ready, Tenten!?

95
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:51,357
Let's do this, Lee!

96
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,257
[grunts]

97
00:06:57,391 --> 00:06:58,857
How come it
didn't work?

98
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:00,524
Everything was
exactly the same.

99
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:03,024
No! One key element
was missing!

100
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,357
Huh?

101
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,724
<i>The first time, we both</i>
<i>longed to see the sneak</i>
<i>peek with every fiber</i>
<i>of our being!</i>

<i>Our should burned with</i>
<i>passion, and we both</i>
<i>refused to let each other</i>
<i>have the first l</i>
ook!

103
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:15,491
Like this!!

104
00:07:15,857 --> 00:07:19,391
Haaaaaaaaaaa!

105
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:25,991
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Cut it out! You're</i>
<i>going to rip it!</i>

106

I am sorry...

107
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:30,191
I hate to admit it,
but you might be
on to something...

108
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:33,191
We can't just
follow a script,
though. We need
to FEEL it.

109
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:34,991
A script...!?

110
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:37,157
That is a
brilliant idea!

111
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,991
What on earth are
you wearing...?

112
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:44,824
I know just what to
do! Script revision
plan... go!

113
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:46,357
Huh?

114
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:50,257
If we do not have
enough passion, we
will just physically
alter the situation!

115
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:54,024
That's way too
literal, Lee!
It'll never work!

116
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:59,057
I will make it
work! I am not
staying in this
world another minute!

117
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:03,524
<i>(Lee)</i>

120
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:20,857
What do you think?
Did it work?

121
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,057
Okay, you can come
on out, Neji!

122
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:30,524
Behold the
explosion of youth!

123
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:34,457
What are you,
crazy!? He looks
just like Guy
Sensei now!

124
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,424
One...two...
three... four...

125
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:38,124
Lee, what did
you do!?

126
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:39,824
I am not sure!

127
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:43,457
I was concentrating
with all my might on
Neji, but I guess I
missed the mark a little.

128
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:46,224
Anyway, it looks
like this method
is effective!

129
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,291

Not again!!!

Why do all your
mistakes turn them
into Guy Sensei!?

137
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:26,991
It looks like Guy Sensei
maintains an inordinately
large presence in my
subconscious...

138
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:33,157
<i>Guy Sensei is always with</i>

<i>emotion... the more</i>
<i>entrenched he becomes...</i>

139
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:40,024
Then you should probably
include Guy Sensei in
your thought and think
of everyone!

140
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,157
Oh--

You're back to normal!

Oh no! Everyone
is Guy Sensei now!

Oh! Even the

ridiculous!

talking about?
It is me!

You wear the exact
same outfits...!!

Jeez, now your
face looks like
his, too!

156
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:55,257
Don't tell me!
Argh! I'm Guy
Sensei, too!

157
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,924
Make it stop!
Standards and practices is
gonna yank us off the air!

158
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:01,924
Behold! The explosion
of youth!

159
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:03,391
To youth!

160
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:06,491
Get away from me!
W-why is this
happening!?

161
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:09,991
I just wanted to
know about the movie,
is that so terrible!?

162

<i>(Narrator)</i>

<i>"Naruto the Movie:</i>
<i>Road to Guy"</i>

164
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:28,024
No it isn't! That's
not what the movie
is called at all!!!

It's my theatrical

Neji! Were you
able to score
some tickets!?

170
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:02,515
Oh yeah. The entire
Hyuga clan is planning
on attending it together.

171
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,915
Our advance-sale
tickets are in hand!

172
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:08,915
Neji! Lee! We've
got a problem!

173
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:10,881
What's wrong?

174
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:13,648
Something just went
down with Lady Tsunade!

175
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:16,081
What?!!

176
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:19,615
You're telling me that
the movie is still
missing a critical piece!?

177
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:22,581
And it's something
big, too...

178
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:25,615
That definitely
doesn't sound good!

179
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:27,548
It's lacking
something major!

180
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:32,015
So there is some kind
of problem with the film.
I wonder what...

181
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,515
"The Amazing True Story
of the Leaf Village Film
Festival"

182
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,148
Hmmm...

183
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,581
Gee. guys, I wonder
what's missing...

184
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:47,748
Ah!

185
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:51,748
I think I have
got this whole
problem figured
out!

What the heck
is going on?

195
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:25,115
Why did we suddenly
get thrown into this
stupid skit!?

196
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,448
But do you not
see, Tenten?!

197
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:30,915
The movie is missing
one vital thing! A
Hollywood action
sequence!

198
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:35,481
Carried out by a
gritty American
hero, overcoming all
the odds in style!

199
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,548
We don't want that
kinda mess! An
American action star?

200
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:40,815
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Naruto's supposed</i>

00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:43,048

<i>If you jump in like that,</i>
<i>you'll obliterate him!</i>

202
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:46,715
It is fine! The
Movie's a compilation
of several arcs anyway!

203
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:52,081
Oh yeah! What if the
mortal enemy he's fighting
against eventually turns out
to be his most powerful ally!?

204
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:56,948
Are you out of
your mind, Lee!?
That'll ruin the
movie!!

205
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:59,115
It's true, Lee,
she's right.

206
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:01,081
Yo mean well, but
you're mixed up.

207
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:05,081
We haven't had a
single movie that's
lacked in blockbuster
action!

208
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:07,381
So then...! What
is missing, Neji!?

209
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:11,948
Of course! It's so
obvious... the one
thing we're lacking...

210
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:18,381
Oh Nejio, Nejio! Why
for art thou called
Nejio?

Oh, Hinaette... My life

But the youths belonged
to houses steeped in
ancient grudge...

215
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:34,448
Their misadventure
love doomed to fail,
they took matters
into their own hands!

Woah, hold the
phone, why do
we need this?

221
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:48,548
A fair maiden and
fleeting romance!

222
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,915
Two soul mates
fading into starry
night!

223
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:54,848
It's obvious
what's missing! A
night of cinema
demands melodrama!

224
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:59,015
This is a summer
blockbuster! No one
wants to see a tear
jerker right now!

225
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:01,548
And we must bravely
shatter that mold!

226
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,715
It'll be the most
powerful film in
history! Breaking
hearts far and wide.

227
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:07,548
A timeless piece
that will forever
be a shining ex--

to you guys, and you're
all totally clueless!

are saying you
have a better
idea!?

You bet we do!
Don't we, Hinata?

Um... well...

be overlooked... The
most important thing
of all!

291
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:52,481
[gulps]

292
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:56,781
Annnd... action!

293
00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:58,681
<i>(Orochimaru)</i>
<i>I turn forty</i>
<i>this year.</i>

294
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:01,848
<i>I've spent my whole</i>
<i>career playing no-name</i>
<i>bit parts...</i>

295
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:05,381
<i>I always considered</i>
<i>myself dedicated to</i>
<i>the craft...</i>

296
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:09,815
<i>But one day I realized</i>
<i>that everyone around me</i>
<i>was half my age!</i>

297
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:14,481
<i>I saw them land starring</i>
<i>roles, while I just spun</i>
<i>my wheels!</i>

298
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:16,881
I'm... fired!?

299
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:20,048
The thing is...
Everyone's having a
hard time working
with ya.

300
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:22,715
He's taking the
job way too seriously!

301
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:24,848
Cut! Cut, already!

302
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:28,715
Well, Orosuke's a nice
guy ad all, but sometimes
he's a big pushy...

303
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:30,148
(scream)

304
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:31,048
The camera's
over here...

305
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:33,015
(bar tender)
We're closing,
pal, go home.

306
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,415
<i>(Orochimaru)</i>
<i>What'd you say</i>
<i>to me!?</i>

307
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:35,881
(bar tender)
Alright! That's it!

308
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,715
<i>(Orochimaru)</i>
<i>But even I found someone</i>
<i>who loved me...</i>

309
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:42,981
<i>I met the sheltered daughter</i>
<i>of some bigwig who ran a film</i>
<i>distribution company...</i>

310
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:47,848
<i>...and she fell for</i>
<i>a two-bit nobody like</i>
<i>me! Can you imagine?</i>

311
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:50,115
<i>He objected, of</i>
<i>course, so we ran</i>
<i>off...</i>

312
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:54,615
<i>...but before we'd had</i>
<i>a chance to create a</i>
<i>single memory together...</i>

313
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:57,615
<i>Even common courtesy</i>
<i>runs out eventually...</i>

314
00:19:57,648 --> 00:20:01,681
[sigh]
"Went back to my
parents house" eh?

315
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:03,548
Oh well...

316
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:08,048
Sweetheart...
sweetheart?!

317
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:11,415
You'e here... why?!

318
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,781
Why don't you
try out for this?

319
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:18,048
You asked your
father, didn't you?

320
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:20,048
I had to...

321
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:23,115
The first he did
was threaten to
disown me...

322
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:26,915
But begging on my
knees was a small
price to pay.

323
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:29,548
But why me...

324
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:36,848
I've seen first hand.
I know how brightly
you shine when you're
in front of the camera.

325
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:42,381
And I want that light
in my life every day!

326
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:44,515
[gasp]

327
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,515
Well this should be
good. Let's see what
you're made of, kid.

328
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:56,881
I'll do it! No
matter what it
takes!!

329
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:58,481
<i>(crew member)</i>
<i>Standby, everybody!</i>

330
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:03,481
Alright! Just watch,
my beloved! I'm going
to shine brighter than
the sun for you!

331
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,248
The hell!?

332
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:09,815
Wait a minute, is
this an anti-
piracy commercial?

333
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:13,381
Well, you'd be in
big trouble without.

334
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:16,581
Yeah I suppose so.
But what's that have
to do with the story?

335
00:21:16,615 --> 00:21:19,481
Bravo, sir! You bring
such perspective!

336
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:21,848
Your perspective
might be a little
skewed...

337
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:25,115
Gimme a break! What
does this have to do
with stopping piracy!?

338
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:28,481
Trust me, you'll
see! I'll explain
everything shortly!

339

It just arrived,
