1
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,077
When snow falls in the
Hidden Leaf Village, it
blankets everything in
pure white.

2
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,210
How are Lee and his
pals enjoying it?

3
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:01,043
Hey, that's not Lee...

4
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:02,810
Huh?!

5
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:08,277
Nice, they're surrounded!
Okay, let's get 'em!

6
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:10,110
Roger.

7
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:12,177
[gasps]

8
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:17,943
Huh?!

9
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,777
I must confirm
something. Is it
winter?

10
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,310
[sighing]

11
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:26,277
Because...

12
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,043
<i>Shino, you idiot!</i>

13
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:38,010
<i>"Shino Loves Insects"</i>

14
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:42,443
Wait... Hibernation?

15
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:48,077
Yes, that's right. Shino's
Parasitic Insects completely
stopped moving when the
weather turned cold.

16
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,110
Technically, they aren't
hibernating in the traditional
sense. They just don't want to

17
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:53,810
leave the warmth of my
body, becaus-

18
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,243
Okay, but why now?

19
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:57,010
It's frickin'
freezing, that's
why.

20
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:04,277
Yes, it's unseasonably
cold this year. Or as Kiba
so eloquently put it, it's
frickin' freezing.

21
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,777
Not having Shino's bugs
makes things tough. If
only there was another
species he could use...

22
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:12,410
Do you think you guys
could help us look
around for some.

23
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,110
Some insects? Sure,
no problem.

24
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:16,243
What?!

25
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,077
Hold on a second here,
we can't just drop
everything and-

26
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,910
Neji, please!

27
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:20,977
Right. Let's do it.

28
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,310
Hold on, you guys!

29
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,843
Honestly, I really don't
deal with bugs and insects
all that well.

30
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:31,543
I, uh... I don't like
them very much either.
So you're not alone
on that one. Sorry.

31
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:35,543
Hinata, to start saying that
now is very inconvenient.
That's because-

32
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:36,977
Suck it up, okay?!

33
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,443
Look, the type doesn't
matter, just find us some
bugs that are still moving!
Got it?

34
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:42,543
Yeah!

35
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:43,810
What?!

36
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,010
Because it would really
hurt my feelings.

37
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,477
Agh! So gross! We ended
up finding a ton of the
nasty little things!

38
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,543
I looked, but I could
only find this one.

39
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:01,343
Huh?!

40
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,377
Not good! That one's
trouble! Why? Because
that's a-

41
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:11,977
[screaming]

42
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,510
A stink bug!

43
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:18,377
[screaming]

44
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:22,043
[screaming]

45
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,010
[screaming]

46
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:34,343
<i>Tenten, Hinata, calm down!</i>
<i>Pill bugs do not bite, stink,</i>
<i>or sting! They are harmless!</i>

47
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:39,443
[screaming]

48
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:43,477
[screaming for help]

49
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,877
Don't any of you even
think about leaving!

50
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:55,910
Hinata, you should get
a medal for being on
this team.

51
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:57,277
Ehh...

52
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,443
It's no good.
Because...

53
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:03,110
[gasping]

54
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,843
They're too slow.

55
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:08,777
[sighing]

56
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:10,877
[groaning]

57
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,877
Forget about speed for
just a second. Surely you
could weaponize the stink
bugs, couldn't you?

58
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,877
Neji, I know you mean
well, but shut up!

59
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:18,243
[weeping]

60
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,410
Hey, then what
about this?

61
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:24,477
"The Love Bugs Movie".
Let us all count the
bug terms!

62
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:27,043
[chuckling]

63
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:30,443
It really bugs me how
selfish you two are!
How could you?

64
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:33,577
Enough already. Get off
your high horse! Now
come over here!

65
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,443
Don't touch me or
you'll really get
stung! I swear!

66
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:41,210
Who you trying to kid,
cry baby? You would not
hurt a fly, you little
tease!

67
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:45,277
You are trapped in our
web now, baby, and there
is no escape! Accept it,
toots.

68
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,543
No, get away!
Someone save me!

69
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:48,543
Freeze!

70
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:49,543
Hah!

71
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:50,943
Aghh!

72
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:54,010
Oh, Tenneth...

73
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:59,443
Hinata! I was so worried
you'd been stung by a
poisonous bug or something.

74
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:01,377
I'm sorry I worried
you, Father.

75
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:05,110
I can't...
Tell him...

76
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:17,877
I thought you'd been acting
strangely lately. That's
why I tailed you. How could

77
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,910
you?! What a filthy
little worm!

78
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:26,843
As your father, I am
putting my foot down.
Annoying mosquito! Just
looking at this poisonous

79
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:29,843
excuse for a human being
makes me as mad as a
hornet!

80
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:32,143
Dad, your such a meanie!

81
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,877
[gasp]

82
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,643
[screaming]

83
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:40,043
And just like that, the
little moth heads right
into the flame. So
predictable!

84
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:43,877
Our last little run-in
really ticked me off, but
now I'll get my revenge!

85
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,810
Don't worry, Daddy-o!
Let me handle these
guys!

86
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:50,310
Don't call me daddy
anything! We must
protect my daughter!

87
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,410
Those punks are knee-
high to a grasshopper!
We can take 'em!

88
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,210
[screaming]

89
00:06:55,943 --> 00:07:00,177
Aw, man. They really
loused everything up.
Those punks...

90
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,277
Tenneth!

91
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,243
Hinata!

92
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,410
Maybe it's none of
my beeswax after all.

93
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:10,243
Hah! To each is
own, I guess.

94
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:14,110
<i>Thank you for</i>
<i>understanding,</i>
<i>father.</i>

95
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,277
<i>The End.</i>

96
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:20,777
[chuckle]

97
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,977
What in the heck are you
grinning about?! That
waste of two minutes
didn't solve a thing!

98
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,877
We don't even really
know where to look for
'em. We're not trained
bug hunters.

99
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,043
Good point. Let me
give you a brief
lecture, then.

100
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,810
You mean we're
still not done?!

101
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:39,010
During the winter, most
bugs stay under leaves,
under rocks, and under
tree bark. Observe.

102
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,043
He just found
Kakashi Sensei.

103
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:42,543
Huh?

104
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:50,377
Whoa! What's Kakashi doing
here? To answer that question,
we'll have to go back a little
bit. It happened like this...

105
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:53,810
You have to find me
within the time limit.

106
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:55,877
Everybody ready?

107
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:06,543
And that's pretty
much the whole story.

108
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:08,910
Kakashi Sensei?

109
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:12,210
Wait, I have got it!
That is not the real
Kakashi Sensei!

110
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,243
Huh? What are you
talking about, Lee?

111
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:18,843
Bugs live in tree bark,
right? And look at that
book. This is not
Kakashi...

112
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:21,543
It is a bookworm!

113
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,943
<i>Ugh, that's so lame!</i>

114
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:24,010
Ooh!

115
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:26,543
Oh, please. Don't be
impressed by such a
bad pun.

116
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:28,110
Prepare yourself!

117
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:38,977
Ah. That was
good. Because-

118
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,143
Awesome! That bookworm
that looks like Kakashi
rules!

119
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:42,343
There's no such
thing, okay?

120
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:44,543
Now we are finally
getting somewhere!

121
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:46,377
Alright, everyone!
Keep looking!

122
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,010
How many times do I have
to tell you? Kakashi
Sensei's not an insect.

123
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:52,343
I doubt there're any
more of your "insects"
out here-

124
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:53,010
Here is another.

125
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:54,377
Seriously?
You're kidding?!

126
00:08:56,343 --> 00:09:00,310
What's Choji doing here,
you ask? Well, it happened
like this...

127
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:07,043
Hmm...Macarons from four
months ago. Should I eat
them? Or is it too risky?

128
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:08,210
[screaming]

129
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,143
What the heck happened?
Did I fall in a pit?

130
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,477
Well, it doesn't look
like I'll be getting out
of here anytime soon.

131
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,410
Don't wanna starve to
death! Guess I have
no choice!

132
00:09:21,443 --> 00:09:24,443
No, no, no, they're
four months old. I
really shouldn't.

133
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:27,777
Aw, man! But they look
so good! Maybe just one...

134
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,843
No, no, no!

135
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:34,377
Agh! Stop it! No!

136
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:40,310
No, no, no...
But...

137
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,410
That's funny. I was just
thinking about him and
wondering where he'd been.
How's it going, Choji?!

138
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:49,977
Hold on a moment! This
hungry creature is not
Choji. It is actually...

139
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,377
A Stomach Bug!

140
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,543
[groaning]

141
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:55,410
It is not!
Enough puns!

142
00:09:57,877 --> 00:10:00,177
I am sure there are
more nearby... Agh!

143
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,510
Gah! Agh! Under
this rock!

144
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,777
[groaning]

145
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,810
Captain Yamato, what're
you doing under there?!

146
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,310
Yes, what is Yamato
doing under there?

147
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,943
Actually, no one knows
what Yamato's deal is.

148
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,410
Despite what you think,
what you see before is not
Captain Yamato. It is another
type of bug.

149
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:26,377
A bug?

150
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,543
Yes, a bug.

151
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:29,777
Oh, great.

152
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:34,143
Let us take a moment
to interview him.
Captain Yamato, correct?

153
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,277
What is your favorite
type of food?

154
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:40,810
What do you like to
do in your free time?

155
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:43,510
You see?

156
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,343
See what, exactly?

157
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,077
Here I come!

158
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:04,343
Whoa!

159
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:09,377
They will collectively
make excellent replacements
for my usual bugs. Because-

160
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,410
Shino, this is
just too awesome!

161
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:12,343
Becaus-

162
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:13,843
They're the strongest
bugs I've ever seen!

163
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:15,077
Becau-

164
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,043
The bookworm, the stomach
bug, and the bug-bug!
Incredible!

165
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:18,943
Beca-

166
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,010
Are you seriously
going along with
this?

167
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:21,210
Be-

168
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:22,943
We should split up
and see how many more
bugs we can find.

169
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,043
Yeah!

170
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,077
I found a bedbug! Oh!
There's a grasshopper!
And a ladybug!

171
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,310
And so, Shino Aburame
assembled the greatest
insect army in history.

172
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:41,410
But this was merely the
prologue to him founding
the Hidden Bug Village,
and becoming its leader,

173
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:44,210
known far and wide as
the "Bug-Kage"!

174
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:46,177
Yeah, right. Like that
would ever happen.

[grunting]

176
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:59,210
In reality, everyone went
back home, and the team
had a craftily create a
warmer environment for

177
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:01,410
the original bugs to
continue working.

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,477
[sigh]

179
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,543
Keep it up, everyone.
Only 6,882 more bug
sweaters to go.

180
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:11,410
I can't take it!
Please, no more!

do women love more than
just about anything?

Hello and good morning!
It is time for another
early-morning trai-
Hold on...

183
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,450
Tenten is not here!

184
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:44,883
Apparently she's out
battling her fellow
females today.

185
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,816
Battling her

Once again, no pushing!
No running!

Please! No pushing,

Megaphones, radio

They're pulling out the
big guns as usual. But
this year, I'm prepared!

196
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,550
Foolish amateurs. They
only put cheap junk out
in the bins to lure in
suckers!

we'd be better off
working together here.

That's true. A little
cooperation maybe
just what we need.

Being at each other's

us in the end.

This is truly
a war zone.

245
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,983
Strategy, weaponry, and
at times, emergency
measures. A female war
zone is a dangerous place

246
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:04,916
where only the most
merciless women come
out on top! Without
allies, you are doomed.

00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:41,250
The most dangerous foe
at this point in the game
is the bargain stealer.
Filthy cowards who snatch

261
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:44,050
your hard-earned clothes
the moment you leave
yourself open!

262
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:49,850
This is the perfect
formation! Optimally
balanced, offensively
and defensively.

263
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,283
We're gonna make
it this year!

00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,483
Huh?

268
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:05,150
I suggest you let go
of this one. Remember,
I am the Hokage.

269
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:11,083
Hokage or not, on the
floor of a bargain sale,
we're nothing but fellow
kunoichi and consumers.

270
00:17:11,116 --> 00:17:13,116
I will not let go,
you got that?!

271
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,816
Excuse me?

272
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,083
Whoa, hold up! Deep
discount or not, this
is Lady Tsunade we're
dealing with.

273
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:20,216
There's just no
way we can beat
her.

Tenten...

275
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:25,883
She is a Legendary Sannin,
but things are different
this year than they have
been in the past.

together as a team, I

Mmm...

Uh huh! So it's a fight
you're looking for, is it?

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,316
That's right!
Bring it on!

281
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,550
Now's our chance!

282
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,216

304
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,216
a second. I hate to
admit it, but we're
outclassed.

305
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,750
Well, then...

306
00:19:22,783 --> 00:19:23,616
Huh?

307
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:27,150
We need to fight on
a field where money
doesn't matter.

308
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,316
You game? Are you
still with me, ladies?!

309
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,183
Yes, of course
we are!

310
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:35,216
At this point we all
share the same fate.
Count us in!

311
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,183
Yes, Tenten. We're
with you to the end!

312
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:39,116
Hm...

313
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,283
I'll admit you've
completely dominated
us so far today.

314
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,650
But there's still
one final battle
yet to be fought.

315
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,150
The most dangerous
and difficult one
of them all.

316
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,650
You don't mean...

317
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,950
We challenge you to
the forbidden "Grab
Bag Throwdown!"

318
00:19:57,383 --> 00:19:59,683
Are you trying to
get yourselves
killed!

319
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:03,850
Huh, what was that?
You're not scared,
are you, Lady Tsunade?

320
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:04,750
[growling]

321
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,216
Fine then! We accept!
Prepare yourselves!

322
00:20:11,316 --> 00:20:13,016
Whew, now I've
done it.

323
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,683
Sorry about that. I know
that grab-bags are the
equivalent of land mines
waiting to blow.

324
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,983
But it was the only thing
I could think of going on
here today where we at

325
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:23,183
least have a chance
at beating the adults.

326
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:27,116
Don't be silly, Tenten.
It's a great plan. We
just need to win.

327
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,650
Yeah, she's right!
Let's do it!

328
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:33,316
We'll beat them, and
return to the village
arm in arm, okay?

329
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,750
Hm! Yeah!

330
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,783
<i>Considering the season,</i>
<i>the heavy ones will be</i>
<i>coats. High value targets,</i>

331
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:46,016
<i>but the wrong choice</i>
<i>will prove fatal.</i>

332
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,983
The uneven weight suggests
multiple items. That does
spread out the risk, but...

333
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,616
We could take a chance...

334
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,050
<i>And pick a light one</i>
<i>hoping that it's something</i>
<i>really valuable!</i>

335
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,316
They're using their
grownup finances to
win with sheer numbers?

336
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,750
We won't know for
sure until we open
these suckers up!

337
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:10,850
Now let the battle begin!

338
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:11,950
<i>Go!</i>

339
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,583
What in the world?!

340
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:17,250
What is this
supposed to be?

341
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:19,316
How in the heck do
you even wear this
thing?

342
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,983
O...kay...

343
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:22,150
[screaming]

344
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:24,250
Let's take a look to
see what's in this one!

345
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,716
[screaming]

346
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:26,883
Ugh!

347
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,616
Aghh!

348
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,750
Down to the last
two grab bags.

349
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:32,816
Bring it on!

350
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:35,783
<i>A 10 pack of</i>
<i>Guy Suits?!</i>

351
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,116
<i>A 10 pack of</i>
<i>Lee suits?!</i>

352
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,216
Unitards?! Are
you kidding me?!

353
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,683
<i>It was nothing</i>
<i>but junk...</i>

354
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,316
Of course, in anime, no
one ever changes their
clothes. So it doesn't
really matter anyway.

355
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,183
<i>Never fear! Here</i>
<i>comes the calvary!</i>

356
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:55,850
Yahh!

357
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,550
Let me help!
Where is the
battle?!

358
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,150
How'd I get
talked into
this?

359
00:23:47,187 --> 00:23:53,220
The next episode is, "17 Nights
<i>of Staying out of Sight" and</i>
<i>"Cleaning the Bathroom</i>
<i>Cleanses the Soul."</i>

360
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,653
Come to think of it,
you're 17, aren't you,
Lee? Huh. You really
don't look it...

361
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:03,053
<i>Yes, indeed! And I will</i>
<i>be 17 next year and the</i>
<i>year after that, as well!</i>

362
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:05,153
Such is the life of
an anime character.

363
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:06,820
You too, right,
Tenten?

364
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:09,887
Eh, yeah, sure. I'm
eternally 17, too.

365
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,520
<i>Boy, they really can do</i>
<i>some crazy things with</i>
<i>the settings, huh?</i>
