1
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:55,921
Today the embargo officially
ends, and one famous shinobi
is getting a mission.

2
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:59,601
<i>Last night, a group of</i>
<i>rogue ninja stole a scroll</i>
<i>containing forbidden jutsu.</i>

3
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:04,701
You must infiltrate their
hideout and retrieve that
scroll. And you must do
it as quickly as possible.

4
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:07,501
Lady Tsunade, is
this the entire team?

5
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:10,401
I gathered you all
specifically for
this mission.

6
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:14,234
Sai, the former ANBU
Black Ops, will lead,
backed by Neji's

7
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:18,167
Byakugan, and Tenten's
weapon user. It will be
a three-person team.

8
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,467
[uncomfortable oinking]

9
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:26,467
Take it easy. You can
hang on for a little
while.

10
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,201
[screaming]

11
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,267
My eye! I
can't see!

12
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,201
[screaming]

13
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:34,134
Neji!

14
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:36,367
[screaming]

15
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:37,134
Agh!

16
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:38,934
Are you all right?!

17
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:42,367
I hate to mention this,
but it appears we have
a man down.

18
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:43,401
<i>Moving on...</i>

19
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,101
Huh?

20
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:48,001
Well, it looks like the
only other available
shinobi is...

21
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,601
<i>"Yamato Gets a Mission!"</i>

22
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:01,001
I am burning
with energy!

23
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:04,001
Of course you would
focus on the clothing.

24
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:08,067
With this ANBU Black-Ops
outfit, I can vanish like
a fart in the wind!

25
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,367
[farting noise]

26
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,634
I'm afraid it's your
imagination. You stand
out in any situation!

27
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,967
Agh!

28
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:17,067
Yeah, to be a member
of the ANBU, you need
to be undetectable.

29
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,201
[sigh]

30
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:24,567
For those in the audience
who don't know, ANBU's full
name is the Black Ops Special
Tactical Unit. They perform

31
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:30,067
extremely difficult
assassination and espionage
missions. Hidden behind their
masks and operating from the

32
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:36,067
shadows, they protect the
village. Kakashi and Captain
Yamato were both once ANBU
Black Ops members.

33
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:39,667
Uhh, it is fine. I just
need to wear the mask! See?

34
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:42,334
It could not be more
obvious who you are.

35
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:46,167
Listen, Lee. Let's get
one thing clear before
we start the mission.

36
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:50,601
<i>Come to think of it, we've</i>
<i>done a lot of stuff with Sai,</i>
<i>but this is our first time on</i>

37
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:53,934
<i>a mission with him. People</i>
<i>tell me he's a first-rate</i>
<i>ninja.</i>

38
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,601
I've been wanting to
ask you something.

39
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:01,167
Do you even have
a wiener?

40
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,201
Yes, I do.

41
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:05,301
You do not have
to answer that!

42
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,967
[screaming]

43
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,134
No way!

44
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,067
[gasp]

45
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:13,634
Our sincerest apologies
to all our viewers.

46
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,001
You too, Sai! Tell
them you're sorry!
Huh?

47
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:20,967
This amazing. Without a
doubt. It's the Leaf's
Beautiful Green Wild Beast!

48
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:22,634
Stop admiring him!

49
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:25,934
[screaming]

50
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,301
Tell me something.
What was the point
of that?

51
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,834
Sorry, I got
carried away.

52
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:35,634
However, Yamato's going
to rendezvous with us when
he finishes his mission.

53
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,034
So I think we'll be
alright in the end.

54
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:44,967
<i>I need to be careful that</i>
<i>I don't become a burden</i>
<i>to Sai.</i>

55
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,401
I just remembered
something. I never
gave you any nicknames.

56
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,201
What?

57
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:54,034
Seeing as we're finally on
a mission together, I think
it will help bring us closer
as a team.

58
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,467
Now that you mention it,
that's a very sweet thought.

59
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,067
Thanks! Tell me what
you think of these...

60
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:02,367
Meatball-Head Hag and
Turd Eyebrow Spastic
Mental Patient!

61
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,934
You're making
them insults?!

62
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:06,101
How come you made
mine so long, Sai?

63
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:07,234
Sorry 'bout that.

64
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:13,967
Remember something, while
I was in the Foundation, I
underwent special training
to kill my emotions.

65
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:18,501
<i>The Foundation's a really</i>
<i>brutal division. They</i>
<i>don't care about anything</i>
<i>but success.</i>

66
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:22,234
Until recently, I didn't
truly understand what
friends were.

67
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:24,967
Oh, Sai...

68
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:28,467
You have been through
an awful lot. But do
not fret, my friend!

69
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:30,201
Let us have a
group hug!

70
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:34,301
He used a jutsu
to get away!

71
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,134
Agh!

72
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:38,334
Are we not all friends
and comrades from the
same village?

73
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:43,201
Yes, I suppose.

74
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:46,701
But you are not sure.
Therefore, I will earn
your friendship by

75
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,434
proving myself to you
on this mission!

76
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:52,401
Oh brother, I can
smell trouble coming.

77
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:58,401
Down there.

78
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,401
I believe we've
found their hideout.

79
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:02,534
You sure? It
is pretty small.

80
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,567
That house is a fake!
I believe the real
hideout-

81
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,734
Hey, nice artwork!

82
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,634
Do you mind? Why must
you always comment on
everything!

83
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:15,101
The real hideout's
probably underground.
I expect the scroll is
there, as well. Let's go.

84
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:15,967
Huh?

85
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:18,501
[growling]

86
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,267
Just as we thought,
here it is!

87
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,634
Yes, but where's
the scroll?

88
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,001
I'll search for it
with my jutsu.

89
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,567
Ninja-Art, Super-
Beast Scroll!

90
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,401
Wow! The animals he
drew came to life!

91
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,434
That is good, but
I can help, too!

92
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:37,967
What in the world are
you talking about, Lee?
That's Sai's jutsu!

93
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,534
<i>If I do this...</i>

94
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,201
...Whatever I draw
becomes part of the
jutsu!

95
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:45,001
And that's your trick?

96
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:47,401
Ninja Art! Super-
Beast Scroll!

97
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:50,001
What's going on?
It's freaking me
out!

98
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,267
Sqquueeaakk!

99
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:54,134
This is horrible!
Get 'em off me!

100
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,301
I'm going to fix
this right now!

101
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,434
That is your trick?

102
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,201
Quit copying me!

103
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:01,467
Ninja Art! Super-
Beast Scroll!

104
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:04,101
Oh my goodness!
How cute are they?!

105
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:07,867
They are not only cute,
but also surprisingly
strong.

106
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,401
<i>What's that noise?</i>

107
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:12,467
Heads up, guys!
It's the enemy!

108
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,134
No big deal, Sai!
Just leave them to me!

109
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,967
I heard voices!
Who goes there?!

110
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:19,967
<i>It's a food vendor!</i>

111
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:24,601
Good, it worked! I
used a wood-style move,
like Captain Yamato would
have done!

112
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:27,501
Wouldn't it be weird
for an oden stand to
be down here?

113
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:28,467
That explains it!

114
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,301
It's just an
oden stand!

115
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,434
I can't believe
it! It worked!

116
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:37,267
Hey, wait a minute!
Isn't it weird for an
oden stand to be down
here?

117
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:38,267
Yeah!

118
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:41,101
They suspect us!
They're coming back!

119
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:43,134
Looks like we only
have one option!

120
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:45,267
Don't do that!
It's forbidden!

121
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,934
<i>Giant Mecha Ten-Zone!</i>

122
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:52,467
For heaven's sake, Lee!
That's just a poor man's
Yamato!

123
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:56,234
But a boring character
like Yamato will not
draw anyone's attention!

124
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,434
That will draw
everyone's attention!

125
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:01,134
<i>Look at that!</i>

126
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,167
Just another
giant mecha!

127
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:05,467
Hey, wait a minute!
How'd it get here!

128
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:07,001
We have intruders!

129
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,534
I told you
they'd notice.

130
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:12,467
Guess we'll have to
fight! Ninja Art, Super-
Beast Scroll!

131
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:16,601
Nice job, Sai!

132
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:21,467
One problem, though.
I'm almost out of ink. I
can't use any in battle.

133
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,001
Lee, this is your fault
for forcing him to waste
it!!

134
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:25,367
Sorry about that.

135
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:28,001
All right, let's
interrogate them
about the scroll.

136
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:31,401
Don't waste your
time hotshot. You're
not gonna get
anything out of us!

137
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:34,367
If Yamato were here
right now, what would
he do?

138
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:39,034
<i>I'm not above using</i>
<i>fear to control people.</i>

139
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,267
I bet he'd do this!

140
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,967
Stop it, please!
Don't hurt us!

141
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:48,434
[screaming laughs]

142
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,767
Alright, got it!

143
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:54,334
Excellent! Now we just
have to escape, and the
mission will be a success!

144
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,434
I guess from the looks
of it, you didn't need
our help after all.

145
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,034
[groaning]

146
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,367
<i>That is not true!</i>

147
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:03,534
We are here to assist
in this retrieval, no
matter what it takes!

148
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:06,134
What are you doing?!
Don't open that!

149
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:06,834
<i>What?!</i>

150
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:08,934
[screaming]

151
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,267
It's a trap!
That scroll is
a fake!

152
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,401
Lee!

153
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:14,534
Lee!

154
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:17,234
You guys okay?

155
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:19,801
The others were
able to get away!

156
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:26,434
That was close.

157
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,067
If we hadn't figured out
the scroll was a trap when
we did, we might have all
been caught!

158
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:33,401
I understand. But
what about Lee?

159
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:38,067
Discard your comrades,
my boy.

160
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:42,801
You have to kill your
feelings. This is the
way of the Foundation,
my boy.

161
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,401
All this for
a phony scroll.

162
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:47,534
<i>I got it!</i>

163
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,301
Don't worry, the
real scroll is safe.

164
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:54,067
Good! Hey Eyebrows, I've
got a proposal for you I
believe you'll find

165
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:57,801
interesting. You tell
us where your pals are,
and we'll let you live!

166
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,801
Not a bad deal,
considering.

167
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:04,234
You can forget about
it! I would never sell
out my friends!

168
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:07,967
Oh yeah? In that case,
you can die!

169
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:11,401
What are you doing,
guys?! You have to
get out of here!

170
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:14,534
Sorry, Sai was pretty
specific about what
we should do.

171
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:17,467
We rescue him and
we all get out of
here together!

172
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:18,267
[gasp]

173
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:22,334
To tell you the truth, I
don't really understand
it myself. But you two

174
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,434
accepted me with no
questions asked.

175
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,001
We bonded. I would
never leave you!

176
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,901
<i>We're comrades now!</i>

177
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:32,067
Thank you, Sai!

178
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:34,267
It feels pretty nice
to make new friends.

179
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,001
[giggling]

180
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,134
Take out every
last one of 'em!

181
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:37,867
Right!

182
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,267
Lee, I am totally out of
ink. I'm gonna need your
help.

183
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:42,367
I am ready!

184
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:43,501
Then we're on!

185
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:44,301
[grunting]

186
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:48,401
Super Brows Scroll!

187
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,234
[screaming]

188
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:55,034
Those are the scariest
eyebrows I've ever seen!

189
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:57,734
[grunting]

190
00:10:58,234 --> 00:11:00,167
Retrieval is
now complete!

191
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,401
That was gross!

192
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:02,334
[groaning]

193
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:03,901
<i>You won't get</i>
<i>away with this!</i>

194
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:06,767
What the-?

195
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,034
You did this?

196
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:10,867
[gasp]

197
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:11,767
Yamato!

198
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,134
Grab on to me, everyone!
I am going to fly us away
from here, right now!

199
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:24,167
Are you telling me
there's no other
way out!

200
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,967
Yes! This is
the right scroll!

201
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:30,767
Good work, team.
You did very well
on this assignment!

202
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:33,334
I really didn't think
we were going to make
it, this time.

203
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,467
Thanks again. You
save me back there.

204
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:38,934
As I understand it,
that is exactly what
friends are for!

205
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,134
[giggling]

206
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,501
Looks like you finished
the mission, safe and
sound!

207
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:43,601
Hi there, Neji!

208
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:45,667
[screaming]

209
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,467
No, my eyes!

210
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:48,667
[screaming]

211
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:52,634
Poor Neji. It's his
plight to always be
collateral damage.

212
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:07,455
Today, the Leaf Village
is about to face a crisis
unlike anything it's
ever seen before!

213
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:14,122
I believe that is Mr.
Teuchi! What is going on?

214
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:16,455
Must crush you!

215
00:12:16,488 --> 00:12:17,155
What?!

216
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:19,355
I must crush you!

217
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:19,822
[screaming]

218
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:21,288
Settle down, pops!

219
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,222
He wants to crush us?
What's wrong with him?

220
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:27,355
The Leaf...

221
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:28,288
Huh?!

222
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:31,555
The Leaf must be
crushed until...

223
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:34,022
...there's nothing
but dust!

224
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,188
[screaming]

225
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:45,188
<i>"Leaf Village of</i>
<i>the Dead!"</i>

226
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,355
No! Stop it!

227
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,555
Stay away from me!

228
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:55,322
There's no escape!

229
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:56,688
Help me!

230
00:12:58,088 --> 00:12:59,622
No! No!

231
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,222
Stop it! Somebody,
help me!

232
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:05,455
More and more people
are being affected!

233
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,588
What could cause
this to happen?

234
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,622
[chuckling]

235
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,655
<i>Oh yes, it's only a</i>
<i>matter of time, now!</i>

236
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,155
[chuckling]

237
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:16,388
I can't believe
his plan is working!

238
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:23,122
Lord Orochimaru, shouldn't
you be working on a plan to
crush the Leaf Village?

239
00:13:23,155 --> 00:13:26,622
It's so hot out here.
Who could focus on
being evil?

240
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:29,455
Get me more iced tea,
will you, Kabuto?

241
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:34,355
Really, if only the shinobi
in the Leaf Village were
like you, we wouldn't need
plans.

242
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,222
Um, Kabuto, tea?

243
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,688
We could destroy the
village with our eyes
closed!

244
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:40,288
What did you say?!

245
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,522
That might work!

246
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:50,055
What a great idea! A
virus that will cause
the infected to turn
into Lord Orochimaru!

247
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:52,155
I never would have
even thought of that.

248
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:54,188
[chuckling]

249
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:57,988
I'd forgotten this attack
for the first 47 episodes.

250
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:02,322
It turns out I'm actually
a genius! You see, with
the series being almost

251
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:04,555
over, they'll have no
time to recover!

252
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:07,088
I should have made
this move ages ago!

253
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:08,655
<i>I'm so smart!</i>

254
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:12,222
Victory is mine! The
Leaf will fall today!

255
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,455
It's locked!

256
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,355
<i>Freeze, you three...</i>

257
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,155
Face it, you
cannot escape us!

258
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:26,055
What do we do?!
We've got nowhere
to run!

259
00:14:26,088 --> 00:14:28,522
It's time for
you to join us!

260
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:29,088
[nervous groan]

261
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:31,188
Someone save us, please!

262
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:32,188
Quickly in here!

263
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:32,988
[gasps]

264
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:34,988
Come one! Move it!

265
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:36,322
Lady Tsunade!

266
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:43,488
Good work. That will
at least buy us some
time.

267
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:45,388
You saved us,
Lady Tsunade!

268
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:47,455
What in the world is
happening out there?

269
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:48,955
Something diabolical!

270
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:49,488
[gasps]

271
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,988
I'm positive Orochimaru
is the one responsible
for this!

272
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:54,355
I should have known!

273
00:14:55,822 --> 00:15:00,122
That monster has somehow
turned his evil DNA into
a highly contagious virus!

274
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:01,922
Byakugan!

275
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:08,255
<i>Oh! Good heavens!</i>

276
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:13,522
The infected people start
slithering around, complaining
to everybody about their
grudges! Eventually, they

277
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:17,555
become so irritating and
lazy they can't even do
their jobs properly!

278
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:21,088
In other words, they
ultimately become
Orochimaru!

279
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:22,855
It's the end
of the world!

280
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,622
What are you saying?
Is there nothing we
can do?

281
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:29,955
Don't be ridiculous!
Come on now, who do
you think I am?!

282
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:31,188
Come with me!

283
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:34,422
What's this?

284
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:35,855
Sakura?

285
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:37,355
<i>Shizune's here,</i>
<i>as well!</i>

286
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:41,388
It is too dangerous to
be that close to an Oro-
zombie!

287
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,022
Don't worry...

288
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:45,988
It's very selective.

289
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:53,322
From what I've seen so far,
it's only men who turn into
Oro-zombies. No women have
caught the virus yet.

290
00:15:56,022 --> 00:16:00,488
My crack team of female
researchers and I are
heavily involved in
finding a cure.

291
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:02,922
We should have things
back to normal in no
time!

292
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:09,122
Leave it to Lady Tsunade
to notice such an important
detail.

293
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:11,155
She sure knows
her stuff!

294
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:15,855
Yeah, and when you think
about it, none of Orochimaru's
previous schemes have ever been
successful, anyway!

295
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,122
That is certainly
a relief!

296
00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:18,355
[laughing]

297
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:21,588
What's going on here?!
why have you stopped
collecting data?!

298
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:24,188
Get back to work
and do your jobs!

299
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:27,622
We are doing our job.
We have simply been
waiting for the right

300
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:31,055
moment to obliterate
the Hidden Leaf Village!

301
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,188
[growling]

302
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:33,355
What's happening?

303
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:36,222
[screaming]

304
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:36,988
Ahhhh!

305
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:40,122
You're next! I'm
coming for you!

306
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:41,322
[screaming]

307
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:44,955
What happened? She said
women weren't in danger
of getting infected!

308
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:47,522
We are all in danger!
We have to get out of
here, now!

309
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,122
[screaming]

310
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:54,022
You're trapped
and can't escape.

311
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,922
What's wrong with those
stupid idiots? They aren't
adjusting for the virus's
deficiencies!

312
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:01,522
What are you
talking about?

313
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:07,255
It's the way viruses are
programmed. As they spread
themselves from the bodies
of host to host, they mutate

314
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:13,522
a bit each time. And my
virus is no different. It
becomes that much harder
to control or eradicate it.

315
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:17,788
This will be your
punishment for
underestimating my
genius, Tsunade!

316
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:23,822
Orochimaru hasn't had his
act together all year! And
he never will. The series
will be over pretty soon!

317
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:27,022
Dear viewers, on the
next episode, you'll
find a new show.

318
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:30,255
It's a spin-off! The
working title is very
catchy. It's called

319
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:32,455
'Orochimaru's
Amazing Adventures!'

320
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:36,022
Unfortunately, we only
have three episodes
left, m'lord.

321
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,322
What? Seriously?

322
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:41,555
[growling]

323
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:43,855
Now Guy Sensei and
Kakashi Sensei are
after us, too!

324
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,522
Uh oh, we're cut off!

325
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:50,388
And from what we've seen,
if we try to fight them,
there's no way to avoid
getting infected!

326
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:53,522
This can't be real!
I can't believe it's
going to end like this!

327
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:57,555
There is one person who
can turn this situation
around, am I right, Neji?

328
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,022
What?! You mean me?!

329
00:17:59,055 --> 00:18:03,055
Of course I mean you!
It just so happens that
you are uniquely qualified!

330
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,355
Think about your long
history of cross-dressing!

331
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:09,255
<i>Actually, I would rather</i>
<i>that history end up in</i>
<i>the dustbin.</i>

332
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:14,522
No, my friend, that will
not help. You have to face
it. We are on the ropes here,
and this is the only strategy

333
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:16,355
we can use to make
a comeback!

334
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,322
Excuse me?!

335
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:18,155
Huh?

336
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:20,222
The virus has been
unstoppable, so far!

337
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:21,088
[growling]

338
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:23,122
It has infected both
men and women alike!

339
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:28,922
But you, who deep in your
heart of hearts, is a true,
dyed-in-the-wool-cross-
dresser, are neither!

340
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:31,422
Only you can be
immune to this
virus!

341
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:33,255
I don't cross-dress
because I want to be-

342
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:38,488
He does have a point,
you know. Orochimaru
and cross dressing
basically go hand in hand.

343
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:39,788
Not you as well?!

344
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:41,488
I'm just hoping...

345
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,555
Otherwise, there are no
options! There'll be no-
one left who can oppose him!

346
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:48,822
And we'll all
be finished!

347
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:51,422
[sobbing]

348
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:52,755
Neji...

349
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:57,088
I hear you. If my
actions can help
save the village,
then so be it.

350
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:07,388
[attacking yell]

351
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:12,288
I am now going to
crush you both,

352
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:13,355
[growling]

353
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:16,222
After all that big talk,
he gets himself infected!

354
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,755
That is unbelievable!
I was sure he was immune!

355
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:21,388
Yeah?! Now what do we
do? We're going to be
next!

356
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:22,255
Hmm...

357
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,255
How 'bout we
try this...

358
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,255
[screaming]

359
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:33,088
You've done it!
You're plan was
successful, m'lord!

360
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:36,955
Yes Kabuto, my
perseverance has
paid off, and my
dream of crushing

361
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:39,155
the Leaf Village is
finally coming true!

362
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:42,055
Must crush the Leaf.
Must crush it.

363
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:45,388
With this many minions
under my personal control,
I can assure you that

364
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:48,055
crushing these people's
village will be a cakewalk!

365
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:52,355
Come with me, everyone.
Let's get started. Let
us turn it into a pile
of trash!

366
00:19:54,855 --> 00:20:00,022
Why aren't you all moving?
I can't do this alone! You
all need to go on a rampage
with me, starting right now!

367
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:04,922
Well, well, if it isn't
the virtuous Rock Lee!
Or should I be calling
you 'Loser Lee'?

368
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:08,122
It's time to let yourself
run wild, and help me
crush the Leaf!

369
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:09,422
Get away from me!

370
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:10,655
What's happening?!

371
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:13,755
I will crush! That is
my goal. I will crush
my quads!

372
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:16,955
What do you mean? What
will crushing your
quads do for me?!

373
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:20,255
I can't believe it!
Even after being turned
into me, you're still
useless!

374
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:21,388
Ahhh!

375
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:22,588
What's wrong,
Kabuto?

376
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,788
Take a look! It's
not just Lee who's
gone off-script here!

377
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:28,022
[gulping]

378
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:30,888
I'm gonna crush
this jug of sake!

379
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:33,022
I have to crush
this cellulite!

380
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:35,755
I am going to crush
Akamaru's fleas!

381
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:36,855
What happened?

382
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:39,422
Don't you remember?
You explained it to
me, m'lord.

383
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:43,822
As viruses spread themselves
from the bodies of host to
host, they mutate a bit each

384
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:46,722
time. And my virus
is no different.

385
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:49,288
You're telling me
this is a mutation?

386
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:53,255
That's exactly what I'm
saying. The sentiment to
crush remained, but the

387
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:56,288
targets then changed, to
match everyone's individual
personalities!

388
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,888
I must find a way to
crush this bubble wrap!

389
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:01,088
I have to crush these
pimples on my butt!

390
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:03,855
I'm going to crush
that yakitori stand!

391
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,055
I'll crush the levels
on this scroll!

392
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:08,722
I'll crush the writers
who won't let me talk
in this series!

393
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:12,688
Actually, who cares?
At this point, the village
will collapse, regardless!

394
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:15,355
My goal will be
achieved, and I will
win in the end!

395
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:18,655
[gasp]

396
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,255
What are you
doing, Kabuto?

397
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,655
Must crush, as well.

398
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,788
You're infected?

399
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,222
Wait a minute! What
are you gonna crush!

400
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:37,955
Good question. I'm surprised
you don't know. For subjecting
me to years of humiliation.

401
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:40,322
It's time for revenge!

402
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:41,822
I will now crush you!

403
00:21:41,855 --> 00:21:43,722
Don't do this, Kabuto!

404
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,388
Things have finally
worked out for us.
Try to control yourself.

405
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:54,822
I'm going to crush
your Orochi-
[Bell Rings]

406
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,555
[growling]

407
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:57,922
No fair, that's
an illegal move!

408
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:00,388
[screaming]

409
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:05,755
To all of you who are
viewing this episode,
I need you to move in
closer to your screens.

410
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:07,788
So I can crush you!

411
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:53,650
<i>Lord Orochimaru, the</i>
<i>next episodes are: 'The</i>
<i>Alliance to Destroy White</i>
<i>Day' and 'Clean up the Dolls!'</i>

412
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,849
By the way, I'm
sorry about earlier.

413
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:58,269
<i>It's fine. But now I</i>
<i>know how you really feel.</i>

414
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,869
My lord...

415
00:24:00,903 --> 00:24:05,303
<i>I'm just a pitiful character</i>
<i>whose schemes are always</i>
<i>doomed to failure. I'm an</i>
<i>object of universal contempt,</i>

416
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:09,203
<i>equally hated by Lee and</i>
<i>his friends, and also by</i>
<i>my own subordina</i>
te.

417
00:24:09,236 --> 00:24:10,669
You make a good point...

418
00:24:10,703 --> 00:24:13,736
<i>You know what needs</i>
<i>to be crushed? This</i>
<i>stupid series!</i>

419
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:16,003
[wailing]
