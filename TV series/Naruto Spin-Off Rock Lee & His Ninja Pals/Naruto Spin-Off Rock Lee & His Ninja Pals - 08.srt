1
00:01:52,193 --> 00:01:55,560
(Narrator)
Behold! The famous
Great Stone Faces.

2
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:59,793
The face of each
Hokage has been
carved into the
cliff side...

3
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:03,727
Here is the fifth
Hokage herself,
Tsunade!

4
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,093
Let's go, Shizune!

5
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:06,993
Yes, milady...

6
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:16,093
Huh..!?

7
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:21,693
Hey, fellas! Any of
you feel like parting
with your money today?

8
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:30,460
"Even Hokage Go Bald"

9
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,627
We're training with
ninja tools today!

10
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,893
What kind of tools?

11
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:38,060
Check it out!

12
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:38,960
[gasp]

13
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:44,827
You... handed me...
a pair of nunchaku..!

14
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:47,960
Rolling up these
scrolls takes forever.

15
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,560
Hey, Tenten--
Look!

16
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:52,560
Huh? Are nunchaku
not your thing?

17
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:57,093
The truth is... I
love them so much!

18
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,027
He's amazing!
Look at him go!

19
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,493
Watch out!

20
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:07,993
ARGH! You just made
Lady Tsunade bald!
She's gonna have our
heads when she sees that!

21
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:09,493
I am so sorry!

22
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:11,093
[running]

23
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:15,060
Come on, Lee! Hurry
up! We have to get
it back to normal!

24
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:19,127
After we fix her hair,
maybe we can get my face
back to normal, too?

25
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,860
(Thinking)
When it comes to Lady
Tsunade, Tenten would
do anything...

26
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:24,127
[gasp]

27
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:29,227
So that's Tsunade,
the fifth Hokage, huh?

28
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,060
We'll sniff her out
and then we'll
snuff her out!

29
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:33,960
Who are those ninja!?

30
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:36,527
We have to warn
Lady Tsunade!

31
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,860
(Gambler)
I roll first!

32
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:42,160
Here we go!

33
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,527
(Gambler)
Three and four: seven!

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,560
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

35
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:55,227
"Run the 3-legged race
with your klutzy kid at
a family picnic--"

36
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,993
"--Waste your chakra,
lose the race and
your next turn!?"

37
00:03:59,027 --> 00:03:59,993
That's not fair!

38
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:01,760
[laughing]

39
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:02,993
Watch and learn.

40
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:05,760
Hiyaaaa!

41
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:08,527
Double sixes!

42
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,093
Ten, eleven, twelve.

43
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,727
"Arranged marriage
to an oil tycoon"

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,460
"Get oil fields in the
number you just rolled
as a wedding gift!"

45
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,493
Outta sight! Twelve
fields all for me!

46
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,860
For reals!?

47
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:28,027
When it comes to gambling,
they usually call her
"The Legendary Sucker," but
she's cleaning up today!

48
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,927
I've got a bad
feeling... Hm?

49
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:35,760
Mount Fugi, a hawk,
and an eggplant?

50
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:38,027
What the heck
are you doing!?

51
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,160
Guy!?

52
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:45,727
There are rogue
ninja targeting me?

53
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,660
When they told me
about it, we sent
Team Guy over
right away...

54
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,460
But we didn't have
time to coordinate
our disguises.

55
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:57,027
I'm glad you were so
quick about it and all,
but those are the worst
disguises ever.

56
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,027
Mhm.

57
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,793
But Mt. Fugi!...?

58
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:04,793
We heard that you were
playing down here at
Tansakugai, so we wore
outfits to bring you luck!

59
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:07,027
Why!? Why am I
the eggplant!?

60
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,893
Lady Tsunade..?
I... I got this
for you.

61
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,960
A good-luck charm?

62
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:14,827
Wow! Thank you!

63
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,827
[happy sigh]

64
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,527
You are taking this
seriously, huh, Tenten!

65
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,093
Course I am!

66
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:29,760
Because... I'm a big
fan of Lady Tsunade--
She's always so
strong. It's just...

67
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:30,960
Oink?

68
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,627
Wow! It really
worked, master!

69
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:37,693
Very well done,
Sakura!

70
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:41,927
(Thinking)
Since I can't use medical
ninjutsu, I couldn't
become her student.

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,693
I don't really feel
like I've earned her
respect, that's all...

72
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:49,693
This is my
chance to show her
what I can do!

73
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:53,660
Lee! I'm so proud!

74
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,660
I know just
how you feel!

75
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:56,927
You do?

76
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,627
I will give this
mission my all
as well!

77
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:05,093
Please, let us escort
you back to the village,
milady. You'll be out of
harm's way there!

78
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:06,727
Not so fast!

79
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,227
You think you can clean
us out, then leave before
we can win any back!?

80
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,760
Fine by me!

81
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:14,793
[gasp]

82
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,993
[laugh] Let's see
how you do at cards!

83
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:24,927
Doesn't matter what we
play. Lady Luck's on my
side today, no matter what!

84
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,460
Hm, we'll see
about that!

85
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,893
Come on! I drew the
old maid again!?

86
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,027
Guy Sensei, are you
sure it is okay for
us to be playing?

87
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,860
If guarding Lady
Tsunade calls for
it, it's all right.

88
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:49,527
The rules for Old Maid
are pretty simple, Lee.

89
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,960
Just make sure
you're not the last
one to have her.

90
00:06:51,993 --> 00:06:53,927
Byakugan!

91
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,460
There she is!
On the far right!

92
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:59,227
They don't mean
a person, Neji!

93
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,093
Technically speaking,
Lady Tsunade is more
of a spinster.

94
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:06,893
She is over half a
century old, though
you would never know
it just by looking!

95
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,493
Shut up, Lee!

96
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:12,860
Sure, maybe she's hiding
under a ton of makeup,
but 53 is basically the
new 47!

97
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,893
I'm still young enough
to break you in half!

98
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:21,527
That... that isn't
what I meant, Lady
Tsunade! I'm not
trying to say..!

99
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,760
Hey! Do you know who
else puts on a good show?

100
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,060
Huh?

101
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:27,093
Hey 'ooooo!

102
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:29,493
She is not
a wrestler!

103
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,827
[grunt, groan]

104
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,527
Is that one Tsunade?

105
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,293
She isn't
bald on top.

106
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:41,127
Our target's supposed
to be a master of
ninjutsu, so, let's
use that to find her.

107
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,293
What do you mean?

108
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:46,793
[snicker] Just leave
it to me, I've got
something in mind!

109
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:53,693
Sorry to barge in, but
my friend is very sick!
Is there a doctor in
the house?!

110
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,527
Why are you coming
in from the closet?

111
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,960
This is anime, Lee.
Don't sweat the details.

112
00:07:57,993 --> 00:07:59,527
As a matter
of fact--

113
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,527
Why, yes! I
am a doctor!

114
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,760
I don't think
that's her...

115
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:06,460
Fine. If that's the
way they wanna play
it, I'm game!

116
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:12,493
Pardon me, but, is anyone
bald here? I could just
look but I've got an eyepatch.

117
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:14,093
Ooo! Bald!
Right here!

118
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,960
How are <i>you</i> bald?

119
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:19,727
I owe you both an apology.
We were in such a rush, I
could not get a real hawk
outfit...

120
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,993
Bald eagle was
all they had!
[groan]

121
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:26,127
Long story short,
your quest for
baldness has come
to an end!

122
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,093
I don't think
this is gonna
work!

123
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:31,027
Hey! We are not scrapping
this mission just yet!

124
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,893
I wasn't gonna bust
this one out, but it
looks like we've got
no choice!

125
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:41,527
Pardon me! It's weird
to ask, but I need to
know if someone's curves
are over 100 centimeters!

126
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,927
That would be me!

127
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,527
One-hundred-twenty
centimeters!

128
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,027
That is not
what he meant!

129
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,193
Outsmarted by
an eggplant!

130
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,027
I am not giving up!

131
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,793
Me again!

132
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:56,760
Is anyone here wearing a ton
of make-up in a desperate
attempt to pass off as something
they're clearly not?!

133
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:59,493
Me! I really caked
it on for the
snowlilne!

134
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:02,027
Are you for real!?

135
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,927
What is your deal!?
Stop being so vague!
Let em know exactly
who we want!

136
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,460
Okay, fine,
just calm down!

137
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:09,893
This one ring
any bells!?

138
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:13,160
Is there anyone here
who resorts to violence
at the drop of a hat...

139
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:16,727
<i>...has horrible luck with</i>
<i>gambling, has even worse</i>
<i>luck with the fellas...</i>

140
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,060
...is fighting a losing battle
against gravity and wrinkles
which is a big problem because
she's still single at 53!?

141
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:26,527
Grrrrr!
Gravity and
wrinkles?!

142
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,027
(Gambler)
Hold on, blondie!

143
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,793
If you're trying to
win and run, you and
me got a problem!

144
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:33,060
Watch out!

145
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,693
Got them all!

146
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,593
Good thing!
They looked
sharp...

147
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:41,627
L-Lady Tsunade!

148
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,527
Could you be
any more dumb!?

149
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,827
No way! All the kunai
we deflected still
found a way to land
right on her head!

150
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,793
Don't worry, milady!
I'll save you!

kunai out first...?

You are safe now!

I don't think we'll
be seeing <i>them</i> again!

[grunt]

156
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:06,093
Lady Tsunade!

157
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:08,627
All of the men we
kicked away somehow
landed on her head!

158
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,693
What are the
odds of that!?

159
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:12,493
You guys had better not
be doing this on purpose!

160

Meddling do-gooder
ninjas!

161
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:19,460
How dare you throw
kunai at Lady Tsunade!?
Your luck's run out!

162
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:21,193
Argh!

163
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,593
She's bald!!!

164
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,193
On the bright side, at
least she now looks like the
carving of her on Mt. Hokage

165
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:32,893
So I guess it
all worked out!

166
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:33,927
-Yeah! You're right!
-Yeah! You're right!

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,693
It did not all
work out!!!

168
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:36,560
Ahh!

169
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,193
[chuckle]
So she was the
one all along!

170
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:41,560
Now's our chance!

171

Lady... Tsunade.
I'm sorry!

183

All I wanted to do
was protect you, but
those two ninja almost
carried you off!

Whatever she says,
we deserve it.

off with me if you
hadn't stopped them
when you did...

00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:41,893
I'm proud of
you, Tenten.

191

She... she just
said she's proud
of me!

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,660
Neji, Guy, and
Lee as well.

193
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:51,927
You guys played an

[slurp] Heh heh!
You thought you could
out-stretch the likes
of me?

206
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:53,226
I'm chakra-ing out.

207
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:57,026
All right! That's three
million chakra and 2
chocolates!

208
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:59,226
You really cleaned
up, Lord Orochimaru.

209
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:03,926
Must've been the
snakeskin wallet I
bought off the late-
night shopping channel.

210
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,992
They said it would
bring good luck.

211
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:09,059
What are you going to
do with all that chakra
you just won, anyhow?

212
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:14,626
What do you think.
Kabuto? I'm going
to use it!

training coming up!

215
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,559
Hey! Where's Lee?

216
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:38,726
He's up there, repairing
the damage he did to
Lady Tsunade's likeness.

217
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,826
Uh, you think he's
gonna be okay on
his own?

218
00:13:43,026 --> 00:13:44,692
That's a pompadour!

219
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,826
Why does he think
that's even an
option!?

220
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:51,659
Hey, Lee! How come
you gave the Hokage
a pompadour!?

221
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:54,659
Oh! Sorry, Tenten!

222
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:57,659
I am trying my
best but I am
not good at this!

223
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:04,059
Too scary!

224
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,026
What're those curls!?

225
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,259
Bald again!

Why do you not
listen to my brain!

228
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,226
How are you so
bad at that!?

229
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,092
I think I've got
a fix for this!

230
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,126
If we plant trees for
her hair, changing her
'do will be a lot
easier, right..?

231
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,126
Beats carving!

232
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,759
Oh! I never would
have thought of
trees!

233
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,092
Why'd you make
her a samurai?!

234
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:37,659
She is right. This
will only work if we
plant a lot more of them.

235
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:39,826
Not gonna lie,
I kinda dig it.

236
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,026
You just gave
her an afro!?

237
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,226
Not a problem!

238
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:45,126
Just a bit off
the top, eh?!

239
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:49,092
Now she doesn't
even look like
a girl!

240
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,092
Leave her hair
alone already!

241
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:52,692
What's that?

242
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,759

the chakra I won in
the Tanzakugai--

going to use him to
wipe out the Hidden

00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:49,826
I'll handle him!

It looks as though there
is definitely going to be
a fight now!

00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:13,126
I don't go out of my way
to get into scrapes with
anyone, but if it's for the
sake of my friends, I'll do it!

Now we're right back

I guess it is
up to me!

Wait, you can do
summoning without
using ninjutsu?

turtle outfit doesn't
count! Not against a

278

It is true the snake
is larger than us, we
could not find a

zoom in until Tenten

If he can shoot us
at just the right
angle...

Forced perspective!?

282
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:01,059
It is easy on the
budget, and a
practical effect!

funnier?! It's so

Ah, yes. You see

Today I will sing

the flame of this
candle.

300
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,192
What does that
help with?

301
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:09,192
Both the candle and I
were slurped up by
this giant snake!

302
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,792
But I didn't blow it
out, so, there's that.

303
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:14,059
I still don't get
what that's
training for!

304
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:17,859
What do we
do now!?

305
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:20,859
Do not worry! I
am prepared for
this moment!

306
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:28,492
I will throw this
super-spicy curry
into Manda's mouth.
After that...

307
00:18:32,326 --> 00:18:34,792
Fly true, curry!

308
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:43,059
Uhh...

309
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:44,192
Is it working?

310
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:45,892
Byakugan!

311
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,692
[grunt] It's so
good... but it's
so hot!

312
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:52,959
Guy's eating
the curry himself!

313
00:18:52,992 --> 00:18:55,926
Ahhh!

314
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,559
This is no time
to be stuffing
your face, Guy!

315
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:02,826
Calm yourself, Naruto.

316
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:08,559
I developed a device in
case a day like this should
ever come along, and now is
the time to give it a try!

317
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:09,859
What kind of device?!

318
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:11,892
Dude, are you breaking
the fourth wall!?

319
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:15,126
What's wrong!?
Afraid of the big
bad snake, are we?

320
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:18,592
I dunno, I think we've
put the series leads in
too much peril...

321
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:22,792
Our chibi design is
better for comedy.
Well, live and learn.

322
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,926
We cannot keep
fighting it like
this!

323
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:28,959
Huh!? We were
running away! That
wasn't fighting!

324
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:31,826
Hey, isn't there an
extra face up there?

325
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:37,692
One, two, three,
four, five... six!

326
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,726
<i>(Neji)</i>
<i>Number six is</i>
<i>Guy Sensei!</i>

327
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:46,026
Goodness, you do not
think that this is the
hero he built to champion
our darkest hour!?

328
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,159
(Lee)
The giant robot...
Might Guygatron!

329
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:50,892
Might Guygatron?

330
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:53,759
Fight for great
justice, Might
Guygatron!

331
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,792
That's right!
Take him down!

332
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:02,526
Pitiful. It's just
a giant doll.

333
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,292
We'll use chakra
threads to make
it fight!

334
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:09,159
Focus, focus, focus!

335
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:14,826
Neji, you take
the right half...
Tenten, you take
the left half...

336
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:15,859
Now work together!

337
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:16,526
And you!?

338
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,926
Eyebrow duty!

339
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,126
That doesn't
help at all!

340
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:22,759
Is that piano
wire?

341
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,259
And now! The
final form!

342
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:24,992
Huh?
Huh?

343
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:29,526
Super Attack!
Robo-Sexy Jutsu!

344
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,859
It's showtime!

345
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:38,492
Tell me why this
giant robot is
wearing a bikini!?

346
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:41,659
Oh my!

347
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:44,759
What kind of idiot
do you ninja take
me for!?

348
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,592
Ow, ow ow!

349
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,659
Ooof! Oof! Ooof!

350
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:50,592
Grrrr!

351
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:55,959
You think yourself
a match for me?
[cocky laugh]

352
00:20:56,926 --> 00:21:02,692
Argh! Since the Robo-
Sexy Jutsu did not stop
him, there is only one
option left to us!

353
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:05,126
But, Lee..! That
move is so hazardous!

354
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:07,192
Will it even work
with a robot?

355
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,626
Just one way
to find out!

356
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:10,759
Right!

357
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:18,159
W-what? How are you
still on your feet?

358
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,092
Now! And a one...!

359
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:23,059
And a two..!

360
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:25,126
And a three!!!

361
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:28,926
Now you die!

362
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,059
Shimura Style, Wow!

363
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,692
Curses! Foiled
again!

364
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:41,692
It's better this
way, really.

365
