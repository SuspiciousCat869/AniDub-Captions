1
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:56,424
<i>Today we find ourselves</i>
<i>in the Hidden Sand</i>
<i>Village, far from the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf.</i>

2
00:01:56,457 --> 00:02:01,857
<i>There are other ninja</i>
<i>villages, too, but the</i>
<i>Leaf and the Sand are</i>
<i>especially close allies.</i>

3
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:07,691
<i>That's why Rock Lee and</i>
<i>his team are on their way</i>
<i>to the Hidden Sand right</i>
<i>now for a mission.</i>

4
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:10,491
We should reach the
village any minute now.

5
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:16,757
Huh? What's
that cloud?

6
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:20,924
Ruuuuuun!

7
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:41,591
<i>I want to be friends with</i>
<i>Gaara!</i>

8
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:47,224
Oh, it's just you. I
thought you were enemy
shinobi.

9
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:50,391
<i>In case you've been</i>
<i>living under a rock, this</i>
<i>is Gaara.</i>

10
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:53,791
<i>He's the</i>
<i>Kazekage, or leader,</i>
<i>of the Hidden Sand.</i>

11
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,624
<i>Gaara and Lee once met on</i>
<i>the field of battle.</i>

12
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:59,524
Lee risked his safety to
use a forbidden jutsu,

13
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:02,857
<i>but he still lost and</i>
<i>got really hurt in the</i>
<i>process.</i>

14
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,657
Gaara. Hey! How nice
to see you again!

15
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:09,424
I think he can hear
your teeth chattering.

16
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:12,557
<i>Yes, I may have lost when</i>
<i>we fought that one time,</i>

17
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:16,657
but I have been
practicing a lot. Victory
is mine next time...

18
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:19,291
Anyway...

19
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,724
He ignored me!

20
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:24,824
I don't think he sees
you as a worthy opponent,
Lee.

21
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:27,357
He is Kazekage, after
all.

22
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,924
Don't get down
about it.

23
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,724
I guess I should tell
you why you're here.

24
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:41,191
Rumor has it rogue
ninjas have slipped
into the village.

25
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:43,424
I want you to route
these intruders out.

26
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:47,357
Indeed. You can count on
us, Gaara.

27
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:52,457
Wait, is Lee harboring a
grudge? I mean, Gaara did
hurt him pretty bad back
then,

28
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:54,224
and blew him
off today.

29
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:56,957
Lee's been staring at
him the whole time we've
been here.

30
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,191
[puckering]

31
00:03:58,224 --> 00:03:59,757
Whoa, Lee! Back
it up!

32
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,924
Get your ugly mug away
from Gaara!

33
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:03,391
Ahhhh!

34
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:05,124
Temari! Kankuro!

35
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:10,424
<i>These are Gaara's older</i>
<i>sister and brother, Temari</i>
<i>and Kankuro.</i>

36
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,257
Maybe you know them,
but maybe not.

37
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,457
No funny stuff near
the Kazekage.

38
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:16,124
Back off.

39
00:04:16,157 --> 00:04:20,857
Why are you mad at me?!
Your brother was the one
swooping in to steal my
first kiss!

40
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,624
That's enough!

41
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:26,791
What has gotten into you
today?! Tell Gaara
you're sorry, Lee!

42
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:29,224
Take heart. I will say
sorry with you.

43
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:30,257
Right.

44
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,357
My bad!

45
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,657
Yeah, what he said!

46
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:36,324
Those don't count! Those
were the worst apologies
I've ever heard!

47
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:38,324
Neither of you meant
a single word of it!

48
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:40,624
What the heck is
going on with Lee
today?

49
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:43,357
Indeed. He's really
pushing people's
buttons.

50
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,491
This isn't a good day
for him to get weird
on us.

51
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:49,991
Don't worry. Sensei's
got a solution.

52
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,657
<i>Solution?</i>

53
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:58,957
<i>Welcome to the 138th</i>
<i>Annual Leaf vs. Sand</i>
<i>Alliance-Team Building</i>
<i>Barbecue Cook-Off, and</i>

54
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,891
<i>more! Thanks for coming,</i>
<i>everybody!</i>

55
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:03,924
Why are we doing this,
again?

56
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:05,224
Don't you know?

57
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:06,524
No idea.

58
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,691
<i>Barbecues are a summer</i>
<i>tradition! They're a</i>
<i>chance for young people</i>
<i>to come together,</i>

59
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:15,591
<i>overcook some low-grade</i>
<i>beef, and frolic along</i>
<i>the riverbank!</i>

60
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:19,224
Is that supposed to be
fun? 'Cause I'm not
feeling it.

61
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:24,557
<i>But wait, there's more!</i>
<i>Barbecues are also an</i>
<i>arena where dads can earn</i>
<i>the respect of their</i>

62
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,391
<i>wives and kids with</i>
<i>their fearless grilling</i>
<i>skills!</i>

63
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:31,557
The way you describe
barbecues doesn't make
me wanna go to one!

64
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:35,791
<i>The point is...</i>
<i>Barbecues give folks who</i>
<i>don't have a ton in</i>
<i>common, and don't</i>

65
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:39,624
particularly like each
other the chance to get
along for a change!

66
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:44,791
I see. If all goes well,
Lee and Gaara will be
able to clear the air
between them.

67
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:46,391
Will you lend
a hand?

68
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:47,591
Do we have a choice?

69
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:49,657
And you're sure this is
gonna work?

70
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:52,624
Absolutely! I'm a
master of the grill!

71
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:56,791
Okay, everyone! The food
is ready!

72
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,191
Something's half-baked,
and it's not the cuts
of meat.

73
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:05,224
Lee, Gaara! Check out
these fire-sticks!
Crazy, huh?!

74
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:08,791
I give it about a
minute before he burns
himself with one of those.

75
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:15,657
Lee! Gaara! Look at that
roast pig! You know you
want a piece! What are
you waiting for?!

76
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:17,857
He's going way faster
than the pig.

77
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:21,791
I think we know where
the real ham is here and
it's not in the spit.

78
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:25,224
No change yet.

79
00:06:25,257 --> 00:06:29,491
Usually, he'd be up for
whatever foolishness Guy
Sensei pulled.

80
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:34,757
Pig didn't work.
Obviously this is bad.
Let's go bigger!

81
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:41,191
<i>Let's dance! Kick up</i>
<i>your heels and trip the</i>
<i>light fantastic! Shake</i>
<i>it, you guys!</i>

82
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:44,224
So we're ditching the
barbecue for a festival?!

83
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:47,857
This is not the time for
a dance number!

84
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:48,957
Why not?

85
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,224
How's their village
still standing?

86
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:52,291
Oh, man.

87
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:53,691
[screaming]

88
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:54,591
Huh?

89
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:57,157
[grunting]

90
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:01,957
[snickering]
That's the last of 'em.
Time to tear this dumb
village up!

91
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:03,791
[chuckling]

92
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,791
<i>Here they come!</i>

93
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:12,324
You're a rogue ninja
attacking my village?

94
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:16,291
When we fight I will
defeat far more of these
villains than you!

95
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:19,324
He's still hung up on
Gaara at a time like
this?!

96
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:21,224
<i>This time, I shall win!</i>

97
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,791
Uh, Lee?! What are you
doing?!

98
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:29,724
Look, everybody! I am
faster than his sand!
[laughing]

99
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:32,157
Maybe this could wait
'til later?!

100
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:36,591
[grunting]

101
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:37,657
What's his problem?

102
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,857
'Bout to get worse!

103
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,391
Sand Coffin!

104
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:44,191
I can't move.

105
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,791
That is not so hard!

106
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:46,724
[gasping]

107
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:50,957
Sand Squeeze!

108
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,824
Why do you keep doing
that thing?!

109
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:54,324
Sand Shower!

110
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:55,898
[grunting]

111
00:07:55,898 --> 00:07:57,324
Damn it!

112
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:58,591
Too easy!

113
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,291
Sweat Shower!

114
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:01,724
Stop it! That's
disgusting!

115
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:04,424
Eww! Yuck! That's
gross! Blech!

116
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:07,224
Everyone feels better
after a good, honest
sweat!

117
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:10,591
Only if it's their own
sweat! Not someone
else's!

118
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:15,624
I can't endanger the village
with big moves. I'll have
to just fight with the sand
in my gourd.

119
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,857
That's the spirit,
Lee! You can do it!

120
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:20,557
[struggling]

121
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:23,624
Gaara's sand attack
accidentally hit Lee!

122
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:26,291
[groaning]

123
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:30,557
Huh? Even though he
totally missed, he's so
calm about it!

124
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,357
Uh... sorry.

125
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:37,657
I take it back! He's
sweating like crazy! It's
coming right through his
sand armor!

126
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:40,824
Please. It is nothing
more than a scratch.

127
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:43,524
Hey! Who wrapped it?!

128
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,824
You should fall back. You
can't fight like that.

129
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,157
No...

130
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,257
What the?

131
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,791
Tell me. Why are
you doing this?

132
00:08:54,824 --> 00:09:00,591
Yeah, Lee. What do you
keep trying to one-up
Gaara for? You resent him
that much?

133
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:05,857
Tenten. I do not resent
Gaara. That is not what
this is.

134
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:06,891
Huh?

135
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:15,691
I got hurt so badly
during my match with
Gaara, I feared my days
as a ninja were over.

136
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,191
But then...

137
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:24,324
Giving up on your dreams
hurts worse than any
injury you can get.

138
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,724
Have the operation!

139
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:33,557
I was brought back for
the sake of following my
dream.

140
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:40,291
I do not want to lose to
Gaara. Not because I resent
him, but to follow through
with my ninja way!

141
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:43,791
If you work hard enough,
you can defeat even a
natural.

142
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,991
That is why I
cannot stand down!

143
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:48,857
<i>So that's his angle.</i>

144
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:57,891
I talk a big game, but in
all the time I have been
thinking about it, I have
never come up with a way

145
00:09:57,924 --> 00:10:01,857
to surpass Gaara. Alas,
I may have to give up...

146
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:03,991
<i>Oh, Lee.</i>

147
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:08,391
I--I'm sorry I mistook
your resolve for simple

Guy Sensei.

149
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:14,957
I see my star pupil
grabbing life by the
horns. Oh, to be young
again!

150
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:17,791
What verve! An
inspiration to us all!

151
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:20,957
I'm definitely not
inspired by that outfit!

152
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:22,357
Guy Sensei!

153
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,757
I get it! Yes, of course!

154
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,424
Sand Coffin!

155
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,457
Leaf Sandstorm!

156
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:38,691
He took all the sand for
his attack!

157
00:10:38,724 --> 00:10:44,924
[panicking]

158
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:47,824
At long last, Lee, you
are above Gaara!

159
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:48,891
You're right
about that!

160
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:51,757
He's definitely above
him right now!

161
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:58,524
<i>I thank the Hidden Leaf</i>
<i>for its aid.</i>

162
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:04,424
Honestly, we could not
have done it without you,
Gaara. I mean it when I
say you really are amazing!

163
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:10,591
That said, I made a vow
during the nice-guy pose.
So I will surpass you through
hard work eventually!

164
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:12,791
Someday, we shall fight
again!

165
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:17,557
All right. You got it.
It's a deal.

166
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:27,524
It is a deal, he
said! I will wait for
you forever, Gaara!

167
00:11:27,557 --> 00:11:31,691
[grunting]

168

<i>Stop crying on me!</i>

169
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:37,191
Whoa!!!

170
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,657
What's wrong with
you, Lee?!

171
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:46,357
<i>The line between rival</i>
<i>and creeper can be cloudy.</i>
<i>But Rock Lee did get a little</i>
<i>closer to Gaara today.</i>

172
00:11:58,648 --> 00:12:02,581
<i>One day while passing</i>
<i>through the mountains on</i>
<i>the way home from a</i>

173
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:04,881
Someone's coming this
way.

174
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:08,648
Make sure you greet
him properly. It's
mountaineering
etiquette.

175
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:09,948
In that case...

176
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:12,548
I am all
set, baby!

177
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,648
My card and cellphone are
at the ready!

178
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:16,948
I didn't say social
climber, Lee!

179
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:20,314
Baby, you've gotta
network if you wanna be
the next big thing!

180
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:23,281
In the business world,
it's all about who you
know!

181
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:25,948
All I wanted you to do
was say hi to him!

182
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,348
What?!

183
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,014
Hello there!

184
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,381
[screaming]

185
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:33,314
Huh?

186
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:42,981
<i>The Rock Lee Impostor</i>
<i>Strikes!</i>

187
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,248
<i>Huh?</i>

188
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,414
So he ran when he saw
Lee?

189
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,414
Uh-huh.

190
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:51,481
Also...

191
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:54,748
[panicking]

192
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:59,448
<i>We passed through a town</i>

<i>I have always thought</i>

194
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:07,881
They saw a shady-looking
dude go by, and got all
freaked out.

195
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:13,414
I am not shady in the
slightest, Naruto. I
have absolutely nothing
to hide!

196
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:17,814
You've got stuff to hide,
all right. And I don't think
that leaf is doing the best
job of it!

197
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,981
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

198
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:21,514
I figured it out.

199
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:22,781
An impostor?

200
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:25,681
Yes. Exactly.

201
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:31,281
Apparently, someone who
looks exactly like Lee
has been running amok,
doing terrible things to

202
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:32,348
the townsfolk.

203
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:34,881
<i>Eh, I wouldn't</i>
<i>call them terrible...</i>

204
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,681
<i>They're more like</i>
<i>dumb grade-school</i>
<i>pranks, really.</i>

205
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:41,314
But why go around
pretending to be
Bushy-Brows?

206
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:43,481
Of course! He's a
copycat.

207
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:44,981
For real?

208
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:48,414
Now that Rock Lee and
his Ninja pals have started
to capture a market share,

209
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:50,681
copycats are sure to
come out of the woodwork.

210
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:52,348
<i>So it's a PR move?!</i>

211
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:57,448
That is a slap in the
face to our staff! I do
not roll out of bed
looking like this!

212
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,248
People have to draw
this perfect hair!

213
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:00,881
Hair is not the point,
Lee!

214
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:06,481
I am going to give this
fake a piece of my mind.

215
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:09,348
I think I'm gonna give
him a piece of my fist.

216
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:11,348
Thank you for helping us.

217
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:15,748
This fake could be
tougher to find than
we're giving him credit
for... This calls for a

218
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:21,581
lot of concentration.
From what I've learned,
this guy is like Lee in
every single way.

219
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:24,481
Every single way, huh?

220
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:25,681
Just leave it to me!

221
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:26,514
Huh?!

222
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:29,948
<i>Ohhh noooo!</i>

223
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,914
Get back here, lady!

224
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:35,514
Nooooo!

225
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:40,348
Why am I always put
in this position?

226
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,848
Please! Someone! Anyone!
Help!

227
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,381
The boss wants you for
his girlfriend,
cutie-pie!

228
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:49,581
Now, let's see what
you're hiding under
that sash!

229
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:51,448
Oh, you bad man!

230
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:58,281
I get it! If this faker
is like you in every way,
he'll have to rescue
Neji. Good plan, Naruto!

231
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,981
I guess it's
tickle-time 'til
someone stops me!

232
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,914
Is that really
necessary?

233
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:06,681
That is enough of that,
you ruffian!

234
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:09,748
Oh, good! Lee has
come to save her!

235
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:14,481
My name is Rock Lee! It
is true I have no
ninjutsu at my command,

236
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,014
but I can still
defend the weak!

237
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,681
You weren't supposed to
take the bait, you
doofus!

238
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:24,314
I was drawn in by their
amazing acting! Please,
forgive me!

239
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,981
You totally blew your
cover!

240
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,548
Telling me that blew your
cover.

241
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,281
Don't talk back to me!

242
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:30,914
Okay.

243
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:33,281
Think we should help him?

244
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:36,814
That is enough of you,
you ruffian!

245
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:38,281
Huh?

246
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:40,614
Whoa, it's the fake!

247
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:45,614
My name is Sock Lee! It
is true, I have no
ninjutsu at my command,

248
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:48,248
but I can still
defend the weak!

249
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,281
The face is totally
wrong! And did he just
call himself Sock Lee?!

250
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:57,381
Whoa! I'm face-to-face
with the real thing here!
You're mad about the
whole copycat thing, huh!

251
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,681
That's right! You're ruining
Lee's reputation, you know.

252
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:03,948
That said, you look
nothing alike, so maybe
we can just--

253
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:06,248
He really is the spitting
image, huh!

254
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:07,348
Unbelievable!

255
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:10,248
You don't need byakugan
to see they're not the
same!

256
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,314
Hm?

257
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:17,981
Who put a mirror in front
of me?

258
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:21,514
Snap out of it, Lee! This
guy looks nothing like
yoooou!

259
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,648
Listen up! This fakery
has to stop!

260
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:29,714
Well, if that's the
case, time for some
backup!

261
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:32,414
Reji! Zenzen, now!

262
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:35,348
You're kidding me!

263
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:37,481
[giggling]

264
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:40,514
Not even close!

265
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:43,514
Hey, Boss-man, can you
cover me for a sec?

266
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:46,481
Seriously? You're making
a Reji-register joke?!

267
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,914
She doesn't look
anything like you,
Tenten!

268
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:49,981
Then stop staring.

269
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:52,914
So, I guess Zenzen is
banking on a similar name.

270
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:55,914
These two should have put
more into their
disguises!

271
00:16:55,948 --> 00:17:01,548
Like here. These are way
too big. And this part.
This is too curvy.

272
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:04,014
Why do you have to point
everything out?!

273
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:08,014
Your teamwork is pretty
bad. Who can tell the
real from the fake?

274
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:11,981
First we'll beat you,
then we'll take your
reputations away.

275
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,381
Oh, no you don't.

276
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:15,614
In that case, let
us begin.

277
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:18,448
We're gonna put the
hurt on you four!

278
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:21,348
Copycat or not, no one
talks like that anymore!

279
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,814
Face the wrath of my
secret move!

280
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:24,814
Here we go, Lee.

281
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:27,581
I'll bet the two of you
use the same attacks!

282
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:36,281
[shrieking]

283
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:38,914
Lee doesn't have
anything like that
up his sleeve!

284
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:41,648
It's like something from
an old school anime!

285
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,381
[grunting]

286

<i>Lee!</i>

287
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:44,914
Not good.

288
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:46,581
Get up and
attack him!

289
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:50,781
Hit this copycat with
your best stuff, Lee! And
I'm sure you'll come out
victorious!

290
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:55,948
All right, then! Let us
see what you do with...
Extending punch!

291
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:57,514
[struggling]

292
00:17:57,548 --> 00:18:00,281
A, that's not your
move. B, there was no
extension!

293
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:03,881
Hey, Boss... I put my
hair down. Do I look
like him?

294
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:05,881
That is not what we're
talking about!

295
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:07,781
Enough with the
reactions already...

296
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:09,848
Don't you tell
me to be calm!

297
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,814
Time to end this! Shimura
Death Strike!

298
00:18:13,848 --> 00:18:15,414
[winding up]

299
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:16,881
[grunting]

300
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:18,748
How do ya like that?!

301
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:20,448
That had to hurt!

302
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:23,748
Yeah, no kidding! Even
watching that was
painful!

303
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:24,814
[grunting]

304
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,548
Victory is mine!

305
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:29,981
I cannot let him win!
What do I do?

306
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:31,448
<i>What's wrong with</i>
<i>you, Lee?!</i>

307
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:32,481
[groaning]

308
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:34,348
You can't lose to this
guy!

309
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,514
You're the real one,
after all!

310
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,814
But, Tenten...! Neji...!

311
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:44,048
Focus on the bond you
have with your teammates!
That's something the
faker doesn't have!

312
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,881
My bond with Tenten and
Neji. Of course!

313
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:54,248
[struggling]

314
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:55,848
I need toilet paper!

315
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:58,748
Tools, T.P. Summoning
Jutsu!

316
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,448
[gasping]

317
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,414
That enough for the time
being?

318
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:05,314
<i>Well?</i>

319
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:11,981
How come when you think
of the bond you have with
us you think of the
bathroom?!

320
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:18,814
Because when life
caught me with my pants
down, you and Neji both
had my... my backside!

321
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:21,814
That bond is on thing
thing of mine you
cannot fake!

322
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:23,614
Tough talk, two-ply!

323
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,414
Fine. Have it your way.

324
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,514
[screaming]

325
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:33,348
[grunting]

326
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:33,842
What?!

327
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:34,448
The?!

328
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:35,348
Heck?!

329
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:38,414
"Often Imitated, Never
Duplicated!"

330
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:44,981
Asakujaku
featuring Rock Lee!
Morning Chicken!

331
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:46,748
[screaming]

332
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:48,648
[firing]

333
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:49,714
[gasping]

334
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,014
Bravo!

335
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:52,648
Thank you, Tenten!

336
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:54,981
Too weird, too much!

337
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:59,481
I couldn't beat the
real Rock Lee. So much
for my dream, I guess.

338
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:00,948
I'll never be a ninja.

339
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:02,548
Whaddya mean?

340
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:08,414
I've wanted to be a
ninja since, like,
forever, but I can't
use ninjutsu at all.

341
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:12,914
Then one day, I heard
about Rock Lee. He
can't use ninjutsu
either, but he's still

342
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:15,848
out there giving it his
best shot.

343
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:21,881
But I didn't have
friends to train with, or
a sensei to guide me, so
it all kinda fell apart.

344
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:26,981
I got jealous, you
know? Started trollin'
everybody.

345
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:29,314
All this stems
from that?

346
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:34,414
I figured I needed
teammates, so I hired
Reji and Zenzen for nine
bucks.

347
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:36,314
Hey Boss, are you firing
us?

348
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:37,981
You better
pay me, okay?

349
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:42,848
There was a time when
I thought being a good
ninja was all about the
external stuff.

350
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:46,581
Havin' a good team
at your back. That's
the key.

351
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,848
I'm gonna learn from
this and keep trying my
hardest!

352
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:55,348
Causing trouble in
someone else's name is bad
form, but copying can be
a good way to learn.

353
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:57,948
Lee's a good guy, so
just do what he would do.

354
00:20:57,981 --> 00:21:02,648
Neither of you can use
ninjutsu, so you're kind
of in the same boat.

355
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:05,848
You are wrong. Mr.
Impostor has had it
tougher.

356
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:07,514
Huh?

357
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:11,448
I have had friends to
help me along the way, but
Mr. Impostor has walked
alone.

358
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:15,614
In that sense, you
are stronger than I
am, Mr. Impostor.

359
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:17,481
Aw, Mr. Real
Lee.

360
00:21:17,514 --> 00:21:19,981
Therefore, you can
use my name!

361
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:23,314
You are not giving away
your name, Lee! Forget
about it!

362
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,014
We're not changing the
title of the show this
far into it!

363
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:30,714
You can call yourself the
New Rock Lee. I will be
known as Classic Rock
Lee.

364
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,448
Oh no, I just couldn't.

365
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:33,614
It is fine, really.

366
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:35,481
Please, no, you're far
too kind.

367
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:37,014
<i>From one Rock Lee to</i>
<i>another, I insist!</i>

368
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:40,748
I couldn't possibly
impose like that! Oh, no
no no no!

369
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:42,614
That's enooough!

370
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:44,514
[grunting]

371
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:47,348
That is enough of that,
you violent little girl!

372
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:48,814
What the--?

373
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:50,314
[gasping]

374
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:56,448
Greetings! My name is Pac
Lee! It is true I have no
ninjutsu at my command,

375
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,581
but I can still
defend the weak!

376
00:21:58,614 --> 00:21:59,781
[groaning]

377
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:01,881
Is this trending
now or something?

378
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:04,681
Pac Lee is gonna put the
hurt on you four!

379
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:07,681
[laughing]

380
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:50,711
Next week's titles are,
"A Hot Night for a
Chilling Tale" and

381
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:53,844
"The Hokage's Tears
Aren't for Decoration".

382
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:58,211
<i>A chilling tale, huh?</i>
<i>Actually, ever since the</i>
<i>show started,</i>

383
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:01,644
<i>I have felt as though</i>
<i>there is someone behind</i>
<i>me. Always watching.</i>

384
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:03,678
Me, too. It gives me the
creeps.

385
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:06,211
<i>Maybe there is a ghost</i>
<i>haunting us even now!</i>

386
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,878
He's watching every
move we make with his
dead eyes!!

387
00:24:08,911 --> 00:24:11,178
<i>I am so afraid, Neji!</i>

388
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:13,578
<i>Um, that's just Yamato</i>
<i>Sensei.</i>
