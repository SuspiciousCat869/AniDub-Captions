1
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:56,266
<i>This structure is the</i>
<i>Leaf Village's main</i>
<i>government building. It</i>
<i>is in here that Fifth</i>

2
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,866
<i>Hokage, Tsunade, does most</i>
<i>of her work.</i>

3
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,966
Hokage...

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,666
What is your opinion on
this matter?

5
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,600
I feel there's only one
way to handle this.

6
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:10,933
We'll have to overcome
it with hot-blooded
energy!

7
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:12,566
Whaaat?

8
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,866
<i>Guy Sensei is</i>
<i>the new Hokage.</i>

9
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:27,333
Wha--? Excuse me, you
said Guy Sensei is the
new Hokage?

10
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:29,233
How did such a thing
happen?

11
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,833
It's an interim
appointment!

12
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,633
Interim?

13
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,933
Lady Tsunade had to go on
a long international
trip, and she asked Guy
Sensei if he would be

14
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,900
willing to fill in as
Interim Hokage until
she gets back.

15
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:43,366
Would you please keep
things running smoothly
while I'm gone.

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,766
I understand the need,
but why Guy Sensei, of
all people?

17
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Kakashi Sensei and
Shikamaru's father are
off on missions. Guy
Sensei was the only

18
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,966
person at their level who
was free to fill in.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,366
<i>He's always free.</i>

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,500
What a great choice! I
know he is going to be
able to handle it.

21
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,733
And we must do everything
in our power to help him
out!

22
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,633
Idiot! Idiot!

23
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,333
Got it! You three want to
help me, is that right?

24
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,133
Anything at all, Sensei!

25
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:16,466
There's no telling what
kind of craziness Guy
Sensei will get into. And
Lady Tsunade will be

26
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,600
furious if anything
happens while she's
gone.

27
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:23,466
I am just so moved by
this! To think that our
Guy Sensei is the fill-in
Hokage!

28
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,866
You little fool! I
am no longer Guy Sensei,
I am the Guykage!

29
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,666
Yes! I understand
completely!

30
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,866
Stop making up weird
titles for yourself!

31
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,533
Behold this monument,
Lord Guykage!

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,500
Marvel at the beauty of
the great stone faces!

33
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,500
How did all the faces up
there become Guy Sensei?!

34
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,833
<i>I had Captain Yamato</i>
<i>change them with his</i>
<i>wood-style techniques!</i>

35
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:50,300
Stop dragging innocent
people into your schemes!

36
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,866
Huh? What's this
you've brought me?

37
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,500
These are reports sent
directly to the Guykage.
It is your job to review
them.

38
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:01,833
Alright, let's see...
This one says morale has
been down among our
ninjas shinobi lately.

39
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:06,566
<i>Maybe Guy Sensei will</i>
<i>actually bear down and do</i>
<i>the Hokage's job</i>
<i>properly.</i>

40
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Huh?

41
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:08,500
These stupid fools!

42
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:09,766
What's wrong?!

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,433
It's ridiculous!

44
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:14,966
How am I supposed to
understand a problem from
one lousy piece of
paper?!

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,566
Well first, you'd have
to read it through
completely.

46
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,966
We can't stand by and
let our troubled ninjas
suffer! Let's go, Lee!

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,833
Yes sir, Guykage, sir!

48
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,866
<i>Wait, where do you two</i>
<i>think you're going?!</i>

49
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,633
[charging forward]

50
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,900
Hey, ya Pops! One big
order of ramen, please!

51
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,000
Here! Enjoy!

52
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,966
Hey! That was pretty
quick!

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Wait a minute. What the
heck is this?

54
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:39,266
<i>Curried ramen.</i>

55
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,966
Huh?

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
[chuckling]

57
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,700
Bushier Brow
Sensei?

58
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,600
It's my latest
order as Hokage.

59
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:48,966
When you're feeling
down, nothing can pick
you up quite like curry.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,433
I heard morale was down,
so I ordered everyone to
start making curry
dishes!

61
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:56,666
Excuse me? Did you just
say that you're the Hokage?

62
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,566
Guykage to you.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,433
I have to tell you, this
curry is fantastic!

64
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:06,800
Well it had better be.
Take a look... I went out
and hired a curry expert!

65
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,500
I make the best!

66
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:09,666
Huh?!

67
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,833
Where did this guy come
from?

68
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:15,666
Get over yourself,
Naruto, and eat already.

69
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,666
Huh?

70
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,433
Choji?

71
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:22,966
It's amazing. The curry
ramen is out of this
world! I'm gonna get so
fat eating this.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,500
The truth is, the BBQ
place only had curried
beef today..

73
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:30,866
And at the Yamanaka
Flower Shop, they only
had curried tulips!

74
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,633
You're kidding! They're
going that far with it?!

75
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,833
So let me see... As long
as I'm here, what else
is it I can do for our
shinobi?

76
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,500
You mean you're not
done?!

77
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:40,566
Got it!

78
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,833
Idiot! Idiot!

79
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:48,933
What a great idea! I'll
have all our shinobi wear
my beloved unisuit!

80
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:50,533
Ahhh!

81
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:54,533
It is a great idea! They
are sporty, yet
functional!

82
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,333
Excuse me? Naruto?

83
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,533
You mean they got you,
too, Sai?!

84
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:03,333
Hey! You're not a
shinobi! You're the
last one who should be
wearing that!

85
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:06,333
Ahhhh! Everyone's
wearing them now!

86
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,933
Time for the Hokage's
next order!

87
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:12,933
When greeting another
fellow shinobi, you must
give them a hot-blooded
hug!

88
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,833
This will strengthen the
relationships between
shinobi!

89
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,400
Whaat?

90
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:20,833
Listen, guys! In spite of
what he's saying, you really
don't need to do this!

91
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:25,633
These are your Hokage's
orders, Naruto! When you
meet a fellow shinobi,
you give them a hug!

92
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,966
What?! I'm telling you,
this is nuts!

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,933
Um... Naruto?

94
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,200
Huh?

95
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,466
Well, I guess it can't
be helped. It's the
Hokage's orders.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,766
Huh?

97
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know what's
happening around here.
Where did Lee and Guy
Sensei run off to?

98
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,833
I have no idea.

99
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:43,800
Hm?

100
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:47,333
Sorry about all this,
Hinata.

101
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,666
Nuh- Naruto...

102
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:50,433
[fainting]

103
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:52,233
Are you alright?!

104
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:53,766
What's happening here?!

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,766
I don't understand! I
didn't do anything!
Hinata?!

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,866
Naruto!

107
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,033
Huh--? Neji!

108
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:03,366
She's passed out! What
exactly is it that you
did to her?!

109
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,333
It wasn't me! It was
the Hokage who ordered---

110
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,233
[screaming]

111
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:09,700
Wow!

112
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,933
Guy Sensei, you are the
best Hokage I have ever
seen!

113
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,966
Everyone's morale
should be through the
roof by now!

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,833
[chuckling]

115
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:17,833
[angry muttering]

116
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,333
Huh?

117
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:23,333
This is nuts! We can't
stomach any more of Guy
Sensei being the Hokage!

118
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:28,266
Captain Yamato! If you do
nothing else, at least
fix Mount Hokage!

119
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,400
They're revolting
against Guykage!

120
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,400
Do not worry. I will take
care of this.

121
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:33,500
Lee?!

122
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:40,300
I am the Guykage's
right-hand man. I will be
able to put down this
little rebellion!

123
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,433
Hm?

124
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:44,400
Please, everyone! It is
important that you calm
down.

125
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,600
I hear your complaints.
Let us talk this out...

126
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,600
Wow! Lee's actually
being serious for a
change!

127
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,000
You may speak
to my fist!

128
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,600
Why am I not surprised?!

129
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:56,833
We will fight
head-to-head and settle
things, like the true
ninja that we are!

130
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:59,333
This is your idea of a
peaceful settlement?!

131
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:00,933
Fine! I accept your
challenge!

132
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:05,966
But I want to go first!
Human Boulder!

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,533
Whoa!

134
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,900
Hey! That always works!

135
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:10,766
Uh!

136
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:13,500
Oh!

137
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,900
Okay, Hinata, let's
get moving!

138
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:17,500
Mm! Ready!

139
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:18,200
[grunting]

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,500
[groaning]

141
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,866
Huh?

142
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:26,733
Wait a minute... What's
happened to everybody?

143
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,800
I get the feeling
of power...

144
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,800
... like I have a lot more
energy than normal!

145
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:37,966
That's it! All that
curry I ate has given me
tons of power! That's the
only possible explanation!

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,866
I think my Taijutsu
has gone up a level!

147
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,400
Of course! I can move a
lot more freely in these
tights!

148
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,833
It actually
makes sense!

149
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:50,633
It is unexpected, but
Naruto and I are actually
working well together!

150
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,233
I see it now! That little
hug helped me get used to
being near him!

151
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,000
That move has helped me
open my eyes!

152
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,333
What?!

153
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:58,633
[groaning]

154
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,866
I thought Bushier Brow
Sensei Hokage's orders
were just his usual

155
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,566
random craziness. But it
turns out they all had a
point!

156
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,233
We didn't understand
what it was! And so we--

157
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:13,733
Guy Sensei... We can see
now that you really cared
about everyone so much!

158
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:16,733
Is that honestly
true... Guy Sensei?

159
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,033
Eh?

160
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:22,500
<i>Oh for heaven's sake!</i>
<i>This idiot didn't give</i>
<i>it any thought at all!</i>

161
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,966
<i>I can't believe it!</i>
<i>Even Captain Yamato is</i>
<i>affected!</i>

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
<i>Now what?!</i>

163
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:35,700
<i>Oh no! There are so many</i>
<i>faces of Guy Sensei</i>
<i>appearing, it's getting</i>
<i>freaky!</i>

164
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:38,833
Huh?!

165
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:42,633
What the heck?!

166
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,200
The Guy Sensei faces are
all starting to fall on
the village!

167
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:49,733
What are we gonna do?!
Everything will be
destroyed!

168
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,200
Now don't panic!

169
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:54,666
We must all band together
and combine our powers to
protect the village!

170
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,666
Yes, Lord Guykage, sir!

171
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,466
Move out!

172
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,666
Hyaaaaah!

173
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,633
Activating Special
Dynamic...

174
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,533
... Entry Attack!

175
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,533
They're all in perfect
harmony?!

176
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:10,966
We did it! We broke up
every boulder!

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,966
Great job,
Lord Guykage!

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,966
I apologize, Bushier
Brow Sensei!

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,833
You really are
incredible, Guy Sensei!

180
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,933
Congratulations,
Guykage!

181
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,000
Hmm!

182
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,400
Hooray, Guykageee!

183
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,500
You guys are the best!

184
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:30,400
Alright! Night's coming
on! Let's finish out
the day by running 5000

185
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,966
laps around the
village on our hands!

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,866
<i>Yes sir, Guykage, sir!</i>

187
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,966
<i>All you people need to</i>
<i>snap out of it!</i>

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,366
Idiot! Idiot!

189
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:45,333
[sighing]
Thank goodness we're
finally home.

190
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:48,633
I hope everything went
smoothly while we were
gone.

191
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,600
Huh?!

192
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,466
What's happening here?!

193
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,466
Nothing. We've almost
completed 5000 laps.

194
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,633
It is a motivational
exercise that Lord
Guykage was able to
come up with!

195
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,966
Don't give up now,
everyone! We're almost
there!

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,533
What the heck
are you doing?!

197
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:11,033
I'm building up their
stamina, so they can face
any enemy, no matter who!

198
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,766
[gasping]

199
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,866
You're overdoing it
again! You fool!

200
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:22,733
I guess Guy Sensei just
wasn't cut out to be
the Hokage.

201
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,033
That may be true.

202
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:31,800
The bottom line is this.
When examining his
record, you can see that
he is not as cool, calm,

203
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:37,300
and collected as the
previous Hokages. He is
way too hot-blooded to be
a Hokage, and the reason

204
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,366
is simple. He cannot
ignore the sight of
people suffering right
in front of him.

205
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:44,700
But that is also the
reason why...

206
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:51,500
... he is my hero! And
when you get right down
to it, I think he is
every bit as cool as any

207
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,366
Hokage who has ever been!

208
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:55,366
<i>[chatting]</i>

209
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,866
[growling]
Welcome to the
restaurant!

210
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,666
[growling]

211
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,200
Well, the dishes are
back to normal,

212
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:06,266
but the ambiance around
here has really changed a
lot, and not for the better.

213
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:21,733
<i>Let me ask. Do you have a</i>
<i>particular word or phrase</i>
<i>you say a lot?</i>

214
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:23,466
Okay!

215
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:27,233
Today's mission is
going to be a patrol
outside the village.
According to what Guy

216
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:30,199
Sensei told us, there
are rogue ninjas roaming
around,

217
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,366
and causing all kinds
of trouble out in this
area here.

218
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,233
So we're to investigate
these incidents and
report back?

219
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,566
<i>What a drag...</i>

220
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,466
Uh?

221
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,733
Shikamaru?

222
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:42,099
Hey!

223
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:45,033
Guess what? Our team's
been assigned to patrol
with you guys.

224
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:46,699
A total drag, for sure.

225
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,299
Oh, really?

226
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,499
Are you upset? Working
with another squad on
missions is never a bad
thing.

227
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,566
Let us be sure we give
it our all!

228
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,499
A total drag, for sure.

229
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:57,599
Ugh.

230
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,066
This place is
pretty far away.

231
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,666
It's going to be a long
day, isn't it?

232
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:17,499
Yeah, and what
a drag.

233
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:18,699
[sighing]

234
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,666
Shikamaru, will you
please stop saying
everything in the
world is a drag?

235
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:26,233
Hey, if something's a
drag, it's a drag. There's
no way around it.

236
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:28,233
Even this
is a drag.

237
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,366
I realize this mission
has the possibility of
being tough,

238
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,133
but your complaining
isn't going to resolve
it. It's only going to
make it worse.

239
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,733
That response is a drag.

240
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,633
What?! Oh, come on!

241
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,266
Easy

242
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,133
Come on, Shikamaru has
been using that phrase
for as long as I can
remember!

243
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,399
However, this is a joint
mission, Shikamaru,

244
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:49,433
so for the time
being, if you don't
mind, cool it, all right?

245
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:52,566
I don't know why I
should. In itself, that
would---

246
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,366
[growling]

247
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,533
[sighing]

248
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,233
Which way do we go?

249
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:01,633
I think the left path is
the shorter one.

250
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,233
It'd still
be a drag...

251
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:05,033
[growling]

252
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:07,099
... but we should
take the path on
the right.

253
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,699
Sure about that?

254
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:11,599
If you feel that
strongly, it must
be the right way!

255
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:16,266
My gut feeling is that
Shikamaru's super-genius
200 I.Q. will naturally
steer us away from

256
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,099
anything that could be
potentially troublesome.

257
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:23,399
And as a bonus advantage,
we won't have to listen
to him complaining about
everything.

258
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,433
That's the best
reason of all.

259
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,566
<i>Once the decision was</i>
<i>made, the group headed</i>
<i>down what should have</i>
<i>been a trouble-free path.</i>

260
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,333
<i>However...</i>

261
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,233
Huh?

262
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:36,066
Oh, Bushy-Brow! This is
perfect! What great
timing you have!You've
arrived re right on time!

263
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:37,499
Naruto?

264
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:41,066
We all got together and
decided it was finally
time to try out that new

265
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:43,266
Kabbadi training you
thought up.

266
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,166
<i>Kabbadi is an Indian</i>
<i>sport. It's a little</i>
<i>different. One of the</i>
<i>rules is, while you're</i>

267
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,299
<i>practicing it, you have</i>
<i>to keep saying "Kabbadi"</i>
<i>over and over until you</i>
<i>run out of</i>
breath.

268
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,699
It's called Kabbadi?

269
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,699
I can say this is
definitely...

270
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,199
... a total drag.

271
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,633
And what's the point of
it, anyway?

272
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:02,966
Are you ready to join the
fun, Bushy-Brow? If so,
let's hear it for Kabbadi!
Kabbadi!

273
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:06,033
I am definitely ready!
Kabbadi, Kabbadi,
Kabbadi, Kabbadi!

274
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,999
You don't have to play
it, you know!

275
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,366
Such a total drag,
know what I mean?

276
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,966
Kabbadi, Kabbadi,
Kabbadi, Kabbadi.

277
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,699
Shikamaru, why are you
playing?!

278
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:16,699
Idiot! Idiot!
Idiot! Idiot!

279
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,699
Aw, well--we all worked
up a really good sweat!

280
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:24,133
Anyway, Shikamaru, now
that we look back on it,
it's obvious we should
have taken a left turn

281
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,866
back at that fork
in the road.

282
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:31,433
No, if we'd taken a
left, we'd have gone
past... a barbecue place
out this way, and Choji

283
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:32,333
would have been
impossible.

284
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,233
I'm starving to death!

285
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,699
And he would have made
us stop. But as soon as
we walked in...

286
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,299
I'm so sorry. We're
completely out of beef.

287
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,233
But I've got a craving
now! That doesn't work
for me, mister!

288
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:47,133
You know what would
happen then. We'd be
off to find a cow, out
in the mountains.

289
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:47,866
There's one!

290
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:50,999
Hold on, Choji! That's
a female!

291
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:55,966
Then we'd learn it was
pregnant. And after it
gave birth to its calf,
Choji would be so moved

292
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,966
by the miracle of birth,
that he'd be like...

293
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,566
Hey. I'm gonna live out
here and raise cattle
from now on!

294
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:03,399
He'd quit his life as a
ninja to become a
rancher...

295
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,666
... and things would
become a real drag.

296
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,966
It makes sense. You
can't argue with that.

297
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:10,366
Yeah, right! That would
never happen in a
million years!

298
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:11,699
Alright, that's it!

299
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:14,166
I've decided I'm gonna
live out here and raise
cattle!

300
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,333
[mooing]

301
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,299
It sounds like someone
out there decided to
become a rancher!

302
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,499
Whaaat?

303
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:22,566
Another fork in the road.

304
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:25,233
Oh brother. Which way do
we go?

305
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:28,566
It's gonna be a
drag, but we should
go left.

306
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:33,366
<i>Once again, the group</i>
<i>headed down what should</i>
<i>have been a drag-free</i>
<i>path. However...</i>

307
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,166
Huh?

308
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,233
Oh, hey there, Big Bro
Bushy-Brow!

309
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,199
<i>Konohamaru!</i>

310
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:43,199
You're just in time to
supervise! Our group was
about to start using that
special training method

311
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:45,599
for sheep-shearing you
came up with a couple of
days ago!

312
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:47,199
Did he say
"sheep sheering"?

313
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,399
So once again...

314
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,299
... drag's the
correct word.

315
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,566
What do you think is the
"special training
method"?

316
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:55,266
Why don't you grab some
clippers and join us,
Bushy-Brow?!

317
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,366
That sounds like fun!
Count me in!

318
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,299
I guess I'm in, too.
But it's still a drag!

319
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,699
Why are you
joining in?!

320
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,399
[shivering]

321
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,266
Seriously?

322
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,666
What exactly is going on
here, Shikamaru? I thought
this path was supposed to
be trouble-free?

323
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:11,466
It was.

324
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:14,999
If we'd gone right back
there, we'd have passed a
chicken restaurant that's
out this way...

325
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,299
... and Choji would have
been, like...

326
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,066
...I'm starving to
death!

327
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,166
And he would have made
us stop. But then...

328
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,666
I'm sorry, but
we've just run out
of chicken.

329
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:25,233
Don't do this to me!
Now I've got a craving!

330
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:28,566
Next thing you know,
we'd be off to find a
chicken, out in the
mountains.

331
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,666
There's one!

332
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:31,399
Hold on, Choji!

333
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,233
In spite of the crowing,
that's a hen!

334
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:37,399
Then we would learn that
it was pregnant. And
after its eggs were laid,
Choji would be so moved

335
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:41,599
by the miracle of birth,
that the next morning,
he'd dedicate his life
to creating a paradise

336
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:42,966
for chickens.

337
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,666
Things would get really
troublesome.

338
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:46,666
I can't argue with what
It's a drag.

339
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,699
What's a chicken
paradise, anyway?

340
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,399
<i>I'm going to create a</i>
<i>paradise for chickens!</i>

341
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:53,266
[crowing]

342
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,399
Apparently, the chickens
have banded together and
support this effort!

343
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:57,533
Whaat?!

344
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,699
So we've come to
another fork in the road.

345
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:04,399
It's gonna be a
drag, but... we
should go right.

346
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:07,699
<i>They hoped the third time</i>
<i>would be the charm.</i>
<i>However...</i>

347
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,233
Glad I caught you, Lee!
The timing couldn't be
more perfect!

348
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:15,133
As it happens, I'm in
the middle of that new
"politely-refusing-an-
invitation-from-

349
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,099
your-friend-to-go-see-
his-band-perform-live-
at-a-neighborhood-bar"

350
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:20,166
training that you
came up with.

351
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,966
Who would come up with
training for something
like that?

352
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:25,433
Just thinking about it
gives me a big headache.

353
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:27,233
So let's practice, Lee!

354
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:28,999
As you wish, Guy Sensei!

355
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:32,966
The first step is to
distance yourself just
enough.

356
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:36,733
You cannot appear
excited, but you cannot
be repulsed, either.

357
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,599
So then, you smile
slightly uncomfortably--

358
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,466
...And explain why
you simply cannot
participate!

359
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:45,333
I would love to come, but
unfortunately, I have a
family event that I

360
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:46,666
absolutely have to
attend that day.

361
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:47,999
I am so sorry.

362
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,699
What in the world is this
training supposed to
accomplish?!

363
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,266
Such a drag.

364
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,166
Normally I'd be happy
to help, but unfortunately,

365
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,633
I'm cat-sitting for
my uncle while he's
on vacation.

366
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,333
Sorry.

367
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:02,533
I should have known
you'd buy into this
fantasy! You didn't
even miss a beat!

368
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:04,033
For the record...

369
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,466
If we'd turned left at
the fork in the road,
we'd have run into
a ramen place...

370
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:09,233
I'm starving, I
tell you!

371
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,366
But once we walked in...

372
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,399
So sorry, guys, but
we've just run out of
pork.

373
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,766
You can't be serious!
I've got such a craving!

374
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,633
Next thing you know,
we'd be off to find a
pig out in---

375
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,966
That's enough, I get
it. I've heard this
story before.

376
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:25,399
Alright then, let's
move on. The next step is
what you should do when
someone's insistent and

377
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,899
simply isn't paying
attention.

378
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,299
It's called "Weaseling-
your-way-out-when-you've-
had-the-tickets-forced---

379
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:32,933
Dammit.

380
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:40,299
Why is it so important
for us to scramble around
and collect all these
tickets?

381
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,733
Look! A Leaf Ninja!

382
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,399
Didn't expect to see
one of you strolling
around here in the woods!

383
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,099
Come on, boys!
Let's get her!

384
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,499
It had to be now. What a
drag!

385
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:51,033
Oh my goodness, I'm
starting to sound like
Shikamaru!

386
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,699
You think we're nothing
more than a drag, eh?

387
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,199
Fine, let's rumble!

388
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:56,966
What?

389
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:00,666
I would love to, but I
have to be somewhere. So
sorry.

390
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,199
[gasping]

391
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:08,133
This is ridiculous!
It's the same excuse
people would give me when
I would invite them to

392
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,066
come and see me perform
with my band!

393
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:13,466
Oh, yeah? It sort of came
out automatically.

394
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:17,266
In the past, whenever
I'd invite someone to
come and see us, they'd

395
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,166
make that face and
politely refuse. Not one
single person showed up!

396
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,366
Huh?

397
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,399
How dare you hurt our
friend's feelings like
that?!

398
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,199
Wait...

399
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,466
It wasn't on purpose,
I assure you.

400
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:30,699
Huh?

401
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,333
[sneezing]

402
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,633
I can't believe it!
This is wool!

403
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:39,533
What the--? How could
you possibly know I was
allergic to wool?!

404
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,466
Huh?! It's a
surprise to me!

405
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:43,566
Wait a minute.

406
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:48,966
Is it possible? Did
Shikamaru research the
rogue ninjas before the
mission, learn their weak

407
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:53,633
points, then lead us down
these troublesome paths
so we could engage and
overcome them?

408
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:56,099
I have to give you
credit, young lady.

409
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:59,466
You're quite the ninja,
to have figured out both
my friends' weak
points.

410
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:02,999
But I bet you can't
figure out how to beat
me, can you?

411
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:06,066
Heh! Please, your weak
point couldn't be more
obvious.

412
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,299
Let's see how you
handle this!

413
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:12,999
Kabbadi! Kabbadi!
Kabbadi! Kabbadi!
Kabbadi! Kabbadi!
Kabbadi! Kabbadi!

414
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,566
What was that all about?

415
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,699
That didn't tap
your weakness?!

416
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:21,366
<i>Seems like Kabbadi had</i>
<i>nothing to do with</i>
<i>anything.</i>

417
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:24,366
Well, whatever that
was all about, now
it's my turn!!

418
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:27,133
What the hell? Why
can't I move?

419
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,066
Huh?

420
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,666
<i>This is such a drag!</i>

421
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:32,666
Shikamaru?

422
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:33,699
Tenten!

423
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:34,499
You alright?!

424
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:35,599
[grunting]

425
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:43,333
Now I realize that
Shikamaru predicted this
from the beginning. He
could have saved us a lot

426
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:45,999
of trouble if he had just
explained it to start with.

427
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:46,766
Hm?

428
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,166
Oh, it's nothing.
Never mind.

429
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:51,566
Good heavens, this is
truly a drag..

430
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,099
Yeah, you can be such a
drag, all right.

431
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:55,233
Hey, Tenten!

432
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,699
Now that those rogue
ninjas are under control
and we have some time,
let us practice the

433
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:02,599
"Indescribable-anger-when-
you-finally-go-to-see-the-
band-but-find-out-there's-

434
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:04,399
a-separate-charge-for-
the-drinks" training!

435
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:07,066
Oh boy. You, my friend,
are such a drag!

436
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:51,637
Next time is
"Infiltrate Akatsuki's
Hideout" and "A Desperate
Escape Plan"!

437
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:54,771
But guess what? We're
not participating in the
episode.

438
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:57,104
<i>Let me guess... it's</i>
<i>because it's such a</i>
<i>drag, right?</i>

439
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:58,104
That's not it.

440
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,737
<i>Huh?</i>

441
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,571
If we were to be in the
episode, Choji would get
hungry and go to a sushi
restaurant

442
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:05,504
only to find that they
