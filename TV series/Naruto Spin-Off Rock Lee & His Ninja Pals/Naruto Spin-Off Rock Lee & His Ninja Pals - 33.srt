1
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:53,969
Another peaceful day in
The Hidden Leaf Village.

2
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:55,603
[scream]

3
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:57,636
On the other hand,
maybe not.

4
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,436
Guy Sensei,
what is wrong?!

5
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:00,703
[gasp]

6
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:02,536
[pained tumble]

7
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:03,703
What is going on?

8
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:07,169
It better be a matter
of life and death!

9
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:09,603
Huh?

10
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:18,869
[breathing]

11
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:21,669
Guy Sensei, what
happened to you?!

12
00:02:28,536 --> 00:02:32,603
Might Guy: A Story of Love
and Hair!

13
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:37,836
This was supposed to be my
normal shampoo, but look
what it did to my hair!

14
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,769
This stuff here?

15
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:43,436
Byakugan!

16
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,536
This is Orochimaru's doing!

17
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,703
No surprise!

18
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:49,669
Do not be so concerned!
What are a few strands
of hair?!

19
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,136
Lee is right about this.
Cheer up, Guy Sensei!

20
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,936
You mean you...

21
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,469
...don't really care?

22
00:02:56,503 --> 00:03:00,903
Of course not! Do not forget,
my friend, you are the Leaf's
Noble Blue Beast!

23
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:03,036
No one's
going to care!

24
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:18,169
[laughing]
[crying]

25
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:22,503
[throwing grunt]

26
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,603
[pained yell]

27
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,436
Guy Sensei!

28
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:28,636
[groan]

29
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:32,503
Good morning, everybody.
Did you come for training?

30
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:35,836
No, sensei! The truth of the
matter is, we came here to
bring you a present!

31
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:37,069
And here it is!

32
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:38,203
Huh?

33
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:41,536
You guys are great.

34
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,436
Something feels off.

35
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:44,903
Something more,
in his face?

36
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:51,203
It might be too much.
Let's try this.

37
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:53,869
Wait, I know!

38
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:55,436
Hey! That
actually works!

39
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,803
Nothing creepy
about it!

40
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,903
Guy Sensei has
been re-born!

41
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:01,836
[chuckles]

42
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:04,636
Thank you, guys.
For the thought.

43
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,803
But the truth is,
it's pointless.

44
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:12,203
Without any blood pumping
through it, I won't feel
any youthfulness wearing it.

45
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:14,003
[sigh]

46
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,069
It's just a wig.
Is it really that
big a deal?

47
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:20,136
Can't really have
a wig with blood
pumping through it.

48
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:23,969
In that case...
We will find a
wig that is alive!

49
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:25,036
Huh?

50
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,636
For example,
this one will
grow!

51
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,469
But his head
isn't a vase!

52
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,803
Alright, then, this
matches the shape
of his head, perfectly!

53
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,869
He's not a
giant mushroom!

54
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:37,003
[sigh]

55
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:42,869
It's no good. I appreciate your
efforts, but I don't feel a
partnership or any affection
to any of those choices.

56
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:46,803
So that's it.
For now,
I'm done.

57
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,536
I'll see
you later.

58
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:54,136
(Rock Lee)
There must be
some solution.

59
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,636
Blood pumping...
Affection!

60
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:58,503
What have you
come up with now?

61
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:00,969
Guy Sensei needs
a pet wig!

62
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:02,536
What does that
even mean?

63
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,036
It would be a living creature
that you treat with love!
Just as you would a pet!

64
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:09,636
Andif it is a pet,
Guy Sensei is sure
to fall in love with it!

65
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:11,136
That sort of
makes sense!

66
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:13,103
Time to get
ourselves in
gear!

67
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:14,903
Huh?
In gear
for what?

68
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:17,036
Come on, Ino!
Please!

69
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:17,769
Lee!

70
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,036
Do a Mind Transfer
into this wig!

71
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,703
Huh?

72
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:23,036
What in the world
are you thinking?!

73
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,203
If she controls the wig
with her Jutsu, it will
become a real pet!

74
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:27,736
That's ridiculous!

75
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,736
Not if it ends up
helping Guy Sensei!

76
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,503
Just forget
about it!

77
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,536
[humming, gasp]

78
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:35,903
Help us please!

79
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:36,769
[humming, gasp]

80
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:37,669
Please!

81
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,103
[scream]

82
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:39,869
Please, Ino?

83
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:42,103
[scream]

84
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:44,036
Come on, Ino!

85
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:46,936
Please help
us! Please!

86
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:50,736
Okay, fine!

87
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:56,036
Good morning, Guy Sensei!
I have come to introduce
you to what I hope will
be the ultimate partner!

88
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:00,803
Oh, it's you, Lee.
I'm sorry, but I
really don't want to-

89
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:02,769
This is for you!

90
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:06,103
Would you mind
taking a look?

91
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:08,203
What is this?

92
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:14,803
Behold, the ultimate tailed
beast! His name is Cuticle!
He has a hundred-thousand
tails! Can you believe that?

93
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:21,869
Thousands upon thousands more
tails than Gaara's One-Tail or
Naruto's Nine-Tails! Every one
of those little hairs is a tail!

94
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:23,036
I see.

95
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,803
Thank you.

96
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:27,769
Frankly, I'm not sure
what's going on here.

97
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:31,836
But I'm thankful for the
burning concern you have
for your poor old sensei.

98
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,403
Sir!

99
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:41,503
Cuticle.
Arise and
come forth!

100
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:58,903
This is the hundred-thousand
tailed beast? I don't quite
know what to make of it.

101
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:03,736
This is not a good start.
I need to open a line of
communication, to make
him feel the love.

102
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:09,669
Greetings to you my most
exalted master! I am Cuticle!

103
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,636
You can talk?!

104
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:16,803
Oh yes, master! And I give you
my word that I intend to work
very hard, to make you love
and accept me!

105
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,469
That's gonna be
some trick, if he
pulls it off.

106
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:22,636
I believe you.

107
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:30,836
Very well, starting
right this moment...

108
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,669
...you will be
my partner!

109
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,569
(Wig)
The wig is youth!

110
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,069
The wig is youth!

111
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:38,203
(Wig)
The wig will make
everything alright
again!

112
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,636
The wig will make
everything alright
again!

113
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,736
This might work,
after all!

114
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,503
Are you ready,
Cuticle?!

115
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:47,203
(Wig)
Yes, my master!

116
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:51,836
Death Strike!
Time to experience
Cuticle Frenzy!

117
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:52,669
Reload!

118
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:56,969
Yes sir!

119
00:07:57,003 --> 00:08:00,203
Time for another
Death Strike, and
Cuticle Frenzy!

120
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:04,936
I don't understand
how that move works.

121
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,669
I am ready,
my master!

122
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:08,869
All right..
Go!

123
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:14,069
Beginning the
Youthful Shampoo
Dance!

124
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:19,203
Splendid! What a hot-blooded
soul you have! You're the
greatest partner, ever!

125
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:21,769
What does his
soul have to do
with anything?

126
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,736
Frankly, I
can't imagine.

127
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:28,069
I've been dying
to see this!

128
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:32,169
This film is better!
I would prefer to
watch this one, instead!

129
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:33,203
Huh?

130
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:35,136
We're watching
this one!

131
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,003
No, we are
watching mine!

132
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:37,936
This one!

133
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,436
No, mine!

134
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:41,803
He's arguing
with his hair!

135
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:45,769
We should throw
them a comb. It
might shut them up.

136
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:46,469
[yell]

137
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:47,603
[pained grunt]

138
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:50,103
[running]

139
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:53,003
Hmpf!

140
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:09,436
Huh?

141
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,569
Cuticle!

142
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:40,469
Here, master!

143
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:42,803
We'll watch whatever
movie you want!

144
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:46,536
I'm so sorry, master!

145
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:50,936
My bald spot isn't the same
without you sitting on it!

146
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,703
I miss your scalp!

147
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:58,036
This is like watching a bad
TV movie. Does he know he's
doing this cheesy scene with
a wig.

148
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:04,103
As the days passed, Guy's
relationship with his hair
grew deeper and deeper.

149
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,936
This whole storyline
is giving me heartburn.
[gasp]

150
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:11,836
I can't take much
more of this..

151
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:18,003
Bathing with Guy Sensei,
sleeping with Guy Sensei,
no more! No more!

152
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:20,503
[screams]
I can't do this!
I'll die!
[moans]

153
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,003
Sorry, Ino.

154
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:27,536
Sorry isn't going
to cut it!
I won't recover!
[crying]

155
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:31,936
Looks like she's
pretty much done.
Hm? Hey, look...

156
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:37,436
His missing hair
is starting to
grow back!

157
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:39,936
Yes! Time for
the final stage!

158
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:42,736
You're leaving me?
But why?!

159
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:48,503
Thank you for everything you've
done. I appreciate it. But I
must return to the Tailed Beast
Village now.

160
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:50,669
Please, Cuticle!

161
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:54,503
You have to understand.
This was always going
to be temporary.

162
00:10:54,536 --> 00:11:01,803
Don't go! I thought we were
going to be together forever!
[crying]

163
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:08,736
Listen to my words carefully,
Master, and trust what I say.
Your true partner...

164
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,669
...is up there!

165
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,003
You have to
believe me.

166
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:21,436
[gasp]
Citicle!

167
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:27,603
My master. I beg you.
Live happily with your
real hair!

168
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:36,703
Thank you, Cuticle.
I promise, I'll never
forget you!

169
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:40,636
Seriously, guys.
No more.

170
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:43,736
Noooo!

171
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,069
Lord Orochimaru!
What's wrong?!

172
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:50,936
I accidentally used the shampoo!
The special stuff I made for
that man!

173
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:54,503
How can I crush the Leaf
Village, looking like this?!

174
00:11:54,536 --> 00:12:00,669
It's going to be alright,
m'lord! I, Kabuto, predicted
this accident might happen,
and prepared a contingency!

175
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:04,536
Come forth the
hundred-thousand
tailed beast!

176
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:11,569
Gee, I kinda
like it!

177
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:14,603
He should. That's as
good as he's looked
in years!

178
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:31,944
Today, we join our three heroes
as they are practicing their
moves and polishing their
[coughing] teamwork.

179
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,944
They have been training-
[coughing]

180
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:36,177
Hello! Are you all
right up there?

181
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,577
Sorry, folks.
[coughing]
My throat's been bugging
me for the last few days.

182
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,944
That is very
unfortunate.

183
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:48,877
[sigh]
I haven't had a day off
since I can remember. It's
starting to catch up with me.

184
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,210
Would you like to
take a little break?

185
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:52,377
Say whaa?

186
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,010
Substitute Narrator!

187
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:05,944
You sure you can
handle all this
narrating, Lee?

188
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,177
In my opinion,
I thinkI should
do this.

189
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,177
Nothing to worry about!
I will do my usual superb job,
and everything will work out
great!

190
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,577
That's what worries
me more than anything.

191
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:22,644
Here we go. Welcome to the
Hidden Leaf Village, where we
find three particular shinobi,
training their tails off.

192
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,310
There are only
two of us here.

193
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:28,877
Regardless, our hearts remain as
one even if I am not present.
Now, the introductions.

194
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,944
Right now, Lee?

195
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:35,377
This is Tenten. A very kind
young woman, but a scary one,
who can summon a variety of
weapons in an instant.

196
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,444
Her punchlines are sharp. Lady
Tsunade is her heroine, but she
has many inches to go to catch
up to her, bust-wise.

197
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:44,377
She is strong-willed, but
doesn't always make the
right choices.

198
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:50,044
This is particularly true when
it comes to meals. Yesterday,
she ate a lot of ramen and
gained a ton of weight-

199
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:51,244
Enough, already!

200
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:52,010
Now Neji...

201
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:52,577
[gasp]

202
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,177
Huh?

203
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,544
He loves to
cross-dress.

204
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:58,177
That's all you
have to say?

205
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,010
I'm not doing it
for fun, you know!

206
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:04,610
What you see are two everyday
friends, who go to a normal
school and have become normal
ninja.

207
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:09,444
But what makes them and their
entire team unique, is their
third member.

208
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:11,944
How to describe him? He is
a cool, strong man everybody
loves.

209
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,144
He is known as the
genius of hard work,
and his name is Rock Lee!

210
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:17,077
You expect people
to buy that?!

211
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,877
I am really getting
the hang of this!

212
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,477
You're definitely losing
touch with reality.

213
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,644
I'm gonna go. I'm leaving
everything in your hands,
alright?

214
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:28,110
No problem at all!
Have a relaxing vacation,
Mr. Narrator!

215
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:32,977
Yeah. I'll try.

216
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,410
Training for combat is the
light that fills our world.

217
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:39,610
Training for combat is the
hope that fills my heart.

218
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:45,044
It is the training that
ultimately unites us.
We yearn for the clear
light of training.

219
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:49,277
What in the world are
you babbling about?!

220
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,577
The first task for
these dedicated
ninja are push-ups.

221
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,877
Tenten dropped
down and took on
the challenge.

222
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,910
Bending her arms,
she pushed her
muscles to the limit.

223
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:03,644
Neji was next.
He dropped down and
began his workout.

224
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:08,010
He put his feet together,
kept his back straight,
and pushed off the ground.

225
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:10,310
Their goal was to do ten
thousand repetitions.

226
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:11,144
Huh?

227
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,010
That's crazy!

228
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:18,210
For their next challenge,
both participants must climb
a waterfall, starting right
in the middle.

229
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:20,944
Let us hope they are able
to get through unscathed.

230
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:25,144
[gurgly]

231
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:26,910
[scream]
Neji!

232
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,110
At this point,
let us go to
Tenten.

233
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:30,410
Forget it!

234
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:34,210
Moving right along...
Next on the schedule
is shuriken practice.

235
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:37,310
Thank heavens..
Finally, something
normal.

236
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:38,277
However...

237
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,977
However?

238
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,344
I really have a craving for
pudding. Let us do some
pudding-cooking training,
instead.

239
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,644
Are you serious?

240
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,110
[gasp]

241
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:51,944
A young girl with a broken
heart, meditating as she
is blanketed with snow.

242
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:56,344
A lone seagull cries out.
Neji's Byakugan prevents
his eyes from drying out.

243
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:57,577
Byakugan!

244
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,610
The pair now switch to
harsh spiritual training.

245
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:02,044
This is nuts, Lee!

246
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:06,410
Our heroes now find themselves
preparing to do the latest
make-out dance!

247
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:09,010
What sultry secrets will
they be forced to reveal?

248
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:11,444
Huh?

249
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:14,644
Whoa! That is almost more than
either of them can resist!

250
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:18,110
Only the highest-caliber
of ninja can withstand
such temptation!

251
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,110
The bell is about to ring,
and their trial will begin!

252
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:23,044
[groans]

253
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:32,144
I have to rely on my
Byakugan to get me
through this successfully!

254
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:35,010
Just a little bit more
and I'll have it.

255
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:39,644
Neji!

256
00:16:39,677 --> 00:16:41,910
[groans]
What is the point
of all this?

257
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:45,110
Kakashi Sensei's the only one
who reads this make-out stuff,
anyway!

258
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:46,377
Did I hear
my name?

259
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:46,910
[gasp]

260
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:48,610
Hello..
And thanks.

261
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,210
[moans]

262
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,910
Hey, guys!
What are you
up to?

263
00:16:54,944 --> 00:16:56,344
Shhh!

264
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:58,510
We slipped away when he wasn't
looking, and we don't want him
to find us!

265
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:01,977
There you are, Naruto Uzumaki.
Always running around.

266
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,977
Just another Leaf Ninja.
Lady Tsunade ought to
whack you one.

267
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,177
That is, as long as it does
not make you transform.

268
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,944
Uh, what's going
on here?

269
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:12,244
Unfortunately,
you're about
to find out.

270
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,877
Oh, there you
are, Naruto.
I was just about-

271
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,477
Sakura Haruno!

272
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,977
Huh?

273
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,110
If the village is a
goddess, here is its
angel. Its radiant
beacon of hope!

274
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:22,077
Huh?

275
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,077
Her forehead
shines brighter
than the stars!

276
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:29,977
Wider than the ocean,
standing tall and proud like
Mt. Fuji herself, blazing
forth like the morning sun.

277
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,610
I am but a gaseous nebula of
love, being sucked into the
black holes that are her eyes!

278
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:37,610
Why is Lee
narrating?

279
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:38,877
It's a
ong story.

280
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,244
Let's find someone
else for him to focus
on, so we can escape.

281
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:45,377
If we can start him
on Guy Sensei, he'll
forget all about us.

282
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,577
So far, we have apparently
overlooked one of our most
important players!

283
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,077
Oh, yes.
You forgot
about him!

284
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,210
To make up for lost time,
you need to tell everyone
about him!

285
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:57,544
I understand.
'Him', you say?

286
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,044
Meanwhile...

287
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:05,077
Uh, excuse me, but you're
very early. I haven't even
studied my lines yet.

288
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,110
Only one thing comes to mind
when you see this Prince of
Antagonism, Orochimaru...

289
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,310
Just one thing?

290
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:11,544
You know
what it is!

291
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:16,144
[panic groans]

292
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:17,477
Swallow 'em whole!

293
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,077
Yes.. and then?

294
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,144
And then..
You have to..
spit 'em out!

295
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:29,244
Apparently, his trademark eye
lines are just makeup. Looks
like his real eyes are very
small.

296
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:33,510
[paniced yell]

297
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:45,344
[sigh]
It's really weird.
I've been dying to have a
vacation for so long but...

298
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:50,244
...I wonder what's
going on back
at the village.

299
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:55,410
Maybe, maybe
they're fine
without me.
[sigh]

300
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:58,177
Mr. Narrator!

301
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,377
Huh?

302
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,277
We need to
talk to you!

303
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,510
What?
You mean me?

304
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:10,644
Wha--? What are
you all doing here?

305
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:12,877
You have to come
back to the village,
right away!

306
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,477
Huh?

307
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,377
Seriously!
Right now!

308
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,077
I just introduced him.

309
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,144
Lee, have you
forgotten about
him?

310
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:20,010
Him?

311
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:20,910
Come on,
you know!

312
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:23,477
Oh, you
mean him!

313
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,377
[chuckles]

314
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,077
I almost forgot
about you,
Kakashi Hatake!

315
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,344
Hm?

316
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,110
What brings you all here.
It seems like the show's
doing fine.

317
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:32,910
Fine, my foot!

318
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:34,644
What is
going on?

319
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:37,944
You're just in time, Lee!
There's someone else in the cast
who wants you to introduce him!

320
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:43,877
There is a man who can smash
fate with his fists, a man who
can stand against the heavens!

321
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,044
That man is..
um, Guy Sensei?

322
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:47,610
I can't even
read in peace.

323
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,844
All done!

324
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,177
No, you're not!
Someone over
there is begging
to be intro'd!

325
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:58,144
This man is a traitor to the
village, Sasuke Uchiha. He does
not really fit in, which is why
he does not appear on the show.

326
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:02,644
Stop that!
[grunt]

327
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:07,277
This is the problem with Lee
narrating! He's gonna keep
bringing up things we're not
supposed to mention!

328
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,410
Please come back
to work, Mr. Narrator!

329
00:20:09,444 --> 00:20:11,077
Hm!

330
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,344
Uhh...

331
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:17,544
All right.

332
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:19,977
Ahh!

333
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,144
Okay, let's
do this!

334
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:29,277
Well, that does it. It covers
everyone who is anyone around
here. Now it is time for our
heroes to train.

335
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,310
I don't think
so, Lee!

336
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:32,644
Huh..

337
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:34,210
Uhh.

338
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:39,444
It's time to
take him down,
Mr. Narrator.

339
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:45,977
By popular request, a lone
narrator returns from a beach
resort, where he leaves behind
the sound of crashing waves.

340
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,277
Huh?

341
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,877
After much pressure, his final
battle is about to come to an
end.

342
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,244
His very dangerous opponent:
None other than Rock Lee!

343
00:20:53,277 --> 00:20:54,844
What?!

344
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:58,110
Rock Lee, adored disciple
of Guy Sensei, known as The
Leaf's Handsome Blue Beast!

345
00:20:58,144 --> 00:21:01,110
But his true nature is simply
that of a training-aholic.

346
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:05,210
Desperately in love with Sakura,
his lack of game stymies his
efforts.

347
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:07,277
But that's not
all, folks...

348
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,410
The truth is, he owes Tenten
three thousand, one hundred
eighty ryou.

349
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:16,244
And he makes Neji cross-dress
because he really thinks it
looks cute!

350
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,977
[sigh]

351
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:27,877
[applauds]

352
00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:33,177
As it happens, that vacation
was exactly what I needed.
[clears throat]

353
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,077
It returned my voice
to proper shape!

354
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,210
I am so glad
that you're back!

355
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:40,544
Please, my friend,
make sure you take better
care of yourself from now on!

356
00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:43,377
You're the only
narrator any of
us need, or want!

357
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,344
Mhm!

358
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:50,910
Aw, thank you guys!
I was starting to worry that
the show really didn't need
me, in order to continue!

359
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:54,477
But I was wrong.
To think all of you
appreciate me so much.

360
00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:00,544
I plan to return the favor,
and help improve the ratings.
I'll be there to narrate all
your embarrassing secrets!

361
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:03,944
[paniced screams]

362
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:07,310
One thing stays the same!
The narrator knows all!

363
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:53,163
Next time, be sure to catch
'Save Ichiraku Ramen', and
'Vacations Are For Training'!

364
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,230
I have never gone a single
day without training!

365
00:23:55,263 --> 00:24:02,530
Didn't you tell me you spent
your entire last day off,
sitting at home and binge
watching a bunch of movies?

366
00:24:02,563 --> 00:24:07,697
I was still in training,
though! Those movies were
treasure troves of useful
genjutsu techniques!

367
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,430
Like I said, they're not
genjutsu, they're skits!

368
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:16,530
All those references are
turning you from a ninja
into a comedian!
