00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:54,316
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Autumn is finally</i>
<i>here! One season ends,</i>
<i>and another begins!</i>

2
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,649
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>And you know what</i>
<i>else begins..?</i>
<i>Sports!</i>

3
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:58,416
-A sports tournament?
-A sports tournament?
-A sports tournament?

4
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:02,149
That's right! A ball
game tourney is being
held this Sunday!

5
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:04,816
I am burning with
anticipation!!!

6
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:09,316
The ball game tournament
and sports meet are the
two big events that take
place in the fall!

7
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:12,182
Is this tournament
you're talking about
really that big?

8
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,682
And could you take your
anticipation flame down
a notch? It's burning
out of control!

9
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:18,249
There are all kinds
of ball games, though.
Which one is it?

10
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:20,782
Oh... that is right.
Which game is the
tournament for?

11
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:24,516
[laughter] "Which
game," you ask?

12
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:28,749
It's for Dodgeball!

13
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,682
[groans]

14
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:42,282
"The Green Flame,
Dodge Lee!"

15
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:46,682
I see. Dodgeball,
huh?

16
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:50,082
What's wrong, Lee? You
Don't sound excited
about it anymore.

17
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:51,449
Don't you like it?

18
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:55,116
Well, it is not
that I do not
like it, but...

19
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:57,816
<i>...when I think</i>
<i>of dodgeball...</i>

20
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,416
So, tell me! How
far are you into
Narutimate?

21
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,782
I just made it
to the cave!

22
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:08,149
Yeah? I'm at
the wind tower.

23
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:10,582
Woah! Really?

24
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,549
I swear, boys are
just so completely
childish...

25
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:18,182
HOnestly, the game
simply seems kind
of childish to me.

26
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:22,582
I hate to break it to
you, but, it's not the
dodgeball that's childish,
it's the boys.

27
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,382
Don't be such
a softie!

28
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,516
You're even softer
than these cream-
covered dorayaki!

29
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:30,549
Stop eating that nasty
crap! Your blood sugar
will go through the roof!

30
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:32,616
Listen to me, Lee!

31
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:39,682
Dodgeball... is a
serious game that tests
the most fundamental
ninja skills!

32
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,549
(Lee)
Really? Are
you sure?

33
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:46,649
<i>(Guy)</i>
<i>Clearly you don't</i>
<i>see it that way.</i>
<i>Fine. I'll show you.</i>

34
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:49,749
Right! A little
exhibition match
should help you
understand...

35
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:52,316
Behold! The depth
of dodgeball!

36
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,416
I just do not get
<i>it, Guy Sensei.</i>

37
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,616
For a ninja, handling
a large object like a
dodgeball is nothing!

38
00:03:57,649 --> 00:04:00,649
Especially compared
to the skill needed
to handle a kunai!

39
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:02,182
<i>(Guy)</i>
<i>Come on, Lee!</i>
<i>Throw it!</i>

40
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:03,816
Oh! Alright!

41
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:06,249
Woooahhh! Oof!

42
00:04:06,282 --> 00:04:09,516
GAH! My apologies!
I know that face
hits do not count!

43
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,616
[sobbing]

44
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:14,582
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>Um, uh... Guy</i>
<i>Sensei..?</i>

45
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:16,516
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Poor thing!</i>
Huh!?

46
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,116
What's wrong
with you!? That
was too rough!

47
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,082
What!?

48
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:22,482
This is training! Take
it easy, would you?

49
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:24,516
<i>Not this again!</i>

50
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:27,449
Ah! It was an
accident! I swear!

51
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,649
I did not mean to
hit him in the--

52
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:33,216
GOTCHA!

53
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:34,816
See that?

54
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:37,682
In dodgeball, if you
let your guard down,
even for a second,
you get hurt.

55
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:40,616
The "dodgeball"
part was finished
way before he
got hurt...

56
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:44,382
<i>(Guy)</i>
<i>A ninja must always</i>
<i>be sure to secure</i>
<i>his own safety...</i>

57
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,416
...and endure until
his chance to strike
presents itself.

58
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,482
That is basic
ninja conduct.

59
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:51,482
What a fearsome
game..!

60
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:53,716
I never knew
dodgeball was
so complex!

61
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:57,082
How can I gain the
patience to endure
like that!? Please
teach me!

62
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:59,516
Visualize it, Lee...

63
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,282
<i>See yourself...</i>
<i>dodging the ball...</i>

64
00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:03,516
Okay! I will
try it!

65
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:05,049
That's the spirit!

66
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:06,149
Visualize!

67
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,616
Visualize!

<i>Our first match pits</i>
<i>Team Guy against Team</i>

Alright! You're going
down, Bushy Brow!

73
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,682
Bring it on,
Konohamaru!

[chuckle]

75
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:31,849
Who do you give
this match to,
Lady Tsunade?

76
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:33,716
Five silver on
Team Ebisu!

77
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:35,349
You're betting
on this..!?

78

<i>[whistle blow]</i>

Visualize, Lee!

81
00:05:42,782 --> 00:05:45,716
<i>Visualize... Yes.</i>
<i>I will undulate like</i>

[happy sigh]

83

What the heck!? Why
are you relaxing!?

84
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:56,382
The ball's coming
right for you!

85
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,549
Lee!

86
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:05,249
Snap out of it!
You have to focus!

87
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:05,982
[nauseous groan]

88
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:07,582
Hey! What's with
all the nausea!?

89
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,449
I have come down
with imaginary
morning sickness...

90
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:12,782
I think you mean
imaginary seasickness!

91
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:16,516
It's time for round 2,
Bushy Brow! Get ready!

92
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:20,649
I will just have
to... use the...
drunken fist...

93
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:24,416
I see right through
your clever ruse!
Sexy Jutsu!

94
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:32,449
[excited scream]

95
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:33,849
Owww!

00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:35,616
<i>(Shizune)</i>
<i>And Lee is out!</i>

be such an idiot!?

98
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:39,582

I'll get them!
Huh?

99

Neji!

Time for Gentle Fist!
Eight Trigrams!
Sixy-Four Palm!

00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:51,616
Nice one, Neji!

103
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,482
We are so finished...

Things weren't looking
so good for Team Guy when
Lee was eliminated early
on in the match...

107
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:04,849
But they managed to
earn themselves a
victory thanks to
Neji's dedication!

108
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,149
What are your thoughts
on the outcome, Lady
Tsunade?

109
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:08,482
Just take it,
you thief!

110
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,682
And with that,
we're on to
the semi-finals!

111
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:12,316
(Shizune)
Team Kurenai!

112
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,182
(Shizune)
Shino starts off
right with a jutsu!

113
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:17,449
It looks like the
ball has suddenly
vanished!

114

Remember, Lee,
visualize...

Ahhhh, uhhh,
Ooof!

116

And just like that,

Hiyyya!

118

Eight Trigrams
Palm Rotation!

119
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:32,382

Again, the opposing
team is out in one
fell swoop!

We're not done!
Severe Leaf Hurricanes!

There's no need
to blow away
the spectators!

122
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:42,816
(Shizune)
Team Guy comes from
behind for another win!

123
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:45,182
Ugh! I'll win
next time!

124
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,082
With that, it's
time for the finals!

126

It's team Guy vs.
Team Kakashi for
the championship!

127

You guys are so going
down, Bushy Brow!

<i>the team. I am</i>
<i>totally useless...</i>

129

Don't worry...
Just concentrate.

130
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,716
Visualize, and you
can do it, okay?

131
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,082
You keep telling
me that, but...

132
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:06,782
The match is
about to begin!

133
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:09,349
Which way are you
leaning on this,
Lady Tsunade?

134
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:10,649
Number 8 in
the fifth...

135
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:13,882
You're betting on
horses now!? Take
those off an pay
attention!

136

Special Big League
Rasengan, Version One!

What an ingenious
combination!

147
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:43,582
Naruto's Rasengan's
were just a distraction!

Team Guy is down

Dodgeball is not just

My ingenious plan
failed again!

00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:51,125

[sigh] Don't
kid yourself.

213
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:16,125
I think the problem is
much more fundamental
than just getting
the date wrong.

214

Shut your mouth!

constantly fail, I'd
say that <i>you're</i> the
"obviously weaker" one.

heart to follow that

moment to work
against the Leaf!

00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:20,292
...they rushed in to
try and ride our coattails
for their own bit of fame,
fortune, and screen time!

291
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:22,159
I'm not excited
about that stuff!

292
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:25,059
Don't lump me in
with this bunch
of one-offs!

293
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:27,392
Nice one! You completely
destroyed the fourth wall.

294
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:30,492
And why would any of
these guest characters
even know that sort
of thing...?

295
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:34,725
Anyway, I want to see
just how determined
everyone is! Let me
hear you!

296
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,359
[cheering]

297
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:39,792
Whatever! I'll win
no matter what
the cost..!

298
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:45,325
Okay! Would the next 5
applicants please make
their way to the
interview room?

299
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:47,292
<i>I'm up...</i>

300
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:49,192
Reporting for testing!

301
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,392
What's Lord
Orochimaru
doing here!?

302
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:54,325
So, you're here,
too, Kabuto...

303
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:57,259
<i>I see- That's</i>
<i>how it is...!</i>

304
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:00,392
I deduced your
transparent plan
right away...

305
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:04,859
<i>I'd expect nothing</i>
<i>less, Lord Orochimaru.</i>
<i>You had the same idea.</i>

306
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:09,392
We're both trying to join
them, gain their trust,
and then strike when
they least expect it, yes?

307
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:11,959
<i>It looks like we</i>
<i>have ourselves a</i>
<i>challenge....</i>

308
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:14,325
<i>Only one of us can</i>
<i>win this contest.</i>

309
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,192
<i>And that one of us</i>
<i>is going to be ME!</i>

310
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:23,225
So, first off, I
would like you to tell
us why you would like
to join the firm.

311
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,325
<i>Firm!? What is this,</i>
<i>a law office...!?</i>

312
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:31,159
<i>Hold it, if I'm going</i>
<i>to be accepted, I have</i>
<i>to play along with</i>
<i>their little games...</i>

313
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,992
First, Mr. Kabuto
Yakushi.

314
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:38,292
Right. Well, I feel I've
reached my full potential
here working as part of
this organization...

315
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,192
What textbook is
that response from?

316
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:45,159
You could've just said,
"What is this, a law
office!?" Such a shame
to miss a good punchline.

317
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:48,259
Besides, we already
have a top-tier straight
man in our firm!

318
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:49,492
Why do you keep
saying, "Firm!?"

319
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:51,959
Wait, was that
straight man you were
talking about me!?

320
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:53,259
Case and point!

321
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:56,959
Oh, crap! So they
wanted me to play
along on a deeper
level!?

322
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,225
(Lee)
Next applicant,
please...

323
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:02,425
Well, I... I...
Uh...

324
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:05,259
<i>What's this!? He's</i>
<i>too nervous to answer?!</i>

325
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,359
<i>Good. Lord</i>
<i>Orochimaru will</i>
<i>lose points for</i>
<i>that!</i>

326
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:09,959
I... I mean...

327
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:22,825
[big screaming yell]

328
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:27,325
[more screaming]

329
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,492
And that perfectly
describes how badly
I want to work here.

330
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,292
<i>What a ridiculous</i>
<i>performance!</i>

331
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:35,359
<i>Expressing your desire</i>
<i>like that will get</i>
<i>you nowhere!</i>

332
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:37,859
Wow! I really felt your
desire to work here!

333
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,759
Are you freaking
kidding me!?

334
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:43,992
Not only do I see just
how much you want to be
here, but that made for a
great comedic setup, too!

335
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,159
Really amazing work!

336
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,225
I'm awarding extra
points for that!

337
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,725
The amount of stupidity
you two are capable of
is shocking...

338
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:54,092
Next, I would like for
each of you to tell us
a tale about your skills!

339
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,192
I, for one, have a
lot of experience
with medical jutsu!

340
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:03,825
That's a short
tale. My tai's
a bit longer!

341
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,492
My goodness! That
is quite a tale,
indeed! Well done!

342
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:09,059
I see that you're
good with simple
puns, too.

343
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:10,825
More extra points
for you....

344
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,925
Darn it all! I
shouldn't have
given the straight
answer!

345
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:16,259
Morons! Every last
one of your! Morons!

346
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,225
And now for the
elevator pitch.

347
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,359
This is your last
chance to really
make an impact.
Best of luck!

348
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,859
Make an impact..?
What should I say?

349
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:26,825
I'll go first,
if you don't mind.

350
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:27,459
What!?

351
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:29,059
I win, Kabuto.

352
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:32,959
This story will have
such a huge impact,
they'll have no choice
but to go with me!

353
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:34,392
Get a load of
this,loser!

354
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,492
I'm not going to die!

355
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:44,125
This won't kill me
because, I love yo--

356
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:52,859
Oh my goodness! What
a heartwarming story!

357
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:57,025
He wanted to prove that
the love he felt for her
would protect him even
from death itself!

358
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,925
But in the end, he
was hit by a truck,
and... wait!

359
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,759
That's the wrong kind
of impact, you idiot!

360
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,759
Wow! That was great!

361
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,125
Huh?

362
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,725
First you played along,
then nailed the punchline!
It was amazing!

363
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:12,959
Even our very own
punchline wizard
Tenten isn't good enough
to pull a move like that!

364
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,292
What do you mean,
"punchline wizard?!"

365
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:17,959
And with that, you
just passed with a
perfect score!

366
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:18,959
Congratulations!

367
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:20,259
Agreed! You pass!

368
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:22,059
Three points for
Hara Taira!

369
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:23,825
Why the heck
are they betting!?

370
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:27,325
I... I passed?
Really?

371
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,225
Heh, I admit
defeat.

372
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:31,292
Lord Orochimaru...

373
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:35,392
Kabuto, before
when I said that
you were obviously
weaker than me...

374
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:36,992
I was bluffing.

375
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:38,025
Huh?

376
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,125
I wanted to force
you to step out
of my shadow.

377
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,425
To decide things on
your own terms! To
be all you can!

378
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:47,759
You're a very strong
man, Kabuto. Much
stronger than me...

379
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:52,092
I don't know what
to say...

380
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,459
Farewell, Kabuto.

381
00:20:56,025 --> 00:21:00,125
I'm sorry! I had
no idea, but I
understand now!

382
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,959
You were just trying to
help me grow! You have
a much bigger heart than
I could ever hope to have!

383
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:08,092
I know this is
sudden, but I'm quitting
as your new pal!

384
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,725
This was all part
of my plan.

385
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,359
I was going to
infiltrate your group,
gain your trust, and
take you all out!

386
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:16,759
But I am going to
beat you without any
of that underhanded
trickery!

387
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:20,259
[evil laughter]

388
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,792
You revealed your
true self, Kabuto!

389
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,892
Even if you hadn't
quit, you still lose!

390
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:26,792
Serves you right, you
traitorous buffoon!

391
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:32,092
You still think you're
better than me, do you?
[evil laughter]

392
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,925
Grrr... Why you
little..!

393
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,059
You were trying to so
the exact same thing!

394
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,959
I could tell right
away! You're not
fooling anybody!

395
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:42,959
No fair! Outing
me is against the
rules, you jerk!

396
00:21:42,992 --> 00:21:45,125
This is what makes
you a petulant pinhead!

397
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,825
That again!?
Seriously!?

398
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:48,892
I'm not a pinhead
you reptilian goon!

399
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:50,992
I don't know how
I've put up with
you for so long!

400
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:52,192
<i>(Orochimaru)</i>
<i>Shut up, you moody brat!</i>

401

What was that!?

<i>...Zero!</i>

<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>Five-star sushi, huh?</i>

409
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:57,847
(Lee)
So, if it is not on a
conveyor belt, do we just
spin around instead?

410
00:23:57,881 --> 00:23:59,414
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Seriously!? Of</i>

<i>Only mature adults eat</i>

412

(Lee)
Right right! I
understand now!

413
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:06,814
(Lee)
So I should order
quid, and then change
my order to sea urchin-

414
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:10,881
(Lee)
and then eat the whole thing,
and then complain about the
taste when I am done!

415
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:12,847

Excellent plan, right?
