00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:56,401
There are some battles in
life that one cannot afford
to lose. This, my friends, is

2
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:58,301
the story of one
such battle.

3
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,867
[groaning]

4
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:02,767
Really? Master Jiraiya?

5
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:06,834
Correct. We spoke, and he
has agreed to train the
three of us.

6
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,401
But it's so brutal!

7
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:13,867
Master Jiraiya is one of
the legendary Sannin, along
with Lady Tsunade and
Orochimaru, he's also

8
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:18,367
Naruto's master. Any training
sessions he conducts are sure
to be grueling.

9
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:23,734
Greetings, friends!
It's been a while!

10
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:29,967
The mystical, ethereal hermit
of Mount Myouboku, also known
throughout the world as the
Toad Sage!

11
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:33,567
Yes! It is I, the
gallant Jiraiya!

12
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:36,567
[groaning]

13
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:46,201
<i>"The Legendary</i>
<i>Sannin, Jiraiya"</i>

14
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:54,834
Well, what choice did I
have? The series is already
at Episode 46! If I didn't
make a grand entrance now,

15
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,834
I would have no chance
of leaving a lasting
impression!

16
00:02:57,867 --> 00:03:00,434
Who cares? It's about
time you showed up
again.

17
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:01,734
How did you hear me?

18
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:04,967
Tell me, why did you
just up and leave us
the way you did?

19
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:07,367
Uh, because, there was
no time to waste!

20
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:11,867
<i>While keeping Orochimaru</i>
<i>under surveillance, I</i>
<i>noticed he was starting to</i>
<i>make suspicious movements!</i>

21
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:15,334
Exactly what kind of
moves was he making
that caught your
attention?

22
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:19,767
Everything Orochimaru does
is suspicious! But there's
no point in challenging the

23
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:22,767
man's observations. I'd
better stay out of this
one.

24
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:26,701
<i>A shinobi never knows when</i>
<i>he'll be confronted with</i>
<i>danger. So he must always</i>

25
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:29,301
<i>be prepared to jump</i>
<i>into battle and fight!</i>

26
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:32,501
So tell me, did you
complete the training
I assigned you?

27
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,501
Yes, we did as
you asked.

28
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,501
Prepare to be
amazed, pervy sage!

29
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:40,734
It's the one and only
Sexy Triplet Jutsu!

30
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:43,834
Oh yeah! Everybody passes!

31
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,934
What in the world is
going on around here?!

32
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,234
You fail, however!
You project no
sexiness at all!

33
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,967
How can you say that?!

34
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:54,334
Don't worry about it, kid.
I'll whip him into shape
in no time. You can count
on that.

35
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,334
So, is everyone ready?

36
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:59,801
Thanks so much for taking
us to the hot springs for
a getaway, Lady Tsunade!

37
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,767
It's good to have a
girls-only retreat,
now and then.

38
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:07,967
Okay, boys, let's wrap
it up for today and
rejuvenate ourselves
with a hot bath!

39
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:08,601
Right!

40
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:09,467
Yes!

41
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:10,201
Sir!

42
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:12,501
[chuckling]

43
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:13,834
You plan to peep on
those girls, don't you?

44
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:17,601
[chattering]

45
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:19,934
Alright, men,
let's move!

46
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:22,034
Hold it right there!

47
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:26,401
I don't care if your
a Sannin or not, Master
Jiraiya! I won't let
you go peeping!

48
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,367
Don't try to stop
us, Neji! This is a
right of passage!

49
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:31,834
Peeping is part of
the legacy of being
a man!

50
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:34,301
Nothing you say is
going to change my
mind!

51
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:37,501
Listen, Neji. I
understand where you
are coming from.

52
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:41,701
I know we already did a
lot of fan service in
Episode 31, and after all

53
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:44,967
that, we do not want the
views thinking we are
out of ideas.

54
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,834
<i>That was the worst fan</i>
<i>service ever! And how</i>
<i>does that affect this</i>
<i>situation?!</i>

55
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:53,634
You forgot that in all of
it, there were no fan
service shots of Tenten
or Sakura?

56
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,301
Now, we can finally
have our revenge!

57
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:58,234
That is not an
excuse to peep!

58
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,934
It's easy to talk high
and mighty, but the bottom
line is, you could very

59
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,967
easily use that Byakugan
to peep in on them for
yourself!

60
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:07,234
Lady Hinata, do you
come here often?

61
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,901
What?! That's insane!
I would never do that!

62
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:14,201
Hinata's inside that spa!
And I'm not letting you
peep on her!

63
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:17,601
Wow, Hinata! They look
even bigger than last
time!

64
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:20,501
<i>It's embarrassing!</i>
<i>Please don't stare,</i>
<i>Tenten!</i>

65
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,567
Neji, you have got to
get a hold of yourself!

66
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,467
Be proud! You held out
longer than I thought
you would!

67
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,367
I didn't...
I mean...

68
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,267
Calm down! You
will be alright!

69
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:39,701
How pitiful...

70
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:43,567
Wow, your's are as
small as ever, Sakura.

71
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:44,934
<i>Stop trying to</i>
<i>touch them, Ino!</i>

72
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,601
<i>But they are</i>
<i>nicely shaped.</i>

73
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:49,567
Stop messing around,
girls, and get in
the water!

74
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:58,767
Come on! We haven't even
gotten to the hard part yet!

75
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:02,301
I have a feeling none
of them are ready for
this assignment.

76
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:04,967
Oh my goodness,
Lady Tsunade!

77
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,034
<i>[chuckling]</i>

78
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,934
<i>I can't let a bunch</i>
<i>of kids show me up!</i>

79
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,634
<i>I guess we lose...</i>

80
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:15,334
All that big talk,
and you get flattened,
at your age?

81
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:21,501
What's going on here? Every
one of us is collapsing like
a panicky child! There's no
one mature enough to play the

82
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:24,901
adult and be the straightman.
I feel like it should be me,
but...

83
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,867
<i>[sighing]</i>

84
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:31,301
That really hits
the spot!

85
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:34,434
I must say, you sort
of sound like a little
old man, Tenten.

86
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:38,467
Well, the truth is, it
feels like I don't have
to overreact today.

87
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:42,634
By the way, I thought
I saw some of the boys
with Jiraiya, on the
way in.

88
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:45,234
What? You think they're
trying to peep on us?

89
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:46,667
They'd better not be!

90
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,367
<i>He never changes.</i>

91
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,601
But he's supposed to be
the most mature of the
whole bunch!

92
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:55,634
Lee and Naruto will go
along with whatever
that man does!

93
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,534
<i>What? Naruto might...</i>
<i>Naruto might...</i>

94
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:04,701
Don't worry, ladies.
I anticipated this
problem, so...

95
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,501
I brought along
some backup.

96
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:11,967
Excuse me. Why are we
on anti-peeping guard
duty?

97
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:16,234
Lady Tsunade's orders.
Sorry, but there's nothing
we can do about it.

98
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:21,401
Hypocrites! If they were
given half a chance, they'd
be off peeping in the blink
of an eye!

99
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:25,501
The thing is, pervy sage,
most guys aren't as open
about it as you are.

100
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:27,201
You don't understand.

101
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:32,967
There are three categories
of peepers: Casual perverts,
closet perverts, and open
perverts. The closet perverts

102
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:37,234
seem to be cool, and they're
popular with the ladies. But
they're just a bunch of
cowards!

103
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,267
Wait! Why am I
in that group!

104
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:45,201
On the other hand, we open
perverts remain true to our
deepest desires, no matter
what the situation may be.

105
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:49,101
Lots of main characters
in Jump anime have this
personality trait.

106
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:52,434
<i>And for the record,</i>
<i>there are those who</i>
<i>are unaffiliated with</i>
<i>either group. Pay</i>

107
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:54,501
<i>attention, this will</i>
<i>all be on the test.</i>

108
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,934
And what test is that?!

109
00:07:56,967 --> 00:08:02,434
This is very interesting!
So being open perverts
defines us as Jump anime
main characters!

110
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,401
That's great!
I had no idea!

111
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:07,567
Naruto and Mr. Bushy-
Brow, you guys are
amazing.

112
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:10,367
Konohamaru, do you
have any idea what
you're saying?!

113
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:13,534
Yes, I do! And I'll
follow the path of
the open pervert!

114
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,101
You need to go
back to the path
of the Hokage!

115
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:19,267
Let's settle this once
and for all! It is my
contention, and I

116
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:22,901
believe this deeply,
that closet perverts are
no match for open perverts!

117
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:23,375
Yes!

118
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:24,001
Right!

119
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:25,501
I'm with you,
as well!

120
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,967
Why is everyone being
so confrontational?!

121
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:31,801
<i>You three handle Iruka</i>
<i>and Ebisu. Leave Kakashi</i>
<i>to me!</i>

122
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,067
Take formation
Alpha and charge!

123
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:34,834
Roger!

124
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,201
Hold on! This is
way too serious!

125
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:38,434
Move out!

126
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:39,801
<i>Don't do this!</i>

127
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:44,901
Don't fight it!
You're going to let
us pass, Kakashi!

128
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:47,467
Well, I didn't expect
you to attack head-on.

129
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:51,234
Yeah? I know you well
enough, not to try and
sneak around you.

130
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:54,467
Considering the dirty
novels you read around
women, you have no right

131
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,134
to try to stop me,
Sexual Harassment
Sensei!

132
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:58,067
Huh?

133
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:02,234
Don't bother, Naruto.
Kakashi has sided with
the sullen squad!

134
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:03,934
What are you
talking about?

135
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:08,134
Our Open Pervert Squad
is strong! We cannot
retreat now!

136
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:11,267
What are you doing?!
Stop dividing us into
weird squads!

137
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,867
Sorry, boys,
but I'm afraid...

138
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,101
...we can't let
you through!

139
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,334
Iruka and Ebisu
sensei...

140
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:19,034
Double team! The
jutsu we need is...

141
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,067
...A Sexy Sandwich Jutsu!

142
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,001
What?! No way!

143
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:32,101
Our jutsu isn't working
on these closet perverts!

144
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,201
Jeez! What's
going on here?!

145
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,767
[chuckling]

146
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:42,267
Well guess what? You
two aren't the only ones
who've grown stronger
around here!

147
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:46,167
We've been training day
in and day out, to become
mightier than ever!

148
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:49,034
<i>That's not training!</i>
<i>You're just reading</i>
<i>dirty books!</i>

149
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:53,834
And because of that,
your pitiful techniques
are useless! They're
unable to affect us!

150
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,834
[growling]

151
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:02,601
Uh! The pressure's
getting to me! Ebisu
Sensei looks all buff!

152
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:05,934
What in the world?!
Wrong anime here, guys!

153
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:08,967
It's no use,
everyone. We
can't win.

154
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:11,201
Do not quit on
us, Konohamaru!

155
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:13,867
Oh, brother
Bushy-Brow!

156
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:16,567
It is important that
you remember your
training!

157
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:19,001
<i>He's right! The</i>
<i>training is vital!</i>

158
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:22,534
Have you trained for
anything besides the
Sexy Jutsu?

159
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:25,634
The most important thing
to remember is, never
give up hope!

160
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,067
The fact is, only when
you quit, will the battle
be truly over.

161
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:33,834
That's wrong! Hey!
You're talking about
a lesson from a
different series!

162
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:38,367
I have an idea. I think
we can use their positions
as teachers to undermine
them!

163
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:43,301
Time for a Sexy Teacher-
Student Forbidden Romance
Jutsu!

164
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:44,834
Someone help us!

165
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:50,334
Great plan. The closet
squad's intelligence and
imagination may be off the
charts, but they're not

166
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:54,901
used to a direct attack on
their psyche. He knew that
and took advantage.

167
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:59,567
Tell me something? Why
are you explaining this
ridiculous scene so
seriously?

168
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,034
Um... Uh...

169
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,834
I don't...
Uhh...

170
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:06,234
Sensei...

171
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:07,901
I...

172
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,001
Uhhh!

173
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:13,301
[screaming]

174
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:15,634
Alright! We did it!

175
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:19,967
<i>I knew they were really</i>
<i>closet perverts! That's</i>
<i>how it happened when I</i>
<i>beat them, back in the day!</i>

176
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,467
We're really
closet perverts?

177
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:24,567
I don't remember
being like this!

178
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:28,101
Can't a guy read a book
in peace around here?

179
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:31,834
You do realize that I'm
the author of the very
book you're reading, right?

180
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:35,801
I'd never thought I'd
have to fight you,
Lord Jiraiya.

181
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:39,867
We're going in
there, Kakashi!

182
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:46,234
Two powerful shinobi,
facing off in the name
of passion. Will Lee and
his friends finally go

183
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:51,301
through their beloved
right of passage? We'll
find out, in the second
half of this episode!

184
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:55,434
Hope I am featured more
in the rest of this story.
I was barely in this half.

185
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:11,191
Lord Jiraiya's desire to
peep on the girls in the
hot springs has forced him
into battle against Kakashi

186
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:15,436
Hatake. Who will prevail
in this confrontation?
Will Lee and the boys

187
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,870
finally get to go through
their right of passage.

188
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,370
This is dangerous. If
Master Jiraiya and Kakashi
go at it, the collateral
damage will be huge!

189
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:25,636
And it's all just
so he can peep!

190
00:12:27,803 --> 00:12:29,003
Are you ready?

191
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,803
The summoning?

192
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,703
[chuckling]

193
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:42,670
My most hardcore work.
It was deemed too graphic
to be published. You
feeling lucky, Kakashi?

194
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:43,736
That's gross!

195
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,770
Well, I do want
to read it...

196
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,936
Hold on! Don't
give in so easily!

197
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,936
[nervous breathing]

198
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,570
Oh my goodness!

199
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:54,603
I win!

200
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,503
The poor man never
had a chance.

201
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:06,570
<i>"Infiltrate the</i>
<i>Women's Bath!"</i>

202
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,803
And so, the Pervert
Squad, led by Master
Jiraiya, charged ahead,
toward the women's bath!

203
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:17,436
The guards are defeated!
Now no one stands in our
way!

204
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,236
Yeah!

205
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,403
But that's not
the real problem!

206
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,403
I can't stop them.

207
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,570
I can't see anything!

208
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:27,470
Quit shoving!

209
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:28,770
Move over, willya?!

210
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:31,370
<i>Stop it! Settle</i>
<i>down, boys!</i>

211
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:32,403
Wow!

212
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,103
Someone is there!

213
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:35,836
<i>Who is it? Is</i>
<i>it Sakura?! Oh</i>
<i>please tell me</i>
<i>it's Sakura!</i>

214
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,936
[groaning]

215
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,736
Who's there?

216
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,336
[screaming]

217
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,303
[sighing]

218
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:58,836
Luckily, I switched the
Men's and Women's signs,
once Lady Tsunade and the
girls were safely inside.

219
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,503
I wonder why they
were screaming, though.

220
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:03,303
Well, whatever...

221
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:06,870
Jiraiya and Lee, and
Naruto, as well!

222
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,803
Orochimaru! I should have
guessed that you were up
to something suspicious!

223
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:12,836
What in the world
are you doing here?!

224
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,070
What's shaking, Jiraiya?
I haven't seen you in a
while...

225
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,770
[chuckling]

226
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:22,603
We're in big trouble,
Kabuto. We came to the
hot springs just for a
little vacation, not

227
00:14:22,636 --> 00:14:24,936
to confront Jiraiya!
Why is this happening?!

228
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,403
I don't know! I
don't understand
it, either.

229
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:33,403
Jiraiya's suspicions were
aroused earlier, when he
spotted Orochimaru visiting
a local bookstore. He would

230
00:14:33,436 --> 00:14:37,036
never believe that his
nemesis was really just
there to read some travel
books.

231
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,536
There are lots of interesting
places we could visit locally,
even just for a day trip!

232
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,270
Orochimaru is one of
the legendary Sannin,
and an incredible ninja
in his own right.

233
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:51,370
He has been reduced to a
bumbling villain in this
anime series. Now here we
are, all the way to episode

234
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:54,836
46. He is overdue to
try something seriously
evil!

235
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:57,536
You must keep your
guard up, everybody.

236
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,636
Yes, sir!

237
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:02,670
What the-?! Kabuto, they've
forced us into a corner by
catching us off guard!

238
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,703
<i>We can't just say</i>
<i>we're on vacation,</i>
<i>now!</i>

239
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:08,470
There's no choice! We'll
have to bluff our way out,
Lord Orochimaru!

240
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:10,336
Hmm. Very well...

241
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:14,003
I'm preparing to crush
the Leaf Village at
this very minute!

242
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:17,870
That's a lie! You're
not about to crush
anything, wearing a
towel!

243
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:20,936
And what's going on
with you, Jiraiya?
What are you up to?

244
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,936
Same as always. I
just want to see
some naked broads!

245
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,470
I'm afraid you sound
like the evil one here,
Master Jiraiya!

246
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:28,736
[chuckling]

247
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,303
What should I do,
Kabuto? I thought that
would intimidate them,

248
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:33,036
but they're not
responding correctly!

249
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:36,003
You'll just have
to improvise!

250
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,870
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't exactly tell
you the truth! We're
here on vacation!

251
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:43,336
<i>They're never going</i>
<i>to buy that!</i>

252
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,336
As one of the legendary
Sannin, you need to keep
up the act. Besides,
you're good at improv.

253
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,536
Try something and
see if it works!

254
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,903
I'll give it a shot!

255
00:15:51,936 --> 00:15:54,536
[chuckling]

256
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:55,936
[nervous groaning]

257
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,703
[chuckling]

258
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,003
[groaning]

259
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,003
[screaming]

260
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:06,003
I can't believe this!
Of all the times to
have evil plan writer's
block!

261
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:10,770
What's going on with
you?! Your ridiculously
unrealistic imagination
is your biggest weak

262
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,370
spot, but it's your
greatest weapon,
as well!

263
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:16,870
So telling them it's
top-secret or classified
information, won't be
good enough.

264
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:17,836
Is that what
you're saying?

265
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,770
<i>Of course!</i>

266
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:19,303
Agh!

267
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:19,793
[gasp]

268
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,736
I should have realized!
In previous episodes,
your plans have centered

269
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,036
around you infiltrating
our ranks, undetected!

270
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,036
I bet you snuck into
the bath house because
you are using it in your
plan, somehow!

271
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,570
Really? Is that
right, Orochimaru?

272
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:33,803
Well, I, uh...

273
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:38,470
I didn't even think of
that, but now would be
my chance to get some
momentum going.

274
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:43,636
That's right! Very
astute! My plan does
involve this bath house!

275
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,736
<i>Ah ha! I should</i>
<i>have known!</i>

276
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,503
Huh?

277
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:51,703
You saw everyone was
shampooing their hair!
You might as well confess
now, you creep! I bet the

278
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:54,303
plan was to get shampoo
in everybody's eyes!

279
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:57,603
Seriously? What a
disgusting plot!
It's horrifying!

280
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:02,036
If he did that, no one
in the village would be
able to wash their dirty
hair!

281
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,236
This cut away just looks
like you're sad that you
can't peep along with
everybody else!

282
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,936
I didn't even think of
that! But since the idea
seems to scare them so
much...

283
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:12,636
Try this on for size!

284
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,703
There's no point in
shampooing your own
hair, Lord Orochimaru!

285
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:19,970
You won't get away with
this, mister! I won't
get one speck of shampoo
in my eyes!

286
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:22,070
I am doing just
fine, so far!

287
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:23,670
[nervous chatter]

288
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,136
It hurts!

289
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,536
Why are you all
playing along?!

290
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,970
Orochimaru!

291
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,070
This is absurd! I
guarantee you, he's
plotting something
else!

292
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:33,136
What? Huh?

293
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,936
Why do you say
that, Neji?

294
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,236
Well now, think about
it. So far, all we've
seen him do is put on
shampoo and wash his hair.

295
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,536
<i>Notice he hasn't made any</i>
<i>move to enter the water</i>
<i>yet. That tells me his</i>
<i>real aim is the hot spring</i>
!

296
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,303
Oh, of course! It's obvious!
It's a conspiracy to try and
make us stay in the water
too long!

297
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,970
You sure about that?
But what would be the
point?

298
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:57,503
I understand it. The
Leaf Villagers would get
overheated, and start to
feel dizzy!

299
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:01,636
And you're getting
overheated from something
entirely different!

300
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,636
I actually never would
have thought of that!
But what the heck!

301
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:11,603
Jiraiya is right! I
plan to make all of you
suffer from the effects
of your extra-long soak!

302
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:15,170
If that's the case,
what's the point of
us being here, m'lord!

303
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,636
You will not defeat us!
We can spend hours in
the bath and never get
overheated!

304
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,570
That's right!

305
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,670
[groaning]

306
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,036
Are you crazy?!
You're falling into
Orochimaru's trap!

307
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,436
But nothing is happening!
I wonder if his real plan is
to get us to go underwater,

308
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,370
to see who can hold his
breath the longest.

309
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:37,003
Better not be! He's
got a big surprise
coming!

310
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,236
Time for a little
fast forward action!

311
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:43,536
What happened here? My
eyes sting, I'm overheated,
and now I'm trying to hold

312
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,103
my breath longer than
these imbeciles!

313
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,403
Enough of this
foolishness!

314
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:50,270
Oh yeah, I get it now!

315
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,070
Stop getting things!

316
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:55,603
I should have figured it
out earlier. He's going to
make the Leaf Villagers

317
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,370
suffer by forcing us to
do synchronized swimming!

318
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:00,970
That makes no
sense at all!

319
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:02,970
Stop! I've had it
with you people!

320
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:07,270
I'm not putting up with
any more of your nonsense!
I swear, I'm going to

321
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,203
destroy you and the Leaf
Village, with my bare
hands!

322
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:11,903
[heavy breathing]

323
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:14,336
Any reason you couldn't
have done this from the
beginning?

324
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:16,736
No choice. We have
to use that jutsu.

325
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,670
Got it!

326
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:21,370
Sexy Bath time Jutsu!

327
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:25,303
Ooohh! Victory
is assured!

328
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:28,636
So what?

329
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,670
What? No way! Our
sexy jutsu had no
effect!

330
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:38,403
You know, maybe he
isn't really a man,
after all!

331
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:40,470
I am one hundred
percent male!

332
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:45,036
It's Sai! Have you
been here at the hot
springs, all along?

333
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,236
Naruto...

334
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:46,970
Huh?

335
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,003
Does he...

336
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,736
...have an Orochi-
[honking]

337
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,970
Uh, what exactly are
you asking about?

338
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,636
<i>Uh...Can we instead</i>
<i>call it his Orochi-</i>
<i>[honking]</i>

339
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,470
Why don't you just
say Orochi-
[honking]

340
00:19:58,036 --> 00:19:59,636
Hey. That's mean!

341
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,270
Okey dokey. You all
seem pretty busy, so
I'm gonna take off.

342
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,136
What was that
all about?

343
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:09,570
Forget about him! Listen,
we have to hit Orochi-
[ding] with the you know
what!

344
00:20:09,603 --> 00:20:11,236
Don't call me Orochi-
[ding]

345
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,536
No problem!

346
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,936
Rasengan!

347
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:16,736
You go get
him, Naruto!

348
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,336
Wha-? That is amazing!

349
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,570
What is it, Lee?

350
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:23,436
I mean, through some
miracle, they have
made a new jutsu!

351
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,270
You're sure about that?

352
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,370
Ahh!

353
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:32,303
It is Boobsengan,
I tell you! Sakura's
boobs have become two
perfect Rasengans!

354
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:35,203
The Master Student's
Rasengan has a brand
new name!

355
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:38,170
Horrible! Even I may
not be able to dodge
that one!

356
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,436
Eat this, pal!

357
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,503
[weeping]

358
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:46,470
Hey, Bushy-Brow! Why
did you jump into our
Rasengan?!

359
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:53,936
I am sandwiched in
between Sakura's boobies.
Sandwiched between Sakura's
boobies. Boobies. Boobies.

360
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:58,570
[screaming]

361
00:20:58,603 --> 00:21:02,970
I've never seen the guy
so excited! He's riding
the wave of a pure
power burst!

362
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:08,036
[screaming]

363
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,603
Alright, we
pulled it off!

364
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:12,236
Huh?!

365
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:18,503
You perverts!

366
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:22,270
What in the world?

367
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:25,170
That's my bra! And
just how did it get
on top of your head?

368
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:28,570
I hope you're ready for
some pain! 'Cause you're
gonna pay!

369
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:33,503
Is that some kind of
threat? A man is always
ready for a little pain.

370
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:34,603
[attack yell]

371
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:39,503
[screaming]

372
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:41,570
I wasn't part
of this...

373
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:44,570
Idiot...
Idiot...

374
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:46,670
[groaning]

375
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:53,736
I swear I'll crush these
guys before the last episode
of the series. You're with
me, right, Kabuto?

376
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,036
Yes, Lord Orochi-
[ding]

377
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,636
Stop! Don't
call me that!

378
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,436
Of course, Orochi-
[ding]

379
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,070
<i>Stop making fun of me!</i>

380
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:03,103
As you wish,
Orochi-
[ding, ding]

381
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:05,703
<i>Ugh! Where's my</i>
<i>Kusanagi Blade?!</i>

382
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,699
That Rock Lee and Naruto
are just the worst!

383
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:51,957
<i>You said it! Peeping</i>
<i>toms are scum!</i>

384
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,890
You know what? I say
we put the smack down on
them, Ino!

385
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:56,624
<i>Wait! Can we talk</i>
<i>about this?!</i>

386
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,224
<i>Next time on Rock Lee and</i>
<i>Friends: "Dogs Need Dog</i>
<i>Friends." and "The Shinobi</i>
<i>You've Been Waiting For!"</i>

387
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:05,924
<i>You should have told us</i>
<i>earlier that this was</i>
<i>coming up!</i>

388
00:24:05,957 --> 00:24:11,624
<i>Seriously! What's going on in</i>
<i>that pea brain of yours? We</i>
<i>need time to fix our makeup,</i>
<i>among other things! Bye! Bye!</i>

389
00:24:11,657 --> 00:24:14,524
<i>Go figure. Women</i>
<i>are so fickle!</i>
