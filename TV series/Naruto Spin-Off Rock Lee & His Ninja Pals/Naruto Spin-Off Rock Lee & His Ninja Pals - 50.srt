No. My Drunken Fist. But I have
done so much spinning around...

...that I am no longer able to
put myself in a drunk-like

to make yourself feel dizzy and
nauseous?

Becoming an adult doesn't happen

Yes! Learning! Good idea!

And here is where I
begin the journey.

Coffee. No cream.

138
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:27,207
Drinking your coffee black

<i>I would like to buy a suit!</i>

140

A suit doesn't make you an

00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:38,707
Just drive. Take me somewhere

<i>and we avoid an international</i>

Here goes! I'm afraid I do have
some conditions.

269
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:37,672
One, I refuse to change my last
name, and two, I am not moving

Yes. Protect the family.

condition. He'll have to live
with <i>her</i> and join her clan.

298
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:27,952
You just came to make fun of me.

299
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:36,852
Huh! Wait a second. Guy could be
<i>my ace in the hole. If I can</i>
take advantage of his dimwitted
<i>tendency to speak and act...</i>

300
00:18:36,886 --> 00:18:43,019
<i>...without thinking, I might</i>
<i>still be able to sabotage this</i>
<i>interview! I'll just wait for</i>
<i>him to say something dumb.</i>

301
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:45,986
<i>I admire your courage in even</i>
<i>considering this marriage.</i>

302
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:51,919
<i>I mean, she may be the Hokage,</i>
but she's also a foul-tempered,
<i>compulsive gambler without any</i>
<i>feminine charm whatsoever...</i>

303
00:18:51,952 --> 00:18:53,552
All right, enough!

304
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:54,586
Huh?

305
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:59,819
That move! Supersonic Bondage
jutsu can only be mastered by
one who's been chosen by the...

306
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,719
...gods of sadism!

307
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:03,086
[All] Amazing!

308
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,319
Huh?

309
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,452
[Cheering]
Very well done!

310
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:09,219
With Guy Sensei's invaluable
assistance, of course.

311
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:12,019
<i>You're kidding! Nothing I do</i>
<i>works!</i>

312
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:16,186
So then, tell us, what do you do
in your time off, when you're
not gambling?

313
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:22,586
<i>Huh! I've got one more chance!</i>
<i>All right, this is it, I'm</i>
<i>putting everything on black!</i>

314
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:30,186
Well, when I'm not gambling I,
spend all day in my pajamas!

315
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,019
Huh?

316
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:35,519
I win!

317
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:37,452
[Screams]

318
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:42,386
By doing that, you are saving
water and electricity by cutting
back on your laundry, right?

319
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:45,119
Frugality is a very
good trait for a wife!

320
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,352
And for the environment!

321
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,819
Yes, the environment!

322
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:55,852
I can't win for losing. But it's
<i>not fair, he cheated! [Sigh]</i>
<i>Does this really mean I'm</i>
<i>about to get married?</i>

323
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:57,786
<i>Flex it!</i>

324
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,786
We're ready to serve your meals.

325
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,119
<i>Ramen?</i>

326
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,919
The A entrée is
Ichiraku ramen.

327
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:10,086
We finally come to a nice
restaurant and <i>this</i> is what we
get?

328
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:16,052
<i>And for the B entrée , filet</i>
<i>mignon à la Hidden Cloud with</i>
<i>red wine sauce.</i>

329
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:17,919
You got to be kidding,

330
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:18,952
That looks good.

331
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,619
Yeah, the B was definitely
the better choice. You win,
Lady Tsunade.

332
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:29,319
What? Oh, win, me? Impossible. I
can't win at this point.

333
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:32,786
[Chewing]

334
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:36,452
Yum! You're right! It's
delicious!

335
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,219
Yes. Delicious indeed.

336
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:45,152
The two of them even have the
same taste in food! It's a
perfect match!

337
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:47,186
That settles it!

338
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:53,752
I am proud to have helped you
find a cure for your loneliness!

339
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,786
It was all rather pricey...

340
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:59,119
... <i>But well worth it if it</i>
<i>means that you have found</i>
<i>wedded bliss at last!</i>

341
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:03,219
Hello? Wedded what?
Come again?

342
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,419
Uhh, well you and Lady Tsunade
just had your marriage
interview.

343
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:09,852
We what? What are
you talking about?

344
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:15,919
I have no intention of marrying
the Hokage or anyone. I'm only
here because I knew I'd get a
good meal.

345
00:21:16,386 --> 00:21:18,986
Goodbye, everyone.
[Gasping]

346
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:24,386
Woohoo!

347
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:32,219
I was worried there for a while,
but actually these marriage
interviews are kinda fun!

348
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:34,886
Hate to disappoint you, better
luck next time, kids!

349
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:38,152
Huh?

350
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:48,052
<i>Looks like it's rice and water</i>
<i>again. [Sigh]</i>

351
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:49,519
[Stomach Rumbles]

352
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:52,186
Huh? <i>Lee!</i>

353
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:54,186
[Gasps] Uh, yes?

354
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,419
How about another marriage
interview? Can you set it up for
me?

355
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:03,152
I'm thinking we should do surf
and turf this time!

356
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:06,386
No! Please give me a break!

357
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:50,604
Next time, we have The Final
Battle and Our Final Mission is
S-Ranked!

358
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,065
Which means that Sakura and I
are finally getting married!

359
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,532
<i>Good for you, Lee.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

360
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:58,232
Thanks, Neji! I could never
have done it without you!

361
00:23:58,265 --> 00:23:59,965
<i>Hold on! What are you talking</i>
<i>about?</i>

362
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,832
Before the final battle, the
hero always asks the girl he
loves if she will marry him when
it is all over.

363
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:06,265
And the girl always says yes!

364
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,099
<i>It's common knowledge.</i>

365
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:13,832
No it's not! And anyway, the guy
<i>who proposes always ends up</i>
<i>dying in the battle, so if I</i>
were you I'd keep my mouth shut!
