1
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:54,894
The cherry blossoms are falling,
the birds are singing, the
weather is perfect...

2
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:59,827
...nature is glowing a vibrant
green! And I'm out of breath.
[Loud Inhale]

3
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:01,961
It is time for the sports meet!

4
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:11,227
And now, here to read the pledge
<i>of good sportsmanship is our</i>
<i>own Rock Lee!</i>

5
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:13,661
I pledge!

6
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:15,927
I can't believe they picked
Bushy Brow...

7
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,961
Oh, you're just jealous that
he's the center of attention.

8
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:21,294
No I'm not! I'm just envious
it's not me!

9
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:24,661
Do you really think he's going
to make it through the whole
pledge?

10
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:30,061
Well he better! I spent all day
yesterday helping him memorize
it! He should be fine...

11
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:37,961
We...we are uh...we uh...uhh...

12
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,094
<i>He's totally blanking!</i>

13
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,727
Umm...Uhh...

14
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:47,961
Come on, Lee!

15
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:50,594
<i>You spent all day on</i>
<i>this, think!</i>

16
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:57,327
We, we uhh...

17
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:04,994
We are...we are...we are
uh...Uh, we are here right...?

18
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:07,994
We are here today!

19
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:09,227
[Sighs]

20
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:10,927
He finally remember.

21
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:13,861
To celebrate our graduation!

22
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,294
[Cheering]

23
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:16,394
[Grunts]

24
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:18,361
This isn't a high school
graduation!

25
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,227
[Screaming]

26
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:23,027
[Explosion Sounds]

27
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:32,794
"The Leaf Village Sports Meet."

28
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:38,161
[Sigh] I completely
messed that up...

29
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:40,761
And I practiced so hard!

30
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,927
It's okay. It happens
sometimes.

31
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,661
Yes, don't let it get
to you.

32
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:46,227
That is it!

33
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,194
I will just have to redeem
myself by coming in first in
every single event today!

34
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:53,261
I think he let it
get to him...

35
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:56,261
I know you're upset, but you're
getting too worked up, even for
you!

36
00:03:56,294 --> 00:04:01,361
Of course I am worked up! It is
what I do! But this is not just
about reclaiming my honor!

37
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:04,761
This meet has really got my
blood pumping extra hard!

38
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:10,161
It is a competition to show off
your athleticism, strength, and
<i>bikini briefs!</i>

39
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,694
Yes, you're right Lee. But at
the same time, you're so very,
very wrong.

40
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:17,361
Since I cannot use ninjutsu, a
sports competition...

41
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:20,294
...is the perfect venue for me
to demonstrate my skills!

42
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,894
So I have to succeed here,
no matter what!

43
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:24,761
[Grunts]

44
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:27,194
Stop focusing your power in
your bottom!

45
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:29,827
Remember, if you put too much
mental pressure on yourself...

46
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,394
...then you'll be too nervous
to succeed.

47
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:32,561
Yes that's right!

48
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:33,694
[Grunts]

49
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:34,627
Huh?

50
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:39,227
If you strain yourself too much,
you'll only be able to use half
your strength, Lee.

51
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,794
So what should I do then?

52
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,127
Simple, you don't sweat it!

53
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:46,294
<i>I know better than anyone how</i>
<i>hard you try.</i>

54
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,294
<i>You've been running at my side</i>
<i>for a long time now.</i>

55
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:54,094
But when you run together, your
hard work just turns into random
weirdness!

56
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:59,827
Just have faith in yourself! If
you go into this with your usual
focus, you'll win for sure!

57
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:02,294
Remember that, no matter what
may happen!

58
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:04,094
Yes! I will remember!

59
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,061
<i>Hold up!</i>
Huh?!

60
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,361
You're not even wearing the
right outfits!

61
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:10,627
<i>Idiot! Idiot!</i>

62
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,861
So, have you finally calmed
down now Lee?

63
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:15,827
Yes! I'm loose and relaxed!

64
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:18,194
A little too loose.
if you asked me!

65
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:21,861
I am going to sweep this entire
competition, just you watch me!

66
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:24,727
I will not even let you two
beat me, either!

67
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:28,794
Talking big again, huh? Well, it
looks like you're back to
normal, Lee.

68
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,261
Yeah, but is that
good or bad?

69
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:33,261
Our first event is going
to be the foot race!

70
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:37,694
<i>Have faith in myself...</i>

71
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:40,327
<i>If I stay confident, I will</i>
<i>succeed!</i>

72
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,561
On your marks...Get set...

73
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:48,894
Whoa! No way!

74
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,327
Sometime today, Kakashi Sensei!
[Gun Shot]

75
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:52,694
[Grunts]

76
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:55,927
I am not done yet!

77
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,227
[Screaming]

78
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,194
Huh?

79
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,794
Coming through, Bushy Brow!

80
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:04,127
No come back here!
[Screaming]

81
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:07,961
I am still not done yet!

82
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:11,627
[Screaming]

83
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:15,894
Ahh! [Embarrassed Laugh]

84
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:21,127
[Grunting]

85
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:24,294
<i>The winner is Naruto!</i>

86
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:26,961
I am still not done yet!

87
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:28,027
Huh?

88
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:33,061
I will win, I will lose. I will
win, I will lose.

89
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,694
You totally rock, Naruto!

90
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:38,727
I mean you're completely
cleaning up in this meet!

91
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:39,861
Yay me!

92
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:41,994
Honestly though, it was more
luck than anything.

93
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,327
Huh?! Hey, it wasn't luck at
all! I'm just that good! Watch,
I'm gonna win this whole thing!

94
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:49,327
[Lee Mumbling]
You're letting this get to you
too much.

95
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:50,894
[Lee Mumbling]
Are you okay, Lee?

96
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:54,927
I will lose...
This cannot be happening.

97
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:58,994
Guy Sensei told me that if I
just had confidence, I would win
for sure!

98
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,961
Knock it off, you're
being annoying!
Champion, Champion, I'm
number one!

99
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:02,961
<i>Naruto!</i>
Huh?

100
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:04,827
Uh, Bushy Brow?

101
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:05,861
You okay?

102
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,727
I am still not done yet.

103
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,827
I swear...I swear that I...

104
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:13,961
I will defeat you Naruto!

105
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:14,794
[Grunts]

106
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:17,294
If you think you've got what it
takes then bring it on!

107
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:21,261
Our next competition is just
about to begin! It's the
scavenger hunt!

108
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:25,727
<i>Each competitor will draw from</i>
<i>the box a card with an item</i>
<i>written on it.</i>

109
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:28,761
<i>They'll then have to find and</i>
<i>borrow that item from someone.</i>

110
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,161
<i>The first person to cross the</i>
<i>goal with their item wins!</i>

111
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:35,794
Lady Tsunade, tell us: what do
you think the key is to winning
a race like this?

112
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:37,661
Just pure luck...

113
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:38,694
There you have it!

114
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,727
Will Naruto continue his string
of victories? Will Rock Lee win
<i>his challenge to the current</i>
<i>leader?</i>

115
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:47,694
Will a new front-runner emerge?
<i>Is anyone even listening?</i>

116
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:48,694
<i>On your marks...</i>

117
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:52,061
There is no way I am going to
lose to this time, Naruto!

118
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:53,894
Let's do it, Bushy Brow!

119
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:56,561
Let's just stay calm and move
apart, you guys.

120
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,261
Get set...Woah!

121
00:07:58,294 --> 00:07:58,927
[Bang!]

122
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:00,927
<i>And they're off!</i>

123
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,194
Don't forget about me!

124
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,627
Neji Hyuga takes an early lead!

125
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:08,261
He's got his card! But it seems
<i>that something is wrong...</i>

126
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:11,094
<i>"A somewhat melancholy..."</i>

127
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:12,294
<i>"Ghost?!"</i>

128
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,861
What a shocking item for him to
have to find! How will he handle
<i>it?</i>

129
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:21,794
I'm not going to let this
obstacle defeat me!

130
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:24,261
Eight Trigrams Rotation!

131
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:25,861
Where are you going, Neji?!

132
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:31,027
It appears that Neji has just
exited the arena in order to go
see if he can find a ghost!

133
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:35,327
Lady Tsunade, in your opinion,
what would you say went wrong
for Neji in this event?

134
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,227
Just bad luck.

135
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:38,227
There you have it!

136
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:40,061
Sakura's about to draw her card
<i>now!</i>

137
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:42,727
Oh boy, I hope that I get
something easier!

138
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:45,094
<i>'A fleeting dream within a</i>
<i>dream."</i>

139
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,161
She's picked a very lightweight
<i>item!</i>

140
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,194
How the heck do I find something
like this?!

141
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:53,861
<i>These competitors find</i>
<i>themselves utterly stumped</i>
<i>by their difficult items!</i>

142
00:08:53,894 --> 00:08:57,561
<i>It seems that Lady Tsunade's</i>
<i>analysis was correct: it all</i>
<i>comes down to luck!</i>

143
00:08:57,827 --> 00:09:02,327
<i>God, Buddha, Great Spaghetti</i>
Monster...whoever is listening,
<i>please grant me luck!</i>

144
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:06,827
<i>It seems neither God nor</i>
anyone else heard! The card says
<i>"sweet devil!"</i>

145
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:08,961
<i>Hey, wasn't that a song in the</i>
<i>70's?</i>

146
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:12,627
I do not have time to track down
a copy of that song!

147
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:14,861
But I cannot let Naruto win this
event!

148
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:19,127
Maybe my card will give me a
way to help Lee somehow...

149
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:21,027
<i>Tenten has made her pick...</i>

150
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:26,894
<i>"A thrilling conclusion where</i>
your best friend's defeat makes
you snap and awakens your latent
<i>powers!"</i>

151
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:28,627
<i>Wait, that's been done before.</i>

152
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:33,127
This isn't a scavenger hunt,
it's a silly mess, and I don't
want to mess around with it
anymore!

153
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:35,561
You okay, Lee?

154
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:37,094
What is <i>that</i> ?!

155
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,061
And now, for the
second stage...

156
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:41,261
How did you draw that
summoning circle so fast?!

157
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:44,227
All that I have to do is dial
the number listed here!

158
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:46,994
What?! You can't just summon
devils over the phone!

159
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:50,061
Yes, hello there. I am over at
the sports stadium for the
competition today.

160
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:52,094
Could you please send over a
devil right away?

161
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,327
[Tenten Angrily Screaming]
All you have to do is head
toward downtown and make a right
turn on Shuuei...

162
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:59,627
All right, I'm gonna finish
Bushy Brow off right now!

163
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,827
Huh?

164
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,894
Uhh...

165
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:07,161
Naruto seems to be confused by
what's written on his card.

166
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:08,861
Hmm.

167
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:09,627
Huh?

168
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:11,894
What is it, Naruto?

169
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:17,794
Well, uh...This is hard to say
but I kinda sorta need to borrow
something from you, Sakura...

170

172
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:25,861
What?!

173
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,727
I really only need to borrow
them for a minute...

174

Okay. Yeah.

181
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,760
The scavenger hunt's been called
<i>off due to injury...</i>

182
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:05,293
...and because all anyone found

[Grunting]

184
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:10,526
Sorry I hit you.
The real problem was all the
weird stuff we had to find, not
your injury.

185
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,793
It's only my head.

186
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:14,926
Next we'll begin the red versus
white cheerleading competition!

187
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,626
What? Cheerleading?!

188
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,726
I have to win the next one! I
will win! There is no doubt! I
will win for sure!

189
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,660
What is wrong with winning? Is
there a law against it? I do not
think so! Although I guess I
should check...

190
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:30,526
Maybe it would help Lee get back
on track if I cheered him on...

191
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:37,826
[Cheering]
Wahhoo! Yeah!

192
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:42,860
<i>But I don't know...I'd be so</i>
<i>embarrassed to wear a</i>
<i>cheerleading uniform!</i>

193
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:44,593
<i>Hmm...</i>

194
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,026
But you know what! I'll do it
for Lee!

195

[Cheering]

196
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:55,126
[Cheering] Go! Go! White team
go!

197
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,760
No this is wrong I'm having
doubts about this!

198
00:11:58,026 --> 00:12:02,293
Fight! Fight! White team fight!
Fight! Fight! White team fight!

199
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:03,226
Totally, you know?!

200
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,793
Thats definitely wrong, no
doubt about it!

201
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:09,826
Hooray! Hooray! Red team go!
Hooray! Hooray! Red team go!

202
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,193
Aw, thanks, Sajura! You rock!

203
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:14,460
I will do my best
too, Sakura!

204
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:19,760
What are you getting all pumped
up for?! They're cheering for
the other team!

205
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:21,093
I am sorry, Tenten!

206
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,093
We're about to move on to our
next event! Time for the
tug-of-war to begin!

207
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:30,860
<i>Unlike team tug-of-war</i>
<i>competitions, these will be</i>
<i>one-on-one matches.</i>

208
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,826
Does our color commentator, Lady
Tsunade have any insight on how
to win this one?

209
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,193
Have good luck.

210
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:38,460
There you have it...

211
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,893
Are you ready for
this Lee?

212
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:44,193
Of course I am!

213
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:48,626
Because Guy Sensei told me that
if I just believe in myself, I
will win for sure!

214
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,093
Okay, but in case it doesn't go
that way, try to remember...

215
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:54,460
...if you need anything, I'm
right here.

216
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:56,526
Thank you, but I am fine!

217
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,760
I will show everyone that
I can win on my own!

218
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:00,626

wrap this up!

What is that?

247

A Mr. Rock Lee placed an order
for a devil. Could you please
tell me where to find him?

the brink of defeat!

254
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,126
Hey, wait a second! Isn't this
supposed to be a one-on-one
tug-of-war?

255
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,726
Yes, but to play devil's
advocate, technically Naruto was
the first one to break the
rule.

256
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,860
Forget the rules! That's a
devil, for crying out loud!

257

We have to keep things on this
show in-universe!

What's your analysis, Lady
Tsunade?

259
00:14:46,326 --> 00:14:49,593
The rule does state
that this tug-of-war must be
one-on-one.

Here, Lee. Why don't you eat
something?

No, thank you. I am trying to
stay in the zone.

278
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,560
Okay, well how about a shoulder
rub? You must be pretty beat.

279
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,793
Right now, I have to stay
focused on finding a way to win.

280
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:44,960
Lunches and shoulder rubs are
only going to distract me from
that.

281
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:47,726
Listen, it's fine to put the
competition first...

282
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,526
...but you really don't have to
do everything on your own, you
know?

283
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,160
I do not understand.
This is <i>my</i> battle.

I guess, but you're
not alone...

<i>The time has come for</i>
<i>our final event!</i>

You guessed it, it's the
chicken fight!

287
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,726
<i>In this event, teams of four</i>

It's all luck.

Where is Neji, anyway? We need
four people to compete in this

There's no time. The two of us

00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,693
I do not think so.

303
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:00,226
What?!

304
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,193
This is the final battle! No
matter what it takes, I must
defeat Naruto all by myself!

305
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:07,793
You do know that we're carrying
you, right?

306
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,160
Everyone hold on tight,
and...go.

307
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:13,760
Let's do this!

308
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:15,026
Charge!

309
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Do the other thing!
Retreat!

310
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:18,226
[Horse Noises]

311
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,060
<i>Uh, oh! It's trouble for Lee!</i>
<i>His team is down a member, his</i>
<i>costume's the wrong animal...</i>

312
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:26,593
<i>...and he's been surrounded! I</i>
mean, seriously, can his team do
<i>anything right?</i>

313
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:28,593
Okay! You don't have
to rub it in!

314
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:29,960
I have got this.

315
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,726
Hidden Leaf Un, Deux, Trois!

316
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,826
[Chuckles]

317
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:36,026
Hey, where were you
hiding that tutu?!

318
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,560
Hornet Stinger!
I'm gonna hurl!

319
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,460
Quick! Knock him off their
shoulders!

320
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:45,060
[Grunts]
Where'd their horse go? What?

321
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:49,960
Hmph! I just used the
substitution Jutsu!

322
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,760
Good one, Guy Sensei!

323
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:53,993
Come on! You just jumped out of
the costume!

324
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:56,226
Depantsification Jutsu!

325
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,193
Don't do that!

326
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:01,226
Keep it up, Lee. You're doing a
great job! Show these guys what
you've got!

327
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,760
Yeah but you don't have to show
them Guy Sensei!

328
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,693
So it has come to this. Leaf
Crapshoo-Ahh!

329
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:08,793
No, not that!

330
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:10,460
[Screams]

331
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:13,893
[Grunting]

332
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:18,126
Are you nuts, trying to use Leaf
Crapshoot while you're standing
on our shoulders?!

333
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,526
I am sorry.

334
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,860
Do you understand now, Lee?

335
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,226
Do I understand <i>what?</i>

336
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,893
It appears that you're finally
starting to use your true
strength.

337
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:28,826
But do you know what
that really is?

338
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,126
True strength...?

339
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:33,593
<i>You've been trying to fight on</i>
<i>your own this entire day.</i>

340
00:18:35,193 --> 00:18:38,226
It's understandable. There are a
<i>lot of solo events at these</i>
<i>kinds of meets.</i>

341
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,626
But it's right when you're
fighting alone that you need the
support of your friends behind
you more than ever!

342
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:48,526
The support of my friends? But
what do you mean by that?

343
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:49,993
Cue the flashback...

344
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:55,826
Just have faith in yourself! If
you go into this with your usual
focus you'll win for sure!

345
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:58,660
Remember that no matter
what may happen!

346
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:01,726
Haven't you figured out what I'm
trying to tell you?

347
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,060
When do you feel like you have
the most confidence in yourself,
Lee?

348
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:16,626
When I am with my friends!

349
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:20,693
That's it! So, you think you can
beat Naruto?

350
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,993
Yes!

351
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:24,693
Hmm.

352
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:31,526
This is it, folks. The battle's
<i>entering its final round.</i>

353
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,893
It's Lee versus Naruto,
winner take all!

354
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:35,126
It's all luck.

355
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,960
I didn't even ask you
this time.

356
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:42,860
The cheers have reached a fever
<i>pitch! It's down to the final</i>
two! Who will emerge victorious?

357
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,926
Bring it on, Naruto!

358
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
All right!

359
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:50,160
[Cheering]

360
00:19:50,726 --> 00:19:53,526
<i>He is strong! I would expect</i>
<i>nothing less!</i>

361
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,626
[Grunt]
Lee!

362
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,493
Ha! I've got you now,
Bushy Brow!

363
00:19:58,826 --> 00:19:59,460
Woah!

364
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,593
Lee is inches away
from defeat!

365
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,860
[Grunting] <i>I will not</i>
<i>lose! Not now!</i>

366
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:11,126
I cannot disappoint the friends

<i>step of the way today!</i>

367
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:12,693
<i>Sorry I'm so late.</i>

368
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:13,160
Huh?

369
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:15,093
Wait, that voice!

370
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:15,726
Huh?

371
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:23,060
Neji!

372
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,693
Incredible! Out of nowhere, Neji
<i>has reappeared with his</i>
<i>scavenger hunt item...</i>

373
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,860
...a somewhat melancholy ghost!

374
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:39,793
[Sigh]

Ouch, that really hurt!

379
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,060
Oh!

380
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,026
<i>Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!</i>

381
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:06,860
<i>Unbelievable! Lee wins! Neji,</i>
<i>completely oblivious to the</i>
<i>dramatic atmosphere...</i>

[Cheering]

384
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:14,493
Good job. You got me
this time, Lee.

385
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:16,226
Thanks, Naruto.

386
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,993
But the next time we meet,
I'm gonna win!

387
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:21,893
We gotta make sure it's a true
one-on-one battle, though!

388
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:26,160
Yes, so we can see who truly
is the best. But can we still
have friends cheer for us?

389
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:29,026
Yeah, you bet! I want our
friends to be there too!

390
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:32,493
I'm happy for you Lee.
I'm glad you beat Naruto.

391
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,893
Thanks, but it was not just me!
We all won together!

[Giggles]

393

Friends are wonderful, aren't
they, Lee? They just make
everything better.

394
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,793
Yes!

395
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,760
As we run through the days
ahead, we must always remember
to cherish our friends!

396
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:47,093
Now, follow me!

397
00:21:47,126 --> 00:21:49,026
Right Guy Sensei!

398
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,993
Wait up, I'm coming too!

Me too...
