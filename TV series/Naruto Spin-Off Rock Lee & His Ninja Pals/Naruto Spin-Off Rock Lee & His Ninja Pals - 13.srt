1
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:59,555
<i>A Master. Someone to</i>
<i>admire, to follow. An</i>
<i>important person, who is</i>
<i>there to give knowledge,</i>

2
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:05,455
<i>to train one to achieve,</i>
<i>to lead one down the</i>
<i>right path. But there</i>
<i>comes a time when every</i>

3
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,955
<i>student strives to</i>
<i>surpass his master.</i>

4
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:15,522
A practical-skills test
instead of a regular
exam?

5
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:20,322
The format of the test is
up to each team's jonin,
according to these
guidelines.

6
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:23,089
What challenge are you
going to put up, Kakashi?

7
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:27,922
I think I'll pass anyone
who can beat me in
paper-scissors.

8
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:29,855
Very creative! How can I
top that?!

9
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:35,089
How 'bout this? I'll pit
all three of my students
and myself in a no-holds
barred battle royale, and

10
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,722
we'll compete until only
one of us remains
standing!

11
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:41,555
Well that's stupid!
You're setting up a
situation where only one
person can pass!

12
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:45,389
When they were first
starting out, your
trainees appeared quite
hopeless, but they've all

13
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:47,355
become very strong since
then.

14
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:51,889
You've done pretty well
yourself. I hear that
Naruto is flourishing and
playing an active role!

15
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:09,589
It's true. I have to
admit, he's pretty much
left me in the dust.

16
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,322
So the student has
surpassed his master!

17
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:17,422
It makes me feel a little
lonely, but it's encouraging.
After all, he can't stay
my student forever.

18
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:18,789
[grunting]

19
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:22,922
Well anyway, don't go
too overboard...

20
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:23,822
Right.

21
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,822
<i>'Student Vs. Master! Rock</i>
<i>Lee Vs Might Guy!</i>

22
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:41,022
Why do you think Guy
Sensei called us in?

23
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,822
He probably came up with
another crazy training
exercise he wants us to
do.

24
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:46,355
I hope that is true!

25
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:50,255
If I am going to become a
great ninja like Guy
Sensei, I have to go
full-tilt,

26
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,422
no matter what
he makes me do!

27
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,522
I'm going to be giving a
practical-skills test!

28
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:59,222
It's an essential part of
your training, with a
simple format!

29
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:01,989
In order to pass,
each of you will have
to fight me and win.

30
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:04,255
He's way too excited
about this.

31
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:08,155
We start immediately!
You can come at me in
any order you wish!

32
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:11,189
Yes-s-s! You are an
amazing teacher, Guy
Sensei,

33
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:14,222
giving us the opportunity
to take you on directly!

34
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:14,889
Oh boy.

35
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,322
He's way too
enthusiastic.

36
00:04:18,222 --> 00:04:19,255
Hya!

37
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:26,922
Good!

38
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:29,989
Eight Trigrams Air Palm!

39
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:33,055
[gasping]

40
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:36,389
Hah!

41
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:39,389
You have passed!

42
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,322
I thought my turn would
never come! Are you ready
for me, Guy Sensei?!

43
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,089
Give it everything you've
got, Lee!

44
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,189
Right!

45
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:52,989
Leaf! Un! Deux! Trois!

46
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:55,455
That won't work here!

47
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:58,989
Fine! I expected that
reaction!

48
00:04:59,022 --> 00:04:59,555
Ready?!

49
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,255
[roaring]

50
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:03,555
What?! He's calling up
the Eight Gates?!

51
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,455
No way! That stance is...

52
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:11,222
Asakujaku!

53
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,555
Sensei... Oh, why?

54
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,555
Lee.. I warned you to
take this challenge very
seriously!

55
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:28,455
But it's just supposed to
be a test!

56
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:31,155
Don't you think your
attack was a little
harsh?

57
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:35,089
The format I use to
conduct this test is
completely up to me!

58
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:38,189
<i>Lee is a ninja who can</i>
<i>only use Taijutsu.</i>

59
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:41,555
I'm grading him with
different criteria than
you two.

60
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:47,089
I'm told Naruto has
already surpassed his
master, Kakashi.

61
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,789
I'll give you a one-week
extension.

62
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:55,955
If you can't win a match
against me by then, you'll
be demoted back to genin.

63
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:10,389
Try not to let
it get you down.

64
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:13,089
I mean, it could be he's
just in a bad mood.

65
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:17,555
Really? I have never seen
Guy Sensei so upset.

66
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:22,122
<i>He has never threatened</i>
<i>me before, even that time</i>
<i>when I went to his house</i>
<i>and ate all the curry he</i>

67
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:23,422
<i>had been saving.</i>

68
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:25,422
Now when in the world did
that happen?

69
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:28,189
<i>Or when I farted in the</i>
<i>elevator and almost</i>
<i>killed him.</i>

70
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,489
That rear-end of yours is
lethal!

71
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:34,289
<i>Not to mention the time I</i>
<i>stayed in the bathroom</i>
<i>reading an entire issue</i>
<i>of Shonen Jump, even</i>

72
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:37,022
<i>though I knew he had to</i>
<i>go, really, really badly!</i>

73
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,422
You read the whole issue
from top to bottom?
That's just plain cruel!

74
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:46,589
You can imagine how angry
he was with me. But I
have to say, today was
different... and worse.

75
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:50,855
It was bad. Using the
Asakujaku against us was
extreme.

76
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:56,255
It had to be the news he
heard, that Naruto had
surpassed Kakashi Sensei.

77
00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:01,022
In comparison, I have not
really improved that much
after all this time, and
he must have finally

78
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,855
gotten fed up!

79
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,822
Don't be so depressed,
Lee. You can put this
whole thing behind you by
defeating him next week.

80
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:10,422
Tell you what. We'll help
you train!

81
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:12,555
Thanks. Let me think
about it.

82
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:16,022
Lee...

83
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:30,089
<i>I heard what happened.</i>
<i>Guy really put you</i>
<i>through the wringer,</i>
<i>didn't he?</i>

84
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:38,289
I want to prove that one
can be a great ninja
without using either
ninjutsu or genjutsu.

85
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:41,855
I have felt like that
ever since I was in the
Academy!

86
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:50,355
Effort. Guts. Passion. I
gave everything I had,
all the time. I never
held back, I let it out!

87
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:56,922
I let it out! I let
it out! I let it out!

88
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,155
[cheering]

89
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,822
And why? For one reason:
To become like my hero,
Might Guy!

90
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:07,822
Whoops, okay. Wrong
show. Let's move the setting
out of the stadium for now.

91
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:13,422
Unfortunately, after all
this time, it looks like
Guy Sensei has given up
on me.

92
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:14,989
I'm not sure that's true.

93
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,722
Huh?

94
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:20,322
To make a move like that
is a double-edged sword.
It hurts the one who's
using it, as well.

95
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:25,289
If he resorted to such
a tactic, you need to
understand why he was
being so strict.

96
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,355
[groaning]

97
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,122
That is it. It is all I
can do. Sorry.

98
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:37,989
You can't quit!

99
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:41,155
You think I'm some kind
of monster, is that it?

100
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:45,022
I'm only pushing this
hard because I believe
in you!

101
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,389
I get it. He is trying to
make me improve.

102
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:51,389
But Guy Sensei is so
strong, it is overwhelming.

103
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:56,089
I can never hope to
emerge victorious... with
just hand-to-hand combat.

104
00:08:56,122 --> 00:09:00,089
There's no point in
working so hard if you
don't believe in
yourself!

105
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,255
Isn't that what
he always says?

106
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:06,422
Oh, Kakashi Sensei!!

107
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:12,089
A student surpassing
their master is one of
the never-ending cycles of
life. And it's a good thing.

108
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:15,322
Guy obviously feels
you're ready to take that
step.

109
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:18,855
See you soon.

110
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:27,755
Lee?

111
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:31,055
I know what I need to do,
and I am going to need
your help!

112
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,089
I am ready! I must find
a way to surpass Guy
Sensei!

113
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:36,289
Hm!

114
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:40,255
We'll start with basic
combat! Fight!

115
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,522
Leaf Hurricane!

116
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:45,789
[gasping and grunting]

117
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:50,422
You need to stand up,
Lee. If you can't
withstand these attacks
from Neji and myself,

118
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:52,522
you'll never be able to
defeat Sensei!

119
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,955
I am ready! Let's do it!

120
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,422
Your strikes have gotten
a lot more precise.

121
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:35,289
Thank you very much you
two!

122
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:38,389
But we all know this will
not be enough.

123
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,822
You still have a problem
with the Asakujaku.

124
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:46,422
It destroys its opponent
with flame and shock
waves. It will be
difficult to counter it.

125
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:50,889
I have an idea! What if I
was able to come up with
my own special shock
wave...?

126
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:53,189
...Like that legendary
fighter once did!

127
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:55,255
That could actually work!

128
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,789
We'll get into a lot of
trouble if we do this!

129
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:03,089
I understand. But still,
I have to come up with
some kind of a
counter-attack!

130
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,189
Hmm...

131
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:08,255
Asakujaku... or the
morning peacock.

132
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,289
I wonder why it's called
the 'morning' peacock?

133
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:12,022
Oh! I should have thought
of that!

134
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:16,955
It is very important! To
understand my opponent, I
must go research the
Morning Peacock!

135
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:18,155
Be the peacock!

136
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:21,455
Nejimi, can you hurry it
up?!

137
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:25,455
Why are you washing your
hair in the morning?!
Some other people would
like to use the sink, too!

138
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:30,422
The shampoo he's using
happens to be a morning
shampoo! And did we just
start a skit?

139
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:35,922
I can't help it! My hair
will be a mess unless I
wash, rinse, and repeat.
You should think about

140
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:39,289
getting up early and
doing this yourself every
day Leeko...

141
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:42,822
It's not the
brushing-of-the-hair that
bothers him, it's the
getting-up-early part!

142
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:46,089
You're never gonna solve
the argument, so why
don't you just have some
morning coffee?

143
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,889
No matter how much you
brush, you will still be
ugly!

144
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:54,289
Isn't it ironic? In spite
of that, I'll still always
be better looking than you,
you hyper-ugly pig.

145
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:55,289
Come on, girls...

146
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:57,955
I've always heard, it
takes one to know one!

147
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,555
Stop! You're gonna give
me split ends, oh my gosh.

148
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,189
Knock it off right now,
the both of you!

149
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:07,955
That hurt! Ouuuuch!

150
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:11,855
Your hair is... just like
a peacock!

151
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:16,089
Ah-ha! That is the
secret behind the
Asakujaku, AKA the
Morning Peacock!

152
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:20,889
That makes no sense at
all! And if I'm a
peacock, Bushy-Brows,
then you're a chicken!

153
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:22,855
[squawking]

154
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,555
[panting]

155
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:30,122
Well, we kinda connected
the morning to the
peacock, but it was a
stretch...

156
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:34,422
So now what? If we can't
figure out the Asakujaku,
there's no way he can
win.

157
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:39,389
There is just one option
left! I will have to face
him head-on and be
victorious!

158
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:58,871
"I Will Surpass
Guy Sensei"

159
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:08,437
<i>It is now one week later,</i>
<i>and Lee finds himself</i>
<i>about to face his beloved</i>
<i>teacher in a showdown.</i>

160
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:15,104
Everything's riding on
this for Lee.

161
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:17,971
Which reminds me. What
are you all doing,
hanging out here?

162
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,671
Oh please. This is
really fun.

163
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:22,004
I wanted to come cheer
for Lee!

164
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:26,637
I felt responsible. After
all, I must admit, I did
egg him on a little.

165
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:31,637
In a face-off between
Turd-Brows and Super
Turd-Brows... I wonder
who will win??

166
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:34,204
Really? You're such a
class act!

167
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:39,637
Lee... Are you ready?!

168
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:41,204
[exhaling]

169
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:47,104
I'm sure you're aware,
if you lose this fight,
the consequences will be
very serious.

170
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:49,704
You will end up being
demoted to genin!

171
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:53,671
I am ready to take you
on, Sensei! I will win
this fight...!

172
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:56,004
And when I do, I will
have surpassed you!

173
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,404
Uh.. This is.. kinda
scary, you know?

174
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:06,937
I've never seen the two
of them like this. I'm
kinda worried about
what's going to happen.

175
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:09,604
Ready... Fight!

176
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:12,204
[yelling]

177
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:14,237
Leaf Hurricanes!

178
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,437
They both started with
the same move!

179
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,571
[struggling]

180
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:20,471
They made a crazy
shockwave!

181
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:22,871
I can't tell who landed
the kick!

182
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:27,304
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

183
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:30,437
Yikes! It looks like
neither one got a leg up
on the other!

184
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:33,604
Now I am going to use a
move you do not know,
Sensei!

185
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,204
Lee has a new move?

186
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:37,571
How did that happen
without us knowing?!

187
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:41,071
The Leaf Whirlwind! The
Leaf Hurricane...

188
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:46,171
Thank you, Sensei! I have
learned many techniques
from you with 'leaf' in
the name!

189
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:49,571
Now, this is a move I created
on my own, building from
that knowledge!

190
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:52,037
Ahhh!

191
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,637
He's spinning around like
mad!

192
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:55,504
Ahhhhh!

193
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:56,904
Huh?

194
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,371
Leaf Gentle Breeze!

195
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:01,504
Oooh... that's
nice!

196
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:03,637
<i>Eww! What a gross jutsu!</i>

197
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:05,004
[groaning]

198
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,137
He should've called it
'Whisper in the Wind'...
Don't you think?

199
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:10,904
What?! I think you're
completely missing the
point here!

200
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:15,271
That one is just the
beginning. The next one
will blow you away!

201
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:18,937
Ahhhhhh!

202
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:21,404
That.. pressure is
serious!

203
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,371
Yeah, you're right, but
so far, all he's done is
spin!

204
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:26,171
Here we go!

205
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:28,171
Leaf Naughty Wind!

206
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:29,937
Ahhh!

207
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:31,971
Huh?

208
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:35,604
For this particular move,
I rotate at very high
speed, generating a
naughty wind that blows

209
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,571
up the skirts of any
nearby girls!

210
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,171
What for?! That's just
another perverted jutsu!

211
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:43,437
Sakura wears shorts under
her skirt, so there's no
way it would have worked!

212
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:45,904
But you were willing
to try that move anyway!

213
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:48,104
What could you possibly
hope to accomplish?!

214
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:51,971
Are you kidding? What
red-blooded healthy male
in his right mind would
not want a glimpse

215
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:54,137
of those lump and
supple shorts cla--

216
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:56,271
Hey! What do you mean by
'plump', smart-ass?!

217
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:58,071
[groaning]

218
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:02,371
Sakura, I understand how
you feel, but don't
forget, Lee is right in
the middle of a match!

219
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:04,671
Time to go on to the next
move!

220
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,104
How about Leaf Snack
Octopuffs?!

221
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:09,171
Ah!

222
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,337
Oh wow! Those snacks!
They taste so good!

223
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:17,137
He calls that a move? It
wasn't even a jutsu!

224
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:21,137
Looks like the soy-sauce
base combines perfectly
with the octopus flavoring!

225
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:22,071
Neji?!

226
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:24,637
Amazing! The perfect
level of crispness!

227
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:26,971
Even with a sharingan,
I can't comprehend how
they do it.

228
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:30,271
Why is everyone analyzing
this stupid snack so
seriously?

229
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:32,971
And by the way, you
all eat much too fast.

230
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,671
Well played, Lee! Using
these puffs was a
masterful move!

231
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,171
I don't believe this!
Have you completely lost
your minds?!

232
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:42,637
I suspect the time for
goofing around is about
to end.

233
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,171
<i>That's Guy Sensei's</i>
<i>serious face!</i>

234
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,537
How serious?! He ate the
whole bag!

235
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:54,037
So, Lee... Have you now
exhausted the last of
your new moves?!

236
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:55,271
[grunting]

237
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:58,137
Because.. it's my turn to
take the offensive in
this fight!

238
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:02,271
I warned you this was
gonna be a serious
battle! Prepare yourself!

239
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:03,637
[roaring]

240
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:05,904
<i>He's opening the Eight</i>
<i>Gates!</i>

241
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:08,904
Gosh! At this point, I
don't suppose he'd
reconsider....

242
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:12,971
I have seen the Asakujaku
countless times!

243
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:18,171
And that... is why I am
going to--
[struggling]

244
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,437
<i>Lee!</i>

245
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:27,637
I am sorry I failed you
two. You did so much to
help me...

246
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:30,204
Puffs are so tasty!
Mmm...!

247
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:32,637
You know better than to
speak with your mouth
full!

248
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,204
You put in all those
hours, helping me
train...

249
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:42,971
[gasping]

250
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:49,671
Sorry, Lee. Forgive me.

251
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:50,471
Huh?

252
00:17:57,037 --> 00:17:58,204
Lee!

253
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:03,171
Thanks.. for all you did.
It is truly because of
you that I found the
answer.

254
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,437
What answer?

255
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:07,504
Guy Sensei, you are
incredibly powerful...

256
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:11,304
But our battle is not
over! I refuse to let it
end!

257
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:17,171
[yelling]

258
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:19,204
They've both opened the
Eight Gates!

259
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:21,271
I don't get it! What
could they be thinking?

260
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,204
All right! Come on, Lee!

261
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:31,404
It was my training that
gave me the hint. The
Asakujaku is a
high-speed, wide-range,

262
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:36,004
multiple-strike attack.
The only way to counter
it is to be even faster!

263
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,204
And by faster, I mean
much faster! I have a
jutsu that leaves even a,
Asakujaku the Morning

264
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:43,971
Peacock in the dust!

265
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,204
Introducing Morning
Chicken!

266
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:48,504
What?! Why did you pick a
chicken?!

267
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:49,571
Asakujaku!

268
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:54,637
[squawking]

269
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:57,504
Come on! This is getting
really crazy!

270
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,871
Not really. He thought
this through.

271
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:05,437
The chicken wakes up
before the peacock. It
gets a jump on him.

272
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,471
That's how it
can beat the peacock.

273
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:09,071
That's got nothing to do
with this!

274
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:14,171
[grunting]

275
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:18,171
So you think you're
faster than my
Asakujaku?!

276
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:19,537
Absolutely!

277
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:21,671
[grunting]

278
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:24,404
[clucking]

279
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:25,504
Nice move!

280
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:29,437
Where did that... come
from?

281
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,104
I am just getting
started.

282
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:37,604
I will... surpass Guy
Sensei...!

283
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:42,171
<i>Lee!</i>

284
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:44,304
[pained clucking]

285
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:49,571
I am so pathetic.

286
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:56,871
Sensei unleashed his
Asakujaku because he
believed I could overcome
it. I was unable to do so.

287
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:00,571
I guess now I will lose
my rank as chunin.

288
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:01,604
Maybe not...

289
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:05,637
And then.. he'll tell me
what a fool I was to try.

290
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,037
Yes, indeed!

291
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:11,171
You are a first-degree
fool!

292
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:14,671
<i>No matter how many times</i>
<i>I knocked you down, you</i>
<i>kept getting up...</i>

293
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:17,304
Coming at me like
a person possessed.

294
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:22,371
<i>And now you're starting</i>
<i>to surpass me. On that</i>
<i>last exchange, your</i>
<i>attack was faster, more</i>

295
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:24,404
<i>creative, and more</i>
<i>effective.</i>

296
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:27,304
Uh--

297
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:29,404
Seeing that proved
something to me.

298
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,871
That one day you will
become a great ninja
who will surpass me
for sure.

299
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:36,037
A first-degree fool of a
ninja!

300
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:39,304
You... mean... I passed
the test?

301
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:41,104
Just barely, but yes!

302
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:43,204
Thank you very much,
Sensei!

303
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:47,504
But be ready. I'm going
to work you to the bone,

304
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,204
until the day comes
when you're able to
surpass me for real.

305
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:53,171
[emotional grunting]

306
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:57,937
<i>Lee... I'm so proud of</i>
<i>you!</i>

307
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,437
Guy Sensei...!

308
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:02,904
You are the best teacher
ever!

309
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:05,904
Thanks a lot, Lee!

310
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:09,471
These guys are getting
weirder and weirder
every day!

311
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:12,171
I can't tell where the
ninja's end and the
birds begin!

312
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:16,537
That may not be so
important. At least
they're both on the
same soundtrack.

313
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:19,337
So.. Anybody in the mood
for a bucket of wings?

314
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:21,404
Not funny, pal! But
delicious!

315
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:23,737
[clucking]

316
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:28,004
<i>It's a good thing they</i>
<i>don't evaluate ninjas on</i>
<i>the quality of their bird</i>
<i>impersonations, or we</i>

317
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:32,537
<i>might not have any heroes</i>
<i>to hoot for... I mean,</i>
<i>root for, in this series!</i>

318
00:21:34,204 --> 00:21:39,904
Okay, it's time to get to
work... And train you to
improve on that nice new
move you developed!

319
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:41,637
Yes, Guy Sensei!

320
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:43,571
Morning Fried Chicken!

321
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:47,504
[clucking]

322
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:48,571
[stomach growling]

323
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:50,271
This jutsu is making me
hungry!

324
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:54,371
I don't know what you're
talking about. It doesn't
bother me the least
little bit.

325
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:56,806
Tenten! Are you gonna
share that?

326
00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:57,539
No way!

327
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:58,339
Come on!

328
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:59,237
Back off!

329
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:02,304
<i>You're supposed to be in</i>
<i>training! Now get with</i>
<i>the program, you two!</i>

330
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:07,304

331
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:51,998
<i>Our next episodes are</i>
<i>called 'I Want My</i>
<i>Popularity Back!' and</i>
<i>'Death'!</i>

332
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:54,865
The second title's weird!
What's that one about?!

333
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:58,965
<i>It's the story of a</i>
<i>script-writer who</i>
<i>collapses with a sudden</i>
<i>illness. As his deadline</i>

334
00:23:58,998 --> 00:24:03,465
<i>approaches, he musters</i>
<i>the strength to pick up</i>
<i>his pen, sneak out of the</i>
<i>hospital, and make it to</i>

335
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:08,332

<i>passion and willingness</i>
<i>to die for his work, are</i>

336
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:09,565
<i>an inspiration</i>
<i>to us all!</i>

337
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:11,698
You expect people to
believe a story like
that?

338
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:13,998
<i>Script-writers</i>
<i>sure have it rough!</i>
