You're right, Lee.

I figured out what
Sai is upset about!

21
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:07,508
Sai does not really stand out in

22
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:12,641

23

That's completely ridiculous!

He doesn't know people only pay
attention to you because you act

have to take you down with our

Those rogues infiltrated the
village.

I noticed them while you and the
others were dragging me around.

177

When I saw they were after Lady
Tsunade, I did as you told me.

178
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:45,530
I charged forward and hit them
head-on, without fear or
trepidation.

all this time.

talking about?

right?!

186
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,830
Actually, not so much.

187
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:24,030
I was worried about all the
kinds of trouble you were going
to put me through before we
were finally finished.

188
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:25,730
Huh?
What? Trouble?

189
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:30,964
However, I have to say, when it
was all over, it was kind of
fun!

00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:34,397
Really, Sai?

He's right though. With all the

We have Choji, Neji, Naruto, and

Hey, Choji, what are <i>you</i> doing
here?

Well duh, I want
the prize.

The theme for the contest is,
'The Man I'd Like to Date.'

It's time to get started. Good
luck to all the contestants!

<i>The first event of the</i>
<i>competition centers around</i>
<i>fashion.</i>

232
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:53,875

<i>What would you wear on a first</i>
<i>date?</i>

233
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:57,608
I think the right answer for a
first date should be casual, yet
stylish.

234
00:13:58,142 --> 00:13:59,908
What is your answer, Choji?

235
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:02,742

Very nice. Not bad at all.

00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:12,675
Well I would hope so. I spent a
week trying to find the perfect
XXL sized outfit!

239
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,275
You went through
a lot of work.

<i>Next up is Neji!</i>

241
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:19,142
I'm not a slave to the
latest fashion trends.

242
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,908
It's so non-trendy, it's
completely traditional!

243
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,908
What do you say,
Lady Tsunade?

244
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:27,975
I think he'd be more at home in
a kimono than a hakama...

[Sigh] Not again.

It's your turn now, Naruto.

247
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:37,808
My research tells me 'natural'
is the right way to go on a
first date!

248

<i>[Crowd Screaming]</i>
That's not the kind of natural
you want to go with here.

249
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:47,775
<i>Really! This isn't so much</i>
<i>'natural' as it is 'back to</i>
<i>nature.'</i>

250
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:50,708
<i>It would work better if his</i>
<i>body wasn't so scrawny.</i>

251
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:51,408
This is scrawny!?

252

Huh?

255
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:01,308
On a first date, the way to
impress the person you're seeing
is to wear a leggy ant outfit!

256
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:04,175
It's not 'leggy ant!'
The word is 'elegant!'

257
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:06,675
Now I get it, it was
a bad pun.

258
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:10,342
Looks like everyone except Choji
ended up as the butt of a joke.

259
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,942

Wanna check this place
out with me?

263
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,708
It's a famous bakery, that
offers all-you-can-eat cake!

264
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:34,108
<i>That was a well-played move!</i>
Choji's banking on the fact that
<i>most girls love a sweet treat!</i>

265
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,675
Sounds great.

266
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,908
Wow, I figured Choji would
suggest getting beef barbeque.

267
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:44,808
You're not that far off,
actually. His first instinct was
to buy all-you-can-eat barbeque
tickets.

268
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:46,842
But then I started
thinking about it...

269

<i>talent contest.</i>

What does any of this have to do
with food?!

271
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:59,308
I had my debut, got popular, and
then got the street in front of
the BBQ place closed off for one
<i>of my shows.</i>

272
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:01,175

273
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,908

get supplies, they had to close
<i>for a day.</i>

274
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:08,742
<i>And Choji had no choice but</i>
to go to the bakery next door,
<i>instead.</i>

275
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:13,242
I guess this is how you win when
you have an I.Q. of two hundred.

276
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:14,875
The next one up is Neji!

277
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,608
Please accept these.

278
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:21,675
Neji decides to go for a direct
<i>strike!</i>

279
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,775
What a beautiful bouquet! Thank
you very much, young man.

280
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:28,342
Yes. I decided to purchase one
rose for each year of your age.

281
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,175
Hmph.

Hold it! Forget all these petty
games, you guys!

285

All you really have to do is
look at her straight in the
eyes!

286

Let's get together this
Sunday...

287
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,875
You and I, uh...

288
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:49,708
Forget it. I can't get into it
when it's just you, Granny
Tsunade. With all those wrinkles
under your eyes.

289
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,575
Hmph.

290
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,908
You're supposed to look into her
eyes, not under them!

291
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:54,608
That is terrible, Naruto!

292
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:57,575
Hmph! I will show you how to get
a woman to say yes!

293
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,708
Lady Tsunade, will you train
with me on your next day off?

294
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:03,875
I do not care if you are
fifty-four and have a face full
of wrinkles!

295
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:07,742
As two single people, we can
overcome the age gap with enough
hard work! That is certain!

296
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,108
All we have to do is-Ahh!

297
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:11,042
Stop talking, Lee!
You're killing her!

298
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:13,675
[Gasp] I am sorry Lady Tsunade!

299

00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:17,542
Forgive me, my Lady.

301
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:19,875
<i>I think it's time for a</i>
<i>ten-minute break.</i>

302
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,842
<i>Tell me something. Were you</i>
<i>serious back there, Lee?</i>

303
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,808
That whole effort was
horrendous!

304
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:29,175
Yes, I know. But believe me, I
am trying to give it my all!

305
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:34,275
I will never be Mr. Leaf
Village! Never! Ever! [Crying]

306
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:36,242
Lee...

307
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:37,675
[Grunting]

308
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:40,675
What kind of a man gives up, and
sits there crying?

309
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:45,275
You have to find a way to hang
tough! If you don't you will
never be able to date Sakura!

310
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,208
[Gasp] You are right!

311
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:53,242
You are so wise! That
was awesome! [Crying]

312
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:55,642
Don't get snot on me!

313
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,142
Get away from me!
I didn't do anything!

314
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:00,542
Leave me alone!
Tenten!

315
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,842
So gross!

316
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:05,642
<i>The final event of the</i>
<i>competition is 'Confessions.'</i>

317
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:10,308
It's the end of the first date.
<i>Admit how you really feel, and</i>
<i>win the woman's heart.</i>

318
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,908
I'm the one you're going to be
confessing to.

319
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:16,142
<i>We'll begin this round with</i>
<i>Choji. You're up first.</i>

320
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:17,542
Right!

321
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:24,542
[Munching]

322
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:31,820
Um, I know this is gonna sound
cheesy, but would you
consider...

323
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:33,354
Huh!

324
00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:37,720
Would you eat barbeque with me
for the rest of your life, every
day?!

325
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:40,220
[Gasp] You stink!

326
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,687
<i>Oh no! A blast of bad breath</i>
ruins everything at the critical
<i>moment!</i>

327
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,854
You didn't prep anything for him
this time, Shikamaru?

328
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,787
'Fraid not. It was too
much of a drag.

329
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,320
Everything you did for him
before was <i>more</i> of a drag!

330
00:18:52,954 --> 00:18:55,554
Does this mean I don't get the
restaurant tickets?

331
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:59,220
Hmph! For starters, you'd have
to be a lot more romantic.

332
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:00,987
<i>You try, Neji!</i>

333
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:03,820
We need to talk.

334
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:05,287
Go ahead.

335
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,487
Let me ask. Would you
be mine forever?

336
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:10,687
Yes!

337
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,354
In that case, there's something
important you have to do to
become part of the Hyuga Clan.

338
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,520
I made a quick mock-up, to
demonstrate.

339
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:18,987
Huh?

340
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:20,487
Take a look.

341
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,454
Uh.

342
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,920
She has to have
plastic surgery?!

343
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,787
Everyone in his clan does
have the same features.

344
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:28,920
Is that a bad thing?

345
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:32,554
Well it doesn't make a good
argument, for a relationship.

346
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,854
<i>Let's see how you do, Naruto.</i>

347
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:40,420
Well I've never had a girl over
to my pad before, so I was kinda
hoping...

348
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,920
You know, maybe we could...

349
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:50,320
Hmm. Have you ever cleaned this
place? Let's start now by wiping
down the table with this dust
rag.

350
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:52,287
That's not a rag. It's just a
dirty sock.

351
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,820
Ew, gross. I can't stay here!

352
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:59,720
Come on, now! If you really love
someone, you shouldn't worry
about a little dirt!

353
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:04,720
<i>[Laughing] How naive of you,</i>
<i>Naruto! You have no clue</i>
<i>regarding priorities.</i>

354
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:08,920
<i>The most important thing to</i>
do <i>in this situation is to</i>
<i>support the woman's</i>
<i>feelings. No</i> matter <i>what!</i>

355
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,054
What are you doing
out there?

356
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:14,654
Tenten told me to come chase
after you, and stick to my guns!

357
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:16,487
Did she say stick
to the window?

358
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,387
I swear I will stick by you,
and love you every day!

359
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,987
Yuck! Disgusting!

360
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:26,420
<i>Girls hate clingy guys Lee!</i>

361
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:28,887
Hmph.

362
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,987
Hmm.

363
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,787
We'll just have the Lady pick a
winner from among the four of
us!

364
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,754
Sounds good.

365
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:36,254
Fine by me!

366
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:37,920
[All] Lady Tsunade!

367
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:40,354
[All] Will you please!

368
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,454
[All] Go out!

369
00:20:42,754 --> 00:20:44,787
[All] With me!!!

370
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,787
Ahh!

371
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:54,787
[Heavy Breathing]
<i>You idiots!</i>

372
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,620
Huh?

373
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,387
I can't turn my back for one
minute! What have you done to
Lady Tsunade?!

374
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,554
[Screams]

375
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:01,620
Talk to me m'lady.

376
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:04,387
I'm alright.

377
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:05,754
What a relief!

378
00:21:08,987 --> 00:21:11,954
It is time for the results of
the contest!

379
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:14,620
Mr. Leaf Village has been
chosen!

380
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:21,020
It's mister...

381
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:23,254
...Tenten, everyone!

382
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:28,620
W-w-what are you saying? It's
<i>me?</i> That can't be right!

383
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,487
After all she's done to protect
me, I would definitely rather be
dating Tenten!

384
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:37,554
And so, I am awarding her two
tickets to the Heaven's Doorstep
restaurant!

385
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,454
<i>Come and get your prize!</i>

386
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,987
But, this is so weird.

387
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,254
[Crowd Cheering]

388
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:47,854
[Screaming]

389
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:49,520
And as for you four...

390
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,520
I've been giving it some
careful thought, and finally
decided I have the perfect prize
for you...

391
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,754
And it's my fists!

392
00:21:57,454 --> 00:22:00,687
[Screams]

393
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,887
<i>And by a weird coincidence, it</i>
<i>turned out that Lee and his</i>
<i>friends ended up at heaven's</i>
<i>doorstep as well!</i>

394
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:51,596
<i>The next episode is entitled</i>
<i>"Gaara's First Date," and "A</i>
<i>Gift From Orochimaru!"</i>

395
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:56,029
Wasn't Gaara just here? I mean,
is it okay for him to leave his
village so often?

396
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:59,996
The Sand Village has it rough,
too. They just set up his new
work visa.

397
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,296
Work visa? Are you saying
he's here on a mission?

398
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:08,696
<i>No, there's nothing out there</i>
<i>but desert. Maybe he's here to</i>
<i>earn money to send back to his</i>
<i>village?</i>

399
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:13,596
The Kazekage working abroad?!
You're way out of line buddy!
