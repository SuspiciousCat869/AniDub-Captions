Just leave it to me Neji!

What are you doing?
Fight them, not each other!
No! This fight is mine!

11
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:20,603
[Chuckles] Those boneheads are
fighting themselves!

12
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:21,903
Now's our chance!
Let's get 'em!

13
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:22,903

Now that's what I call teamwork!
You can tell they're best

Please, Shikamaru! I need your
help in training how to be a
best friend so I can improve our
teamwork, too!

30
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:15,169
Aw, what a drag...

31
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:17,103
Can you actually train to be
best friends?

Shikamaru and I have been
sharing snacks since we were
little kids.

34
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:30,603
That's one reason why
we're so close!

35
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,703
I brought some chips
for us to eat!

36
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,569
Oh! Thank you!

I see...

39
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,903
So sharing food is one of the
ways that someone can become a
best friend!

40
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:42,569
Also!

<i>One friend must get fat!</i>

What?! Hey, don't you call me
fat! I'm pleasantly plump!

43
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,969
Open up, Neji! Just
say, "Aah!"

Ow, Lee! That's hot!
Knock it off!

Yes! It is a hot-blooded symbol
of our friendship! This is sure
to help our teamwork!

Ahh!

47
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,769
Is it even possible for them to
be like Shikamaru and Choji...?

48
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:04,703
Just one piece left.

[Chuckles] Aw, the last piece.

51
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,803
The flavor of the final bite of
meat is the best of all!

52
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:12,603
Ah ha! I see.

53
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:16,403
So offering someone else the
last bite of food is also a part
of being best friends!

Here, Neji! Take the last bite
as a symbol of our friendship!

57
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:29,569
Eat this and you will be a
pleasantly plump fatty like
Choji over here!

58
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,603
You and me, outside, now!

to work on our teamwork drills.
Even if it is a total drag...

60

Yes! I am ready to learn!

We'll have a two-on-two

you'll never get the bell from
us.

What's that stance?

72
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:10,169
He does that whenever he's
formulating a plan.

He's a super genius with an IQ

Okay. I've thought of two

Woah, he thinks fast!

Huh? Is Lee devising
a plan too?

skit that Neji set up to give
Lee more courage?

What?! It's a leather keychain!

I am just not feeling the
emotion of a bond between two

Well it isn't really
your style.

You guys just aren't the type to
be all buddy-buddy.

There's just no point in copying
their moves!

All I wanted to do was to think
of a way to team up with you
more effectively!

150
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:24,769
That reminds me, in the future,
our plans should be focused
around me!

151
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:27,869
No, Neji! My plans are superior!
That is because...

152
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:29,736
[Both]
I am simply stronger
than you are!

00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,769
We must fight to see who is
number one!

157
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:40,769
I agree!

158
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:41,903
What?!
Huh?

Not bad at all, Neji!

165
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:55,469
[Chuckling] Same goes
for you, Lee.

166
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:59,869
What-what is going on? Both of
them are on the same page all of
a sudden?

167
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:03,703
Lee and Neji don't have what
you'd call a friendly type of
bond.

168
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,669
Their relationship's different
than Shikamaru and Choji's.

169
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:10,736
But they do want to earn each
other's respect. And they work
together when things get tough.

170
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:13,169
<i>That's what it means</i>
<i>to be rivals.</i>

All right, now that's
more like it.
Yeah!

172
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:18,603
No escape! Eight Trigrams...!

173
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:20,036
I cannot let Neji outdo me!

Huh?

00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:23,903
Jet Lee!
Ahh!

177
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:26,569
No way! He turned that
into a team attack!

178
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:27,603
[Screams]

179
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:32,236
Aww.

[Grunting]

181
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:35,036
Well I guess it's a draw.

<i>Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.</i>

183

Fight me, Neji!

184
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:42,903
That's enough for one day.

185
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:45,869
This suits them better than
being best friends, anyway!

186
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:47,003
Hey guys...

187
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:47,903
Huh?

188
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:52,836
You put up a really good fight
today. I forgive you for what
happened at Barbe-Q's.

189
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:54,769
Weird.

190
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:00,636
If I use the Partial Expansion
Jutsu only on my eyes, then I
can seriously crank up the
cuteness level!

191
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:03,969
Wow, Choji, that is amazing! You
are huge in every way!

192
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:07,603
[Grunting] Don't call me that
I'm pleasantly plump!

193
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:08,903
[Screams]

194
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,536
Neji, I bet I can endure
this longer than you!

195
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:13,903
This isn't the time
for rivalry!

196
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:18,069
It is always a good
time for rivalry!
Oh, man this is such a drag.

197
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:20,469
Yes, it's a drag, but it's still
<i>friendship.</i>

198
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:24,636
<i>And friendship comes in many</i>
<i>forms! Like the form of a giant</i>
<i>rotating ball.</i>

199
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,076
[Birds Squawking]

200
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,443
Ninjutsu is very important to a
<i>ninja, but so is intelligence.</i>

201
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:57,743
<i>And right now, our friends are</i>
<i>about to take an IQ test to</i>
<i>measure theirs.</i>

202
00:11:57,776 --> 00:11:59,376
This is where we're taking
the test?!

203
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:04,243
I am a ninja who cannot use
ninjutsu. So I have mastered
martial arts.

204
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:06,343
But I have to keep my mind
sharp as well!

205
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:10,510
<i>Intelligence is the ability to</i>
think, plan, and solve problems.

206
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,443
<i>It's a no-brainer that it's</i>
<i>important to have brains.</i>

207
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:16,410
<i>Being able to think fast is</i>
<i>important too.</i>

208
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:20,376
Ha! When it comes to being fast,
I never lose!

209
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:23,276
[Screaming]

For some reason I feel
really dizzy...

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,510
Now that's a low IQ...

215
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,043
"The Culprit Is Among Us."

216
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:54,943
Hello!

217
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,276
Doesn't it seem strange that
we're taking a test here?

218
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:07,343
Let's just look for Guy Sensei.
He's the one supervising the
test, after all.

219
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,010
Man, what a drag...

220
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,143
Hmph.

221
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:13,010
<i>[Scream]</i>

222
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,243
That was Guy Sensei!

223
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,043
Sounds like he's upstairs!

224
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:17,210
[Grunts]

225
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,210
Was it this room?

226
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,110
Ah! It is locked!

227
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:23,476
Eight Trigrams Air Palm! Huh!

228
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:27,910
Oh no! Guy Sensei!
Wake up!

229
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,910
Who could have
done this?

230
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:35,043
<i>Preeeetty sure it was them.</i>

231
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:40,376
When I heard about this IQ test
I thought I'd come here
beforehand and set up traps.

232
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:45,376
But Lee and the others showed up
<i>right after he attacked Guy</i>
<i>Sensei, so there was no time.</i>

233
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:51,376
Lord Orochimaru. I believe we
should just stay hidden and
observe for the time being.

234
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,276
Mhmm.

235
00:13:53,143 --> 00:13:55,310
It seems he's only
been knocked out.

236
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,376
What's that?

237
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:01,443
Looks like it's his dying
message. Ugh, what a drag...

238
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,543
Hey, knock it off! Have some
respect! Guy Sensei's been
attacked!

239
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,676
By the way, Tenten, just what
did he mean by "dying message?"

240
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:14,343
Uh! Well uh...it's pretty much
like well you know!

241
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:18,243
Oh! I understand! So it is like
one of those things!

00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,210
<i>I am home!</i>

243
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:23,476
Huh.

<i>Welcome home, Lee!</i>

245
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:30,676

<i>dinner.</i>

[Giggling]

248
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,010
It is just like a note your
mother leaves for you on the
kitchen table.

249
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,076
It's nothing like that!

250
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,976
That is not right...?
Well, then!

251
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,476
Is it like this?

252
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:49,310
<i>Uhh, sure.</i>

253
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,143
These punchlines are becoming
a real drag...

254
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:57,343
It's just a message left by a
victim to help people identify
the culprit behind the attack.

255
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:00,010
Yeah, we know that! I
already explained it!

256
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:02,310
So what is this one
trying to tell us?

257
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:05,010
It looks to me like a
coiled up snake.

258
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:07,243
Of course! I know who the
culprit is!

[Gasp] He does?

260
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:11,010
Spirals are Naruto's symbol!

00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,410
He must be the one
who did this!

<i>so that he would not have to</i>
<i>take it!</i>

269

Come on! That didn't happen!

270
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,676
She's right, there
wouldn't be any point.

271
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,010
Naruto's team is with Kakashi
Sensei taking their own test.

272
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:50,376
Guy Sensei wasn't
involved at all.

273
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,943
I see...Very well then.

274
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,243
Oh! How careless!

275
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:59,243
How could I have overlooked the
clue when it was right under my
nose this whole time?!

276
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,576
Then the culprit must be Choji!

<i>on both of Choji's cheeks!</i>

280
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,910
His motive...?

281
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,510
A grudge from not getting to eat
the last piece of beef at
Barbe-Q's!

282
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:25,143
You were the one who stole that
last succulent bite from me, not
Guy Sensei!

283
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:26,110
Ahh!

284
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:30,110
Sorry Lee, wrong again. There's
no way it could have been Choji.

285
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:34,676
The room was locked, and the
only way in or out was the vent
by the ceiling.

286
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,943
I see...You are right. A fatso
like Choji could not have fit
through.

287
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:44,310
Hey don't call me that I'm
pleasantly plump!

288
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:47,743
Never mind Choji! None of us
could have fit through that
opening.

289
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:52,510
Yes. To get through there you'd
have to have a narrow,
flexible body like a snake.

290
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:53,376
A snake?

291
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,543
This time he must
know it's me.

292
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:57,310
This is quite a conundrum.

293
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,276
Yeah, it's like a
crime novel.

294
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,176
Wait, I have it!

295
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,443
I do not think there
was an actual attack!

296
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:07,343
Solving this mystery must be the
IQ test we are here for!

297
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:12,610
Lord Orochimaru, what should we
do? You heard what they all
said.

298

Guy Sensei, your voice sounds a

304
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:38,310
[Stuttering] No, well that's
because he's my twin brother. I
asked him to come help me and...

305
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:41,176
Oh, wow! You have a twin
brother, Guy Sensei?!

306
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:46,043
Indeed. He works at a bar now
but dreams of becoming an actor.

307
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:48,043
My younger twin, Golden Guy.

308
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:50,443
Great. Yet another
drag to deal with.

309
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:54,610
Listen, if this isn't an actual
IQ test, then I'm out of here.

310
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:57,543
Wow, Shikamaru, you've been
complaining this whole time.

311
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,110
Get serious, would you?!

312
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:00,576
Huh!

313
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:04,676
Anyone who's unsure of
themselves is free to quit.

314
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:11,676
It's time to begin my survival
IQ test, and it's terrifying.
For if you fail you will wake up
in hell.

315
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:14,576
Sounds exciting! I accept
the challenge!

316
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:16,543
The first question...

317
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,576
Hmm.

318
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,643
Hmmm.

319
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:26,043
Hmm!

320
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,543
I can't think of any questions.

321
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:35,443
It's hopeless. Lord Orochimaru's
<i>IQ is too low.</i>

322
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:38,910
Wait I know! Try to say
"pizza" ten times fast!

323
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:42,543
<i>I think my IQ is dropping just</i>
<i>watching this!</i>

324
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,376
This is the test I was
born to take!

325
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,043
Here it goes! Pizza, pizza,
pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza,
pizza, pizza, pizza.

326
00:18:49,276 --> 00:18:50,410
Now what is this?

327
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:51,476
Feetsa!

328
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,410
[Gasps]
Ahh!

329
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,476
Ahh!

330
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:59,110
What an impossible
question to answer!

331
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,143
<i>It's a good thing Lee's IQ is</i>
<i>about the same I guess.</i>

332
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:08,676
And the next question is...What
in the entire world is a dog's
favorite food?

333
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,110
What are you talking about? This
isn't an IQ test, it's just a
bunch of riddles!

334
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:15,243
I know, Pup-sicles!

335
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,410
Ahh!

336
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,543
Belgian woofles?!

337
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,943
Ahh!

338
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,376
The right answer's a hot dog
what else would it be?!

339
00:19:27,976 --> 00:19:29,143
Ahh! Of course!

340
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:32,410
[Laughing] But the next one is
even harder...

341
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:33,443
Ahh!

342
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:34,543
What could it be?

343
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:36,610
The Big Balloon Burst Game!

344
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:41,143
Lord Orochimaru, you've become a
<i>lowly variety show host!</i>

345
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:45,410
With every incorrect answer, the
<i>balloon will grow bigger!</i>

346
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:48,976
<i>You won't be able to stand the</i>
tension waiting for them to pop!

347
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:53,476
And worse...the fate that waits
the person whose balloon bursts
first...

348
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,443
<i>...is a boiling hot bath and</i>
<i>scalding hotpot!</i>

349
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:01,310
Ah! This is one
intense IQ test!

350
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:05,443
No! This isn't an IQ test at
all! Something is seriously
wrong here!

351
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:08,176
Ah! Just stop!

352
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:11,210
It's a drag, but I guess I
gotta save them...

353
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:17,110
Huh? What is this?
What's going on?!

354
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,476
My body's moving on its own!

355
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,676
Oh, no! Stop this!

356
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,176
No! Don't do this!

357
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:26,276
[Struggling]

358
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,243
[Screaming]

359
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:33,576
No! Don't you dare
push me in! Ahh!

360
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:36,076
[Screaming]

361
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,143
No more! I give up!

362
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,243
It was you?!

363
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:41,943
Of course!

364
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:44,243
How dare you try to deceive us!

365
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,110
Ahh!

366
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,043
I suppose the jig is up. But you
don't really believe that
you'll leave this building alive
do you?

367
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:52,310
[Grunting]

368
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:53,543
[Chuckling]

369
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,976
<i>Shikamaru's genius IQ of two</i>
<i>hundred is firing on all</i>
<i>cylinders!</i>

370
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,643
<i>In an instant, he's calculated</i>
<i>two hundred setups and</i>
<i>punchlines ahead!</i>

371
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:11,276
<i>Lee sets it up by mishearing</i>
<i>"building" as "pudding." The</i>
<i>enemy counters with a fancy</i>
<i>chestnut pudding...</i>

372
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,376
Neji reappears and looks inside
them with his Byakugan.

373
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,043
<i>And Lee uses the Sexy Jutsu,</i>
cause things weren't ridiculous
<i>enough already!</i>

374
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,010
Guy Sensei comes to and attacks
<i>with a Shimura Style Secret</i>
<i>Strike.</i>

375
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:26,243
<i>Choji does something in the</i>
<i>background, but it's not</i>
<i>funny, so no one sees.</i>

376
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:29,410
Then Tenten says the punchline:
<i>"Guy Sensei, behind you!"</i>

377
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:34,176
So now, we wait for
that to happen.

378
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:39,310
What kind of prediction is
that?! And how can you just sit
and wait in a situation like
this?!

379
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,476
Huh?

380
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,243
[Heavy Breathing]

381
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:44,143
Ahh! They showed up?!

382
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:47,210
We will fight with sushi! That
is how we roll!

383
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,076
Come on you don't have
to be so shellfish!

384
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,476
[Screaming]

385
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:55,243
Mind blown.

386
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,243
[Chuckles] So, Shikamaru
heroically fought off
Orochimaru.

387
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:02,510
Again proving brains are
stronger than brawn!

388
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,343
[Laughing]
<i>Hey, don't predict my narration</i>
<i>too! I need this job!</i>

389
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:53,573
Next week..."A Field Trip to the
Old Capitol!" and "Girls' Rooms
<i>and Candy Boxes!"</i>

390
00:23:53,906 --> 00:23:55,839
Judging by the
titles, I predict-

391
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:59,073
<i>Hey! Shikamaru, don't</i>
<i>spoil the next episode!</i>

392
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:02,773
You sure? I was gonna drop a
hint that would solve every
problem.

393
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:04,806
<i>It is more fun anticipating</i>
<i>the unknown!</i>

394
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,973
<i>Yeah! Well said Lee!</i>

395
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:10,206
I will enjoy waiting to see what
color Sakura's pajamas will be!

396
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,639
<i>I take it back...</i>
