You are proposing
the beach?

6
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:07,086
Yeah! That's where we
should all go for our
vacation! I mean, it
is summer, after all.

7
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,086
That is true, but
this is no time to be
fixated on relaxing!

8
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,620
Summer is the perfect
time for us to re-double
our training efforts!

But just what kinda
training is THAT!?

10
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:19,053
Whatever. I give
up... huh?

11
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:23,486
Hey! Sakura! Guess
what? Lee doesn't
want to go to the
beach!

12
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,886
I was hoping we
could get everyone
to go together...

Everyone!?

14
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:30,553
By the way, are you
gonna buy that teeny
swimsuit we saw the
other day?

15
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,353
ARGHGHHH!
Actually, I'm
not sure yet.

16
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,920
You should get
it! It looked
fantastic on you!

17

can train at the

It's an awesome idea,
but she's flying away,

are all-natural, but
why the heck are you
wearing that outfit!?

56
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,120
I felt shells qualified
a standard summer fare.

57
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:41,986
There's nothing
standard about that!

58
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,420
Only super models
wear shells, and that
was a long time ago!

Hey, Lee! Isn't
this a coincidence?!

out training, have we?

Are you training to be a
busty swimsuit model!?

How many outfits did
you bring with you!?

everything, Lee.

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,720
Time to go. We can
train at the beach.

81
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:42,453
And I have to tell
you, as your teacher
I'm thrilled to see
how dedicated you are!

82
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:44,986
and as your student
I wish you'd wear
a normal swimsuit!

83
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,653
I'm gonna make things
tough on you today, Lee!

84
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:51,053
You can start with
5000 laps around the
beach on your hands!

85
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:54,820
Woah... you look
even creepier in
that bathing suit
while upside down!

86
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,686
Ready, Lee?
Follow me.

Yes sir!

88
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,053

way to the beach
for this..?

<i>Sakura's swimsuit!</i>

147
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:01,753
Lee's patience is
surprising... How
much can he take?

148
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:04,953
Look! Lee and
Guy! Get out of
the water ..now!

149
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:09,320
It's a shark!

150
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:13,053
Oh, come on! Do
you people honestly
think I'm afraid
of a shark!?

151
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,420
I'll just blow it
away with my Leaf
Hurricane maneuver!

152
00:09:16,886 --> 00:09:19,020
You'er bringing it
closer to you!

153
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:21,620
Whoops! Maybe I
should be spinning
the other way...

154
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:25,120
(Tenten)
That's no good!
Now you're sucking
yourself in, too!

155
00:09:25,153 --> 00:09:27,453
I guess it's time
for my secret trick!

156
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:29,986
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>What's that-- playing</i>
<i>dead!? That won't help!</i>

157
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:34,720
I am sorry, Guy Sensei,
but I do not believe
the shark will fall for
your act..!

158
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:36,120
You need to be
more realistic!

159
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:37,453
I am a dead person!

160
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:39,186
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Did you know your</i>
<i>nose is bleeding!?</i>

161
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,886
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>That blood is gonna</i>
<i>send the shark into</i>
<i>a frenzy!</i>

162
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,520
ARGH! Go away! Get
out of here! Chase
something else! I
ta
ste like leftovers!

163
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,920
You're a genius, Naruto!

164
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:53,853
Now Bushy Brow can
finally go check
out Sakura's swimsuit!

165
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,053
Go find someone
else to eat!

166
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:59,086
Leave this job to
me, Sensei! I will
get rid of it for
you!

167
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,020
-WHAT!?
-WHAT!?

168
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,653
Leaf Huge
Ocean Current!!!

169
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,820
Is that a
new move?

170
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,153
[screaming]

171
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,720
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Why are Naruto and</i>
<i>Konohamaru there!?</i>

172
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:10,520
Lee... you really
came through...

173
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:12,853
Oh stop focusing
on your pupil's
progress..!

174
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:14,920
Talk to me, Lee!
Are you alright?!

175
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:17,886
[gasping for air]

176
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,486
I think I managed
to chase off that
shark!

177
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,986
(Sakura)
Huh? Now where
did it go?

178
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,686
<i>Huh!? Sakura's out</i>
<i>here looking for</i>
<i>something...</i>

179
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,553
<i>[gasp] This is</i>
<i>going to be my</i>
<i>big chance to</i>
<i>get close to her!</i>

180
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:30,953
Hm?

181
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:36,120
<i>AHHHHHH!!</i>
<i>C-could it be?</i>

182
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:40,386
<i>If her suit is</i>
<i>over here than</i>
<i>she has a big</i>
<i>problem..!</i>

183
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,786
<i>SAKURA!</i>

184
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:44,820
Huh?

185
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,786
Ahh!

186
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,386
Sakura! I finally
found the ball!

187
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,586
[gasp]

188
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,753
Lee! Have you seen my
swimsuit anywhere
around here? It came
off during the waterspout!

189
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,620
AHHHHHH!!!

190
00:11:04,386 --> 00:11:05,820
I am naked!

191
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,920
(Sakura)
CHAAAA!

192
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,453
Idiot..! Idiot..!

193
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,453
Now I get
it, guys...

194
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:17,720
So, you were both
trying to help, right?

195
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:20,553
I just wish we could
have actually done
something for you.

196
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:25,986
Sorry, Bushy Brow. The way
things turned out, I guess
you just won't get to see
Sakura's hot swimsuit.

197
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,720
(Sakura)
Oh that suit in the
store was too
wild for me..!

198
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:32,920
I almost got it,
but in the end, I
decided to go with
a normal one!

199
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:37,020
<i>After all this, I</i>
<i>don't blame Lee for</i>
<i>being disappointed.</i>

200
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,820
It does not
really matter!

201
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:42,786
I still got to
see Sakura in
a swimsuit!

202
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,086
MMmmhmmm!

203
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,586
So it didn't
matter either
way!?

204
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,886
(Naruto)
I'm starting to
understand Bushy
Brow!

205
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,553
<i>(Konohamaru)</i>

207
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:57,953

<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Lee and his friends</i>

209
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:15,138
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>And really, what beach</i>

<i>than this!?</i>

210
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,105
Watermelon splitting!

211
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:20,072
<i>Yes... the</i>

<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>That's so melodramatic!</i>

<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>And since when are you</i>
<i>all considered to be</i>

217
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:37,738
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>I have put myself through</i>

Oh brother! I'm not
even gonna begin to
touch that one!

220
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:45,005
I'm so psyched
about this, guys!

221
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:47,005
Well, calm down,
'cause I'm gonna win!

222
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:49,772
I don't care who wins
as long as I get a
piece of that watermelon!

223
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:52,072
What a drag, but I
suppose I'll play...

224
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,172
Alright, guys! It is
time to go for it!

225
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:56,138
[cheering]

226

<i>(Guy Sensei)</i>

"Watermelon Wars"

229
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,438
I want you all to
think about this
for a minute...

230
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:20,638
For ninjas like yourselves,
a game of watermelon
-splitting is so easy,
it's meaningless!

231
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:23,538
(Tenten)
What is the meaning
of the melon on your
your head, Guy Sensei?

232
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:27,372
But if we do not play
the game, we will end
up dissecting the
melon as usual.

233
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,638
Yeah, really.
And where's the
fun in that?

234
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:32,438
Who said you should
dissect the melon
as usual..?

235
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:35,438
I just said an
ordinary game
would be boring.

236
00:13:35,472 --> 00:13:38,472
So then, what does
that actually mean?

237
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:40,538
You still don't get
it, do you, Lee?

238
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:45,172
<i>What is a watermelon</i>
<i>splitting contest?</i>
<i>Concentration and</i>
<i>judgement.</i>

239
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:48,172
<i>You have the potential</i>
<i>to hone these skills,</i>
<i>and many more.</i>

240
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:49,505
<i>I wonder which one</i>
<i>is the sweetest!?</i>

241
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:53,572
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>It looks like nothing</i>
<i>more than an excuse to</i>
<i>pick and eat a good melon!</i>

242
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:55,672
<i>(Guy)</i>
<i>I found a sweet one!</i>

243
00:13:55,705 --> 00:14:01,572
I hereby declare that
today's contest will be the
first-ever all-out Watermelon
Splitting Survival Race!

244
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:04,572
Watermelon Splitting
Survival Race..?

245
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:07,105
I think it sounds
kinda fun!

246
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,672
Me too! I'm
so in!

247
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:12,305
If you're open-minded,
you can think of it as
the perfect training exercise!

248
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:14,705
Yes! Suddenly,
I am all jazzed!

249
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:20,705
Oh yeah, and I forgot
to mention, the winner
is going to get the whole
melon for themselves!

250
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:23,638
A whole melon to
themselves!? How
extravagant!

251
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:24,772
What the heck?

252
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:27,105
It would be better
to share it like
normal people.

253
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:29,238
If you're not confident,
I won't force you to play.

254
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:31,372
I was worried this
would be too hard
for the girls...

255
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:33,605
What does that
mean!? We can
handle anything
the guys can!

256
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:37,372
We won't stand for
you insulting us,
Sensei! We're in and
we're gonna win!

257
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:39,138
Great! Consider it settled!

258
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,772
The rules are quite simple:

259
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:42,638
<i>Everyone starts in a</i>
<i>different spot.</i>

260
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:45,705
<i>And everyone has to</i>
<i>wear a watermelon</i>
<i>balloon on their head.</i>

261
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:48,705
<i>If your balloon gets</i>
<i>popped, that's it!</i>
<i>You're out!</i>

262
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:53,205
<i>The goal is to pop</i>
<i>your enemy's balloon</i>
<i>and survive until the end!</i>

263
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:58,138
<i>The first person to make</i>
<i>it to the finish line and</i>
<i>split the watermelon wins</i>
<i>it all!</i>

264
00:14:58,172 --> 00:15:01,272
Tenten and I will
be the referees,
and enforce the
rules.

265
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:02,738
Why me, exactly?

266
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:04,738
You'll be in charge
of the punch-lines.

267
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:06,105
Gee, what an
honor...

268
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,305
Very well! Let
the race begin!

269
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:09,272
[whistle]

270
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:11,538
You can pack up
and o home now!

271
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:13,105
I will, after
I win!

272
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:15,005
Lady Hinata!

273
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:18,038
You know, Sensei, all the
people you've sent on
this mission are highly
trained ninjas...

274
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:20,605
...I don't think
this watermelon
survival race will
be that difficult.

275
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:21,672
Think again,
Tenten.

276
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:23,505
Huh?

277
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:27,472
This is no ordinary race
they're running. The beach
is littered with traps
unique to the summer.

278
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:29,538
So they have no
idea what they're
in for?

279
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:32,138
Not in the
least. Shing!

280
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,338
Okay... "shing"...

281
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:36,505
<i>If I went straight</i>
<i>through the water...</i>

282
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:39,105
<i>...It would be a</i>
<i>shortcut to the</i>
<i>watermelon...</i>

283
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:44,038
<i>...But I would be</i>
<i>a sitting duck trying</i>
<i>to navigate through</i>
<i>this crowd...</i>

284
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,405
<i>I will have to</i>
<i>move very carefully.</i>

285
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:49,372
Did you figure
it out?

286
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:50,072
ARGH!

287
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:51,572
Nothing is quite
as it seems...

288
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:56,072
Normal summer beach
happenings become
traps in a Watermelon
Survival Race!

289
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:57,005
He's right, Lee.

290
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,472
ARGH!

291
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:02,038
A ninja could easily
hide. Especially in this
big crowd of beach-goers.

292
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:05,238
<i>The first rule of</i>
<i>survival is to move</i>
<i>very carefully...</i>

293
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:09,438
<i>(Guy)</i>
<i>As a matter of fact, while</i>
<i>we've been talking, someone</i>
<i>has fallen into a trap...</i>

294
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:12,272
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Wait, it's not</i>
<i>Lee, is it?</i>

295
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,538
Ooooof!

296
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:16,738
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>Choji looks like he's</i>
<i>in pain! What happened?</i>

297
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:23,738
I ate too much yakisoba and
fried squid and hot dogs and
snow cones and soft serve and
now my stomach hurts!

298
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:27,372
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>You're supposed to</i>
<i>be in a competition!</i>

299
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:28,772
And you too!

300
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:31,005
I'm beggin you--
Please..!

301
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:32,772
I've got you
now, Choji!

302
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:39,572
Ahhhh! -Oooof!

303
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:41,638
That was one of
your summer traps
at the beach?

304
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:45,072
That's right. If you
overeat, you can fall
into Trap # 1

305
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,472
...And that would
be diarrhea! Shing!

306
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:51,272
I know you're trying
to be cool, but the
"shing" is really
not working...

307
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:54,538
Hm? Looks like
we've got some
movement in the
snack hut!

308
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:56,238
Huh?

309
00:16:56,272 --> 00:16:58,572
What's the matter with
you, young lady!? Take
off that funny hat and
get to work!

310
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:00,405
What!? Wait a minute,
I don't work here!

311
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:03,338
I just don't understand
you kids today, you're
such whiners!

312
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:05,272
Hey! Are you listening
to me!? --Ooof!

313
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:09,372
That was too easy.

314
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:14,038
Busy summers at a
fast food stall mean
you're gonna need lots
more help! Shing!

315
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:17,438
That's not so much a
trap, it's just a
problem for the owner.

316
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,605
(Girl)
Hm? What in the world
is this girl up to?

317
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:23,605
You must be lonely
hanging out at the
beach all by yourself.

318
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:26,372
Maybe she's down there
spying on an ex-boyfriend!

319
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:29,405
What a waste! There are
plenty of other fish in
the sea! [laugh]

320
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:31,005
[laughter]

321
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,572
Excuse me, Mr. and
Mrs. Smart-Alek!
i'm not doing this
because I enjoy it!

322
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:35,472
You're open!

323
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,238
You lost focus, and
you have to pay the
price, kid!

324
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:42,438
A lesson learned, see?
Youth is greener on the
other side of the summer
fence... Shing!

325
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:45,305
That one wasn't a
haiku, it didn't
even make sense!

326
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:47,305
It's simply a
warning...

327
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:50,605
When you see other couples
being lovey-dovey at the
beach, it can make you so
jealous, you'll run straight

328
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:53,638
into the arms of
the first guy you
happen to see... shing!

329
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,705
For crying out loud!

330
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:57,305
That watermelon's
gonna be all mine,
folks! --ahhh!

331
00:17:57,338 --> 00:17:59,038
Ooof! Ughh...

332
00:17:59,272 --> 00:18:01,638
I'm sorry about that.

333
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:03,005
[gasp]

334
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:10,005
Wow! She's gorgeous!

335
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:20,372
Arghhh!!! That
was cold, Lee!

336
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:21,438
Nice job, Neji!

337
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:26,038
I'm always the
distraction...
Why me every time!?

338
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:29,205
That was a very smart
move, Lee, teaming up
with Neji...

339
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:35,372
Creating an alluring summer
girl to get Konohamaru to let
his guard down was a brilliant
piece of counter-strategy.

340
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:40,105
What do you mean,
"counter-strategy!?" None
of this is even remotely
like real traps or survival!

341
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:43,505
Oh really? Love is all
about survival my dear,
SHING!

342
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:46,572
Shing, shing, shing!
Is that all you've
got!? Enough already!

343
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:49,205
Alright, so who's
coming after me?

344
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:50,605
At least I have
some protection...

345
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:53,138
There's got to be
a way to get around
that crowd...

346
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:54,838
Boy, this ramen's good!

347
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:59,505
There's no telling where
Naruto and Shikamaru will
attack from. I need an
escape path...

348
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,105
<i>Forgive me Neji, but</i>
<i>in this race, I have</i>
<i>to protect myself first!</i>

349
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:04,572
No action at
the moment...

350
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,472
But this survival
race has definitely
entered it's final
stages.

351
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:10,405
It's down to four
guys, and I have
to say, they're
all pretty goo-

352
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:12,205
Oh no! What's
happening here!?

353
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,305
Lee!

354
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:17,772
Hey, are you alright?

355
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:20,038
[groaning]

356
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:21,605
What happened
to you!?

357
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:25,705
I... I guess I
got in too deep...

358
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:30,138
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>She... was so</i>
<i>beautiful...</i>

359
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:33,238
<i>She appeared before</i>
<i>me as if she had</i>
<i>stepped out of a</i>
<i>dream...</i>

360
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,372
<i>And when she finally</i>
<i>spoke, she told me</i>
<i>she only wanted</i>
<i>one thing...</i>

361
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:40,038
<i>An emerald more</i>
<i>beautiful than</i>
<i>the ocean...</i>

362
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:41,972
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>What... the what!?</i>

363
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:44,572
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>I found I was unable</i>
<i>to deny her...</i>

364
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:49,238
<i>I spent all my savings</i>
<i>to buy her an emerald</i>
<i>that sparkled brighter</i>
<i>than the seven seas.</i>

365
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,172
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>What in the world are</i>
<i>you talking about!?</i>

366
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:58,305
<i>(Lee)</i>
<i>But as it turned out, she</i>
<i>preferred to have a yellow</i>
<i>diamond brighter than the sun!</i>

367
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:03,305
<i>Without a thought, she</i>
<i>left me for another man</i>
<i>who was willing to give</i>
<i>her such a jewel...</i>

368
00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:06,705
Yes, that is my
tale of woe...

369
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,038
When I lost her,
I just lost...
everything!

370
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:12,605
You idiot! You
fell into the
ocean!?

371
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,005
Were you trying to
drown yourself!?

372
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,605
Hey! He said he fell,
but what if he actually
fell for a girl!?

373
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:21,138
Everyone! Please let
us through! We have
an emergency!

374
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:25,772
This lovesick fool
needs medical attention!
And, here I am again!

375
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:28,305
<i>Why does this</i>
<i>always happen</i>
<i>to me?!</i>

376
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:31,538
Wow, it worked! The
crowd moved completely
back!

377
00:20:31,572 --> 00:20:34,038
<i>It's a straight shot</i>
<i>to the watermelon!</i>

378
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,605
<i>(Naruto)</i>
<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>for this..!</i>

379
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,305
Naruto?

380
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,538
No way are we
going to let
you get past us!

381
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:46,105
Well-played, Bushy
Brow! I should have
figured it out!

382
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:49,472
But just because
you've made a short-
cut, doesn't mean
you've beaten me! ARGH!

383
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:51,172
-Huh?
-Huh?

384
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:58,238
You guys are really
making me work! I
hope it's worth it!

385
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:00,372
D'oh!

386
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:02,172
Sorry, Neji! But
I had no choice!

387
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:03,438
Lee! You back-stabber!

388
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,705
AHHH!

389
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:06,472
Only one of us is
getting his hands
on that watermelon!

390
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,138
And it is going
to be me!!!
