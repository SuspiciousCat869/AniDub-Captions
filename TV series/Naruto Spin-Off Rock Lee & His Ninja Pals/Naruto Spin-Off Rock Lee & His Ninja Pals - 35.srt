00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:59,641
<i>Caring for pets can be a</i>
<i>lot of fun. Millions of</i>
<i>people do it every day.</i>
<i>But when it comes to the</i>

2
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:03,141
<i>animals used by ninjas,</i>
<i>things aren't always so</i>
<i>simple.</i>

3
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:08,008
This mission I'm on
came out of nowhere. Would
you mind entertaining these
two until I get back?

4
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,208
Sure thing!

5
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:12,541
And I can tell you right
now, they will be in good
hands!

6
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:18,008
<i>The Fifth Hokage needs me</i>
<i>to do something for her. I</i>
<i>was wondering if you could</i>
<i>watch my animals for me.</i>

7
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,308
Certainly, my friend!

8
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:23,508
I'll treat them better
than at any kennel you
could take them to.

9
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:28,708
I hate to ask this, but
could you watch Tonton
for me for a couple of
days? And Katsuyu as

10
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,141
well, just to be on the
safe side?

11
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:34,075
Oh please, don't even
give it a second thought!
I'd be happy to do it!

12
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:43,641
<i>Caring for Animals</i>
<i>is Hard Work!</i>

13
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,141
[gasping]

14
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,508
I can't believe we have
so many pets to look
after.

15
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,141
<i>Yeah, I hope we can</i>
<i>handle it.</i>

16
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,141
Heh-heh. Don't
worry yourselves.

17
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,708
In fact...

18
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,741
I'm adding my ninja
tortoise to the mix!

19
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:03,175
We have enough
on our plates!

20
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,775
We don't need a
tortoise as well.

21
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:06,541
You got a problem,
young lady?!

22
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:10,675
Allow me to remind
you, I've been watching
out for you brats since
you were genin!

23
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:15,141
He's right. For us
ninjas, our animals are
some of our most reliable
allies!

24
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:20,175
Yes, but since I am a
shinobi who cannot use
ninjutsu
have the skills to properly

25
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,708
care for a pack of ninja
hounds, let alone other
summoned animals.

26
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,675
Don't be absurd! Just
ignite your youthful
passion, and you can form
a bond with any animal!

27
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,841
Idiot! Idiot!
Idiot! Idiot!

28
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,508
All right...

29
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,608
Gamakichi and
Gamatastsu...

30
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:36,841
Sup?

31
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,875
Katsuyu and Tonton...

32
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:39,875
Oink.

33
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:42,941
Kakashi Sensei's eight
ninja hounds...

34
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:43,708
Pakkun...

35
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:44,343
Hi.

36
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:45,608
Bull, Shiba...

37
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,063
Yo.

38
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:46,708
Biscuit...

39
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:47,202
Hey.

40
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:47,841
Guruko...

41
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:48,390
Hi.

42
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:48,841
Uhashi...

43
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:49,297
Sup?

44
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:49,841
Akino...

45
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,517
Yeah.

46
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:50,941
Uhei!

47
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:51,741
Right.

48
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,675
<i>Yahooo!</i>

49
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,541
There goes Kiba and
Akamaru.

50
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:57,941
Akamaru! Dynamic Marking!

51
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:59,641
[barking]

52
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,675
Hey, watch where you're
spraying, alright?!

53
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,541
Wow! What great
technique!

54
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:11,108
I have to agree. A
perfect demonstration!

55
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:15,141
Seriously, the dogs are
really impressed! Is the
move that wonderful?

56
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,208
It... looks like
so much fun.

57
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:21,841
I know you, Guy Sensei!
Don't you dare attempt
that one!

58
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,608
Hey there! What are you
guys up to?

59
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:28,108
By sheer coincidence,
everybody on our team is
animal-sitting for
someone this week!

60
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:29,208
Oh...

61
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:31,675
That means we'll all be
best friends in no time!

62
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,308
[struggling]

63
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:37,941
Ah yes, bonding through
kinship! It happens so
much, it's a normal
part of youth!

64
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,675
Right, Guy Sensei!

65
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,741
That would be fine,
except the animal clearly
hates it!

66
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:45,608
[growling]

67
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:49,841
Look, Guy Sensei! Akamaru
is playing with me! Is that
not wonderful?

68
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:54,008
Great job, Lee! You and
Akamaru have formed an
unbreakable bond!

69
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,741
I seriously doubt
that. Oh, boy.

70
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,675
You're a bad dog,
Akamaru.

71
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,275
[whimpering]

72
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:05,541
Well, it's clear. You
and Akamaru understand
each other, don't you,
Kiba?

73
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:08,808
We should. We've been
inseparable since we were
both babies.

74
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,608
He's very different
from a summoned animal.

75
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:16,908
<i>For those who don't</i>
<i>know, summonings,</i>
<i>like Kakashi Sensei's</i>
<i>dogs, normally live</i>

76
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:21,441
<i>somewhere far away. But</i>
<i>they're always on</i>
<i>alert, and immediately</i>
<i>come to the aid of their</i>

77
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:22,808
<i>summoner when they're</i>
<i>called upon.</i>

78
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:25,041
Wait! In that case...

79
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,441
We don't need anyone
to take care of us.

80
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:28,875
Oh, I beg to differ!

81
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:31,908
We promised to use our
full powers to care for
you!

82
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:35,141
You're always so
stubborn about things
like this.

83
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:36,941
Fine, then...

84
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:38,041
Scatter!

85
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:38,908
[gasping]

86
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,308
They ran off!

87
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:44,141
Hmpf! If you want to
watch us so badly, you'll
have to catch us, first.

88
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:48,675
But take heed! The great
Pakkun will not be caught
so easily!

89
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,808
Don't be such a smug
pug!

90
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,808
Hey, this is cool, bro!
It's just like playing
tag!

91
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,608
Except we have a head
start!

92
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:56,575
[oinking]

93
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,041
Stop, Akamaru!

94
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:06,508
What the heck? Everyone
took off and ran away.
Even Katsuyu!

95
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,475
Pop quiz for
everybody!

96
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:12,841
Think about it carefully.
What shocking action did
the animals just take?

97
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:17,141
We already know the
answer to that one! The
question is, what are we
gonna do?!

98
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:18,775
It is obvious!

99
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,808
We have to go out there
and catch them all, and
give them the best care
on earth!

100
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,841
[panting]

101
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:31,941
All this running is
making me hungry, bro.
We need to stop somewhere
and get ourselves a snack!

102
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,141
No way! You'll just
have to suck it up
'til we're clear!

103
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,608
Really?

104
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,075
Huh?

105
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,075
Mmm.

106
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:43,541
Yummyyyy!

107
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:47,541
Gamatastsu, that's not
a snack! That's Tonton,
and you have to put her
down now!

108
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:51,708
Sorry, my friend, but I
suddenly had a craving
for pork!

109
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:54,008
You have to control
yourself!

110
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,641
Ah, there you are!

111
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:57,141
You're coming back!

112
00:06:57,175 --> 00:07:00,008
Tonton! Katsuyu! Thank
goodness we found you!

113
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,108
Hold on!

114
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:02,608
Don't touch him!

115
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:04,075
Thanks, bro!

116
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:07,575
Back off! I won't let
you hurt my brother! He
didn't mean any harm!

117
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:09,475
Don't try to
cover for him.

118
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:11,441
Just hear me out.

119
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:15,108
You must know what it's
like, sometimes. You've
got that cousin, don't you?

120
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:17,841
Her name is Hinata,
if I recall.

121
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,508
Truthfully, you'd
protect Hinata if she
got herself in trouble,
wouldn't you?

122
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,441
Mm.

123
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,675
[trembling]

124
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,008
I'm here, Hinata!

125
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,141
Of course I would.

126
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:33,008
<i>And more to the point, if</i>
<i>Hinata wanted to eat some</i>
<i>flies, you'd catch them</i>
<i>for her, wouldn't you?</i>

127
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:33,875
Uh!

128
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:36,808
All that running made me
really hungry!

129
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:40,775
Help yourself, Hinata! I
was able to catch a lot
for you!

130
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,175
That would never happen!

131
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,141
I'm not done!

132
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:48,641
Don't forget about her
big, scary dad,
Hinabunta!

133
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:50,175
I'm Hinata, folks!

134
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,841
Hinabunta? What are you
even talking about?!

135
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,808
<i>Plus, I haven't even</i>
<i>mentioned Hinahiro and</i>
<i>Hinaken.</i>

136
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,408
Sorry. But I'm very
clumsy.

137
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:02,075
How many types of Hinatas
do you think there are?!

138
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,008
A lot. And they all live
on Mount Hinaboku,
don't they?

139
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,675
Mount Hinaboku?!

140
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:10,075
So, under these
circumstances,
I'm sure you can--

141
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:12,108
Not in the slightest,
big-mouth!

142
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:13,675
Uh!

143
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:17,508
Oiiiink.

144
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,841
Tonton?

145
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,308
What are you doing?

146
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:24,108
Gamatastsu was one step
away from eating you! And
you'd still protect him?

147
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:26,541
Oink.

148
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:34,708
Oink. Oink, oink. Oink,
oink.

149
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:39,008
She's obviously saying
something important, but
I can't understand a
single word!

150
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,975
Oh, well.
Whatever.

151
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:42,175
You're safe now!

152
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,441
Oink!

153
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:47,608
Hold it!

154
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:49,875
Stop running, right now!

155
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:53,141
Why do I feel like
we're being chased,
along with everyone else?

156
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,775
[whimpering]

157
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:57,608
All right, you guys! You
asked for it!

158
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,408
Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!

159
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,841
How do you like this? The
hunter's become the
hunted. You're really
stuck now, Guy.

160
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,075
Awww.

161
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,141
You finally decided to
play with me!

162
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,675
You're mis-interpreting
what's going on here.

163
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,608
Guy Sensei!

164
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:21,541
Look at this! Kiba and
Akamaru have decided to
play with me!

165
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:25,508
And from the looks of it,
they're both having a
lot of fun!

166
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,675
For heaven's sake! Are
the two of you guys
really that crazy?

167
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:34,075
Guy Sensei, do you want
to trade your dogs for my
Fang-Over-Fang?

168
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,541
You... don't
mind?

169
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,675
What in the world is
happening here?

170
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:43,608
Well, that tears it!
Akamaru! Everyone! It's
time for our special
attack!

171
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:46,975
A combo attack with all
nine dogs?!

172
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:48,108
Wow!

173
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:51,941
Hyper Dynamic Marking!

174
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:54,008
Please, this craziness
has to stop!

175
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,708
[grunting]

176
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:56,808
So gross!

177
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,908
Akamaru, combo
transformation!

178
00:09:58,941 --> 00:09:59,775
[barking]

179
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:01,841
A two-headed wolf?!

180
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,641
<i>When Kiba and Akamaru do</i>
<i>a combined transformation,</i>
<i>this is how they end up.</i>

181
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:06,741
Now I have got you!

182
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,841
Stop, Lee! You
don't know--ah!

183
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,175
[grunting]

184
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,441
What happened here?!

185
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:16,675
He got mixed in! Lee,
Kiba and Akamaru are
doing a combo move!

186
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,875
This is actually a pretty
cool deal, huh?

187
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:22,141
What are you talking
about?! Dude, we couldn't
look less cool!

188
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:23,575
We gotta run for it!

189
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:24,675
Wait for us!

190
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:27,841
Hold it!

191
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:29,808
Huh?

192
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:32,908
Come on, how's a
tortoise supposed
to catch us?

193
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,908
My ninja tortoise is faster
than any rabbit, or dog,
for that matter!

194
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,841
What?! Wait a second!

195
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,741
Collabo Taijutsu!
Tortoise Power!

196
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,908
[screaming]

197
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,975
That tortoise is
really fast!

198
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:47,808
[gasping]

199
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,908
You overdid it, Guy
Sensei! It was too much!

200
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:56,908
[gasping]

201
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:00,908
[groaning]
Huh?

202
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:05,008
So... Is everybody
alright?

203
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,775
[whimpering]

204
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:08,375
[chuckling]

205
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:15,008
Interesting. I see he
managed to get out of the
combo in time to save the
dog.

206
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,575
[chuckling]
Nice work, dude.

207
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,575
<i>Hey, thanks a million,</i>
<i>guys.</i>

208
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,941
Looking back, we ended up
having a lot of fun!

209
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,408
Looks like it's
mission accomplished.

210
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:27,575
But still... we have
quite a ways to go.

211
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:30,908
Next time this kind of
thing happens... I will
ignite my youthful fires

212
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,075
and truly learn to
understand the animals!

213
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,641
You know something, Lee?
I believe you!

214
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:42,675
<i>Lee and his pals swore to</i>
<i>learn from their experience</i>
<i>and do better the next time.</i>

215
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,841
<i>And...</i>

216
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,441
<i>It turned out they got</i>
<i>that chance sooner than</i>
<i>they expected.</i>

217
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,975
Here are our new charges!

218
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,141
You're nuts! Forget
about it!

219
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:10,854
<i>It's starting to get</i>
<i>chilly out here in the</i>
<i>Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

220
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,587
<i>So... is everybody</i>
<i>ready for winter?</i>

221
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,487
Maybe we should all do
some joint training, once
in a while.

222
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,854
Good idea! We should go
find Hinata.

223
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:21,354
Hold on! Isn't that her
right there?

224
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:22,420
Hm?

225
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,820
Maybe it is me, but she
seems sad.

226
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:30,354
Oh, it's not anything
real big...

227
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:36,787
It's just the change in
seasons. Winter's almost
here and it's got me
feeling kinda down.

228
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,487
What's wrong with winter?
There's lots of fun stuff
about to come up.

229
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,854
There's the whole
Christmas thing, and
New Years...

230
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,354
The first temple visit,
Valentine's Day...

231
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:48,820
I get it. These are all
days best enjoyed by
couples.

232
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:50,820
You'd like to spend
them with Naruto,
wouldn't you?

233
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,787
[gasping]

234
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,187
Is that what this is
about, Hinata?

235
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,754
Mmmm, well--

236
00:12:56,787 --> 00:13:01,654
It would make me happier
if I could just get a little
bit closer to him, you know?

237
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:04,554
But I don't think I'm
ever going to get that
chance.

238
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:07,220
Come on, winter hasn't
even started yet.

239
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,520
We can arrange for all
the chances you need.

240
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:14,287
It will be our mission as
a group to make sure you
spend winter with a smile
on your face!

241
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,687
Yeah, we're all
onboard!

242
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,287
[affirmative barking]

243
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,554
Thank you!

244
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:20,254
Neji?

245
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:21,820
Fine, I'm in.

246
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:22,654
Heh!

247
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:30,787
<i>Howl at Naruto!</i>

248
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:36,654
We have tried going on
the offensive before and
have failed miserably.

249
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:44,687
Now we will do the
opposite. And try to make
things feel as natural as
possible.

250
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,854
What do you have in mind,
specifically?

251
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:48,320
Something like...

252
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:51,354
[gasping]

253
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:56,387
Naruto!

254
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,220
Thanks for letting me
borrow it.

255
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:01,620
What's this one?

256
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:05,354
I thought since you
liked the first book,
you'd like this, too!

257
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,854
Thanks, and next time,
I'll loan you some more
of my favorites!

258
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:13,454
Trading books back and
forth will start to close
the gap, and then, when
Christmas rolls around...

259
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:18,520
... she can up the ante
with a handmade scarf! If
that does not get to him,
nothing will!

260
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:20,354
Isn't that a
bit too dull?

261
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,854
No. I think it has a nice
flow to it.

262
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:24,820
So what do you think,
Hinata?

263
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:28,387
I think I can pull it off
so it feels natural.

264
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,387
Then it is settled! The
game is afoot, everyone!

265
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:36,187
We are standing by. What
is the situation?

266
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:42,087
I'm on Fourth Street. I
can report the target is
on the move and approaching
your location. Over.

267
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,787
Thanks, that is excellent
news! Time to get in
position, Hinata.

268
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,620
Right!

269
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,820
I wonder if this will
work.

270
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:53,820
I still have eyes on
target. He's closing in
fast. Oh!

271
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:55,354
Something wrong?

272
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:59,820
He's passing by the
library. I think he must
be headed to the shopping
mall.

273
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:02,354
He's probably heading
to Ichiraku.

274
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:03,554
Yeah.

275
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:05,754
[sighing]

276
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:09,120
This is incredibly
frustrating! I mean, we
were so close!

277
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:15,087
Hey, admit it, you were
way off. I mean, Naruto's
probably never set foot
in a library before.

278
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,587
You have a good point.

279
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:21,220
I guess my idea was a
complete failure.

280
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,220
That's a shame.
We got nowhere.

281
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:24,820
I refuse to accept that.

282
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:29,087
We just need to bring
Naruto here in a way that
is both natural and casual.

283
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,320
So your idea is...

284
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:47,287
By pure coincidence, we
just happen to run into
him while we're out on
the town...

285
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
And that's what you
call "natural"?!

286
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:50,954
Okay, here is another
thought.

287
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:54,487
We could hire a
detective to grab Naruto
and bring him here in a
most natural way!

288
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,720
Sorry Lee, but I'm
afraid you're missing
the point again.

289
00:15:57,754 --> 00:16:00,154
<i>Howl at the Sunset.</i>

290
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,254
Our plan will not work
any other way. Do you
understand, Meatball-Head?

291
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:08,154
Meatball Head? Are you
talking to me?

292
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:10,820
A detective always gives
his underlings nicknames.

293
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:13,287
Cool! So what's mine?

294
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,354
You are "Mittens" and
Akamaru is "Boots".

295
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:18,654
All right! We've
been given dog names!

296
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,254
Those happen to be cat
names.

297
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,254
Well in our home, we
don't discriminate!

298
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,254
The cats are happy to
hear that!

299
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,687
Hmpf! This is dumb!

300
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,154
<i>Neji's referred to</i>
<i>as "Big Sis".</i>

301
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,320
Wait a minute! What do
you mean "Sis"?!

302
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:34,154
No insubordination, or
you will be fired. Let us
roll!

303
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,154
Wait, everybody.

304
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:39,520
You've forgotten
something critical.

305
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:42,520
And what would that be,
exactly?

306
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:44,187
Well, my nickname.

307
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,687
What?! And why is your
nickname critical?

308
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,254
How can you ask that?

309
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:52,587
If I don't have a
nickname, it will hinder
our ability to complete
the mission.

310
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,354
Forg O'ten will be
your new name!

311
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:58,687
Forg... O'ten?

312
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,287
Forgotten?

313
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,120
How in the world... did
this happen?

314
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:05,854
Forg, are you all right?!

315
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:10,154
This is all my fault! I
let my poor subordinate
get killed in the line of
duty!

316
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:14,120
He wasn't exactly
killed in action, since
you pulled the trigger
yourself!

317
00:17:14,154 --> 00:17:17,354
His sacrifice will not be
in vain! Let us roll out!

318
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:20,120
You're all going? What
am I supposed to do?

319
00:17:20,154 --> 00:17:23,820
Wait inside until we get
back. We will bring the
suspect to you!

320
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:26,487
Uh...

321
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,520
What a meal! Man, am I
ever stuffed! I have the
time, so I guess I'll go
see what Sakura's up to.

322
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:34,687
Forget it! You're not
getting past me!

323
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,520
What's your problem?

324
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:40,387
You're a suspect in the
legendary Amano River
murders, where you were
able to use the ol'

325
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,120
perfectly timed-gluttonous
maid-finds-the-melon-bread-
dripping-with-blood trick!

326
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:45,587
You're comin'
with me!

327
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,454
I don't know what you
mean!

328
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:50,487
This will be easier on
everybody if you come
quietly!

329
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,387
[grunting]

330
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,654
Sorry, but you're not
making any sense!

331
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,087
The perp's running!

332
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:02,187
Do not worry. Those two
guys are expert trackers.
They will not let him get
away.

333
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,420
Attaboy!

334
00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:07,687
Nobody ever escapes from
our noses! Huh? That
smells like---

335
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,287
You're sure these are
good?

336
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,587
Just have yourself a
bite! I know they smell
awful, but they taste
great!

337
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,487
Why are you grilling
salted horse mackerels?!

338
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,354
You okay?

339
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,354
They've looked better,
that's for sure.

340
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,087
<i>Mittens! Boots! Are you</i>
<i>there? Respond!</i>

341
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,554
<i>Howl at the Sunset.</i>

342
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:30,420
Their sense of smell
betrayed them.

343
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,187
<i>What's happening out</i>
<i>there?</i>

344
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,254
We lost Mittens and
Boots! But we will track
the man down and get him
next time, I swear!

345
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,054
Oh... Okay.

346
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,354
Looks like I was finally
able to lose them.

347
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,454
But what was that all
about? Huh?

348
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:46,654
There she is!

349
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:49,854
Sakura, where are you
headed? I finally found
you!

350
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:51,587
Eight Trigrams Air Palm!

351
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:56,687
I don't care if it does
trap the suspect, this
outfit is just way too
much.

352
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,687
<i>Neji, is Naruto okay?!</i>

353
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,820
Generally, yes, although
I may have overdone it
just a little.

354
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,220
<i>What?!</i>

355
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:08,087
Who are you talking to?
And... what's going on
with you people today?!

356
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,487
None of your business,
but I've got you now!

357
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,687
Mission accomplished!

358
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,854
What the heck is my crime
here? Am I being detained
just because I mistook
the cross-dressing

359
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:19,120
pervert, Neji, for the
real Sakura?

360
00:19:19,154 --> 00:19:21,354
Did you say
cross-dressing
pervert?

361
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:23,187
Pervert?

362
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,887
Eww.

363
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,654
Stay back, don't go
near him!

364
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,154
Wait! Why am I in the
line of fire?!

365
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:33,620
This is all wrong!

366
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:35,254
I have to talk--

367
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:37,420
<i>Farewell, Big Sis.</i>

368
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:40,087
<i>Howl at the Sunset.</i>

369
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:44,554
So Big Sis is out?

370
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:47,254
We have no options.
We have to take him
by force.

371
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,120
No! You can't
do that!

372
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,687
This whole process was
supposed to feel natural!

373
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,354
Listen, Hinata!

374
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:57,787
This is no longer going
down at the library! It
will be at the scene of
the crime!

375
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,354
Uhh... Why are you
Detective Lee Aojima?
You're supposed to be
Chief Leejiro!

376
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:03,254
Uh!

377
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,254
What should I do?

378
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:06,887
Freeze right there!

379
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,454
I said "freeze",
sucker! Why are you
running?!

380
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:14,254
I'm running 'cause you're
chasing me! And whatever
it is, I didn't do it!

381
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:27,020
[grunting]

382
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:29,320
This should shake her,
once and for all.

[grunting]

384
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:33,587
What the---?!

385
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,254
End of the line, mister!

386
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:42,520
What?! Now you've
become Daimon?! You've
gotta stop changing
characters!

387
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:44,787
All right, that's it!
I'm taking you out!

388
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,420
You have no chance!

389
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,620
<i>[grunting with anger]</i>

390
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,120

00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,687
Huh?! Whoa!

394
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,354
Thank goodness I got here
in time!

Ahhhhh!

Hinata! Are
you all right?

399
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:14,120
Naruto?

400
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:17,087
I'm so sorry. I guess
I just got in the way.

401
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,620
I need to get you to a
hospital. Don't try
and talk!

402
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,687
Are you...
all right?

403
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,454

it... Thank you for

Mmm.

What does
this mean?

406

I don't know how these
things happen, but all's
well that ends well, right?

It'll be about a month
before you're fully
healed.

Really. It's that
serious? A whole month?

411
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,554
Don't you worry.

412
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:59,854
Rest up and we'll have you

You are not curious? Even
Orochimaru wants to get
married!

418

You and the other

really have no time
