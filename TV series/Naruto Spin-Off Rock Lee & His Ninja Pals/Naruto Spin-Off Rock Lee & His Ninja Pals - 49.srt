<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>March 14th is finally</i>
<i>here, White Day!</i>

2
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:59,268
(nervous) The friend's
chocolate I got on
Valentine's Day from
Sakura...

3
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:03,431
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>A month ago, and he</i>
<i>still hasn't eaten it.</i>

4
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:06,297
I wonder if it
really was just
a gesture of
friendship...

5
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:10,064
No, I can tell. It
appears to be just
a nice gesture...

6
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:13,664
But there is the
faint scent of love
melted into it!

7
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:17,564
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>In case you didn't already</i>
<i>know, White Day is another</i>
<i>big day for romance--</i>

8
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:21,531
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Where all the boys who were</i>
<i>confessed to on Valentine's</i>
<i>day give their answer.</i>

9
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:25,664
And on this White Day,
I must answer Sakura's
bold confession of love!

10
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,397
And what is my
response-!? I say...
YESSSS!!!!!

11
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:30,764
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Didn't see that</i>
<i>coming..!</i>

12
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:40,564
"The Alliance to
Destroy White Day"

13
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,497
<i>[crowd chatter]</i>

14
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,597
(Lee)
What on Earth!?

15
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,297
What in the world
happened here!?

16
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:53,831
Argh! I thought this
white chocolate looked
a little dark, but it
is way worse than that!

17
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:55,431
--This is dried
fish eggs!!

18
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:59,497
And that's not even the
half of it! The cookies
got switched with the
pickles--

19
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,064
--the biscuits with dried
radishes, the baumkuchen
cake with fish rolls...

20
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:06,764
--and the marshmallows
with freeze-dried tofu!
All the sweets have
been switched out!

21
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:09,064
This is terrible!
White Day is tomorrow!

22
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:12,664
What sort of heartless
maniac would commit such
a dastardly deed!?

23
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:18,531
[evil laugh] We've
done it! This is sure
to ruin White Day...

24
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,931
<i>(Tenten)</i>
<i>You wanna find</i>
<i>the culprit..?</i>

25
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:26,064
Indeed I do. Otherwise,
I will not be able to
properly express myself
on White Day.

26
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:27,864
Think about it, Tenten!

27
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,597
Even if they were just
token gestures, you would
be upset if you did not
get anything!

28
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,097
Why are they
automatically
"token gestures!?"

29
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:38,231
Never mind! We need to
take back White Day,
and we need to do it
NOW!

30
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:40,831
All of the White Day
candy was stolen from
the store--

31
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:43,831
--and the decorations
were defaces and
dyed black--!

32
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:46,531
There must be a clue
hidden in there
somewhere! Any ideas?

33
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:49,231
That's not really much
to go on, you know.

34
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:51,097
Wait! I just thought
of something...

35
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:51,597
[gasp]

36
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,797
What business do
you have with me!

37
00:03:55,831 --> 00:04:00,364
I need to ask you a few
questions regarding the
White Day candy theft,
if you do not mind.

38
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:03,764
Huh!? Come on!
You don't suspect
Shino, do you!?

39
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:07,731
I think we can safely
profile our criminal as
having a sweet tooth,
as well as...

40
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:10,331
...an affinity
for black!

41
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:16,397
The only groups of
people who fit that
description are those in
their teens and twenties!

42
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:19,097
...as well as those
in their thirties
and forties!

43
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:20,564
That doesn't
really narrow
it down...

44
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:21,597
And-- rhinoceros
beetles!!

45
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,497
rhinoceros
beetles!?

46
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:28,197
Those things love sugar
and are black as midnight
for their whole lives.
Pretty clever, huh?

47
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:31,431
That's ridiculous!
There's no way the
culprits were a
bunch of bugs!

48
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:35,397
Do not resist! Hand
over the beetles if
you know what is
good for you...!

49
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:38,797
I'm afraid I cannot do
that. It is because...

50
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,197
..they've been in
hibernation since
last month!

51
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:43,131
[horrified gasp]

52
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:47,697
If Shino's rhinoceros
beetles have the alibi
of hibernation...

53
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:51,131
...then there must
be another gang of
them out there
somewhere who did it!

54
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:54,164
What do you say we just
move on and drop the
beetle thing already?

55
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:55,797
(Mr. Teuchi)
Here! Enjoy!

56
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:56,531
Huh!?

57
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,197
What is this?

58
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,764
Marshmallows?

59
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:01,264
Grrr...

60
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,464
<i>Have you lost your</i>
<i>mind, Mr. Teuchi!?</i>

61
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:07,431
S-sorry... I just
had too many of them!

62
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:15,097
[groan] This is starting to
be a drag. I've gotta think
of a way to smooth this over
before they get suspicious.

63
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:19,297
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>Well, what do you know?</i>
<i>It looks like we've found</i>
<i>out three culprits!</i>

64
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:21,431
Ah ha ha! Now
I get it!

65
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:21,920
[gasps]

66
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,231
[grunt]

67
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:27,797
You finally finished
creating your new
menu! Am I right?

68
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,531
Oh! You noticed, huh?

69
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:31,764
[relieved sigh]
<i>What a drag..!</i>

70
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,497
[nom nom]

71
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:34,331

[nom nom]

73
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:37,764
Choji! Where did
you get all of
those cookies!?

74
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,497
Oh, these? Shikamaru
gave them to me!

75
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:41,364
Huh!?

76
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,431
<i>Shikamaru...!</i>

77
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:47,731
<i>I had no choice! There's</i>
<i>no way I could eat them</i>
<i>all myself. There's just</i>
<i>too many!</i>

78
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,264
Then that means...
Shikamaru...

79
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:51,431
[nervous gasps]

80
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:53,764
...must have learned
how to bake cookies!

81
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:57,431
Wow! I never would
have expected that
lazy bum to have such
a demanding hobby!

82
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:58,531
What a surprise!

83
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:00,331
[relieved sighs]

84
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:06,831
I thought we were
busted there, for a
minute. So, how are
things looking?

85
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:09,031
Pretty good.

86
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:14,064
I took the famous "White
Lover's Snowcaps" imported
from our friends up north,
and boiled them in soy sauce.

87
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:18,564
...Thusly, I turned them
into a brand new product.
Introducing "Black
Lover's Snowcarps!"

88
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:19,997
Ohh!

89
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:23,631
I'd say our plan to
destroy white day
turned out to be a
great success!

90
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:24,764
So that is
your scheme!

91
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:25,797
[gasps]

92
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:28,264
What are you doing here,
Lee? How did you find us!?

93
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:31,231
I just happened
across this place
while searching for
Rhino Beetles!

94
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:33,531
Still looking for
beetles in March
on a hunch..?

95
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:35,231
You aren't to
be underestimated..

96
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:39,497
So you three were the
ones who stole the
White Day candy and
dyed all of the signage!

97
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:41,664
Why would you do such
a terrible thing!?

98
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:48,664
Hmf! As you know, Lady Hinata
is eagerly awaiting a gift
from Naruto in response to
her Valentine's Day present.

99
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:51,531
But knowing that
insensitive Naruto...

100
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:53,564
Oh yeah! It's
almost White Day!

101
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,531
I completely forgot
about it this year!

102
00:06:55,564 --> 00:06:58,331
Oh well, whatever.
I'm broke anyway.

103
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,097
Guess I'll skip it
this time around.

104
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:04,064
And Lady Hinata will be
crushed, devastated!
She'll cry for weeks!

105
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:08,231
I would rather wipe
White Day completely
off the calendar than
see that happen..!

106
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,764
Same here! I hate
White Day, too!

107
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:15,697
I just know there'll
be a bunch of lowlifes
who use it as an excuse
to go after my Ayame!

108
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:17,697
<i>Not one of them</i>
<i>will be worthy</i>
<i>of her..!</i>

109
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:21,464
I agree with them.
I'd rather there be
no White Day as well.

110
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:25,064
It's... such a drag.

111
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:27,097
Whaaaat!?

112
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:30,564
I cannot believe you
are all trying to ruin
White Day for such
selfish reasons!

113
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:36,231
You are crushing the hopes and
dreams of eager young girls
everywhere who are waiting for a
response from their Valentines!

114
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:37,631
Do you not see that?!

115
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:40,664
If you won't back down,
then I'll just have
to stop you myself!

116
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:45,764
White Day's nothing more
than a stupid spin-off of
Valentine's Day anyway!

117
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,431
It's a sidekick to
a made-up holiday!

118
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:51,097
What you are saying
may be true...

119
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:54,831
...but it is still wrong
of you to make light of
what it might mean to others!

120
00:07:54,864 --> 00:07:56,131
Hmm...

121
00:07:57,497 --> 00:08:01,131
Oh gosh! I'm so
nervous, my knees
are trembling like
crazy!

122
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:05,131
Do not worry, Tenko!
I am sure you will pass
with flying colors!

123
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:09,364
Thanks, Leeko! I'm
glad you came with
me. I'm so nervous
about all this!

124
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:11,264
Alright! Who's next?

125
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:14,497
Oh! Me! Right
here, I'm coming--

[gasp] Be still my
beating heart! What
a gorgeous girl!

127
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,597
So! Tell me, what's
your name..?

128
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,364
Who me!? Uh...

129
00:08:22,397 --> 00:08:24,364
...No, I am just here
as Tenko's friend.

130
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:29,364
You're the kind of beauty
we only see once a decade
around here! You'll be a
megastar in no time!

131
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:35,064

I can..!

How can I ever hope
to push myself without
you here driving me to
be all that I can be!?

143
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,464
YOU IDIOT!

144
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:16,697
I will not stand for
whining like that!

145
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:18,197
But, Leeko..?

146
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:20,464
From now on, you
will be the center.

147
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:24,197
You have to make the
others chase <i>you</i> now!
Understand?

148
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,431
Hold on. What point was
I trying to make here?

149
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:29,264
We were talking
about White Day!

150
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:31,164
Oh, yeah! Right!

151
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:34,731
So, the point I was
making is not to belittle
something just because it
it considered a spin-off!

152
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:40,297
As someone from the Hyuga
branch family, I believe that
you should understand that
concept better than anyone!

153
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,297
[gasp] Well... I--

154
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:47,564
Just because your family
would be considered a
sideshow of the main family
does not make you worth less!

155
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,297
Yes, you're right.

156
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:51,631
Wait a minute!! Who's
family are you calling
a sideshow!?

157
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:54,664
Ugh, this is all
such a <i>drag</i> !

I'm afraid so, son.
Sorry to break it

I knew you'd get
it. Well done.

167

Will you join our
side on this, then?

168
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:28,664
Of course! Let us
combine our strength

[happy crowd chatter]

175
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:44,631
What's going
on here!?

176
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:48,597
But, I thought we
destroyed White Day!
What happened?

177
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:51,297
Ah, Neji, Shikamaru,
Mr. Teuchi. Welcome!

178
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,597
Lee?! What have
you done here?

179
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:57,831
We talked about this! I
thought you agreed that
White Day needed to be
eliminated!

180
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:01,497
Yes, I did! And
it has been! Just
as we discussed
it would.

181
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,597
Then what is
all this!?

182
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:06,197
It is simple.
I remade it.

183
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:07,697
You remade it!?

184
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:11,431
Yes! A brand new,
fully renewed holiday
to replace the old
one:

185
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:15,597
White Day version 2.0!
Also known as White
Day GX for short!

186
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,731
That acronym makes
no sense at all!

187
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:20,564
I have done a complete
makeover on the day's
image--

188
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:25,397
--And now things like the
mullet roe and herring rolls
you planted are the gifts
to give!

189
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:28,264
It's a surprisingly
popular approach!

190
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:32,297
There are a lot of customers
that prefer saltier foods
like these to sweets
and confections...

191
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:34,664
...especially since
they go so well with sake!

192
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:41,264
Candy and other similarly sweet
items have gotten unpopular as
of late as they do not align
with the needs of today's women!

193
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:43,831
You three opened
my eyes to that!

194
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:48,131
No way! That wasn't
what we were trying to
say at all, you idiot!

Huh? The dolls are back
just like they were before.

203
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:31,221
No matter how many times we
take everything down, the
display's back up again the
next day like nothing happened!

204
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:34,821
How many days has it
been now? This has happened

the dolls are up again!?

207
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:54,955
Why are you acting
so surprised about it?
It's happened daily
since the festival.

208
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:57,221
What a baffling
phenomenon.

209
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:59,521
It's not a phenomenon,
it's just mean!

210
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:02,988
March 3rd was over a
week ago and someone's
still putting the dolls out!

211
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:05,188
It certainly is a
mean thing to do.

212
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:09,221
I can't believe Leeko
and I hung out so late!
What was I thinking?

213
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,988
I've gotta get back home
and clean up all my dolls
before it's too late!

214
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:15,488
The 3rd's almost
over..!

215
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:20,655
Last train for the
Hidden Leaf Village,
number 666, now departing!
All aboard!

00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:24,688
Oh no! Wait for me!

217
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,988
What was that story
all about?

218
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:29,188
You mean you
do not know?

219
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:34,021
I have heard it said that if you
leave your dolls out on display
too long, you are doomed
to miss the last train home!

220
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:35,921
Oh, get real! No
one says that!

221
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:38,521
Is that so? Maybe it
was 'oversleep' then...

222
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:40,755
It's 'you'll be late!'
Get it right!

223
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:45,688
<i>(Narrator)</i>
Right! Tenten speaks the truth!
<i>The saying goes that if you</i>
leave your dolls out past March

<i>3rd, you'll be late. As in,</i>
<i>you'll be late in finding a</i>

f
<i>you're looking for one...</i>

00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,688
What a fascinating
saying! Oh no!

226
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:56,521
Did you figure
something out?

227
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:58,588
It is all beginning to
make sense to me now!

228
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:03,588
It must be because of all
of those dolls being left
out too long that Lady
Tsunade is still single--

229
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:04,755
ARGHHHH!

230
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:06,188
Just who do you think
you're calling an old
maid!?

231
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,255
Well, in his defense,
he didn't use those
<i>exact</i> words...

232
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:13,855
I'm sick enough of those
things being put out year
after year as it is
WITHOU
T that insinuation!

233
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,488
Figure it out
and fix it!!

234
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,655
Easier said than done.
We don't have the first
clue as to what could
be causing it!

235
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:21,655
Maybe it's just a
bad prank...

236
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:26,655
A normal display would
be one thing, but that's a
fifty-tiered one created
especially for the Leaf.

237
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:31,955
If it's a prank, I've no
idea why they're doing it,
nor why they'd go to so
much trouble.

238
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:32,621
Hmm...

239
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,921
(Thinking)
Yep, he's crazy! That's
the only explanation...

240
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,288
Did you say
something?

241
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:51,955
Not at all! So, uh,
are we doing it again
tonight Lord Orochimaru?

242
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:53,455
Of course we are!

243
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:56,821
By repeatedly leaving the
dolls out, day after day,
year after year--

244
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:02,521

know until they begin!
Hm...?

00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:24,988
Wow, I didn't know
they made dolls this
big.

Aghhhhhhh!

252
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:32,921
Lord Orochimaru,
what's wrong with you?

253
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:35,821
The Emperor doll turned
and smiled like this!

254
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:38,121
It's alive! I'm
telling you! Take
a look!

255
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:40,955
Doesn't look alive
to me...

256
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:43,688
...in fact, the
imperial dolls always
look really calm.

257
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:46,055
No way! I could have
sworn it looked at me!

time and finish up
already!

I totally became the
doll for a moment. I
was possessed by its soul!

Stop with the
scary stories, too!

268
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:13,121
Wha? Lee? When did
you two sneak in here?

269
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:15,821
And why am I dressed
as one of the 5 male
musicians?

270
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,921
I should obviously
be the Empress!

get back to <i>me</i> now?

281
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:53,521
To think you would re-display
all the carefully cleaned up
dolls in a nefarious plot to
ruin women's chances of marriage

282
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,088
We won't let you
get away with this!

283
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:59,555
[laughter] It would appear
that they've left us with
no choice but to use force.

284
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:00,788
Bring it on,
you fiend!

285
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,255
Let's go, Kabuto!

286
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,088
Right, Lord Orochimaru!

287
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,155
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>Finally, an</i>
<i>actual fight!</i>

288
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:08,721
Tenten! Neji! Be
ready for anything!

289
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:09,621
You got it!

290
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:10,255
Hmf!

291
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:11,888
[growling]

292
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:13,921
[growl back]

293
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,488
What!?

294
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:16,655
Get back here!

295
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:19,488
I'll show you! I'll
put all the dolls
back up by force!

296
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:22,588
Oh yeah? Then I will clean
them all up by force!

297
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:23,388
What!?

298
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:24,788
So that's what he
meant by 'force?'

299
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,688
How long are we
gonna keep doing this!?

300
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:40,588
Probably until one
side passes out from
lack of energy...

301
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:43,855
It will go on forever
at this rate! I need
to use that move!

302
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:46,621
What special move are
you planning this time!?

303
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:48,855
Leaf Ninja Art:
Every Other Step!

304
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,055
Are you kidding!?
Grade schoolers can
do that!

305
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:55,688
Hm, a fearsome move,
I admit. But overuse
will leave your legs
sore later..!

306
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:57,721
Don't take his stupid
move seriously..!

307
00:17:57,755 --> 00:18:01,221
Time for my trump card!
Summoning Jutsu: Escalator!

308
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:03,855
[gasps]

309
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:06,188
You lose!

310
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:08,855
This time I am
the victor!

311
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,721
Ah, too easy,
too easy!

312
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:13,255
Why didn't you
do this from the
start?

313
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:14,855
No way!

314
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,255
Ha ha ha! You're
finished...!

315
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:19,988
Unless you somehow find
an elevator, you cannot
defeat my escalator!

316
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:25,221
And even if you did,
it would be useless!
Accept your defeat!

317
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,755
No! And that is
not true! Elevators
go higher and faster!

318
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:33,788
So naiÃ¯ve! Look closely,
mister know-it-all. Don't
you see your elevator's
glaring weakness?

319
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,188
What glaring
weakness?!

320
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:38,721
Sure, elevators can go
up and down quickly and
with little effort---

321
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:41,855
But you still have
to gather the dolls
manually at the top.

322
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:45,221
And for the dolls at
the middle it'd be just
as quick to walk from
the bottom!

323
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:48,788
Ahhh! I never even
considered that!

324
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:50,521
Victory is mine!!!

325
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:56,555
Secret Escalator Technique!
Bringing Lots of Dolls to
the Platform All at Once Jutsu!

326
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:59,521
I am so beyond
sick of this...

327
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,855
We do not stand a chance
of winning at this rate.

328
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:05,121
How can we hope
to beat the mighty
escalator!?

329
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:10,088
So, Leeko, tell me.
Have you picked a
high school yet?

330
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:13,188
No, afraid not. I
am still waffling...

331
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:19,588
Are you kidding me? You're
more than smart enough to
continue on to this system's
high school, Leeko! What gives?

332
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:22,888
No way! Get real!
Hidden Leaf High
School is way beyond
my level!

333
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,555
I would never get in!
There is just no way!

334
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:28,488
Oh.. What about you,
Orochimaru? Any plans?

335
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:32,955
I, Uh-- already have
the referrals I need to
get into our high school.

336
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:35,188
Huh? Referrals?
You mean...

337
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:37,021
You're on an escalator?

338
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:38,988
Promise you won't
tell everyone yet.

339
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:41,721
I'd be too awkward.

340
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:44,788
<i>(Thinking)</i>
<i>This is an escalator</i>
<i>school for Orochimaru?</i>

341
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:49,155
<i>But she has never out-scored</i>
<i>me once! Not even on the</i>
<i>mock-entrance exams..!</i>

342
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,188
<i>I will not lose! Not</i>
<i>to Orochimaru!</i>

343
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:55,055
Whoa, really?

344
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:58,221
So you rose the escalator
and skipped all the
entrance exams...?

345
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:00,855
Wow, you geniuses are
something else, for sure!

346
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:02,021
Oh, go on...

347
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:03,221
Hey! Look! It's Leeko!

348
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:05,121
You're simply
amazing, Leeko!

349
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:11,188
I still can't believe that
you skipped a grade and you
get to start out high school
as a sophomore!

350
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:15,021
What!? Leeko skipped a
grade!? That's like being
on an elevator!

351
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:16,521
You said it, Orochimaru!

352
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:21,055
I studied day in and
day out, all so I could
beat you, fair and square!

353
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:25,521
I wasn't expecting the
"skip a grade" elevator.

354
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:30,155
Now I'm embarrassed for
being complacent just
because I had an easy
ride on the escalator.

355
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:34,555
That entire scenario has
absolutely nothing to do
with our battle.

356
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:37,921
That leaves me
with only one option...

357
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,621
(Tenten)
Yay! The dolls are up!

358
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:43,288
Hm?

359
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,821
<i>(Orochimaru)</i>
<i>I'm home.</i>

360
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:50,621
Welcome back,
Orochimaru!

361
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:52,721
Take a look, it's
the imperial dolls!

362
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:54,988
Oh, wow! Thanks
so much!

363
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:58,255
I'm sorry I couldn't
buy you real dolls. I
know that's what you
wanted...

364
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:02,088
No, no. I know how
hard things have been
for you lately...

365
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:06,488
You work yourself to
the bone, day and night,
just so you can pay for
my schooling, mom.

366
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:08,788
I couldn't be more
happy with these.

367
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:12,255
<i>(Orochimaru)</i>
<i>I promise to take</i>
<i>good care of them.</i>

368
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:16,221
[teary] Poor
Orochimaru!
I feel terrible!

369
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:20,921
You did not do all of
this to make the village
women miss their chance at
marriage and happiness--!

370
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:24,855
--You just did not want
the Dolls Festival to
come to an end..!

371
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:29,788
(ugly crying)
It's true...!

372
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:34,921
<i>Heh heh.. fell for</i>
<i>it... hook, line,</i>
<i>and sinker...</i>

373
00:21:34,955 --> 00:21:38,155
What if I offered
to help you out?
How about it?

374
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:39,188
Huh?

375
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:45,188
<i>(Orochimaru)</i>
<i>What!? WHAT!? Enough! Why</i>
<i>do I have to get dressed</i>
<i>up, too!?</i>

376
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:51,088
Because! By becoming one
of the dolls yourself, you
will be able to enjoy this
happy holiday to the fullest!

377
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:54,255
If that's the case, then
wouldn't it make sense for
me to be the Empress?

378
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:57,255
What are we even
supposed to be with
these things on our
heads!?

379
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:59,655
I think we're supposed
to be bales of rice.

380
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:02,955
Why does every single
stupid episode have
to end like this!?

381
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,121
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>You guess it! Orochimaru</i>
<i>has been foiled again!</i>

382
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:52,526
(Mr. Teuchi)
The next episode is: "Baby-
sitting Guy Sensei" and "Lady
Tsunade's Marriage Interview"

383
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,147
(Mr. Teuchi)
It's about time! Lady Tsunade's
more than old enough for
marriage interviews!

384
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,680
(Tenten)
You could say the same
thing about your daughter Ayame.

385
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:02,213
(Mr. Teuchi)
That's true, but there simply
isn't a man suitable for my
Ayame, you know?

386
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:06,580
(Mr. Teuchi)
If a good respectable man came
along that she cared for, she'd
certainly be free to marry him!

387
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,880
(Tenten)
So if she came to you and said
there was a man she wanted to
marry....

388
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:12,580
<i>I'd obliterate him!</i>
(Tenten)
So you wouldn't let
her marry, you liar!

389
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:15,913
(Tenten)
Lighten up! You'll be the reason
she's single for the rest of
her life!
