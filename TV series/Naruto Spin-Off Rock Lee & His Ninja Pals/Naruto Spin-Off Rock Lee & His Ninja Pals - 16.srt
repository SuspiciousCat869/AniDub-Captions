an excuse!?

all their reasons.

like a lot of their
reservations had to do with
Guy Sensei's personality.

Well, I suppose if nobody
is showing up, Guy Sensei

around than, either.

chance upon this spot!

So anyway, we need to
find a reliable way of
coolingGuy Sensei down!

276
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:23,523
I suggest... We
can use a gi-normous
fan!

00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:26,990
Then his temperature
will drop like a rock!

verbal water-style
jutsu is all...

287
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,457
Don't throw in the
towel already, geeze!

288
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,057
So we just need to
lighten him up a
little big, is that
it? I have got it!

289
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,657
We just gussy him
up in a sheer, yet
casual new outfit!

290
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,223
Nobody said anything
about his clothing, Lee!

291
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:08,623
Oh, right. Then
how about this!?

292
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:11,890
Somehow that makes
him seem even more
intense!

293
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:14,090
And last but not
least, there's
this one...

294
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:20,623
Yeah, you'd burn off an
entire day's worth of
calories if you ran into Guy
first thing in the morning.

295
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:25,457
Again, I know the 3 of
us are used to it, but
to a normal person...

296
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,123
Sometimes Guy Sensei can
be a lot to deal with in
the morning!

297
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:30,857
Oooh..?

298
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:33,657
Ooof.

299
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,657
Guy Sensei!

300
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:41,390
Okay, so essentially,
Kakashi Sensei was saying
that one should avoid Guy
Sensei in the morning, right?

301
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:43,357
I have it!

302
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,923
He can teach the
class at night!

303
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:49,590
I dunno. He just
looks like a tired
crazy old guy now.

304
00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:52,390
This should keep
things nice and
cool now, right guys?

305
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:55,623
Oh yeah, totally.
So cool, I'm starting
to get the chills...

306
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,390
...From the creepiness.

307
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:01,557
Huh?

308
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,523
I'm really sorry,
everyone...

309
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:08,423
Looks like I
actually needed
my students to
save me for once.

310
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:10,090
We haven't saved
you at all!

311
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,490
If anything, you're
worse off than when
we started, are you
<i>kidding!?</i>

312
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:16,390
Chin up, team!
All that matters
is we did our best!

313
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:19,390
We didn't accomplish
anything! What are
you so proud of?

314
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:20,923
Relax! It is fine!

315
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:23,090
We just need to
wait for everyone
to show up!

316
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:32,657
<i>(Narrator)</i>
<i>BUt, just as Tenten feared,</i>
<i>no one showed up to do</i>
<i>calisthenics with Guy Sensei.</i>

317
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,423
[bird chirping]
Idiot!

318
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:39,123
It's hot enough during
the night summer, and
you expect me to go
exercise with Guy Sensei?

319
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:41,890
Ugh, just thinking
about it makes me
toss and turn!

320
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:45,290
I-I'm sorry... He's
a little bit intense,
isn't he?

321
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,523
I'm not much of an
early riser, know
what I mean?

322
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:53,290
You'd just end up
doubling all the stress and
exhaustion of the day if you
ran into Guy at night.

323
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:56,057
What a drag...
I'm gonna pass.

324
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,123
I'm sorry! Gimme a
sec. I'm trying
to think, here...

325
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:03,023
Should I stuff the
beef in rice balls,
or wrap them up with
it instead?

326
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,223
[sigh] I cannot
figure it out!
What are we
doing wrong!?

327
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:10,290
Maybe we over-
learned the lessons
of history--

328
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:13,023
I think we've been
hoisted by our own
petard.

329
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:16,623
Oh, we're hoisted, all
right. We're hoisted,
hosed, and hopeless.

330
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,357
I say we call
it a day...

331
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,290
Well the three of us
should keep showing up
at least. He is our
Sensei, after all.

332

<i>(Guy)</i>
<i>Wait! You've got</i>

333
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,590
Don't think I do.

334
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,590
We got a report of
a suspicious man in
the area.

335
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:31,057
I'm just doing
radio calisthenics!

336
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,090
Yeah, you can tell
us down at the
station, weirdo.

337
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:38,323
(Guy)
Excessive force! You
no good thugs! I
know your type!

338
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,990
Alright, you've
done your time.

339
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:49,423
No more funny
business, okay?

340
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:50,723
Yes, sir...

341
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,423
No one seems to be
waiting for ya...
Don't you have anyone?

342
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:55,357
I, uh...

343
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,623
I have somewhere
I've gotta be, sir...
I have to go...

344
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,257
Huh? Go where?

345
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:05,857
Radio calisthenics.

346
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,090
Hey you guys...

347
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:29,390
Sorry Guy Sensei...
I... I...

348
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:31,423
<i>(Guy)</i>
<i>I should be</i>
<i>apologizing to</i>

00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:33,190
[gasp]

350
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:37,290
You've all been waiting
for me, and I wasn't
able to be here to run
the calisthenics class.

351
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,423
Guy Sensei?

352
00:20:39,457 --> 00:20:41,090
It wasn't just
them....

353
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:42,390
Huh?

354
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:49,290
The three of them have
been running around all
over this village...

355
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:53,023
...rounding up as
many people as they
could find to meet
you when you got out.

356
00:20:56,057 --> 00:21:01,490
This is... I have
such wonderful
pupils I don't know
what to say...

357
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:07,123
Well, you seem pretty toned
down, so I guess we can get
through this without burning
too many calories...

358
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:09,323
Alright! Shall
we then?

359
00:21:09,357 --> 00:21:13,257
Show us the new and
improved calisthenics
you created, Guy Sensei!

360
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,590
Okay then! Here
we go!

361

Now, raise your hands
high in the air, and
