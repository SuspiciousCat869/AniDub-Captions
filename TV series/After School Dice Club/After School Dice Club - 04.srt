1
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:14,765
[MIKI] The first school term
is drawing to a close.

2
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,183
I have to admit,

3
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,936
I was kinda depressed
at the start of the year.

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:23,565
But before I knew it,
months had come and gone.

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,235
It's all thanks to
my amazing friends.

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,571
And the fun times
we share together.

7
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,989
[AYA]
Hiya, Miki!

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,408
Let's eat lunch up
on the roof today!

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,203
That sounds nice,
but it's too hot.

10
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,664
[AYA]
Mm... Them's the breaks.

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,332
Hey! It's Midori!

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,668
Yay! The gang's all here!

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,215
I'm sorry. I work my
part‐time job after school.

14
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:52,010
Uh! Come on, Midori. Please!
You have to make an exception!

15
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,554
[MIKI]
I know that girl.

16
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,973
She's the student council
vice president.

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,475
I offer my humblest apologies.

18
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,061
If there are no further
inquiries, I'll be going.

19
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,104
[REN]
Wait!

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,438
[MIDORI]
Well then, shall we?

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,567
Yeah, okay. Coming.

22
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,959
[REN]
Okay! As previously discussed,

23
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,670
we're going to make this
year's school festival

24
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,339
the most memorable and
original it's ever been!

25
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,257
To do this, I asked you
all to come up with

26
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,593
as many creative concepts
as possible.

27
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,178
Whacha got for me?

28
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,846
[BOTH grunt]

29
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,433
Well, we did manage to devise
a handful of things, but...

30
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,727
They're not memorable
or original.

31
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,521
I guess it's easier
said than done.

32
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,148
That's all part of the
brainstorming process!

33
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,567
We can do this!
If we put our heads together,

34
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,362
I'm sure we can think
of something great!

35
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,535
[REN]
Gotta say, I'm disappointed.

36
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,162
Every single thing listed
up there is so boring.

37
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,540
I mean, a hot dog
eating contest?

38
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,917
Who came up with that
award‐winning suggestion?

39
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,002
Uh. You did, Vice President.

40
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,962
[REN]
Uh!

41
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,172
Let's face it.
We're just not capable

42
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,299
of pulling off something
new and unheard of.

43
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,592
It may be monotonous,

44
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,594
but I think we should remain
within our wheelhouse.

45
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,222
[REN] Unacceptable!
I'm the one in charge!

46
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,725
Due to the president's mishap,
the burden falls to me.

47
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,477
And I say we make him proud!

48
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,355
[TANAKA] Mr. President!
I wish you a swift recovery.

49
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,024
You'll be back
before you know it!

50
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,861
Uh? It looks like you'll
need to cover for me.

51
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,779
I'm counting on you.

52
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,615
[REN] This will be the
best festival our school

53
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,202
has ever seen, or my name's
not Ren Shibusawa!

54
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,998
It may not be easy, but
nothing worth having is!

55
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,883
I won't let you down.

56
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,886
[REN] It all started
when I first became

57
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,180
student council vice president.

58
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,474
That said, let's address
the next issue.

59
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,852
[YUTO] I see! You're a
humanities‐type guy, huh?

60
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,020
Could of fooled me.

61
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,148
Yeah, sorta. It's not that
I'm a humanities type,

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,066
I'm just even worse
at math and science.

63
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,818
[BOTH laugh]

64
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,612
[REN] Sorry to interrupt
your lovely tête‐á‐tête,

65
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,071
but we're trying
to have a meeting!

66
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,740
Don't worry, I'm listening.

67
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,702
Glad to see you're taking
your job so seriously, VP.

68
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,621
No more side discussions.

69
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,498
Remain focused
until we're finished.

70
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,833
Copy that! [chuckles]

71
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,210
[REN]
There were two things I learned

72
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,628
right away about Aoshima.

73
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,089
He was tall and he thought
everything was one big joke.

74
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,634
Despite his easygoing
attitude, he was popular

75
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,637
with all students, no matter
their grade or gender.

76
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,223
Initially, I hated him.

77
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,226
[REN]
I have a question.

78
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,854
What made you decide to run
for student council president?

79
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,856
Where is this coming from?

80
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,775
[REN] Council members
should all be model students

81
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,319
who follow the rules to a T
and lead by example.

82
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,029
Yet you lead by
bending the rules

83
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,697
like they're made out of taffy.

84
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,074
You're so oblivious.

85
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,535
How can you expect other
students to abide by guidelines

86
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,496
if you're constantly acting
like they don't exist?

87
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,415
Wow. I guess I never
looked at it that way.

88
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,416
What?

89
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,418
Well, I haven't put
that much thought

90
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,128
into being a model student.

91
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,340
And living by the rulebook
was never really my style.

92
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,716
[REN]
No kidding.

93
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,302
People threw away their votes
on him because he's popular

94
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,264
and only cares about
having a good time.

95
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,016
And I'm stuck being
his unlucky lackey.

96
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,311
[YUTO] But, I didn't just run
for president because I could.

97
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,813
There's a reason.

98
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,064
It's simple.

99
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,150
There's no greater joy than
bringing smiles to everyone.

100
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,360
[gasps]

101
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,028
[YUTO] Being a part
of the student council

102
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,073
seemed like a good way
to achieve that, y'know?

103
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,575
Here.

104
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,743
It's the overview of
next year's budget.

105
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,162
You asked Kimura to write
one up for you, yeah?

106
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,456
Awesome! It got
finished so fast!

107
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,251
He had me worried at first,
but he pulled it off!

108
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,753
[YUTO] Not quite. Tanaka's
the one who pulled it off.

109
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,963
Uh?

110
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,548
When it comes to
writing reports,

111
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,801
Tanaka's definitely
the guy for the job.

112
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,720
That's why I was confused
when you asked him

113
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,722
to handle the sports
club negotiations.

114
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,557
Kimura has better people skills.

115
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,226
So I had him and
Tanaka switch jobs.

116
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,978
Your heart's in the right place.

117
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,856
It's admirable to try and
do everything by yourself.

118
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,108
Even so, you can't really expect

119
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,235
to single‐handedly
solve every problem.

120
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,945
You have limits.

121
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,824
Relax a little, VP.
You might like it.

122
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,204
[REN] He wasn't oblivious.
He understood everything.

123
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,957
Aoshima may have seemed
carefree on the outside,

124
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,586
but on the inside, he cared
more than just about anyone.

125
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,921
From that day on,

126
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,632
I took the president's advice
and started asking people

127
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,217
for help whenever
I felt overwhelmed.

128
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,054
And... That's how I know.

129
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,182
There's only one person
who can help me now!

130
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,436
[AYA] Whoa! You were the
student council president

131
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,896
during your middle school days?

132
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,148
[MIKI]
Amazing! How impressive!

133
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,441
Not really.

134
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,735
There was an older classmate
who roped me into it.

135
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,862
And once you're in,
you're kind of stuck.

136
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,865
Do you think you're gonna run
for high school student council?

137
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,743
Not at all.
I have other goals so...

138
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,079
[REN] Which goals
are you referring to?

139
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,457
[MIDORI] Vice president?
How did you find me?

140
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,751
[REN] Naturally the council
keeps track of all the places

141
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,004
students are employed.
I've said it before, but...

142
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,255
I really need your help

143
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,007
preparing for the
school festival!

144
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,927
A mind like yours is
meant for this stuff!

145
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,637
Um. You know...

146
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,889
I've been meaning to
ask you something.

147
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,141
How exactly do you
two know each other?

148
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,269
From middle school.
We were both on student council.

149
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,147
That's right! We were quite
the team back in the day!

150
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,275
If the school was putting on
an event, we were running it!

151
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,528
[MIKI] She must be
the older classmate.

152
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,989
The one who roped her
into middle school politics.

153
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,616
C'mon! You have nothing to
lose and everything to gain

154
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,993
if you lend me a hand.

155
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,370
I'll make you a shoo‐in
for the next election!

156
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,498
Then the two of us can run the
school just like we did before!

157
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,708
Sound like a plan?

158
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,959
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,420
But this isn't the first time
I've turned down your offer.

160
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,630
I'm too preoccupied
with personal matters.

161
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,341
Organizing the festival is
simply out of the question.

162
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,677
[REN] I don't know what personal
matters you're talking about

163
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,095
but I do know you
could always do

164
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,763
part‐time work during college!

165
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,806
Don't waste your youth

166
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,474
struggling to make
some quick cash.

167
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,643
Take advantage of the
opportunity you have!

168
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,728
Kay?

169
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,105
[MIDORI] Actually,
I don't just work here

170
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,149
so I can maintain a
stable source of income.

171
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,985
Huh? It's not
because of money?

172
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,320
What else could be driving you?

173
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,741
[MIDORI] I'm working here
to make my dream come true.

174
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,743
Your dream?

175
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,413
[REN]
Okay. Care to elaborate?

176
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,373
I'm a big fan of board games.

177
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,917
But sometimes playing
them just isn't enough.

178
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,627
I want to create them.

179
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,005
[BOTH gasp]

180
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,674
That's the dream?

181
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,887
[laughs] You have got
to be kidding me!

182
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,430
I don't know what
I was expecting,

183
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,599
but "creating games" was not it!

184
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,975
What's so funny?

185
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,643
Everything about it!

186
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,937
You really don't hear
how silly you sound?

187
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,857
Board games are totally
outdated and uncool.

188
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,693
I didn't even know people
still bothered to play them.

189
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,237
It's as laughable
as it is ludicrous.

190
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,948
I think it'd be best to drop
this worthless hobby.

191
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,575
I'm only looking out for you!

192
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,786
Your new dream could
be student council!

193
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,621
[MIKI]
It's not a worthless hobby!

194
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,538
[gasps]

195
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,831
[MIDORI]
Miki...

196
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,750
I'm sorry. Say what?

197
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:47,587
Um... Well... I said that
board games have worth.

198
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,589
This is an "AB" conversation

199
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,925
so you can "C" yourself
out anytime.

200
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,759
[gasps]

201
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,386
We're not bystanders!
We're her friends!

202
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,721
And it's like Miki said,

203
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,015
board games are
far from worthless.

204
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,184
They're not outdated, either!

205
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,603
They're more fun than
you can possibly imagine!

206
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,147
You both... believe that?

207
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:06,981
[scoffs]

208
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,526
Think I care how fun you
find your little pastime?

209
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,194
You're seriously deluded.

210
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,654
These games you're
going on about

211
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,572
are nothing but a
huge waste of time.

212
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,908
And you'll never
convince me otherwise.

213
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,243
Midori has potential!

214
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,412
She should use her talent to
do something of actual value!

215
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,915
She and I practically
ran our middle school.

216
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,668
I know her better than you do.

217
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,378
I work hard.

218
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,714
[REN] I became a member
of the student council

219
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,008
because I want to
see everyone smile.

220
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,762
Midori! I thought you felt
the same way that I do!

221
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,683
Value differs from
person to person.

222
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,184
It's very subjective.

223
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,978
One might view
something as trash

224
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,855
while others might view
that same something

225
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,439
as a priceless treasure.

226
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,984
Projecting your values
onto me won't be effective,

227
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,570
because what you
trashed I treasure.

228
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,821
[REN gasps]

229
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,781
[REN]
Yes. That's it.

230
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,117
That unbreakable willpower
that never falters under

231
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,704
any amount of pressure.
She's composed and controlled.

232
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,207
And as cool as a winter breeze
even after being taunted!

233
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,543
It's settled. She has
to be my successor.

234
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,879
I won't take no for an answer!

235
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,963
Just so you know,

236
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,257
I'm not leaving until
you agree to my terms.

237
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,884
That could pose a problem.

238
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,012
Especially when the
customers start filing in.

239
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,726
[MIDORI] Why don't we play a
game to settle this? All right?

240
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,144
I'm listening.

241
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,229
[MIDORI] A good old‐fashioned
battle of wits.

242
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,647
If you manage to beat me,

243
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,108
I'll do as you ask and
team up with you again.

244
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,277
But should you lose,
you have to give up

245
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,070
on recruiting me for
student council.

246
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:36,946
[AYA, MIKI]
Uh...

247
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,490
If you're serious,
then I'm on board.

248
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,119
So then, what kind of game
did you have in mind, Midori?

249
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,204
[MIDORI]
This one.

250
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,665
The game that will decide
our fate is <i>6 Nimmt.</i>

251
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,927
<i>6 Nimmt</i> is fairly simple.

252
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,679
We start by shuffling
the entire deck of cards.

253
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,974
They're numbered 1 through 104.

254
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,310
Each player is dealt ten cards.

255
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,146
Then four cards are drawn from
the deck and placed faceup

256
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,649
on the table for everyone's
viewing pleasure.

257
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,359
As for the gameplay rules,

258
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,445
everyone chooses a card from
their hand and puts it facedown.

259
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:21,282
When everyone is ready,
all cards are revealed together.

260
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,702
[MIDORI] The cards are then laid
next to each other on the table,

261
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,163
starting from the
smallest number.

262
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,373
Keep in mind

263
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,751
you have to put each card after
the number it's closest to.

264
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:36,881
For instance, the cards in this
scenario would look like...

265
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:37,882
...this!

266
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,384
Oh, I gotcha!

267
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,635
Then what?

268
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,928
[MIDORI]
The process is repeated

269
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,138
until we play every
card in our hand.

270
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,307
Pay attention to the
sixth card, though.

271
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,935
The person who plays
the sixth card in a row

272
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,437
must take the five cards
that come before it.

273
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,606
The last card that was
played then gets placed

274
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,651
at the front of the new row.

275
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,653
Is that a good thing?

276
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,989
[MIDORI] See those things
at the top of the cards?

277
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,282
[AYA]
Ah! Little cows!

278
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,034
After all ten of your cards
have been put into play

279
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,703
you count the number
of cows you acquired

280
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,413
and the one with the most loses.

281
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,498
Uh. So you don't want cows?

282
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,416
Correct.

283
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,210
Though you may not want them,
they do still serve a purpose.

284
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,629
You force them on
the other players.

285
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,091
[MIKI, AYA]
What a strange concept!

286
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,884
[MIDORI]
One more thing to make note of.

287
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,469
If the card you
play has a number

288
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,763
that's less than all the
other cards on the table,

289
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,141
you can select any
of the four rows

290
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,936
and add all of those cards
to your personal collection.

291
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,397
And you can really pick
any row you want to?

292
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,690
Yes, that's right.

293
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,358
And most of the time
you'll want to choose

294
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,152
the row with the
least number of cows.

295
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,778
So that's the gist of it?

296
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,822
That's right. The full gist.

297
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,825
Gimme a break. I thought
this was a game of fate.

298
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,535
It's rudimentary at best.

299
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,662
Are you really going to
follow through if I win?

300
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,414
[MIDORI]
Yes. You have my word.

301
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,833
Perfect. Let's get this
show on the road!

302
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,376
Yeah! Let's do this!

303
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,087
[MIKI whimpers]

304
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,630
[MIDORI]
Okay, everyone.

305
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,383
Select a card and
place it facedown.

306
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,052
Reveal them all together.

307
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,137
Right... now!

308
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,767
Next we match them with the
four rows and put them in order.

309
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,144
[MIKI] Hmm... It seems
rather unbalanced.

310
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,063
An unbalanced beginning is good.

311
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,399
Honest. It makes for
a better second round.

312
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,235
Flip your card. Right... now!

313
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,947
Huh?! The second row is just one
measly little card away!

314
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,824
This could be bad.

315
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,201
[REN]
Huh...

316
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,203
[REN]
This is a piece of cake.

317
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:35,666
There's a 48 on the table, which
makes this card a safe bet.

318
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,126
All that talk of her pipe dream

319
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,170
kind of built up
my expectations.

320
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,132
But there's nothing remotely
fun about this stupid game.

321
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,300
Don't worry Midori.

322
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,136
I will defeat you and reawaken
your true potential!

323
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,848
Time to flip! Here we go!

324
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,808
All right!

325
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,893
My 49 goes right next to the 48.

326
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,061
I'm good to go!

327
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,270
[MIDORI]
One moment, if you please.

328
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,605
Uh?

329
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,565
The card I played was a 7.

330
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,026
Which makes it the smallest
number on the table.

331
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,611
So I get to take a row.

332
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,862
[BOTH gasp]

333
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,990
[MIDORI] I think I'll be
taking this 48 for myself.

334
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:13,621
What? So then... Where is
my 49 supposed to end up?

335
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,288
[REN whimpers]

336
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,333
Oh, my. I do believe
your card makes six.

337
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,211
Would you be so kind as
to take the other five?

338
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,380
Is this for real?!

339
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,132
Your reaction tells me
that was a card

340
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,758
you thought was completely safe.

341
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,760
Such is the nature of <i>6 Nimmt.</i>

342
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,262
Plot twists are endless.

343
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,430
Heads up.

344
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,057
Midori is straight up
merciless today!

345
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,350
Uh‐huh.

346
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,643
[REN]
She got me.

347
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,729
She turned what should've been
my safety into my destruction!

348
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,357
How could I know she could
pull tricks like that?

349
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,818
[MIDORI] Okay. Time to
pick your next card.

350
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,986
[REN gasping]

351
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,404
[REN]
I would pick a card,

352
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,824
but suddenly I can't decide
because none of them feel safe!

353
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,243
This game is... scary!

354
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,246
[MIDORI]
Come on. Hurry it up!

355
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,791
[REN]
It's scary, but in a fun way!

356
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,838
[REN] The fourth row
only has four cards.

357
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,841
Bingo. Can't trick me this time.

358
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,218
[MIDORI]
And flip!

Wait. That's 73!

[MIKI]
Yes. It is.

362
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,310
[MIDORI]
That lands your 74 here.

363
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,562
Making it another
sixth card to a set.

364
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,647
Oh. I didn't mean to!

365
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,107
I wouldn't fret too much.

366
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,942
That's just how
the game is played.

This is a conspiracy!

Let's flip!

00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,495
Oh, no! I'm a failure!

372
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,418
[MIDORI]
I accumulated two cute cows.

373
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,545
I ended up with seven of them.

374
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,922
Well, what about you?

375
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,091
Not bad. I just have four.

00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,051
[BOTH]
Hm?

377
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,387
So? What was your final score?

00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,515
Ha! What does it matter?

00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,766
[MIKI, AYA]
Uh!

00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,309
Yeah. Whatever.

00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,853
We all know I lost. No big deal.

382
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,189
I'm not ashamed to admit defeat.

383
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,108
Or to admit that game was fun.

384

[AYA, MIKI laugh]

385

[REN]
But even so! I won't accept it!

386
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,074
Why do you have to be the one
who makes these trivial things?

387
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:13,950
[MIDORI]
Why not?

388

[gasps]

389
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,454
In my mind, games are the
bridge that connect people.

390
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,915
They span borders
and generations.

391
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,126
The maker of <i>6 Nimmt</i>
said something similar.

[REN gasps]

393
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,046
[MIDORI]
Games have an extensive history

394
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,673
that rivals that of books.

395
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,841
They have connected, excited,
and brought happiness

to all kinds of people
since ancient times.

397

You don't feel they
hold any value,

398
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,224
and I strongly disagree
with you on that front.

399
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,561
I believe they're an essential
part of the human experience.

400

You said something earlier

when you were trying to
get your point across.

402

[REN] I became a member
of the student council

403
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,193

see everyone smile.

the same way that I do!

It would take a lot more than
that to burst her bubble.

opposite effect.

She's officially obsessed.

00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,438
all the thinking I had to do!

471
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,315
I wonder. Who thought
to make this game?

472
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,153
Whoever that person is,
they're a bona fide genius!

473
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,487
[BOTH]
Heh.

474
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,406
[MANAGER] In Germany,
people who design games

475
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,075
are referred to as authors.

476
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,744
Take a closer look
and you'll see how

477
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,163
each game box features
the name of its creator.

478
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,039
They should be acknowledged
for their handiwork

479
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,708
just like any other
kind of author.

480
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,044
Manga, books, news articles‐‐
you name it!

481
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,172
Game authors...

482
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,090
[MANAGER] But this isn't
a long‐standing tradition

483
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,592
or anything like that.

484
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,845
Originally, a game author was
just one unknown craftsman

485
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,681
for a company that
produced games.

486
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,309
The man who invented <i>Beat the</i>
<i>Buzzard</i> is actually the one

487
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,436
responsible for making
the biggest difference

488
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,605
regarding game author
recognition.

489
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,940
His name was Alex Randolph.

490
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,234
He's the one who
thought of printing

491
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,070
the creator's name on
the game box design.

492
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,450
Later on, his idea would become
a convention with German games.

493
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,953
Getting your name on a box
might not sound all that fancy.

494
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,997
But there is a deeper
meaning to it.

495
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,416
It's no longer a
manufactured product.

496
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,335
The moment you lay claim
to your creation,

497
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,669
it becomes a work of art.

498
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,588
[gasps]

499
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,635
What a beautiful way to phrase
that. Games are like art, huh?

500
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,805
I know right?
It sounded so enticing.

501
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,183
That's when my dream
first formed in my mind.

502
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,100
[EMILIA]
Mm?

503
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,354
I will become a game
author one day!

504
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,981
Mm. Sounds weird
saying it out loud.

505
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,108
It isn't weird!
It's who you are!

506
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,944
There isn't a doubt in my mind‐‐

507
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,029
the game you make
will be as great as you!

508
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,573
Thank you. Come to think of it,

509
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,700
the plan was to start
taking steps towards

510
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,578
turning my dream into a reality
once I began high school.

511
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,832
A game... author?

512
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,300
[MIKI]
In honor of summer break,

513
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,260
we take a vacation to Kanazawa.

514
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,471
We even come across
a game at the hotel!

515
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,641
I feel like I've played this
game somewhere before.
