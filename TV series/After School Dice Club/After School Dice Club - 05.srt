1
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,263
[MIKI] Our first term of high
school has come to an end.

2
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,642
And summer break
is in full swing.

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,353
[AYA]
I feel like I'm melting.

4
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,480
Ugh, I heard summers
in Kyoto were hot,

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,774
but this has to be
some kind of record!

6
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,651
[MIDORI] Hate to be
the bearer of bad news

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,028
but it gets way hotter
than this, Aya.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,697
[AYA]
No! Say it ain't so!

9
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,200
I know! If we want
to beat the heat

10
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,701
we've gotta leave the street.

11
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,954
We should go to
the beach instead!

12
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,082
Good plan, but the closest
ocean is miles away.

13
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,542
What? For real?

14
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,169
Yeah. A one‐day trip
might be tough.

15
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,130
Then let's make it more than
one day and stay overnight!

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,591
Wishful thinking.
I hope you realize

17
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,052
vacations like that
aren't exactly bargains.

18
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,178
Who's paying?

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,847
[AYA]
Um. That's a good question.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,600
But I can't just not go to
the beach during summer break!

21
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,936
Talk about depressing!

22
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,650
[MIKI]
I have an idea.

23
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,901
[BOTH]
Huh?

24
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,197
[MIKI]
Okay, I'm heading out!

25
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,824
Make good choices!

26
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,993
All right!

27
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,452
[MIKI]
And just like that,

28
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,248
Aya, Midori, and I were off on
our first big vacation together.

29
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,750
Our destination was
the city of Kanazawa.

30
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,961
Not only does my aunt
Miyabi live out there,

31
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,255
she runs her own inn!

32
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,302
I never thought I'd see the day

33
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,263
when Miki went on
a trip like this.

34
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,557
Will she be all right?

35
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,812
[TOMOE]
Please, Miyabi.

36
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,481
Take good care of Miki
and her friends.

37
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,874
Now this kind of weather I like!

38
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,419
It's hard to believe the three
of us are actually here.

39
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,337
I've never been
to Kanazawa before!

40
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,797
Same goes for me.

41
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,465
We really lucked out!

42
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,093
None of this would've been
possible without Miki's aunt!

43
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,261
[MIDORI]
Mm‐hm!

44
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,929
Speaking of my aunt,

45
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,723
the inn she owns is
close to the beach,

46
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,100
and she said we'll have
a room all to ourselves.

47
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,102
[AYA]
You're the absolute best!

48
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,480
Have I told you lately
how much I love you?

49
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,567
Is our destination
within walking distance?

50
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,736
It's about a 30‐minute
train ride from here.

51
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,779
Then let's squeeze
some sightseeing in

52
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,531
before we take the train, 'kay?

53
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,158
But... What about the beach?

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,785
It's great! But the city
has other great things!

55
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,454
We'll go to the beach tomorrow!

56
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,749
[AYA] Mm‐hm! So much to see,
yet so little time!

57
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,459
I do love a good adventure!

58
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,420
Fair enough. If that's
what you two really want.

59
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:18,175
Yay! Our Kanazawa
exploration starts now! Heh!

60
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,801
[MIKI, MIDORI]
Yeah!

61
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,277
[AYA] Wow, what a jam‐packed
day! We saw so much!

62
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,029
Shall we head to the inn now?

63
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,988
Good idea.

64
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,782
It's just about the
time I told my aunt

65
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,283
we would be arriving.

66
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,161
[laughs] Wonder what's on
the dinner menu tonight!

67
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,039
She says as she stuffs
her face full of ice cream.

68
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,668
It's fine. 'Cause this is an
appetizer, not the main course!

69
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,379
[MIYABI]
Why hello, girls! Welcome!

70
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,965
I trust your journey here
wasn't too difficult.

71
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,926
[MIKI]
Not at all. It was nice!

72
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,636
What a relief!

73
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,472
I'll have to let your mother
know you made it safe and sound.

74
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,057
She was worried about you.

75
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,767
Oh. She was?

76
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,977
[MIYABI] And these two
must be your new friends!

77
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,437
I'm Midori Ono.

78
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,273
Thank you for your
hospitality and generosity!

79
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,151
I'm Aya Takayashiki,
how d'you do?

80
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,655
Such polite young ladies.
Don't be shy, come on in,

81
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,533
and I hope you came hungry,
because dinner is ready!

82
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:32,374
[gasps] Everything looks
positively delicious!

83
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,042
[MIYABI]
Eat to your heart's content!

84
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,837
This doesn't feel right. You
should feed this kind of meal

85
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,380
to guests who pay to be here.

86
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,798
[MIYABI]
What kind of hostess would I be

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,050
if I simply allowed
you girls to starve?

88
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,927
You're Miki's friends,
after all!

89
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,054
It's nothing to fret over.

90
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,098
We really appreciate it!

91
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,599
[MIYABI]
Anytime, sweetheart.

92
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,060
Well, you can
color me convinced!

93
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,896
[GIRLS]
Thank you so much!

94
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,777
Yummy!

95
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,239
[MIDORI] This just might be
the best sashimi I've ever had!

96
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,492
It's so fresh I could
practically taste the sea!

97
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,328
Uh? You seem happy.

98
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,330
What's making you
smile like that?

99
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,499
It's just... you used
to be the kind of girl

100
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,042
who would hardly talk to people.

101
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,295
Yet you've made such
delightful friends.

102
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,213
I'm happy for you!

103
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,798
My niece can be stubborn.

104
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,009
So please continue to
show her your kindness.

105
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,760
Hey! Aunt Miyabi!

106
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,637
Oh, no worries in
that department.

107
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,763
We're besties!

108
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,223
Yeah.

109
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,313
There's a warm bath waiting for
you girls when you're ready.

110
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,647
But please take your time.

111
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,149
[GIRLS]
Okay!

112
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,610
Thank you very much.

113
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,282
[AYA sighs]
That was delicious!

114
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,284
I'm liking this city
more and more!

115
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,953
It has great food and
stylish architecture.

116
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,872
It's really the bee's knees!

117
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,542
"The bee's knees"?
You sound like a grandma!

118
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,878
[MIDORI] Does a grandma have
the strength to do this?

119
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,546
Well? Does she?

120
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,590
[groaning]

121
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:04,674
[clattering]

122
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,092
[ALL gasp]

123
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,845
[AYA]
Whoopsie!

124
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,184
What's this? The back side
of these pieces are blank.

125
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,185
I wonder why.

126
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,019
[gasps]

127
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,103
Huh?

128
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,688
[AYA]
See? Check it out!

129
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,899
[MIKI]
You're right. How peculiar.

130
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:21,858
Right?

131
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,028
Shogi pieces are supposed to
have markings on the back, too!

132
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,155
Take the dragon behind
the rook, for instance,

133
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,240
or the gold behind the silver.

134
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,159
[MIDORI] That's because
these aren't for Shogi.

135
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,160
[AYA, MIKI]
Uh?

136
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,955
I think they're <i>GOITA</i> pieces.

137
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,789
[MIKI]
<i>GOITA</i>?

138
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,540
Wanna elaborate on that?

139
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,126
It's an old game from a
port town named Ushitsu.

140
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,587
You know, the one on
the Noto peninsula.

141
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,840
My, oh, my! So you've
heard of <i>GOITA</i>, eh?

142
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,302
I'm impressed that you know that
game, despite not being a local.

143
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,764
Midori knows more about board
games than anyone I've ever met.

144
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,975
She works in a store
that markets them.

145
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,935
[MIYABI]
Oh! Is that so?

146
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,103
That's correct.

147
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,189
<i>GOITA</i>'s unique rules caught the
attention of game specialists.

148
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,774
They made it into a card game.

149
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,360
We now sell it at the
store Miki mentioned.

150
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,611
Though, I'm ashamed to admit

151
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,738
I haven't played it
for myself yet.

152
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,575
But still, a proper set made
of bamboo intrigues me.

153
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,703
Would you mind if I
studied it for a while?

154
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,329
No. Not at all.

155
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,833
If you're studying a game,
we should probably play!

156
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,044
I would, but this game requires
us to have four players.

157
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,796
Oh. It does?

158
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,758
One. Two. Three. Four.

159
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,718
Who, me?

160
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,804
Wait! Don't drag Miki's
aunt into this!

161
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,972
My bad.

162
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,350
[laughs] I don't mind.
I have time to play with you.

163
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,727
‐‐[AYA] Huh?!
‐‐Huh? Are you certain?

164
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,979
Aw, yeah!

165
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,274
I, um...

166
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,735
I match your bishop
and play a gold.

167
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,695
I can't play a thing.

168
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,822
There! I win!

169
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,449
Almost unopposed!

170
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,408
[MIYABI laughs]

171
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,912
Ah! Another loss!
This game is hard.

172
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,040
[MIDORI] I thought it
was really engaging!

173
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,583
I just wish I would've
buckled down

174
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,751
and played it sooner than this.

175
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,004
I agree. Who knew such
an entertaining secret

176
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,797
was hidden away in
a place like this?

177
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,008
[MIYABI] You say that like
you've never played before.

178
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,759
Uh?

179
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,761
Miki, you know you played <i>GOITA</i>

180
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,138
when you were younger
and came to visit.

181
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,640
I did?

182
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,352
[MIKI] Actually, I get the
feeling that she's right.

183
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,064
But I can't quite
place the memory.

184
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,524
[laughs] Don't worry about it.

185
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,859
Uh.

186
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,239
[AYA]
Mm! Just what I needed!

187
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,533
That <i>GOITA</i> game was pretty fun!

188
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,409
I know.

189
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,370
So why is such a fun game
exclusive to the Noto region?

190
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,540
Similar games were made.
They just have different names.

191
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,333
[AYA]
Really?

192
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,584
Could you explain?

193
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,212
[MIDORI] There's <i>Maru‐Shogi</i>
and <i>Imo‐Shogi</i> for example,

194
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,005
which are essentially
the same as <i>GOITA</i>,

195
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,716
but they of course make
use Shogi pieces.

196
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,843
<i>Iro‐Kammuri</i> is
also very similar,

197
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,304
except it utilizes
Hyakunin Isshu cards

198
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,431
and plays to a
different hand size.

199
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,517
Also, another parallel,

200
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,645
was that these games were often
used as a means to gamble.

201
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,773
And in the Edo era,
gambling was banned by law.

202
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,776
As a result the games became
less and less popular.

203
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,530
Huh! Pullin' out the
smarts card! As always.

204
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,448
That explains why <i>GOITA</i>
didn't spread

205
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,618
much farther than one small
part of the Noto peninsula.

206
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,703
[AYA] I definitely wanna
give it another go!

207
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,538
[MIKI]
Me, too!

208
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,831
[MIDORI]
Agreed!

209
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,751
[MIDORI] Okay, I'm turning off
the light.

210
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,254
[sighs] We're finally
going to the beach!

211
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,714
You're really excited
about this beach trip.

212
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,218
Yes. I'm filled to the
brim with excitement...

213
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,056
So much so... I might...
not sleep...

214
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,186
Hey, Aya.

215
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,189
No way! She fell asleep!

216
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,568
[MIDORI] She looks so blissfully
unaware of the world.

217
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,444
But I know one way
to change that!

218
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,029
[sighs]

219
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,491
Hey. Come on now, Midori!

220
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,744
Let's let her sleep. She's
earned it, don't you think?

221
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,872
True. We should get
to bed as well.

222
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,540
Good call.

223
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,003
[MIDORI]
Miki. Thank you.

224
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,087
Huh?

225
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:11,963
Really.

226
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,550
I could only ever dream of going
on a fancy trip like this one.

227
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,468
But here I am, thanks to you.

228
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:23,683
That's backwards. I should
be the one thanking you.

229
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,685
If I were never
introduced to you,

230
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,438
then I wouldn't have been
introduced to games either.

231
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,107
I would've lived my life without
ever knowing how much fun

232
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,775
I was missing.

233
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,695
I mean it. Thank you.

234
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,406
[MIDORI gasps]
Miki.

235
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,033
Let's play a lot.

236
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,493
All of the games. Together.

237
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,329
Deal?

238
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,373
Sweet dreams.

239
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,711
[MIDORI] Oh, great. How am I
supposed to sleep after that?

240
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,264
[AYA]
Move it or lose it, ladies!

241
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,434
You slowpokes better
hustle! It's beach time!

242
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,269
I'm gonna need you
to tone it down.

243
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,313
Did you even put on
some sunscreen?

244
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,940
I can do that stuff later!

245
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,691
Later as in when you're burned?

246
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,320
Relax. You're acting like the
ocean might disappear on us.

247
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,448
I'm sorry, girls,
but I'm too hyped to stop!

248
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,408
So let's get going!

249
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,785
[thunder cracks]

250
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,286
[AYA]
Huh?!

251
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,377
[AYA] How is this
scientifically possible?

252
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,672
The sun was just out!
It's not fair!

253
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,217
It's not like we can change the
weather. Just accept it already.

254
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,134
[AYA]
No!

255
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,678
[TAKASHI]
No!

256
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,222
[cries] But the beach!

257
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,267
What'd you want me to do?
Magically clear up the rain?

258
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:51,104
[TAKASHI] Yes! Whatever it
takes! You said we were going!

259
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,106
You said we were going!

260
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,857
Oh geez, Aya.

261
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,943
What do you think we should do?

262
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,904
What can we do other
than stay in?

263
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,948
Oh, yeah!

264
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,491
We can play this!

265
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,367
Genius!

266
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,326
Great idea!

267
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,829
[TAKASHI]
What's going on?

268
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,205
[MIDORI]
Uh, hello.

269
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,665
Oh hey, what's up?

270
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,418
[MIKI] This is a tabletop
game called <i>GOITA.</i>

271
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,170
You're welcome to
play if you want to!

272
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,046
Really?

273
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,464
Come on, Takashi.

274
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,384
Please don't be a bother to
these nice young ladies.

275
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,760
Let's go back to the room.

276
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,888
Daddy! I wanna play the game!

277
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,390
It's okay buddy.

278
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,268
Pardon me, but the game
we we're wanting to play

279
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,103
actually requires four players.

280
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:32,979
[AYA]
That's right!

281
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,315
Your son won't be a
bother‐‐he'll be our fourth!

282
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,318
Y'see? There's no game
if there's no me!

283
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,902
A‐Are you sure about that?

284
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,280
You bet! We were
rained‐out, too.

285
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,824
Might as well make the most
of it with a fun game!

286
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,492
Are you ready to play?

287
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,785
[TAKASHI]
Mm‐hm!

288
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,789
Well, if you're sure it's okay.

289
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,959
First, you have to know
the rules before we begin.

290
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,794
For <i>GOITA</i>, you must
have two teams

291
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,713
made up of two players each.

292
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,923
There are 32 pieces total.

293
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,634
Two Kings, Rooks,
and Bishop pieces.

294
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,722
Four Golds, Silvers, Lances,
and Knight pieces.

295
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,683
And ten pawns gives us 32.

296
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,060
[TAKASHI]
Cool!

297
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,437
[MIDORI] All of the pieces
are turned facedown,

298
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,315
and each of the four players
is dealt eight of them.

299
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,858
Let's break it down.

300
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,109
The dealer starts it of

301
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,695
by playing one of their
pieces facedown.

302
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,907
This is followed by a second
piece they play face‐up.

303
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,117
The second piece
is the "Attack."

304
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,621
If the next player has the same
piece as the dealer's attack,

305
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,373
they can put it into play.

306
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,958
This is what's
known as a "Match."

307
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,961
If you match successfully,
you then become the dealer

308
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,964
and initiate another attack.

309
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,759
This process is repeated
until one of the four players

310
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,762
has put all eight pieces
of their hand into play.

311
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,598
The team with that
player wins the round.

312
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,768
The winning team scores the
value of the last card played.

313
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,646
You play several rounds and
keep cumulative scores,

314
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,441
and the first team to rack up
150 points wins it all!

315
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,318
In addition, if the
last move you make

316
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,530
has two of the same tiles,
you receive double the points.

317
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,740
Double points? Right on!

318
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,326
There are a few other
rules we should go over.

319
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,120
The King pieces are special.

320
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,080
They can match with
the Rook, Bishop,

321
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,249
Gold, Silver,
and Knight pieces.

322
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,918
Basically, the Lances and Pawns
are the only exception

323
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,586
when it comes to
matching with Kings.

324
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,713
However, you can't attack
with King pieces

325
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,508
until someone first plays
a King as a match.

326
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,634
I gotcha!

327
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,803
That covers just
about everything.

328
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,096
You have any questions?

329
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,681
Sure don't! Let's play!

330
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,307
Right! Let's pair off!

331
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,725
Since it's his first time,

332
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,644
Takashi should team
up with Midori.

333
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,605
You'll like her! She's a real
whiz when it comes to games!

334
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,315
Let's do this. Are you ready?

335
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,650
[TAKASHI]
Mm‐hm!

336
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,652
[MIDORI] Why don't you
go first, teammate?

337
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,862
[TAKASHI]
Okie‐doke!

338
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:51,451
I will... play my first
piece facedown. And...

339
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,662
I'll attack with
a nice Gold piece!

340
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,999
[AYA] I match your Gold
and attack with a Silver.

341
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,168
[MIDORI] I match your Silver
and play a Knight.

342
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,838
Matching your Knight.
Attacking with Rook.

343
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,556
[MIDORI]
I'll have two Pawns left over,

344
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,516
but this is the game‐changer!

345
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,437
I match your Gold,
and Attack with a Bishop!

346
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,438
I pass.

347
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,689
[TAKASHI]
Yeah!

348
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,523
[MIDORI]
Eh?

349
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,234
[TAKASHI] Match the Bishop
and attack with Silver!

350
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,486
Uh...

351
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,656
Awesome! Match your
Silver, and that's the round!

352
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,617
Ten points!

353
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,745
Man. What a total bummer.

354
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,997
I would've passed if you'd
let the Bishop through.

355
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,790
Huh? You would've?

356
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,211
Takashi, I wasn't expecting you
to counter the play I made.

357
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,587
What? Why not?

358
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,631
Me winning is the same
as you winning.

359
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,050
So there's no need to
interfere with what I do.

360
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,093
A basic <i>GOITA</i> strategy is to let

361
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,095
your partner's attacks
go unmatched.

362
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,639
[TAKASHI]
Oh, I see!

363
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,974
I don't wanna match
my teammate's attack.

364
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,477
Okay! I got it now!

365
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,942
[AYA]
King matches, Rook attacks!

366
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,945
[MIDORI] She matched my Silver
with a piece as rare as a King.

367
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,615
Which means she probably doesn't
have any Silvers in her hand.

368
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,535
[MIDORI] King is matched,
Silver is played.

369
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,161
I have to pass.

370
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,121
[MIDORI]
Miki doesn't have one either.

371
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,334
So Takashi must have
the only Silvers left!

372
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,003
[TAKASHI]
Hm... I'm gonna pass!

373
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,797
[MIDORI]
What?

374
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,925
[MIKI] I play another facedown
piece, finishing with a Rook!

375
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,385
That's 40 points!

376
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,970
Which makes 150!

377
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,514
Miki and I win the entire
kit and caboodle!

378
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,976
Aw! Losing's no fun.

379
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,270
Takashi. That one round

380
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,146
you had two Silvers
in your hand.

381
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,773
You should've matched
them with mine.

382
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,150
That would've clinched
a victory for our team!

383
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,735
What? No way!

384
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,029
Earlier you said
the exact opposite!

385
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,281
[MIKI gasps]

386
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,449
[MIDORI] Earlier I told
you the basic strategy,

387
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,576
but this was different.

388
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,328
You learn that difference by
paying attention to the pieces.

389
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,621
[TAKASHI]
Huh?

390
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,083
[MIKI]
I remember now.

391
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,669
[BOY] Why didn't you think to
match my Gold piece, Miki?

392
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,421
Your two Golds were
all our team needed

393
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,464
to win this round,
but you blew it!

394
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,882
[MIKI]
Um. I thought that matching

395
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,634
my teammate's attack was bad.

396
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:18,055
Not in this situation!
Why don't you understand?

397
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,516
I'm sorry. This game
is really hard.

398
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,103
So, I don't think
I can play anymore!

399
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,772
[MIYABI]
Miki! Please come back!

400
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,609
[MIKI]
Takashi is like me.

401
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,528
He's going through
the same thing I did.

402
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,196
Sometimes you match,

403
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,115
but then there are
times that you don't.

404
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,908
What's the difference?

405
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,869
[MIKI]
Hey, Takashi.

406
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,163
Would you like to play
on a team with me?

407
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,707
It might be fun to
switch up partners.

408
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,254
[AYA]
Uh?

409
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,427
[AYA] Matching your Lance and
attacking with a Silver!

410
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,347
[MIKI] Your Silver is matched
and my Knight is attacking.

411
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,097
[MIDORI]
Pass.

412
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,099
[TAKASHI]
I, uh, pass, too!

413
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:07,229
Hm! Aw, fine then!
I play my King and my Rook.

414
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,940
[MIKI] It's pretty obvious Aya
doesn't have a Knight.

415
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,318
But what about Midori?

416
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,823
[MIKI]
It's a risk I have to take!

417
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,993
[MIKI] I match with my King
and attack with a Knight!

418
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,246
I'm passing.

419
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,541
[MIKI] As I thought. Midori
doesn't have a Knight either.

420
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,878
Which would mean the
last two Knight pieces

421
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,005
are in Takashi's hand.

422
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,466
[TAKASHI] Both of the Kings
are already in play.

423
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,804
And Miki attacked with two
Knight pieces back‐to‐back.

424
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,933
There's only four Knights total,
and I have the other two!

425
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,023
[TAKASHI]
Did she set me up?

426
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,400
[gasps]

427
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,406
[TAKASHI] I match my teammate's
Knight, and attack with my own!

428
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,327
[TAKASHI] This was the best
move. Right, partner?

429
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,333
[MIKI]
He got it!

430
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,712
He figured out what I was trying
to tell him all on his own!

431
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,588
[MIDORI]
Well played, Takashi.

432
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,840
I pass!

433
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,590
Same!

434
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,425
Me, too.

435
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,093
Booyah!

436
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,428
Now... Let's see...

437
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:25,224
I'll play this piece facedown
and end it with a Lance!

438
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,934
And victory is ours!

439
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,311
Aw. My winning streak is over.

440
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,063
But you made an
awesome final move!

441
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,566
She's right. It really was.

442
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,026
[TAKASHI] And I couldn't
have done it without you!

443
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:41,741
[ALL laughing]

444
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,412
Thanks. That was a lot of fun!

445
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,705
Now that I got the hang of it,

446
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,082
I wanna take you guys
on in a rematch!

447
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,710
Thank you so much. My wife
and I are truly grateful.

448
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,587
You turned what could've
been a disappointing day

449
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,005
into a precious memory.

450
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,548
No trouble at all.

451
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,466
[MIKI, AYA]
Right!

452
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,217
What else have you
got planned today?

453
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,427
[GIRLS]
Uh.

454
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,555
[MIDORI] Well, we're kind
of playing it by ear.

455
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,306
I know!

456
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,515
[OTHERS]
Huh?

457
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,476
Come hang out with
us at the beach!

458
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,895
[TAKASHI'S FATHER] Uh, the rain
ruled that out for us, kiddo.

459
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,855
But it stopped!

460
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,148
Huh?

461
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,902
[ALL gasp]

462
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,155
[MIKI, AYA, MIDORI]
Wow!

463
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,532
[AYA]
It's beach time!

464
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,451
[MIYABI] I guess it was
a passing shower.

465
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,037
Skies should be clear for
the rest of the afternoon!

466
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,581
Yes! Beach!

467
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,000
Hey! Let's go for a swim!

468
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,835
[TAKASHI, AYA laughing]

469
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,921
Stop and think for
a second, Aya!

470
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,422
You still don't have sunscreen!

471
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,966
I said stuff like that
can wait till later!

472
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,426
No, it can't!

473
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,886
[MIKI giggles]

474
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,891
[MIYABI]
Miki really has come a long way.

475
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,353
And I suspect those
two played a part.

476
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,273
[MIKI]
Hey, Aunt Miyabi!

477
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,984
It's perfect out here now!

478
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,403
[MIYABI]
Tomoe, it seems your daughter

479
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,698
is doing just fine these days.

480
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,284
[TOMOE]
A message? What's this!

481
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,051
[MIDORI] What? You wanna
play the game I made?

482
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,095
No way! It's not even done yet!

483
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,390
Wait. What do you mean I'll
never finish at this rate?
