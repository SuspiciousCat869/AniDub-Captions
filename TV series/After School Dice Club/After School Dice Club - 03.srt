No! Give him back!

Go long!

00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,017
He might rip. Please stop!

[GIRL A]
Whacha gonna do?

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,354
[GIRL C] Think we'd listen
to a scaredy‐cat like you?

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,773
Psh. How annoying.

come and get it.

[MIKI]
Just a dream.

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,541
I always thought it was
better to be alone

15
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,126
than risk getting
hurt by someone.

16
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,964
That kind of mentality served
as my own unique armor.

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,467
It's what protected me
when I was young.

18
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,232
[MIKI] Goodness.
That was such a long time ago.

All the way back
in elementary school.

Uh... Someone.

00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,137
[MIKI]
Um. Excuse me, miss.

27
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,139
Are you all right?

Take a look.

00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,112
[MIKI]
What? You mean through there?

33
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,613
That's right.

34
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,202
[HANA]
That's my kitty cat.

35
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,204
She refuses to come out, though.

00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,122
[MIKI grunts]

37
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,374
We were on our way
to the vet's office,

38
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,960
and she's hiding because she
must have figured it out.

39
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,045
She's not the biggest fan.

Come out, Sakura, sweetie!
We need to get going!

[MIKI]
That's it!

42
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,845
Wait here. I think I have
an idea that might help.

43
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,313
I know that feeling,
when you're scared.

44
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,276
But there's no need to be.
You can come out.

45
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,571
Not so fast there!

Please, it's nothing.

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,329
So tell me.

51
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,832
Where did you learn your cat
whispering techniques?

52
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,709
Huh? What do you mean by that?

53
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,962
It's something special.
Sakura's kinda fussy.

54
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,839
She's the princess
and never lets anyone

55
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,217
besides me touch her. My little
sister would be jealous.

56
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,303
Uh? She's that picky?

57
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,889
Poor baby. She was
startled by some children

58
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,183
playing nearby and ran
straight for a hiding spot.

59
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,851
Uh.

60
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,686

Sakura.

62
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,982
Were you drawn to me
because I'm shy like you?

Oh! Nothing! But...

But what?

66
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,657
I, um. I sympathize
with your cat.

67
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,534
I know firsthand how scary it is

68
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,495
to approach someone
you don't know.

69
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,954
[HANA laughs]

70
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,664
Like me?

I'm someone you don't know.

00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,084
Oh. I'm not afraid!

73
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,629
Just being around you is
putting me at ease somehow.

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,964
Good! I was hoping so.

75
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,801
I can see what you mean
about you and Sakura, though.

76
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,220
[MIKI]
So it's not just me?

77
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,764
We may both be shy
compared to most.

78
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,182
But we're content,

79
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,352
just sitting here
together like this.

80
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,896
Oh! Time sure flies.

00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,356
We still have our appointment.

Uh! That's right!

83
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,984
Were you on your
way somewhere, too?

84
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,027
I was.

85
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,987
I had planned to meetup
with some friends.

86
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,365
Oh. Sorry. I guess
I held you up.

87
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,992
No. I really enjoyed
talking with you.

Goodbye. Thanks so
much for the tea!

much for the save!

You seem distraught.

Um, well. I'm fine, but...

96

Come on.

00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,354
She can tell us about it later.

00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,315
For now, though,
let's head to my place!

Yes, let's.

the last time I visited

a friend's house.
I'm kind of nervous.

[MIDORI]
I see. So that's what happened.

103
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,374
[MIKI] Yeah. Now you know
why I was late.

I'm proud of you! That's great!
You helped someone out!

105
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,547
She's right. At least you
didn't hit the snooze button

00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,257
on your alarm clock
over and over.

It's odd.

109
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,597
I've never heard of a cat being
so unresponsive to its owner.

110
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,099
They're called
scaredy‐cats for a reason.

111
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,934
Scaredy‐cats?

112
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,978
Something wrong, Miki?

113
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,688
Just caught up
in my thoughts.

114

Y'know, my kitty cat freaks
if I get anywhere near her.

You have a cat?

Mm‐hm. And a sister.

117

I just don't know where she is.

play a four‐player game!

Aw... Always the ice queen.

I made it home, Aya!

What are the odds?

Never would've guessed my sis
was the one you helped!

It's fate!

It's something, that's for sure.
I really can't thank you enough.

I guess I should've said that
the first time I met you, huh?

crossed again, Miki!

Yes! I feel the same!

Hey, Aya. Are you sure
she's related to you?

She's way too pretty.

What are you trying to say?

And your name is?

meet you as well.

one more introduction.

The name's Maki! What's up?

I thought the more people we had
to play these games‐‐the better!

00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,167
That makes sense to me.

It would seem we have a case
of polar opposites attracting.

Well you sure do act like her!

00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,063
Not a single ounce
of fear in your eyes.

163
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,691
Hana's always been there
for me through thick and thin.

164
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,402
I'd love to return the favor,
so I'll be there for you, too!

165
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,403
Cool!

166
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,364
Um. How exactly did the
two of you first meet?

167
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,992
It all started at the
restaurant I work at.

168
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,244
I was being harassed
by a drunk customer,

169
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,621
but Maki jumped in
and stood up for me.

170
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,874
That was the highlight
of the night, for sure.

171
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,751
Hana is like a magnet.

172
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,879
Leave her be and she attracts
all sorts of creeps and weirdos.

173
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,506
But my magnetism flips
when Maki's around.

174
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,427
That's right.
One look at me an‐‐ Not cool!

175
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,345
Jeez...

176
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,807
[AYA, MIDORI laugh]

177
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,144
[MIKI] I guess looks
can be deceiving.

178
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,189
[AYA] Oh! Does Sakura
wanna come and play?

179
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,857
[MAKI]
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

180
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,442
Come 'ere, kitty!

181
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,944
Okay. Guess that's a hard pass.

182
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,780
[AYA]
Don't take it personally, Maki.

183
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,365
She won't even let me touch
her and I live with her!

184
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,367
[MIDORI] It must have been love
at first sight with Miki, then.

185
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,410
[AYA gasps]

186
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,829
You're as heartless as the cat!

187
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,624
Honestly, she was
purring on her lap!

188
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,042
I almost didn't believe it.

189
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,545
That's not fair! Miki, you gotta
teach me your wooing ways!

190
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,380
Uh. I don't have those.

191
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,758
It's a true talent
that can't be taught.

192
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,346
[MAKI] Mm. Don't know why, but
you look oddly familiar somehow.

193
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,222
[gasps]

194
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,723
[MAKI]
You said your name was Miki?

195
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,350
Which middle school
did you go to?

196
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,686
I, uh, spent middle
school at Kamogawa‐West.

197
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,854
[MAKI]
Get out!

198
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,273
Same as me!
I'm Kamo‐West, too!

199
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,110
Ha! Small world, amirite?

200
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,363
I must've seen you
somewhere around school!

201
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,240
But all three of
them are still in

202
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,783
their first year of high school.

203
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,202
There's no way you could've been
enrolled at the same time.

204
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,453
What?

205
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,540
Hmm. Then where do I know her?

206
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,959
[MIKI] I have this sinking
feeling she's right‐‐

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,420
we have met before.
A long time ago.

208
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,755
Somewhere.

209
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:35,218
Ah, well. Are we gonna
reminisce or we gonna play?

210
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,720
Maki is what you'd
call an ace gamer.

211
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,223
Yup! Mainly when it comes
to the fighting kind!

212
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,224
Fighting?

213
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,433
Video games, Hana!

214
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,977
Better put your fists away.

215
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,187
You're not gonna need
'em for board games.

216
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,605
Board games, huh?

217
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,773
That's your cue, Midori.

218
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,400
[MIDORI]
Understood.

219
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,485
But calling it a board game
is a little misleading

220
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,364
since we won't be utilizing
an actual board.

221
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,949
[MAKI]
We're playing <i>Incan Gold</i>?

222
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,200
The heck is this?

223
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,119
[AYA]
Something fun from overseas!

224
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,164
Lately, Aya's been raving about
how much she enjoys these

225
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,500
European board games. We might
as well try them for ourselves.

226
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,043
Is that a fact?

227
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,837
I've never seen
anything like it.

228
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,922
They aren't that rare, y'know!

229
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,049
They make boatloads
of them in Germany!

230
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,678
Okay, then, Aya. Tell me,
how's the game work?

231
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,264
Well. I mean, obviously...

232
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,391
Midori, why don't you
do the honors today?

233
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,393
Sure thing.

234
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,271
The point of <i>Incan Gold</i> is to
explore the ancient ruins

235
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,690
and escape with as many
jewels as possible.

236
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,192
It should be self‐explanatory,

237
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,528
but the player with
the most jewels wins.

238
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,071
The rules are simple.

239
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,533
First, flip the top card
of the deck face‐up.

240
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,036
If you're lucky enough to get
one of these treasure cards,

241
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,039
it means you've found the number
of jewels listed in the corner.

242
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,874
That's a good thing.

243
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,168
In this case,
the number is 11.

244
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,045
The jewels found are
then split up evenly

245
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,130
amongst all of the players.

246
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,298
It's simple math.

247
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,301
Since there are five of us,
we each get two.

248
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:03,306
Then, the remaining jewel
gets left on this card.

249
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,682
I gotcha.

250
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,517
We're collecting
these little guys.

251
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,937
Right. The expedition continues.

252
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,230
We keep flipping our cards

253
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,774
and stuffing our pockets
with these precious gems.

254
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,067
Uh.

255
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,026
A snake?

256
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,903
[MIDORI]
This is a hazard card.

257
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:21,199
The standard deck in Incan Gold
is only made up of 30 cards.

258
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,076
Fifteen of them are hazards.

259
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,036
But... that's half!

260
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,788
So what do hazard cards mean?

261
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,665
The first card is
a "premonition."

262
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,041
Nothing happens.

263
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,586
However, if the same type
of hazard shows up twice,

264
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,422
the expedition is
marked as a failure.

265
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,510
When that happens, the explorers
are forced to escape the ruins.

266
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,721
In addition, they lose every
last piece of the treasure

267
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,306
that they've gathered
on their journey.

268
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,724
No exceptions.

269
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,684
What?!

270
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,726
Oh...

271
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,019
[grunts]

272
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,438
There are five types of hazards.

273
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,069
Snakes, spiders, mummies,
flame traps, and falling rocks.

274
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,489
There are three copies of
each for a grand total of 15.

275
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,575
Of course, there's only one way
to retain all of your jewels.

276
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,994
And that's by retreating.

277
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,037
You make your choice
after each card.

278
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,622
Continue or go home?

279
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,250
We decide out loud?

280
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,004
Not quite. You use this
little explorer token.

281
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,715
When you're ready, hold
the token in your hand

282
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,634
to symbolize your desire to
retreat with your loot in tow.

283
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,803
Keep your hand empty
to keep going.

284
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,222
You reveal your
choices together.

285
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,935
Easy enough.
Let's recap real quick.

286
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,647
You can either take the risk for
more treasure or go home because

287
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,735
you're too scared to press on.
What this boils down to...

288
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,029
...is a game of Chicken.

289
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,074
How very astute.
This is similar to Chicken.

290
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,369
The further you go,
the more dangerous it gets.

291
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,872
But the more explorers
who turn back before you,

292
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,292
the larger your share of
the treasure becomes.

293
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,086
You just have to be careful
when deciding to withdraw.

294
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,338
Hm?

295
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,882
[MIDORI] Unearthing the jewels
doesn't make them yours.

296
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,010
In other words, they don't count
towards your final score.

297
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,470
What does that mean?

298
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,014
Only by retreating to safety
are you allowed to claim

299
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,933
whatever jewels you find.
You then place them

300
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,895
in your tent to properly
display your earnings.

301
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,272
Oh! So there's a chance
you could lose

302
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,816
all your jewels and points
if you get too greedy.

303
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,029
You got it. Weigh the outcomes,
make the best decision,

304
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,531
and stay one step ahead
of your fellow explorers.

305
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,283
I like the sound of that.

306
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,242
[HANA]
Uhh...

307
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,286
Also, do you remember
those jewels

308
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,829
that get left on the cards?

309
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,289
You can take those
if you retreat.

310
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,917
There are a lot of perks
to running away!

311
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,211
[MIDORI] One game
consists of five rounds.

312
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,505
The player to successfully
gather the most points

313
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,091
within those rounds
is the winner!

314
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,468
<i>Incan Gold</i> has three
types of jewels.

315
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,387
The turquoise one
is the most common,

316
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,930
but is only worth one point.

317
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,890
Obsidian is worth five points,

318
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,684
and then the gold
one is worth ten.

319
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,562
And those are the rules.
Understood?

320
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,022
Yeah.

321
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,816
Somewhat.

322
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,276
It's not exactly rocket science.

323
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,905
No worries, sis. Just pair up
with Maki if you're confused.

324
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,659
Wait. We can team up?
I'm game if you are.

325
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,244
Sure, that's cool.

326
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,954
All right, then.

327
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,747
Let's play some Chicken.

328
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,917
[laughs] Been a while since I've
been this pumped for a match.

329
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,085
[MAKI laughs]

330
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,629
Uh. Lighten up, please.

331
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,431
[AYA]
Whoa.

332
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,642
One more fire or mummy
and we're cooked, or wrapped.

333
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,144
'Kay, time's up!

334
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,229
Make a choice!

335
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,106
[MIDORI]
Miki is the only one going back.

336
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,483
For real? What a party pooper.

337
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,569
Yes. I'm sorry.

338
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,655
If we draw the wrong card,
Miki will be the smart one!

339
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,533
C'mon, Hana!
Go big or go home!

340
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,618
So that just leaves
three of us.

341
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,745
Let's see if our
gamble paid off.

342
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,623
[MAKI] Boom, baby!
Five pieces of obsidian!

343
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,544
Just as I thought.
You get goods if you got guts.

344
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,963
Hm?

345
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,508
Yo, Miki. You used to
be bullied a lot, huh?

346
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,634
[gasps]

347
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,012
I could tell almost instantly.

348
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,139
Bullies have this
basic instinct.

349
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,516
It lets them seek out weaker
people and prey on them

350
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,101
like it's open season.

351
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,769
With that meek attitude,

352
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,606
you might as well wear a
sign that says, "Bully me."

353
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,065
[MIKI gasping]

354

[GIRL C] Think we'd listen
to a scaredy‐cat like you?

355
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,111
Psh. How annoying.

356
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,989
[MIKI] Wait a minute,
one of those girls...

357
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:34,619
She was older than the others,
but I don't remember her name.

358
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,621
Could it be...?

Listen here! I won't allow
my friend to be bullied.

[MIDORI]
Same here!

363
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,923
I'll stand by Miki's
side no matter what.

364

[MIKI]
Thank you, you guys.

365
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,470
Huh. Cute speech.

366
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,097
But can you match it
with your courage?

What the...?!

00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,853
Well. Time to bounce!

370
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,397
Oh, you're heading back
to your campsite.

371
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,234
Guess you're not brave enough
to hang with Midori and me.

372
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,318
Isn't that right?

373
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,112
Absolutely. Now that it's
just the two of us,

374
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,532
we'll be swimming in riches
before we know it!

[MIDORI]

[AYA]
No! We're completely mummified!

[laughs] Man, I got
you guys good!

379
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,875
That means our team
sweeps this round!

380
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,710
Way to go, Maki!

381

Oh, it's in the bag! I came
to win, just like I always do!

Come on, you two!
You've gotta hold it together!

384
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,557
I swear, my jewels
will be avenged!

385
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,607
[MAKI] Sweet! The finish
line is in our sights.

386
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,403
Time to claim my rightful
spot as number one!

387

[gasps]

388
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,948
I respectfully withdraw.

[AYA]
What?!

390
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,578
And now there's spiders?
Four of the five types.

391
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,955
That's way too hazardous!

392
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:05,251
Aw, cut the whining!
Make your choice!

393
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,336
If you're out, who'll
avenge your jewels?

394
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,006
[whines] My poor jewels!

395
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,341
[MAKI]
And then, there were two.

396
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,636
Yeah, it's you and me.

397
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,098
Sure you don't wanna just call
it quits? I'd still let you.

398
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,975
Um. I'm sure.

399
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,352
[MAKI] Gotta say, never thought
I'd be going head‐to‐head

400
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,646
with you in the final matchup.

401
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,356
[MIKI]
Just her and me.

402
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,108
One on one.

403
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,735
[MIDORI]
Miki.

00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,571
Let's continue! Here goes!

Falling rocks!

406
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,618
Now all five types of hazard
cards have been put into play.

407
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,329
One more spells instant
death to all explorers.

408
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,997
[MAKI]
Yo, Miki.

409
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,500
You wind up failing here?
You end up dead last.

410
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,045
Bow out now.

411
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,048
I'm sure you realize retreating
means you won't beat me,

412
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,926
but you'd still snag second
place. That's not bad.

413
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,720
[MIKI]
I do realize.

414
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,473
I mean, it's no secret
that I'm a coward.

415
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,809
Even if I left now, nobody
would think any less of me.

416
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,937
Huh? So warm.

00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,484

of my troubled thoughts?

finally have the courage

to go further,
thanks to my friends!

card, it's all over for her.

Nah, it's my last name.

[gasps]

478
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,968
Wait. Miki.

479
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,970
Did you just call me what
I think you called me?

480
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,305
[gasps]

481
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:55,606
So, then, we have
met before, huh?

482
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,441
Yes!

483
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,359
Where was it, though?

484
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,153
[MIKI] Painful memories
are a lot like caves.

485
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:05,533
They're dark and scary, and I
hate being trapped inside them.

486
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,828
But, if I muster the courage
to push through,

487
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,080
I just might come across
something else.

488
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,666
Something as precious as jewels.

489
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,799
[MIDORI]
It's a faceoff against

490
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,676
the student council
vice president!

491
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,596
If she loses, she has
to give up on me.

492
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,390
I, too, have a dream I
want to see realized.
