1
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,312
[MIKI] It started out as just
another ordinary summer day.

2
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,943
[MIKI hums]

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,070
[MAKI]
Hey there, cutie! Flying solo?

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,447
[gasps] Maki?

5
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,366
Yo! Been awhile!

6
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,785
Whacha doin'?
Your friends flake?

7
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,995
Uh‐uh. Aya's off on a trip.

8
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,498
And Midori is too preoccupied
with finishing her game

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,582
to meet up today.

10
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,959
Pump the breaks.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,378
Don't tell me those two are
the only friends you have.

12
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,212
[gasps]

13
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,046
Well then,

14
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,215
guess that means you're
hangin' with me today!

15
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,591
Huh?

16
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,886
Please, Maki. Slow down!

17
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,638
What?! Talk louder!

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,640
You're going way too fast!

19
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,976
Yeah! It has plenty of gas.

20
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,770
Which means we could go a lot
faster than we are right now.

21
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,063
[gasps]

22
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,336
[MAKI]
Okay. We're here!

23
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,880
[MIKI whimpers]

24
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,634
[MAKI]
Wow. That really shook you, huh?

25
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,678
Y'know, I would've
eased off the throttle

26
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,012
if you'd said something.

27
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,139
I did say something.

28
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,225
[MAKI]
Ha! Oh, well.

29
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,896
Come on! This way!

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,944
Whoo! This water is really cold!

31
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,029
What are you waiting for?
Get in here, girl!

32
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,198
It feels pretty nice.

33
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:28,291
Yeah, you're right.
It does feel nice!

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,086
Uh. Whoa! Check out
all the fish!

35
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,423
Do you think I can
catch one with my hands?

36
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,716
No, wait! Hey, you,
get back here!

37
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,510
Careful! It's kind of slippery.

38
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,303
‐‐[MAKI yelps]
‐‐[MIKI gasps]

39
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,681
You okay?

40
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,350
Guess... I was asking for it.

41
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,354
[MIKI laughing]

42
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,940
Hey. Just who are
you laughing at?

43
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,984
Take that!

44
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,195
[MAKI laughs]
Ah, nice and refreshing!

45
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,155
Wouldn't you agree?

46
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,949
I do agree. Please stop!

47
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,164
We don't have spare clothes.

48
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:07,998
Uh!

49
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,668
Aw, no worries, Miki. Everything
will dry off soon enough!

50
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,253
[MAKI laughs]

51
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:20,343
[MAKI sighs] That summer
breeze feels so nice!

52
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,471
[gasps]

53
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,890
[MAKI]
Remember that game we played

54
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,558
at Hana's place that one day?

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,643
That sure was a good time.

56
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,395
Yes. <i>Incan Gold</i>, right?

57
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,230
Yeah, that's the one!

58
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,900
Board games are pretty
sweet, if you ask me.

59
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,902
Though, I think the older
we get, the less chances

60
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,528
we have to sit down
with a bunch of people

61
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,697
and do something like that.

62
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,824
But, y'know, it was
more than a game.

63
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,576
It's what brought us
closer together!

64
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,119
Oh! Know what?

65
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,579
That reminds me of something!

66
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,206
[MAKI]
Hm?

67
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,040
[MIKI]
This!

68
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,292
[MAKI]
What is it? Some dice?

69
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,460
It's <i>Monjiro.</i>

70
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,711
I bought it recently.

71
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,130
And it just so happened
to still be in my bag.

72
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,341
I haven't tried them out
yet, but apparently

73
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,343
there are a lot of games
you can play with these!

74
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,677
[MAKI]
Oh, for real?

75
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,889
Let me see. Hm...

76
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,100
Well, well. Looks interesting.

77
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,562
All right then!
Let's play! It'll be fun!

78
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,397
The "Monjiro Showdown"
sounds cool.

79
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,398
Sure.

80
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,317
We start by having
you take one half

81
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,861
of these dice and me
taking the other.

82
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,281
Then we use them to come up with
as many insults as possible!

83
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,115
[MIKI]
What?!

84
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,158
Here we go!

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,993
[MIKI]
Wait, Maki!

86
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,912
[MAKI]
Crybaby!

87
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:29,871
[gasps]

88
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,959
[laughs] Next up is...

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,876
[gasps]

90
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,213
Aw, come on! Don't ya
wanna retaliate a little?

91
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,173
Let's go!

92
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,221
[laughing] Delinquent?

93
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,640
That's seriously the
best you can dish out?

94
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,810
No offense, but you
suck at insults.

95
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:57,065
[MAKI] Hm? Six characters,
huh? Impressive.

96
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,693
How about this... Little girl!

97
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,278
[gasps]

98
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,447
[chuckles]

99
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,617
That all you got? Sha‐bam!

100
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,953
[MIKI]
A puppy?!

101
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,415
[laughing] That's way
too weak! Just like...

102
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,960
[MIKI whines]
She's making me feel so...

103
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,797
[MAKI]
Heh! No effect once again!

104
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,632
[MIKI] Why is hurling
insults back and forth

105
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,510
so amusing to her?

106
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,887
[laughs]

107
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,681
Offending people just isn't
your thing, I guess.

108
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,810
I mean, haven't you ever been
in a shouting match before?

109
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,478
By the way, Miki.

110
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,606
How do we decide who
wins this thing?

111
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,817
[MIKI]
Huh? Uhh...

112
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,152
It doesn't say.

113
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,403
Well, in that case,

114
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,406
you should surrender and
declare me the champ!

115
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,532
I refuse!

116
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:53,747
Figures. Hope you know, you're
actually a little bit of a...

117
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,667
No. That's not what I...

118
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,752
Here, Maki.

119
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,003
Huh?

120
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,383
[MAKI]
"Thank you"? I don't get it.

121
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,302
I think you mixed up your dice.

122
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:11,306
[MIKI] Mm‐mm. I've been
wanting to thank you.

123
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,515
[MAKI]
Hm?

124
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,144
I'm guessing you don't
remember, but a long time ago,

125
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,605
you rescued me from
a group of bullies,

126
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,106
and it meant a lot.

127
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,108
This happened at
a shrine, right?

128
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,360
And involved a bear?

129
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,319
[gasps]

130
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,907
Small world. So you were
that little girl. Wow.

131
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,952
You used to get bullied on
the regular, didn't ya, Miki?

132
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,953
[MIKI]
Yes.

133
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,289
Oh, but they stopped the day
after you helped me out.

134
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,791
Man, that ticks me off.

135
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,834
Huh? What does?

136
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,711
My old man could
only be described

137
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,380
as a total train‐wreck.

138
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,174
He loved gambling and
always smelled like booze.

139
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,884
Then he'd come home wasted

140
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,804
and start whaling on
my mom or us kids.

141
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,474
I got hit a lot until my
parents finally divorced.

142
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,185
Mom made the decision
to move to Kyoto,

143
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,021
leaving our old lives behind.

144
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,982
But you never really forget.

145
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,317
Not memories like that.

146
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,736
[MAKI]
So whenever I see some moron

147
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,072
picking on a person
who can't fight back,

148
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,993
I think about my worthless old
man and I jump in to stop it.

149
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,953
Maki...

150
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,748
[MAKI] Bottom line is, you don't
have to thank me for anything.

151
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,584
I wasn't motivated by
an impulse to save you.

152
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,004
I just needed to
let off some steam.

153
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,797
That's what I did back then.

154
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,549
If I saw a bully beating
on someone,

155
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,803
I'd turn around and
beat 'em right back.

156
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,098
That's how I became known
as Mad Dog Kyoko!

157
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,725
[gasps]

158
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,687
[MIKI]
Maki. But how?

159
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,150
Tell me, how is it you're
able to smile like that?

160
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,820
What's your secret?
How can you be so strong?

161
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,781
I... I know how weak
and helpless I am.

162
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,283
And I'm ashamed of it.

163
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,745
I want to change that
part of me so badly!

164
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,996
But I can't.

165
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,330
I'm such a coward.

166
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,707
There's so much I'm afraid of.

167
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,294
Except for running away‐‐
I'm never afraid to do that.

168
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,837
I want to be like you.

169
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,672
I want to have your strength!

170
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,593
What are you talking about?
You're fine as is.

171
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,639
So, basically. I, ah...

172
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,433
I can get carried
away pretty easily

173
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,269
without thinking sometimes.
That's my bad.

174
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,521
So forgive me!

175
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,191
You may not be good
at slinging insults,

176
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,026
but it's not because
you're a weakling.

177
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,028
It's because you're
compassionate.

178
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,907
Your strength lies in
empathizing with others.

179
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,289
[MAKI]
Hey, Miki.

180
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,501
Just now, you mentioned
how you're always one

181
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,296
to turn tail and run,
but are you sure?

182
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,508
At Hana's you had a chance
to run, but you didn't.

183
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,051
You stood your ground.

184
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,429
Besides, you smile a lot
more than you used to.

185
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,389
[gasps]

186
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,393
[MIKI] I guess I can't hide all
the fun I've been having.

187
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,062
It shines through.

188
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,065
[MIKI] Hey, Maki. What do you
say we try a different game?

189
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,191
[MAKI]
Like what?

190
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,859
"Love‐love Monjiro"!

191
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,985
What's that?

192
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,612
We trade compliments.

193
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,365
Ha! Fat chance I'll play that!

194
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,533
[MIKI]
Here's one!

195
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,536
[MAKI] There's that word again.
Doesn't feel flattering.

196
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,288
Uh! How 'bout...

197
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,751
[MIKI]
...this?

198
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,086
Come on, Miki.

199
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,879
Now you're just
picking random words.

200
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,882
I'm not! When you let
your hair down today

201
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,009
you looked so pretty! Honest!

202
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,762
Ugh! That's not even true!

203
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,180
[MIKI]
She's blushing.

204
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,431
[cubes rattling]

205
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,142
[MIKI]
Look, Maki.

206
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:48,439
Huh? Wha‐‐? Cut! It! Out!

207
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,609
Stop it! Stop it!
This is a lot harder for me.

208
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,945
[MIKI]
But I made another one!

209
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,323
[MAKI]
What is with this girl...?

210
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,493
I think she might have
a hidden sadistic side.

211
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,453
[MIKI]
One more!

212
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,457
[MIKI] And that's how my summer
vacation came to an end.

213
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,171
[MIKI] It was the start
of our second term.

214
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,547
Autumn was right
around the corner,

215
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,550
which meant the school
festival was, too.

216
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,178
Aya, Midori, and I decided
to pitch the idea

217
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,637
of doing a board game café

218
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,100
in addition to what our class
was already planning, however...

219
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,685
Denied.

220
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,278
[AYA]
What? How come?

221
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,781
Just straight up shot down?
Seriously?

222
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,700
The real reason you're
rejecting our proposal

223
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:44,037
is because Midori rejected
yours first, isn't it?

224
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,247
You can believe whatever
you want to believe,

225
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,124
but my answer's final.

226
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,209
[grumbles]

227
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,253
We understand. Excuse us.

228
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,839
Wait! What about our idea?

229
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,466
Thank you.

230
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,932
[AYA] Is she allowed to do that?
It's an abuse of power!

231
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,518
There's nothing we can do.
It's best to give up on it.

232
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,231
[MIKI] I get the feeling that
there's more to this story.

233
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,690
[MIKI grunts]

234
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,695
[MIDORI]
Is something wrong, Miki?

235
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,869
[REN] I've already admitted
that board games are fun.

236
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,288
I know from firsthand
experience.

237
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,915
But I can't rely
on Midori or that

238
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,959
brilliant mind of
hers any longer!

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,127
I will make this the best
school festival ever

240
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,922
without her help! And then...

241
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,425
The president will have no
choice but to acknowledge me!

242
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,343
Wassup!

243
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,177
[gasps]

244
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,971
That's right! I'm back!

245
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,347
What? Aoshima?

246
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,933
Hey, Vice Prez! Holdin'
down the fort, I see.

247
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,519
Glad you're back, but,
next time tell us!

248
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,314
I'll go round up everyone else!

249
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:57,318
[YUTO] Hmm. A lot of thought
went into these ideas.

250
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,446
Should shape up to be a
fun festival this year.

251
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,741
Shibusawa really brought
her A‐game, didn't she?

252
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,453
[gasps]

253
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:12,667
[YUTO] A board game café?
Proposed by... Midori Ono?

254
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,711
She's a freshman.

255
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,799
[AYA growls]
I call shenanigans!

256
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,676
Are you still upset, Aya?

257
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,596
Yes! Duh! This was supposed
to be Midori's moment!

258
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,057
A chance to share her
dreams with everyone!

259
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,934
I'm not bothered by it.

260
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,228
Not everyone needs
to know my dream.

261
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,105
‐‐[door creaks]
‐‐Hi, welcome!

262
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,111
[MIKI] Earlier...
I saw him in the hallway.

263
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,739
[YUTO]
Those uniforms look familiar.

264
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,243
It's them. These three
must be the applicants.

265
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,662
Are you looking for anything
in particular today?

266
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,416
Uh. No, uh. This is my first
time at this store.

267
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,834
I kinda wandered in.

268
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,879
It looks like you sell games
of some sort here, right?

269
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,631
Yes. All the boxes you see
around you are board games.

270
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,134
Board games? That's interesting.

271
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,969
Well, since you wandered in,

272
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,888
would you like me to
show you how one works?

273
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,265
Oh. So you can
test them out here?

274
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,642
Yes! In fact, I encourage it.

275
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,312
The best way to learn about
games is to play them.

276
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm in!

277
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,857
But there are so many
games to choose from.

278
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,859
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

279
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,404
A common dilemma.
There are many types of games.

280
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,448
But perhaps if you could
describe what you like

281
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,534
I could help narrow down
the search a little for you.

282
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,412
[YUTO]
Hmm... "What I like"?

283
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,497
Festivals.

284
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,456
Uh?

285
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,916
That's what I like!

286
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,752
Something that's as
exciting as a festival!

287
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,629
[AYA]
Kinda picky.

288
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,382
Doable? Or no?

289
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,718
I've got you covered.
One moment, please.

290
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,262
[MIDORI]
This is <i>The Island,</i>

291
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,556
by game author Julian
Courtland‐Smith.

292
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,766
The premise is great.

293
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,185
The island of Atlantis is
sinking and it's up to us

294
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,062
to save our exploration parties.

295
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,563
Whoa, nice.

296
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,900
To start, you lay out these
little hexagonal land tiles.

297
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,111
That forms the island.

298
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,279
On spaces where you see
the dragon icon,

299
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,073
place this Sea Serpent piece.

300
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,367
Each player begins with
ten "people" pieces,

301
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,993
all of which have a
value ranging from

302
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,954
one to six displayed
on the bottom.

303
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,330
I see 'em!

304
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,998
[MIDORI] This number
is added to your score

305
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,167
if the person it
represents escapes.

306
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,963
There are plains, forests,
and mountain tiles.

307
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,840
All of which are sinking
in that order.

308
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,800
Which means placing your
pieces on higher ground

309
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,177
is generally the safer strategy.

310
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,679
So, keeping that in mind,

311
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,973
let's take turns to place
our pieces on the island.

312
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,891
'Kay!

313
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,855
[AYA]
Ooh! This is cool!

314
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,606
That's pretty impressive!

315
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,942
Now. I'll explain how to play.

316
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,653
You do three things
during each of your turns.

317
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,073
The first: Move your
pieces and boats.

318
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,075
You can move any
of your pieces,

319
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,035
an empty boat,
or a boat containing

320
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,705
your piece by up
to three spaces.

321
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,498
However, a piece that
had the misfortune

322
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,585
of falling into the ocean
can only move one space.

323
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,045
Ideally, you want to put
your pieces on a boat

324
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,382
and make your way to the beach.
Survival takes priority.

325
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,633
[YUTO hums]

326
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,135
[MIDORI] And the only
way a piece survives

327
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,346
is by reaching a beach
and escaping the island.

328
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,140
Right! I gotcha!

329
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,268
[MIKI] Why is he familiar?
It's not just the hallway...

330
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,979
After the moving phase,
the next part of your turn

331
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,482
requires you to take
away a land tile.

332
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,150
Plain tiles go first.

333
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,611
When you run out of plains,
you then remove forests.

334
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,946
The mountains are the last
part of the island to go.

335
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,158
Huh?! But what if one of my
guys was on a that tile?

336
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,203
He's forced to go for a
little swim in the ocean.

337
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,663
Something tells me
it's not a fun swim.

338
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,249
[MIDORI] Behind each individual
land tile is an image

339
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,418
with either a red or
green border around it.

340
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,129
Red ones are items, and
green ones are events.

341
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,049
If it's an item, refrain
from showing others.

342
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,385
Just trust me. You can use items
at the start of future turns

343
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,596
before touching your pieces.

344
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,516
[MIKI]
I remember!

345
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,477
He's our school's student
council president!

346
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,272
The third and final thing you do
is give this six‐sided monster

347
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,108
die a roll. This will force
you to move a shark,

348
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,361
a whale, or a sea serpent.

349
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,946
So the land goes away,

350
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,490
and creepy creatures of
the deep take its place.

351
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,285
Yes! As we continue to play,
the island gets smaller

352
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,454
and the sea gets more dangerous!

353
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,999
Wow! Sounds intense!
Let's give it a shot!

354
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,000
[MIKI]
Why?

355
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,962
What reason does the president
have for being here?

356
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,838
Is it because of our proposal?

357
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,508
But the vice president
already denied that idea.

358
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,760
What's wrong, Miki? You good?

359
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,846
Oh, yeah! Let's play! 'Kay?

360
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,682
I'll start off if
you don't mind.

361
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,102
One, two, three explorers
safely boarded.

362
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,603
And I'm taking this land.

363
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,523
Wait! Red is mine!
You know that, don't you?

364
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,857
[MIDORI]
On the back is...

365
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,985
Oh! Green means an event.

366
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,611
Shark attack!

367
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,530
Since this tile had
a shark on it,

368
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,574
three guesses what
happens to this piece.

369
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,285
What? I'm a man down
on the first turn?

370
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,288
[laughs] I advised you
to stay high and dry.

371
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,831
You act that ruthless
even though

372
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,915
you're playing your friends?

373
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,334
If you don't play to win,
don't play at all.

374
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,961
That's especially
true for <i>The Island</i>

375
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,046
since players have control
of the monsters.

376
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,674
If you want this to be like
a festival, give it your all.

377
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,343
Well, I have no choice
when you put it like that!

378
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,263
Great! That's the way to play!

379
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,514
[AYA]
A shark!

380
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,849
[MIDORI]
A whale!

381
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,184
[MIKI]
Another shark?

382
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,271
That's some pretty whale‐
and‐shark‐infested water.

383
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,024
Looks like things are
starting to heat up!

384
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,650
I've got a boat ready to dock,

385
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,445
but a big sea serpent is
guarding the beach.

386
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,696
If I don't plan accordingly,

387
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,282
my guys will be serpent
snacks for sure.

388
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,285
I guess I'll just have to
take a risk and abandon ship!

389
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,455
Wait! You sure? You'll be
at a total disadvantage

390
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,415
since you can only
move one space!

391
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,125
It's fine. No stress!

392
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,211
I see. So, you must have
drawn the dolphin item!

393
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,379
What's that?

394
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,922
[MIDORI] It permits
a person to be carried

395
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,133
three tiles away by
a friendly dolphin.

396
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,469
However, it doesn't work
if the person is on a boat.

397
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,429
[YUTO]
Ha, ha! Yep! That's the plan!

398
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,015
If I use the dolphin at
the start of my next turn,

399
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,226
I can successfully get at least
one of my guys to safety.

400
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,187
[MIDORI]
If only it were that easy.

401
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,396
Eh?

402
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,066
Shark Warp.
This item lets me move

403
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,778
a shark to any open ocean
tile I so choose.

404
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,530
This sea serpent looks
like he needs a friend.

405
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,406
He does?!

406
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,824
You're evil!

407
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,869
[MIDORI]
Time for a monster roll.

408
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:22,995
[AYA]
A shark!

409
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:23,954
[YUTO]
What the‐‐?

410
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,584
Aw! It really happened!
Well. It's dinnertime!

411
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,088
But that was my
six‐point squad leader.

412
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,464
Rookie mistake.

413
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:37,343
Keep your guard up regardless
of where the monsters are.

414
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,304
So no training wheels for
your first‐time customers?

415
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,224
I like that kinda attitude.

416
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,395
But I won't lose.
No matter what it takes!

417
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,524
[YUTO]
Eh... I think I might lose...

418
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,527
[MIDORI] Only the mountain tiles
remain now. And one of those

419
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,405
tiles has a volcano hidden
on the other side of it.

420
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,156
Once it's flipped over,

421
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,951
everyone who's not safe
on a beach is done for.

422
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,619
That's the end of the game.

423
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,121
[AYA grumbles]
Just like that?

424
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,206
But I've only
saved three people!

425
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,541
Same here.

426
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,836
It's a tough place to be,
but I gotta take a dive.

427
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,462
What? This again?

428
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,756
One volcano and
it's all over, right?

429
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,758
Now is not the time to hesitate!

430
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,345
Good point! One, two... three!

431
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,682
Aya! You're doomed if someone
rolls a sea serpent.

432
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,934
I'm aware. But it's time to act!

433
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,187
Tough talk. I'm really
diggin' your style.

434
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,274
Daredevils like us are the lucky
ones in these situations.

435
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,401
Fortune favors
the bold, after all!

436
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,821
[AYA] Mm! Let's survive
this together. No regrets!

437
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,406
[YUTO, AYA laugh]

438
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,240
[MIKI]
Oh, no!

439
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,450
[YUTO, AYA, MIDORI]
Hm?

440
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,202
Sorry. I got...

441
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,954
...the volcano!

442
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,587
[MIDORI]
Well. That's the end of that.

443
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,174
[AYA]
I came in last place.

444
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,301
I think we tied.

445
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,304
[MIKI]
Um. Midori?

446
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,723
Perhaps I should've
held back a bit.

447
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,476
[laughs]

448
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,810
You nailed it!

449
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,022
Just like a festival.
We laughed and got excited.

450
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,983
We even had some fireworks
at the end of it all!

451
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,485
[AYA]
Uh... Wait, so...

452
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,986
Did you enjoy the game?

453
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:23,574
Yeah. It was fun! 100%!

454
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,327
There's much more to these
board games than meets the eye.

455
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,745
I was pleasantly surprised.

456
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,955
Well. I have to agree,

457
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:30,831
Mr. President.

458
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:31,957
[gasps]

459
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,585
So you noticed, too.
Should've known.

460
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,796
Say what? What's going on?

461
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,881
You knew? From the get‐go?

462
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,007
Indeed I did.

463
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,259
We attend the same
school after all.

464
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,220
Got anymore games
like The Island?

465
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,139
Sure! This store is
chockfull of them!

466
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,224
Just take your pick.

467
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,810
Ha! I might have to.

468
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,355
Gonna be a fun festival!
No doubt about it!

469
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,900
[MIKI] The following day,
the president overturned

470
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,402
his second in command's
decision to deny us,

471
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,571
and our proposal for
a Board Game Café

472
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,448
was officially approved.

473
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,741
[YUTO]
Just so you know,

474
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,327
I expect you three
to give this your all.

00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,843
I went to another
board game café‐‐

00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,219
one that was near school.

481
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,847
And I met this super‐duper‐
fan‐flipping‐tastically‐

00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,641
mega‐awesome cute girl there!
