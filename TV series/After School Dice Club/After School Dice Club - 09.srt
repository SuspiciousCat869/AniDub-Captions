[MIKI]
After the school festival,

2
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,514
it was time for midterm exams.

3
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,183
We decided it would be best
to postpone any game‐playing

4
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:19,770
so we could concentrate
on studying.

5
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,480
Luckily the hiatus
was short‐lived

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,358
since exams came and went
in the blink of an eye.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,401
[STUDENTS sigh]

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,489
[AYA sighs] It's been a hot
minute since I could relax.

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,990
[MIKI]
I'm with you there!

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,785
If you're relieved, just
think how Emmy must feel.

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,870
She took all those
tests in Japanese!

12
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,872
Where'd you learn how
to speak it so well?

13
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,000
I was taught by my grandmother
after I moved over here.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,419
She's Japanese.
I learned from the best!

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,337
Wait.

16
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,673
How long have you
lived in Japan again?

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,508
It's been four years!

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,135
But I moved to Kyoto when
my papa finally opened

19
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,805
his board game shop.
The rest is history!

20
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,390
That makes sense to me.

21
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,935
Now that I'm thinking about it,
where exactly is your game shop?

22
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,436
[MIDORI]
It's right here.

23
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,481
[EMILIA] Uh. I don't think
I know where that is.

24
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,400
[MIDORI] Considering how new
you are to the area,

25
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,568
that's understandable.

26
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,860
But you know,

27
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,405
Kyoto streets aren't all
that hard to remember.

28
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,782
They all just so happen
to cross at right angles,

29
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,534
which is similar to a <i>Go</i> board.

30
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,202
If you know which
direction north is,

31
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,621
you'll always be able
to find your way.

32
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,622
A "<i>Go</i> board"?

33
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,623
You're overthinking.

34
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,500
She's talking about
the game board in <i>Go.</i>

35
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,461
Oh! <i>Ja!</i> I know <i>Go</i>!

36
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,548
At least the title.
The rules are another story.

37
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,258
But that still helped me get it.

38
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,176
I should be able
to read that map now.

39
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:37,222
It looks like Midori's shop is
north of our current location.

40
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,016
So it's this way!

41
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,392
That's west, not north.

42
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,560
[laughs]

43
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,436
Wow.

44
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,562
I wonder...

45
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,689
Is Emmy...?

46
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,899
[GIRLS]
Directionally challenged?

47
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,580
[AYA]
Howdy‐ho!

48
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,416
All together as usual, I see.

49
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,711
Wow. This shop is
unbelievably cute!

50
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,170
[TAKERU]
Hm? Who is this?

51
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,298
She's our friend, Emmy!
Born and raised in Germany!

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,092
Oh, wow. You don't say.

53
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,011
Nice to meet you. I'm Emilia.

54
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,139
This might be small
and underwhelming

55
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,058
to someone from Germany,
but I hope you still enjoy it.

56
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,561
Nein! There's no need
to be so modest.

57
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,147
I'm honestly just
happy to be here!

58
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:54,568
This whole place
fascinates me!

59
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,737
<i>Elfenland!</i>

60
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,238
What's an "Elfenland"?

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,573
It's been ages.

62
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,617
This was a game I used to play
a lot back in Germany.

63
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,370
Only I think the box
got a little smaller.

64
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,205
[TAKERU] It did.
But the board and pieces

65
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,166
remain the same as
they always were.

66
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,542
Care to play and see
for yourself?

67
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,585
[MIKI, AYA, EMILIA gasp]

68
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,045
Is that really okay?

69
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,213
[AYA]
Cool!

70
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,840
[MIKI]
The board is so pretty!

71
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,843
You're reacting like I did
the first time I played it.

72
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,845
You might wanna
brace yourselves.

73
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,680
We're about to embark
on an adventure

74
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:24,931
through a fantasy world,

75
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,934
that happens to be inhabited
by trolls and elves.

76
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,478
See this little boot here?

77
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,354
It represents your
current location.

78
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,565
And, as you travel
around the board,

79
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,984
you recover these markers
from every town.

80
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,653
Yay! Traveling is
one of my favorites!

81
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,281
So to move, you use
these "vehicle tiles"

82
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,783
as well as these cards.

83
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,826
Tiles and cards each
have an illustration of

84
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,787
a vehicle depicted on them.

85
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,829
At the start of the game,

86
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,665
each player receives
eight cards and four tiles.

87
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,250
No more, no less.

88
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,293
Okay.

89
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,505
So players take turns placing
a tile on the individual roads

90
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,256
at the beginning of each round.

91
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,301
This decides which vehicle
can travel that path.

92
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,221
The important thing to make
note of here is the terrain.

93
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,180
Why?

94
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,723
[MIDORI]
Because there're five types.

95
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:11,228
Grassland, Forest, Desert,
Mountain, and River.

96
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,437
Depending on the terrain,

97
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,440
a vehicle may or
may not be supported.

98
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,776
[EMILIA] Boars can only go
on grasslands and forests,

99
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,445
while unicorns can go
everywhere but two terrains.

100
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,781
Even dragons‐‐one of the
more versatile vehicles‐‐

101
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,407
are barred from rivers.

102
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,493
[MIKI] What do these
ones and twos mean?

103
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,329
Those show the number of cards
it would cost to travel.

104
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,163
[MIKI]
Cost?

105
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,289
For instance,

106
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,252
if there's a boar tile on a
grassland road, the cost is one.

107
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,379
So you pay one card.

108
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,881
If you traverse a
desert via unicorn,

109
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,467
you pay the cost of
two unicorn cards.

110
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,593
I see!

111
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,137
Can you not travel if you
don't have the right cards?

112
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,889
Nope. In that case,

113
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,351
you can pay any three cards you
like and still be good to go.

114
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,186
This is known as a Caravan.

115
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,856
But, only use Caravans
as a last resort

116
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,358
since that kind of
strategy is so wasteful.

117
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,569
[MIDORI] The round ends
one of three ways.

118
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,780
You run out of cards,
you can't play your cards,

119
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,991
or you just don't
want to play them.

120
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,827
Before the next round
can start, you select tiles

121
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,038
and draw until you once again
have eight cards in your hand.

122
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,874
The player who picks
up the most markers

123
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,626
at the end of four rounds
is dubbed the winner.

124
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,503
And that's all there is to it!

125
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,505
Thank you!
I think I understand!

126
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,631
This sounds like fun!

127
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,508
Well, shall we get started then?

128
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,010
Yeah!

129
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,599
[AYA cheers]

130
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,268
[MIKI laughs]

131
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,437
[MIDORI laughing]

132
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,022
[EMILIA laughs]

133
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,317
[MIDORI]
That's the end of round one!

134
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,152
This game is great!

135
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,446
It feels like I'm really
traveling the world!

136
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,280
[MIKI]
Mm‐hm!

137
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,407
Come on, let's keep
this adventure going!

138
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,951
You bet! There's three
more rounds to go!

139
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,454
Let's visit as many
towns as possible!

140
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,289
[AYA]
You know it!

141
00:06:55,707 --> 00:07:00,337
Huh?! That was supposed to be
my unicorn mountain pass.

142
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,922
Uh. Nice move there.

143
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,131
[EMILIA chuckles]

144
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,927
[AYA]
Hm...? Oh, yeah!

145
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,055
[AYA laughing]

146
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,268
[MIKI]
I can't go on.

147
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,938
But there are still four
of my markers on the board.

148
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,982
Same for me.
But check Midori out.

149
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,027
That a girl!
She got all but two!

150
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,905
So close yet so far
from domination.

151
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,407
After Emmy goes,
the game'll be over.

152
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,493
Right! Then here I go!

153
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,537
How about one with a troll,
two with the elves, three with

154
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,457
a boar, four with a dragon,
five for another dragon,

155
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,293
and I'll pay a Caravan
of cards to make six!

156
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,419
[BOTH gasp]

157
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,587
[AYA]
Whoa, Emmy!

158
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,839
You got all of your markers!

159
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,425
Ha! <i>Ja,</i> I'd say
that went all right.

160
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,843
What a finale.

161
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,428
It appears your
sense of direction

162
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,389
doesn't apply to games.

163
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,355
[JOHANN] Wow, Emmy!
You snagged all of them again!

164
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,608
Your sense of direction in
games is great! Lucky you.

165
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,653
And yet she still gets lost
in her own neighborhood.

166
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,655
That is true.

167
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,533
Emmy.

168
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,160
Are you really going
to Japan next week?

169
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,286
[EMILIA]
<i>Ja.</i>

170
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,997
We're going to miss you.

171
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,499
We'll still be your friends
no matter where you wind up.

172
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,959
[gasps]

173
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,294
Just don't forget us.
Sound like a plan?

174
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,130
There's always email, right?

175
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,924
Oh, Hans. Johann.

176
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,803
I won't forget you all.

177
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,471
I promise you that.

178
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,681
[ANNA]
Liar!

179
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,099
Anna...

180
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,393
You're such a liar!

181
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,187
Oh, no!

182
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,939
Hey. Why the tears?

183
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,400
It's because you made fun
of her sense of direction!

184
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,610
What?! Wait! That's not it!

185
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,238
Really, I'm not crying
because of that.

186
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,616
I just happened to
remember something.

187
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,202
<i>Elfenland</i> was the very
last game I played

188
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,371
with my friends in Germany.

189
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:02,959
I couldn't keep a promise
I made with those friends.

190
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,128
A promise that would
make you cry?

191
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,842
[EMILIA] Mm. Anna. She was
my closest friend back then.

192
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,761
The two of us grew up together,

193
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,555
and we loved games
wholeheartedly.

194
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,849
We loved them so much that

195
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,644
we both promised we'd make
a game together one day.

196
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,397
[gasps]

197
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,940
Distance can be tough,

198
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,902
but I hope it doesn't spoil
the promise we made.

199
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,613
Even if we have to achieve
our dreams separately.

200
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,739
[MIDORI]
Your dream?

201
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,282
Well, you see.

202
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,494
I would like to design
a game of my very own.

203
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,622
And make children all over
the world smile because of it!

204
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,498
[MIDORI gasps]

205
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,333
[MIDORI]
She has the same dream I do?

206
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,709
That's so fitting!

207
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,212
Another gamer‐turned‐
game‐author in the group!

208
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,047
You and Midori should‐‐

209
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,633
[AYA whimpers]
Not kill me!

210
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,259
Are you all right?

211
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,261
You look disgruntled. <i>Ja?</i>

212
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,722
Uh! It's nothing!

213
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,890
[chuckles nervously]

214
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,101
I just completely forgot
I had something important

215
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,519
I needed to do today.

216
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,895
[GIRLS]
Huh?

217
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,732
Better go before I forget again!

218
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,484
[AYA]
That was weird.

219
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,111
Such a shame.

220
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,781
She'll be a fledgling
for longer than I thought.

221
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,493
[MIKI]
Midori...

222
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:22,122
So Midori is also aiming
to be a game designer, <i>ja</i>?

223
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,957
Who told you a secret like that?

224
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,750
Well, from her!

225
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,129
That's when my dream
first formed.

226
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,340
It made me so happy
to hear someone in Japan

227
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,384
say she had the
same dream as me.

228
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,844
I can see why!

229
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,097
<i>Ja,</i> but... I don't think
Midori feels like I do.

230
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,516
I thought it might be nice
to talk with a person

231
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,434
who had the same dream.

232
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,896
Emmy.

233
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:47,814
I, um...

234
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,316
I need to talk to you
two about something.

235
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,484
[BOTH]
Hm?

236
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,999
[MIDORI]
Emmy wants to make games?

237
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,668
She grew up in
the culture's capital.

238
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,171
What would she come up with?

239
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,966
It would be nothing short of
amazing‐‐it's Emmy, after all.

240
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,387
I know I would want to play
it just like everyone else.

241
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,055
But what if her game
turns out to be

242
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,766
a million times
better than mine?

243
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,060
I'm afraid of a game that
doesn't even exist yet

244
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,563
thanks to my stupid pride!

245
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,564
[GEORGE]
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,857
[MIDORI gasps]

247
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,484
You are not a game designer.

248
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,280
[MIDORI] Shut up!
You think I don't know that?

249
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,450
I know it better than anyone.

250
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,703
[MIDORI] Huh? Stuff we
did when we were younger?

251
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,413
<i>Ja!</i> I would like to learn

252
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,291
whatever traditional games
Japanese children play.

253
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,292
Wow.

254
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,252
And that sort of thing
actually interests you?

255
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,005
We refer to fun things like
playtime and board games

256
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,757
as "Spiel" in Germany.

257
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,426
The key word in that sentence
being fun, of course.

258
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,136
And exploring Japanese Spiel

259
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,555
might provide a hint
for making games.

260
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,433
Huh... Games we played as kids.

261
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,810
Would things like tag or
hide 'n' seek count?

262
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,813
I don't think those are
authentic Japanese games.

263
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,274
Like Daruma‐Doll Fell Down?

264
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,360
‐‐Oh!
‐‐There we go!

265
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,487
We've got a game,
but how does it go?

266
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,864
Let's explain it by
trying it out right now!

267
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,115
Great!

268
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,745
[MIDORI]
So, basically the rules are...

269
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,664
Truth be told,
I haven't actually

270
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,998
played this game that much.

271
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,416
I'll take over then.

272
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,043
[EMILIA]
If you could please, Miki!

273
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,170
When playing
Daruma‐Doll Fell Down,

274
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,381
you first need to pick
someone to be the Oni.

275
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,758
I don't think I know
what that word means.

276
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,677
It's a Japanese monster!

277
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,264
Real big and scary, with two
sharp horns that look like this!

278
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,098
Ooh!

279
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,725
We'll play rock‐paper‐scissors
to decide the Oni.

280
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,397
And then, the Oni will
go over to that tree.

281
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,731
I'll make a mark here.

282
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,984
That's where
everyone else starts.

283
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,695
So then... Let's get
back to the Oni!

284
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,321
She hides her face and chants

285
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,741
"Daruma‐Doll Fell Down,"
while everyone approaches.

286
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,910
Daruma‐Doll fell... down!

287
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,621
The moment the Oni finishes
saying this and turns around,

288
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,498
everyone else has to
freeze where they are.

289
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,459
So long as the Oni is looking,
no one can move.

290
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,461
Try really hard to stay still.

291
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,588
Because if you don't,
you get captured.

292
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,717
Oh, no! What happens
if you get captured?

293
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,385
[MIKI] You have to hold
hands with the Oni

294
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,804
and wait for someone
to come to your rescue.

295
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,848
Performing a rescue
is a lot easier

296
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,599
than you might initially think.

297
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,351
Just touch the Oni
while she's chanting,

298
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,894
and you've freed the prisoner.

299
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,062
[MIKI]
Daruma‐Doll...

300
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:33,980
[AYA]
Tag!

301
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,273
[MIKI]
One, two, three, four, five!

302
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,817
Once tagged, the Oni
has to count to ten.

303
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,778
The other players then use that
short timeframe to run away.

304
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,239
Get as far from the Oni
as you possibly can.

305
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,365
[MIKI]
Stop!

306
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,076
[MIKI] When the Oni says stop,
you do just that.

307
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,704
Right. I think I'm
remembering now.

308
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,831
From here, I think
the rules tend to vary

309
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,333
depending on the
region you're in.

310
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,002
Like how the one who touched
the Oni decides the steps.

311
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,045
[EMILIA]
Steps?

312
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,673
[MIKI] Like five big steps,
or maybe ten small ones.

313
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,133
[AYA]
Five big steps!

314
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,218
[MIKI] If the Oni can't touch
anyone after the steps

315
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,972
are taken, she's "it" again.
Lastly, if the Oni is touched

316
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,391
before she manages
to capture a prisoner,

317
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,935
then that would also
result in a rematch.

318
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,146
And that is everything
in a nutshell.

319
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,689
<i>Danke schon!</i>

320
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,566
I'm kind of fascinated.

321
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,693
I have heard of games
like this before,

322
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,445
but they were European versions!

323
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,071
[MIKI]
Huh?

324
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,616
So there's Ox on the Mountain.
That's the German one.

325
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,494
I think Red Light,
Green Light is England.

326
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,579
Both involve approaching
and tagging a player

327
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,414
while that person's
back is turned.

328
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,540
I never knew!

329
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,834
I assumed it was
a Japanese game.

330
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,213
There are some details that make
yours its own unique version.

331
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,465
And it seems a
little more complex.

332
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,467
So what are we waiting for?

333
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,886
[AYA]
Not a thing!

334
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,096
[MIKI]
Ready when you are!

335
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,432
[AYA]
Start! Just one step!

336
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:56,771
[MIKI]
Daruma‐doll... fell down!

337
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:04,070
[MIKI
Daruma‐doll... fell down!

338
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,696
Ah! Midori moved!

339
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,698
[MIDORI]
What? Are you sure about that?

340
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,617
[MIKI]
Mm‐hm. Your left arm!

341
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,744
Don't stress it, Midori!

342
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,080
Your rescue team is coming!

343
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,373
Take my hand.

344
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,666
[gasps]

345
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,753
All right! Here we go!

346

[MIKI]
Daruma‐doll... fell‐‐

347
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,298
[AYA]
Tag! Run!

348
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,008
[MIKI] One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

349
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,885
eight, nine, ten! Stop!

350
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,389
[MIKI] Aya, were you
the one who tagged me?

351
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,348
[AYA]
You got it!

352
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,308
[MIKI]
How many steps can I take?

353
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,436
How 'bout three big ones!

354
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,397
[MIKI]
What? Just three?

355
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,901
One, two, three!

356
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,611
[MIDORI]
Well, naturally.

357
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,531
They may have been big, but
three steps isn't that far.

358
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,699
That's cheating, Aya

359
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,409
Uh? My bad.

360
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,328
I thought I got to decide
whatever I wanted.

361
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,039
It is kind of odd that the
person who tagged the Oni

362
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,375
gets to decide how
the steps are taken.

363
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,254
Let's enforce a minimum number.
Maybe between ten and fifteen?

364
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,257
I think some other regions
already play that way.

365
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,050
So what did you think, Emmy?

366
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,844
Was this a good
enough game for you?

367
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,429
Did it help you
figure anything out?

368
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,973
[EMILIA]
Hmm. Hard to say.

369
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,642
I do have a few
questions, though.

370
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,604
Like, exactly how does
this sort of game end?

371
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,855
I don't know.

372
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,232
I honestly don't
think it has one.

373
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,068
Whenever the bell rings and
everyone goes inside, I guess.

374
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,654
If you really stop and
think about it for a second,

375
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,866
a lot of children's games
go on forever like that.

376
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,827
Just look at tag
or hide and seek.

377
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,538
Das ist true. No ending.

378
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,624
Is something wrong, Emmy?

379
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,543
[EMILIA] I'm fine, but these
rules are certainly not.

380
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,046
That's because they were
designed to amuse children.

381
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,798
We're used to the innovative
rules of modern games.

382
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,218
I refuse to believe
that's the case!

383
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,802
All games can be fun.

384
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,680
No matter who's playing
or what age they are!

385
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,182
Our new mission for today:

386
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,393
Find ways to make Daruma‐Doll
Fell Down more interesting!

387
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,437
Is that something we can do?

388
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,231
Where would we begin?

389
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,068
Well, we could start with one
of the problems that I noticed,

390
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,197
which was this game doesn't have
any kind of a reward system.

391
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,448
[gasps]

392
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,325
Rewards?

393
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,119
[EMILIA] As of right now, the
rules state the other players

394
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,913
have to try and touch the Oni.

395
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,291
But all that tagging the Oni
does is begin another round.

396
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,251
[EMILIA]
Go again?

397
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,418
[AYA, MIKI, MIDORI]
Hmm...

398
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,087
[EMILIA]
You just repeat the same thing.

399
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,005
There's no incentive at all!

400
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,049
Also, the capture‐and‐
rescue mechanic

401
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,093
could use some work,
too. Think about it.

402
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,094
[AYA]
Tag!

403
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,470
[EMILIA]
Stop!

404
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,848
The one who touched the Oni
is at a clear disadvantage.

405
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,101
You see, the players face risks

406
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,645
but aren't given any
incentive or reward.

407
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,065
There should be some kind of
motivation to touch the Oni.

408
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,441
Yeah!

409
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,070
[MIKI] I've never even
thought of it that way.

410
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,865
[MIDORI] You're kidding me.
All that from just one round?

411
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,702
It's an easy fix. If we think
of some sort of ending

412
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,162
and a reward, we'll be set!

413
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,331
Like if a player manages
to touch the Oni,

414
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,834
she could receive one point!

415
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,086
On the other hand, if the
Oni can reach a player

416
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,798
within the given number of
steps, then she gets a point!

417
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,093
Another thing. Why don't we
take turns being the Oni?

418
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,136
The game could end after

419
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,722
everyone has been
the Oni one time each.

420
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,850
And the player who accumulates
the most points is the winner!

421
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,352
Is that really enough to
make this game more fun?

422
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,354
The changes aren't very drastic.

423
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:29,025
<i>Ja.</i> Well... We have to test
it out to know for sure!

424
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,946
Here I go!

425
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,781

Okay!

426
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,699
[EMILIA]
The Daruma...

427
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,117
[AYA]
Gotta tag her.

428
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,744
[MIDORI]
For one point.

429
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,121
[MIKI] Huh? It feels
different from before.

430

Aw, dang it!

436
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,679
[MIDORI] Implementing a point
system makes the players

437
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,140
want to compete to
reach the Oni first!

438
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,185
As a result, we're moving
faster, which makes stopping

439
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,730
more difficult and
capturing us much easier.

440
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,943
[EMILIA]
The Daruma‐doll fell down!

441
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,112
Oh! You two are
doing much better

442
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,989
than I thought you would!

443
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,658
[MIDORI]
Impressive, Emmy.

444
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:23,120
The changes you made were small,
but they had a powerful impact.

445
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,083

474
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,992
then transformed
into chess and shogi.

475
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,368
Games constantly evolve,

476
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,455
and then new games emerge
thanks to that progress!

477
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,124
They're continuously improving.

478
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,960
I think that this concept is
very important for aspiring

479
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,839
game designers such as ourselves
to understand, <i>ja,</i> Midori.

480
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,800
You're right. It is
very impor‐‐ Wait what?

481
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,136
You, but... How did you know?

482
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,388
Of course! You two told her!

483
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,807
Nuh‐uh! She knew about
it from the beginning!

484
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:07,516
[MIDORI]
What?

485
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,935
She's been wanting to talk to
you about your shared passion

486
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,189
for game designing. She just
hasn't had the chance to.

487
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,483
[EMILIA] But Miki had
an even better idea!

488
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,650
Huh?

489
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,068
Leave it to me!

490
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,030
We'll fight fire with fire
and spiel with spiel!

491
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,824
If games are the problem,
we'll make them the solution!

492
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,409
‐‐[AYA] Huh?
‐‐But how?

493
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,827
What are you planning?

494
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,580
You'll just have to
find out tomorrow!

495
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,209
Ah. I was super curious
about what you meant by

496
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,252
all that and what was
gonna happen today,

497
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,339
but I guess I forgot because
it wound up being so fun!

498
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,423
I liked it a lot!

499
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,509
[MIDORI] This whole Daruma‐Doll
thing was because

500
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,096
I couldn't open up and tell
Emmy we have the same dream?

501
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,766
You guys. You're so nosey!

502
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,143
Are you mad at us?

503
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,561
Not one bit.

504
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,021
Heh!

505
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,650
[MIDORI] I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner, Emmy.

506
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,946
More than anything, I want
to become a game designer.

507
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:06,033
Maybe you could try my game out,
if you had time, that is.

508
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,785
[BOTH laugh]

509
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:12,289
I'd love to! I can't wait
to play! It'll be great!

510
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,800
[AYA]
Ugh! I hate you, Dad!

511
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,761
You told me you were going
to the Christmas party,

512
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,429
but then you broke your promise!

513
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,682
I won't forgive you, even
if you play games with me!
