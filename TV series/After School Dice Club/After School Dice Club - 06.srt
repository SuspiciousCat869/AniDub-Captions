1
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,934
[PATRONS chattering]

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,436
[EMILIA] There! I believe
that makes me the winner!

3
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,438
Indeed it does, Emilia.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,191
Since when did you become
such a top‐notch player?

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:27,903
Am I? Or did you
just get weaker, Papa?

6
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,364
That might be a possibility.

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,158
Truth be told, I never
would've guessed Japan,

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,577
of all countries,
had game cafes like this.

9
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,205
[EMILIA] Yeah, and I'm
so very glad it does.

10
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,165
But you know something else?

11
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,793
There's something else that
makes me even happier.

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,294
[CLAUS]
Oh? What is it?

13
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,337
Like minds!

14
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,007
I think Japan has girls my age
who also love board games!

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,009
It sounded so enticing!

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,096
That's when my dream first
formed in my mind!

17
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:54,972
[EMILIA grunts]

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,808
I will become a game
author one day!

19
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,686
Huh. Don't hear
that every day.

20
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,771
[EMILIA]
I know, right?

21
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,775
[BARTENDER] It's pretty rare to
see someone accompany you.

22
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,151
He a friend of yours?

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,530
A term like "friends" is a bit
too strong to define us.

24
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,033
I guess you could say the two of
us are stuck with each other.

25
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,411
I'm sensing you guys
go way back, right?

26
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,912
Something like that, yeah.

27
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,833
We first met in Okinawa, which
was how many years ago now?

28
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,836
[GEORGE] It's been 15 years
since we were in the same camp.

29
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,462
Gettin' a little senile there?

30
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,090
Huh? I know you didn't
just say that, ya jerk.

31
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,508
[BARTENDER chuckles nervously]

32
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,844
[GEORGE] Nice to see you're
as polite as you ever were.

33
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,137
[TAKERU]
I try.

34
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,222
Is this the kind of respect
you show to the person

35
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,683
who first introduced
you to board games?

36
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,060
Or did that slip your
aging mind, too?

37
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:42,936
[growls]

38
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,814
I suspected you might
be a game buddy of his.

39
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,816
So, have seen the Saikoro Club?

40
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,402
[GEORGE] Saikoro Club?
I can't say that I have.

41
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,862
It's the name of my store.

42
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,904
[GEORGE]
I'm sorry, what?

43
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,198
I run a board game
shop these days.

44
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,700
[GEORGE]
That's news to me!

45
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,619
Because I've never told you.

46
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,955
Well, there's nothing that would
strike your interest in there.

47
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,208
Don't worry. I wasn't
interested to begin with.

48
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,544
Not the best business prospect.

49
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,962
Come again?

50
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,840
[GEORGE] Board games don't
make any money in Japan.

51
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,841
[gasps]

52
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,636
[GEORGE] Titles that become best
sellers in Germany are lucky

53
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,889
if they can even find a shelf
to collect dust on here.

54
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,142
The board game craze just
never caught on in Japan.

55
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,144
But you must know
all about that.

56
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,562
I guess.

57
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:29,232
[GEORGE] Frankly, I don't rely
on the Japanese market one bit.

58
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,776
Is that a fact?

59
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,987
Of course. I do some
business in Japan.

60
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,658
But there's nothin' here that
merits my actual presence.

61
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,494
Wow. I'd ask if you could
get any more annoying,

62
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,038
but I already know the answer.

63
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,374
You weren't just spouting
nonsense just now.

64
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,875
The bright lights
of digital games

65
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,087
captivated the minds of this
country, and‐‐as a result‐‐

66
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,047
boards games were
relegated to the shadows

67
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,132
those same lights cast.

68
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,677
But the Japanese are
starting to learn.

69
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,345
More and more people
are catching on

70
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,889
to this incredible culture.

71
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,643
Listen here. Board games
aren't a lost cause in Japan.

72
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,063
My shop sells well, and also
we've got great designers.

73
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,650
[GEORGE] Heh! "A rising
market." You don't say.

74
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,152
[TAKERU] That's right. You'd
better remember that, George.

75
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,988
[BARTENDER]
Huh? What? No way!

76
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,535
If your name's George,
could you be <i>that</i> George?

77
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,550
[MIKI] Aya, Midori,
and I are back in Kyoto

78
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,345
after our short but sweet
vacation to Kanazawa,

79
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,556
and there's plenty of summer
break left for us to enjoy.

80
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,059
Today, the hot topic
for conversation

81
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,685
just so happens to be...

82
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,437
Huh? Playtesting?

83
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,607
Midori. Does that mean you
finished making your game?

84
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,608
[MIDORI]
Mm‐mm.

85
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,069
It's still in the
prototype stages.

86
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,571
I'd like to show it to my
manager and get his feedback,

87
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,657
then maybe make
some adjustments.

88
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,451
But I suppose it is coming
along, somewhat.

89
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,119
[MIKI, AYA laugh]

90
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,371
Is that true?

91
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,372
It is.

92
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,374
Awesome! I'd love to play!

93
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,835
Pretty please, with some
sugar and a cherry on top?

94
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,295
No. Not just yet.
It's incomplete.

95
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,047
You can't tease us like that!

96
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,715
Miki wants to try it, don't you?

97
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,175
Uh. I would.

98
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,094
C'mon! We both have
our hopes up!

99
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,596
Just let us play
one little game.

100
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,306
[MIDORI]
What part of "no" don't you get?

101
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,433
[AYA gasps]

102
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,312
Uh. I'm sorry. It's just...

103
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,608
I don't feel comfortable showing
it to people the way it is now.

104
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,943
[AYA, MIKI]
Uh.

105
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,159
[MIDORI]
So what do you think, boss?

106
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,120
[TAKERU]
Hmm.

107
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,330
Tell me, am I the first,

108
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,666
or have you let others try
their hand at your game?

109
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,418
[gasps]

110
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,794
Of course not.

111
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,629
Why would I let
other people play?

112
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,590
It's still just a prototype.

113
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,884
I see. Just as I thought.

114
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,468
[MIDORI]
And that thought was...?

115
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,303
[TAKERU]
Hm...

116
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,847
Cut the silent treatment!
Please, Boss.

117
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,640
[TAKERU grunts]

118
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,392
[MIDORI]
Out with it!

119
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,853
As you wish. This game‐‐

120
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,896
[knocking]

121
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,234
I apologize.
We're closed for the day.

122
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,068
Huh?!

123
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,612
Am I interrupting?

124
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,947
Depends. What are you
doing here, George?

125
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,533
Oh. Is this someone you know?

126
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,660
So this is your
little game shop.

127
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,788
I thought my "little game shop"
wasn't of any interest to you.

128
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,290
I changed my mind.

129
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,460
I figured I should at least
check it out, since I'm here.

130
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,463
Hmm? That some kind
of new game you got?

131
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,506
Let me take a whack at it.

132
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,842
I'm sorry, but it's
still in development.

133
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:06,927
[GEORGE]
Is it now?

134
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,054
Does that make you
this game's designer?

135
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,306
That's right. This is my game.

136
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,223
[GEORGE]
What's your name?

137
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,726
Who is this gentleman?
You never said.

138
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,102
Oh yeah, I suppose I didn't‐‐

139
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,312
[GEORGE]
My apologies.

140
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,065
It was rude of me not to
introduce myself first.

141
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,026
If you've heard of Bad Dwarf,
you may have heard of me.

142
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,196
I'm George Beresford, game
designer and representative.

143
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,365
What? You're from Bad Dwarf?

144
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,658
So that would mean...

145
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,118
Yep. It seems like you've
done your research.

146
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,536
Of course you would
know who someone

147
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,579
like this idiot is, Midori.

148
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,040
[MIDORI] You can't call
someone like him an idiot!

149
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:37,874
What?!

150
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,043
[MIDORI] This is Bad Dwarf
we're talking about!

151
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,587
The famous new game brand
from the United States!

152
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,966
Their games are top‐notch, and
rightfully rated so by critics.

153
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,801
[GEORGE]
Hmph! True.

154
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,427
But I still don't
know your name.

155
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,263
Right. My name is Midori Ono.

156
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,515
[GEORGE]
Well, Midori.

157
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,267
Why did you create a game you
don't intend for people to play?

158
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,062
I didn't. That's not
my intention.

159
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,063
It's just that...

160
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,440
It should be finished
before people play it.

161
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,985
My game isn't quite where
I want it to be yet.

162
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,529
[GEORGE] But were you not just
playing your game with Takeru?

163
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,114
Seems pretty ready to me.

164
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,574
[MIDORI]
Well, that's because...

165
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,369
[MIDORI]
This is a big opportunity, sure.

166
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,829
However...

167
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,831
You are allowed
to say no to him.

168
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,416
He's a big boy who
can handle it,

169
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,167
and you don't owe him
a single thing.

170
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,336
Midori. Why hesitate?

171
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,462
Are you afraid?

172
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,714
[MIDORI]
What?

173
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,589
That's it.

174
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,133
You're afraid someone
will play your game

175
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,135
and tell you how boring it is.

176
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,177
Am I wrong?

177
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,012
[MIDORI]
No. That's not it.

178
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,472
Lay off her, will ya?

179
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,391
[GEORGE]
Hmph. Fair enough.

180
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,934
‐‐You know...
‐‐[MIDORI] Huh?

181
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,061
To be honest, the last
thing I would've expected

182
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,189
to find in Japan was a young
game designer like you.

183
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,817
I was curious. I wanted
to know what sort of game

184
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,778
someone from a country like
yours would create.

185
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,113
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,073
What are you sorry for?

187
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,034
You are not a game designer.

188
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,452
[MIDORI gasps]

189
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,954
[GEORGE] If you were,
you'd be begging people

190
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,999
to play your game‐‐nothing
would make you happier!

191
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,709
[TAKERU]
Watch it, George!

192
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,961
[MIDORI]
Why? Why should I let someone

193
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,339
who I met less than five minutes
ago talk down to me like that?!

194
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,967
I may not know you,
but I do know games.

195
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,928
All games need to be played.

196
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,556
I told you that my game is
still a work in progress!

197
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,725
The second it's finished,
I'll start recruiting people

198
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,601
to test it out!

199
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,311
[GEORGE]
When, exactly, will that be?

200
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,979
How should I know?

201
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,689
It's done when it's done.

202
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,523
I mean...

203
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,941
I hate to break it to you, kid,

204
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,444
but that game will never
be completed like this.

205
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,320
[gasps]

206
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,654
How can you hope
to go anywhere

207
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,615
if you're trapped inside
your own head?

208
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,991
You'll be old and gray,
and that game

209
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,535
will be just as ready
then as it is now.

210
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,620
Remember this.

211
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,206
It takes more than one
person to build a game.

212
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,624
[MIDORI gasps]

213
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,044
[MIDORI] I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

214
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,337
Uh!

215
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,756
[MIDORI]
No. You're wrong.

216
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,133
A game is a work of art!

217
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:56,054
And that art is created by
one sole author's talent!

218
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,607
[MIDORI] That guy. He puts
the "bad" in Bad Dwarf.

219
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,985
It'll be just as ready when
I'm old and gray, he said?

220
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,780
Well, I'll make him
eat those words.

221
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,841
[MIKI]
Uh. Midori.

222
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,809
[doorbell rings]

223
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,061
[AYA]
Coming! Hello th‐‐

224
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,604
[BOTH yelp]

225
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,276
Your face looks different.
Are you okay?

226
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,986
[MIKI]
You seem exhausted!

227
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,696
I came because

228
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,407
I would like you
to try something.

229
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,575
[AYA, MIKI]
Huh?

230
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,910
Okay, what is it?

231
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,371
It's my, ah...

232
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,539
[MIKI]
"Ah"?

233
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,957
My, ah...

234
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:06,791
[AYA]
Alligator?

235
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,834
[MIDORI]
No!

236
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,877
So then, what?

237
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,379
[MIDORI]
It'd be nice if you could try...

238
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,214
Oh, out with it already!

239
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,675
I worked on my game!
I want you to try it!

240
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,302
[MIKI, AYA]
What?!

241
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,222
But I thought you said it's
an unplayable prototype.

242
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,726
You were like, "What part of
'no' don't you get, huh?"

243
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,477
You pretty much blew a gasket.

244
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,062
You're not wrong...

245
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:32,150
Is there a reason you
decided to rush this?

246
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,278
There is... one reason...

247
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,448
There was this man who came
into the Saikoro Club.

248
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,245
[AYA] Wow. All that stuff
really happened?

249
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,414
So what did you do after that?

250
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,627
[MIDORI exhales] I went home
and pulled an all‐nighter.

251
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,129
It was my hope that the two
of you could playtest this

252
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,631
for me as soon as
humanly possible.

253
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,840
[gasps]

254
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,843
Today we'll be playing
my game: <i>One Room.</i>

255
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,054
You work to make money so
you can afford the furniture

256
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,891
and trinkets needed to comprise
a room of your liking.

257
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,019
[AYA, MIKI] She did it!
She really made a game!

258
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,063
Check out all the furniture!

259
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,274
Did you draw these cards
yourself? They're fantastic!

260
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,026
Yes. I drew them.

261
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,027
Thanks, Miki.

262
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,821
So this game revolves around
interior design, right?

263
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,365
Sounds like fun to me!

264
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,991
[MIKI]
Yeah! It's the type of thing

265
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,743
girls fantasize about, you know?

266
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,578
[sighs]

267
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,081
Okay. Let's go over the rules.

268
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,250
Each player begins
with a "Room Board,"

269
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,460
along with a token
for five gold.

270
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,586
[MIKI]
Why gold?

271
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,964
[MIDORI]
Oh! Gold is the game's currency.

272
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,757
It's used to purchase
your belongings.

273
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,092
[AYA]
Makes sense!

274
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,551
There are two parts to this.

275
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,553
We'll call them phases for now.

276
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,389
First, we have the "Work Phase."

277
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,474
You choose how many hours
of work you want to do

278
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,268
based on the cards available.

279
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,394
Oh.

280
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,355
I haven't had time to make
unique cards for the game yet.

281
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,941
These are just substitutions.

282
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,442
The numbers on
the card represent

283
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,236
the number of hours you put in.

284
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,154
[MIKI]
So a three equals three hours?

285
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:00,989
[MIDORI]
Yes!

286
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,740
Nice, I'm catching on.

287
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,574
[MIDORI] Right.

288
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,286
So the player who starts gets
dibs on the work hours

289
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,455
and then receives money equal
to the number on their card.

290
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,375
If I pick eight,
I receive eight gold pieces?

291
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,334
[MIDORI]
That is correct.

292
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,711
Easy!

293
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,755
Just pick the biggest number and
you'll be rolling in the dough.

294
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,965
You're right.

295
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,594
That strategy would earn you
the most money. However...

296
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,305
Earning the most
doesn't necessarily

297
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,514
give you an advantage.

298
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,309
The player with the highest
card can't go shopping.

299
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,893
Shopping?

300
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,604
[MIDORI] After the "Work Phase"
comes the "Shopping Phase."

301
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,773
During which, you can buy
any of the four pieces

302
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,734
of furniture available
for purchase.

303
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,194
As I mentioned though,
the one who works the longest

304
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,780
is barred from participating
in the shopping phase.

305
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,073
And the player who
works the least

306
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,783
can buy as much as they want.

307
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,036
Provided they have
the proper funds.

308
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,997
I get it! If you clock
out of work early

309
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,041
you have the time to squeeze
in some shopping!

310
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,210
Correct! That was indeed
my logic. So then...

311
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,588
You place your purchased
furniture in your room.

312
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,174
The max number of items
you can buy is 12.

313
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,469
It's over once a player
completely fills their room.

314
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,429
The one who scores
the most points, wins.

315
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,265
How can you tell who
scores the most points?

316
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,808
[MIDORI]
Do you see the colored triangle

317
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,935
at the top right of
each furniture tile?

318
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,312
[AYA]
Uh! I sure do!

319
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,356
[MIDORI] There are four
different colors in this game,

320
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,858
and each of them represents
a specific style.

321
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,069
Pink, for example,
indicates Asian furniture,

322
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,197
while blue is used for Nordic,
and so on and so forth.

323
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,199
The more sets of matching
furniture you have,

324
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,533
the more points you get.

325
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,327
Make your rooms stylish!

326
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,121
You see the numbers on the right
side of your room boards?

327
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,917
Those are how you calculate
all your points for style.

328
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,544
So seven of the same
set equals 28 points!

329
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,963
Right! And having more
than seven won't do you

330
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,424
any good since there are
no additional points.

331
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,301
That's the basic way
to score for furniture.

332
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,512
But keep in mind that you
also get bonus points

333
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,679
for acquiring trinkets!

334
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,597
[BOTH]
Uh?

335
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,515
What are those?

336
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,724
A bonus?

337
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,226
[MIDORI]
The tiles with a gray triangle

338
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,228
on the bottom right
corner are trinkets.

339
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,979
They're not worth much
by themselves,

340
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,107
only granting you
one point apiece.

341
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,359
But if you match them up
with certain other objects,

342
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,985
their point value triples!

343
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,112
For instance.

344
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,363
This lovely little "Cushion"

345
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,532
is worth three points
if you own a "Sofa."

346
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,493
[AYA] Cool! So what are some
other things we can pair?

347
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,412
[MIDORI]
The "Laptop" goes with a "Desk".

348
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,788
And "Books," a "Bookshelf."

349
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,207
[AYA] Oh, neat! There's even
a little board game!

350
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,000
That's gotta pair up
with a table!

351
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,044
[MIDORI] If a piece of
furniture is more expensive,

352
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,172
it'll have a greater number of
possible corresponding trinkets.

353
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,298
Wow!

354
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,592
Seems like you thought
of everything.

355
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,844
Now that you know the rules,

356
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,263
I'm ready to play
whenever you are.

357
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,222
I guess.

358
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,723
[MIKI laughs]

359
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,602
Amazing! It sounds so much fun
I can hardly wait to start!

360
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,063
Me, too! I wanna give it a go!

361
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,815
[MIDORI]
You... do?

362
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,899
[MIDORI]
As I thought.

363
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,318
People can create
games by themselves!

364
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,238
They're built on the designer's
talent and determination!

365
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,365
And I am here to prove it!

366
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,576
Come on. Now I'm in
the mood to decorate!

367
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,410
Yeah!

368
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,455
Oh, right. Well, no time
like the present!

369
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,499
So why don't you start us off,
Aya? Pick your work hours.

370
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,876
'Kay!

371
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,516
[AYA]
Hmm... What should I do?

372
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,186
I've got my heart set on
that board game trinket,

373
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,813
but then I'd have
to get a table, too.

374
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,857
Wait! Eleven gold?!

375
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,358
That table would break my bank!

376
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,861
Why so pricey?
It's just a table!

377
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,362
I had to make it high.

378
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,240
Think of all the trinkets that
tables are able to support.

379
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,450
[AYA grumbles]

380
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,452
I'd like to get a
sofa for my room,

381
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,078
but the right color isn't there.

382
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,954
Be patient!

383
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,540
You don't wanna mess up that
sweet style bonus, right?

384
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,126
Good to see you two have
your eyes on the prize.

385
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,712
And Aya. You've got a
knack for pairing things.

386
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,340
[AYA] Heh! I've totally
got your rules down!

387
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,216
[MIDORI]
Okay!

388
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,718
Looks like it's your turn
to select work hours again.

389
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,513
Well, I might've spent
too much last time.

390
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,682
So to make up for it...
gotta put in some work!

391
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,393
I feel like working nine hours!

392
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,979
And I'll take the four.
The next phase starts

393
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,315
and everyone but Aya gets
to shop till they drop.

394
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,233
How come?

395
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:05,983
[MIDORI]
You're kidding.

396
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,152
You worked the longest shift‐‐
you're stuck at work.

397
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,489
Oh, that's right!
I forgot that part.

398
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,573
That's funny.

399
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,534
Didn't you say you
had the rules down?

400
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,993
[AYA]
Well, you know... Uh...

401
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,162
[MIDORI, MIKI laugh]

402
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,000
[MIDORI]
And that's the end of the game!

403
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,420
Aya got 30 points; 26 for Miki.

404
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,881
And I won with 39.

405
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,258
Nice.

406
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,634
[gasps]

407
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,849
So, um. Feedback time!

408
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,060
How did you two like
playing <i>OneRoom</i>?

409
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,144
[BOTH gasp]

410
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:46,357
Oh, um. It was so much fun!
Go ahead! Tell her!

411
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,233
Yes!

412
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,652
[MIDORI exhales]
Oh, jeez.

413
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,154
They're obviously
just being nice to me.

414
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,283
Listen up, guys! I need you
both to be brutally honest!

415
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,160
I promise I won't get mad!

416
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,038
I can handle it! Just say it!

417
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,540
Okay.

418
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,958
You win.

419
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,837
Um... I don't think "boring"
is the right word to use, but...

420
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,339
Compared to the other games
we've played recently,

421
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,009
it feels like it's missing
something special.

422
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,096
It sounded cool, but got
monotonous when we played it.

423
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,098
[MIDORI]
Monotonous!

424
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,434
The trinkets are all worth
the same amount of points,

425
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,603
it might be nice if they
had differing values.

426
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,771
I had the exact same thought!

427
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,316
And it didn't feel like I was
designing my dream room,

428
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,859
because I was
always worried about

429
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,527
matching things
and getting points.

430
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,403
Preach, girl!

431
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,780
That rule made me pass up
something super cute!

432
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,906
[whimpers]

433
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,782
What else?

434
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,075
I know! Animals!

435
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,368
Animals?!

436
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,788
It wouldn't be my dream room
if it didn't have a pet!

437
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,624
Cats could be worth
seven points!

438
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,334
Oh, but I guess they
might claw up things

439
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,835
like the Asian furniture.

440
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,587
So give them
penalty points, too!

441
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,255
[MIKI]
That sounds like a fun idea!

442
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,549
What about adding some
"chance cards" to the mix?

443
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,635
Keeps you guessing who the
winner will wind up being!

444
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,304
How about a card that makes you
trade furniture with a player?

445
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,722
[MIKI]
You're on a roll, Aya!

446
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,807
Randomly laying out the
game tiles on the board

447
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,017
wasn't very interesting.

448
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,978
I'm with you there.
If we got creative and...

00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,318
Sorry, Midori!
We're just amateurs!

451
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,319
We don't know what we're doing!

She's right!

453
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,322
We just got carried away
with our suggestions.

454
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,449
I know we're way off the mark!

455
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,034
[MIDORI]
Don't be silly.

456
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,118
How could you be off the mark

457
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,537
when everything you
said was a bullseye?

458
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,498
They only played it one time,

459
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,667
but that was all they needed
to point out every flaw

460
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,710
and think of a way
to improve them!

461
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,463
[GEORGE] It takes more than
one person to build a game.

00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,673
[gasps]

463
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,883
Hey. Are you okay?

464
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:36,759
[MIDORI]
Is that all?

00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:37,843
[AYA, MIKI]
Huh?

00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,887
What else you got? Be honest!

Wah! We're sorry, Midori!

468
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,599
I... think we crossed a line!

469
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,477
I want to hear every
suggestion you two have!

470
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,355
[MIDORI] I felt like I'd
given it so much thought.

471
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,692
I put my time, effort, and
energy into finishing this game

472
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,236
with no one but
myself to rely on.

473
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,154
I was certain it was
as close to perfect

474
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,657
as it was ever going
to be. But...

475
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,909
It turns out, as much
as I hate to admit it,

476
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,035
he was right.

477
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,872
My game still has a long way
to go before it's complete.

478
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,832
However...

479
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,750
[MIDORI laughs]

480
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,584
[MIKI, AYA yelp]

481
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,295
We broke Midori!

482
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,715
[MIDORI] That just means
it has the potential

483
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,383
to be so much better!

484
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,304
[TAKERU]
It hurts to say it out loud,

485
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,973
but I'm officially in your debt.

486
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,057
[GEORGE]
Hmm?

487
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,934
[TAKERU]
The incident with Midori.

488
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,394
[GEORGE]
Ah‐ha. That.

489
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,188
I should've been the one who
manned up and set 'er straight.

490
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,107
You saved me from
being the bad guy

491
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,900
and took up the
mantle for yourself.

492
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,194
Heh. You've always
had a soft spot

493
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,320
when it comes to women.

494
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,155
Tch.

495
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,241
But, I did that
because I wanted to.

496
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,202
A game may owe its creation
to a designer's talent.

497
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,788
The girl wasn't wrong
when she spoke about that.

498
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,624
Still, a game cannot
be built alone.

499
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,667
[TAKERU]
Yeah.

500
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,461
[GEORGE] You could be
a prodigy game maker,

501
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,963
but your creations would still
need countless playtests

502
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,215
before they were ever
deemed complete.

503
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,633
All designers know
the importance

504
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,594
of allowing others
to play their games.

505
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,637
It's an essential
part of the craft.

506
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,600
Can't be in this industry if
a little criticism upsets you.

507
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,143
[TAKERU]
Very true.

508
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,436
Time will tell.

509
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,731
She can't get anywhere if she
doesn't take the first step.

510
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,816
Pride, much like
anything in excess,

511
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,318
can be a heck of an inhibitor,

512
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,819
'specially when it
comes to growth.

513
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,154
[TAKERU]
Mm.

514
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,907
Hi, come on i‐‐

515
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,993
[TAKERU]
Huh? What in the world?

516
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,162
Greetings, Mr. Beresford.

517
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,164
It's clear that
you're a professional.

518
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,333
You spoke nothing
but the truth to me.

519
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,293
And I finally realize...

520
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,754
I can't do this by myself.

521
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,714
That was fast.

522
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,717
[MIDORI] Even so, I won't
give up on my dream!

523
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,803
I'm not alone in this endeavor!

524
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,930
I'll be a game author
before you know it!

525
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,433
And my games will bring
joy to people everywhere!

526
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,690
[TAKERU]
She sure is full of surprises.

527
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,318
You must've really
struck a nerve there.

528
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,695
[GEORGE chuckles]

529
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,781
Now it's getting interesting.

530
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,907
[TAKERU]
Hmph!

531
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,408
[BARTENDER]
Heh.

532
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,409
Cheers, buddy.

533
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,411
To a feisty, up‐and‐coming...

534
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,914
[GEORGE]
...fledgling designer!

535
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,176
[MIKI] Maki and I
play a one‐on‐one game.

536
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,387
And we wind up in a rather
deep conversation.

537
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,766
I know that I'm a weakling.
But still...
