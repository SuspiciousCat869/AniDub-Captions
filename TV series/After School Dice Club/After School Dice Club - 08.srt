[MIKI] The school festival
is just one week away.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,056
Coincidentally,
a brand‐new board game café

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,933
opened up near our school.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,018
We decided to check it out
in hopes of learning

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,688
something that might better
prepare us for the festival.

This is it.

There's nobody here.

That seems odd.

00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,081
Perhaps they haven't opened yet.

00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,792
[gasps] Um. I found someone!

[MIDORI, AYA]

She's sleeping?

[AYA] Huh? You remember us from
just passing us on the street?

00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,087
That's right.

You three made quite the
first impression with me.

32
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,676
I happened to overhear your
discussion about board games.

33

[MIDORI]
What a strange coincidence.

Tell us, where do you
come from, Emmy?

I'm from Hamburg, Germany.

What? I am so jealous‐‐
that's board game central!

Unfortunately, the same
cannot be said for Japan.

But that's why
we made this café!

you the owner, right?

It's really remarkable.

You do not mind?

65
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,414
Not at all! We're usually
in need of a fourth.

of this one, too.

77
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,400
The board looks so pretty!

78
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,778
It does! These patterns
are beautiful!

79
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,655
These specific patterns
are called Celtic Knots.

80
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,823
"Celtic Knots"?

81
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,368
The Celts were a people.
Europeans from the BC era.

82
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,829
The stylized knots they
used for decoration

83
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,706
became a symbol
of their culture.

84
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,249
I've heard of Celts before.

85
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,044
They say modern‐day Ireland
was built by them, right?

86
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,380
Correct! Just so happens,
my mama is of Irish decent!

00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,760
Oh! So then...
The necklace you're wearing.

88
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,262
[EMILIA] Good eye!
This is a Celtic charm.

89
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,348
It was a gift from <i>meine Mutter.</i>

90
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,433
This tiny keepsake
holds the great power

00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,143
to make any wish come true.

Oh, wow! It's so lovely!

93
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,855
[MIDORI]
It really is!

94
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,734
[EMILIA]
Okay! Let's go over the rules!

95
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,903
Everyone is going to
start with eight cards

96
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,488
as well as five pieces.

97
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,573
Wow! The cards are
pretty like the board!

98
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,284
The pieces look like
clovers! How cute!

99
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,328
[EMILIA] There are five
different card colors.

100
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,331
When your turn comes,
you play a card.

101
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,042
You then put a piece on a
space with the same color

102
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,961
as the card you just played.

103
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,046
The cards are numbered
from zero to ten.

104
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,548
As you can see.

105
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,051
For your first card, you can put
down any card number you'd like.

106
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,095
However, the next
card's important.

107
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,222
It decides what card
you can play next.

108
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,306
[BOTH gasp]

109
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,934
[EMILIA] Like this! You play
cards that have the same color

110
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,394
on top of one another.

111
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,230
First I had a four,
then I played a six!

112
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,315
Which means the cards
I play from now on

113
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,861
will have to have a
value of six or greater.

114
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,736
On the other hand,

115
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,030
if I had played the
six before the four,

116
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,076
I could only play cards
equal to or less than four.

117
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,370
I gotcha! When you play
cards of the same color,

118
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,247
you can only go up
or down in number!

119
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,456
So no backsies!

120
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,041
<i>Das ist prima!</i>

121
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,252
Also, every time
you play a card,

122
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,462
the piece on the path with
the corresponding color

123
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,840
advances by one space.

124
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,258
There are five paths.

125
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,844
And you can only have
one piece per path.

126
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,263
You may go down
all five if you want.

127
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,307
But notice that the
first three spaces

128
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,933
give you a negative score.

129
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,268
Pick your paths wisely!

130
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,979
Yup, it says negative on
the board, right there!

131
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,231
[EMILIA] Your points are
determined by where your pieces

132
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,650
end up once the
game has finished.

133
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,277
Which would mean...

134
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,530
If we don't play four cards,
we'll be negative in that color.

135
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,700
Also, be careful where you
put your big piece, <i>ja</i>?

136
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,410
It gets double the points.

137
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,453
[BOTH]
Ooh!

138
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,288
Same for negative points.

139
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,332
That's why I told
you to be careful.

140
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,750
[AYA, MIKI]
Uh!

141
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,711
[EMILIA] There are three
types of tiles on the path.

142
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,589
Numbered tiles provide
you with points.

143
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,675
The points received are equal
to the numerals shown.

144
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,928
Clovers grant extra movement.

145
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,181
If you land on this tile,
you can move one more space.

146
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,058
That's not all.
You could move a piece

147
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,935
that didn't land on
the clover instead.

148
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,020
<i>Ja!</i> Precisely right!

149
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,190
You can move lots of spaces
if used strategically.

150
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,651
Please keep that in mind,
as it is important.

151
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,527
[AYA, MIKI]
'Kay...

152
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,446
[EMILIA]
The third and final type of tile

153
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,240
is the Wishing Stone.
There are nine of these total.

154
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,534
This tile is first‐come‐
first‐serve.

155
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,536
That means the person who
lands there first receives

156
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,704
the wishing stone.

157
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,415
Collecting stones is a
good way to earn points,

158
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,168
but if you don't obtain at
least two, you'll lose points.

159
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,504
Huh?! We can lose more points?

160
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,464
[MIKI] Oh, the point
values for wishing stones

161
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,966
are displayed right there.

162
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,969
What? You get negative four
points if you don't have any?

163
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,222
[EMILIA] The darker green area
of the board is the goal zone.

164
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,849
The game is over as soon
as five total pieces

165
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,352
cross into this territory.

166
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,480
And that's how you play
<i>Keltis.</i> Any questions?

167
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,357
Nah, your explanation
was on point!

168
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,901
[EMILIA] <i>Wunderbar!</i>
Let's get started then!

169
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,736
[MIDORI, AYA, MIKI]
Yeah!

170
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,321
And the person who's
been to Ireland

171
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,156
most recently goes first!

172
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:10,949
[MIKI, AYA]
Huh?

173
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,035
Gee, Emmy. You're all
about this Celtic theme.

174
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,537
Maybe dial it back?

175
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,498
Great! I went on a
trip just last year!

176
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,042
What? What kind of
a rule is that?

177
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,212
Well, it's more of a joke
than an actual rule.

178
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,007
But a rule nonetheless,
so I go first.

179
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:31,219
Yellow ten! I think... I'll
use my big piece for this.

180
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,346
‐‐[AYA gasps]
‐‐Isn't it a bit too soon?

181
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,265
Well, I'll follow suit.

182
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,683
[AYA]
Your big piece, too?

183
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,477
I'm just trying to plan
ahead. I'll get pretty far

184
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,771
if I have a lot of cards
that are the same color.

185
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,857
Oh. Good strategy.

186
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,484
But... my colors are
all over the place.

187
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,487
I'll stick with a small piece
and play it safe for now.

188
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,322
Same here.

189
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,458
No way! I think I have
to forfeit already!

190
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,585
I can't play the
red nine anymore.

191
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,255
And the other cards wouldn't
get me much further.

192
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,758
You can discard a card
and draw a new one.

193
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,551
So all hope is not lost.

194
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,719
[AYA]
Really?

195
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,137
[MIDORI]
However, the discarded card

196
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,972
can be picked up
by any other player,

197
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,600
so make sure you're tossing
one that nobody else wants.

198
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,020
Huh? A card none
of you want, huh?

199
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,354
Hey, Aya.

200
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,398
Try looking for what other
people have played,

201
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,192
not what you have in your hand.

202
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,071
For example, a person who played
a blue nine, seven, and six

203
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,490
won't take any blue
cards greater than six

204
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,408
because they've no use for them.

205
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,498
If that's the case...
Got one! There!

206
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,584
Good job! That card
doesn't work for anyone.

207
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,586
Thank you for the advice!

208
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,797
I guess that makes
it my turn now!

209
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,466
I play a green three,
and get one point!

210
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,093
It lands on a clover,

211
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,845
so I'll move this other
piece for two points.

212
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,264
But I land on another clover.

213
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,642
So I'll move this piece‐‐

214
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,894
for three total
points this round!

215
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,439
Amazing! You moved three of
your pieces in one turn!

216
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,025
I should've warned you,
but I've never lost this game.

217
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,944
I'd believe that
in a heartbeat.

218
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,654
That clover chain was proof.

219
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,657
But I'm fairly confident
in my own abilities.

220
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:20,203
One point here,
but let's add two more.

221
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,831
You managed three points, too.

222
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,333
Which makes it my turn.

223
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,920
I'll play this green four.
Then move this one.

224
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,548
This one. And this one.

225
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,384
Huh?! Makin' clover chains
like no big deal!

226
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,844
Well, it is fun!

227
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,137
I know the feeling.

228
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,265
Nothing like a good

They enjoy cute things, <i>ja</i>?

in that respect.

[MIDORI grunts]

239
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,830
[MIDORI]
I didn't think it possible,

240
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:07,208
but these two are definitely
on the same wavelength.

241
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,713
[MIDORI]
I'll put a blue one in play.

242
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,922
Now,

243
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,050
if one more piece enters
the dark green goal zone

244
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,552
the game will be over.

245
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,304
What? Over already?

246
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,223
Three of my pieces are
still in the negative area!

247
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,893
[MIDORI] That's because you
played all five of your pieces.

248
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,603
You should've focused
on a select few

249
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,022
if you wanted to get past
the negative spaces.

250
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,231
Since this might be it,

251
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,525
I'll move my big piece
one more space.

252

the other day and actually
introduce myself this time.

Success doesn't hinge
on that group.

316
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,059
[AYA cries]
It's not fair!

317
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,061
So what do you think
we should do?

318
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,479
[sighs]

319
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,688
What's something we could do

320
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,191
that would let people know
to look for us out here?

321
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,151
[door opens]

322
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,944
[EMILIA]
I finally found you!

323
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,945
[GIRLS]
Emmy!

324
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,530
<i>Guten Morgen!</i>

325
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,991
Thanks so much for coming!
You're the best!

326
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:27,867
[EMILIA]
Of course!

327
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,869
Though, it took me a
while to find you all.

328
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,955
Why did you choose such a
remote location for your café?

329
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,708
[gasps] It's terrible, isn't it?

330
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,086
By the time we actually
get a customer,

331
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,588
the festival will
be all but over!

332
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,173
[EMILIA]
Don't fret too much, Aya.

333
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:42,924
Huh?

334
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,843
Because... I brought
a secret weapon!

335
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,345
‐‐Uh?
‐‐Huh?

336
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,223
[SHOUTA] Where's this
board game café anyway?

337
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,600
What?! The second floor
of the old building?

338
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,353
[FANGIRL A]
Yoshioka! You're so hot!

339
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,354
[FANGIRL B]
Please notice me!

340
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,773
[SHOUTA]
Oh, it's just Ryuji.

341
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,942
Slayin' the ladies
like he always does.

342
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,653
Too bad all he cares
about is kendo.

343
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,364
Hey, yo! Shouta!

344
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,408
[SHOUTA]
Why are you following me around?

345
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,535
[RYUJI] I'm just trying
to shake the fangirls.

346
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,036
Don't hafta brag!

347
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,204
[BOTH]
Uh?

348
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,417
[SHOUTA]
Must be the place. Right on!

349
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,585
Seems like business
is really boomin'.

350
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,295
[AYA]
Welcome to our café!

351
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,798
[SHOUTA]
Huh? T‐Takayashiki?

352
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,926
I appreciate you two
taking the time to stop by!

353
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,761
[SHOUTA]
So, what's with the outfit?

354
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,805
[AYA laughs]
Cute, huh?

355
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,016
Anyway, you guys came
at a really great time!

356
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,769
So don't be shy and come on in!

357
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,272
I apologize for the long wait.

358
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,608
All right, boys. Let me
explain how the game works.

359
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,402
[STUDENTS]
Right! Thanks, head maid!

360
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,697
[SHOUTA] This is awesome. It's
almost like a party in here!

361
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,700
Just a little while ago,
it was the exact opposite,

362
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,326
but then this happened!

363
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,412
[SHOUTA]
Huh? What's the‐‐?

364
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,415
Wait. That girl. She's
the cute transfer student

365
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,959
all the guys won't
stop gushing about!

366
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,086
Emmy told us about the
school's social network.

367
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,963
We put one picture up and boom!

368
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,089
[SHOUTA]
Emmy?

369
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,175
She's right over there!

370
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,261
I know you've been waiting,
so let's play without delay!

371
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,806
[SHOUTA] I see. So she's the one
attracting the male demographic.

372
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,933
Hey, Tanoue!

373
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,185
Here ya go!

374
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:17,810
[SHOUTA]
Huh?!

375
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,645
Wanna manage this table for us?

376
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,605
What?!

377
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,107
"Manage" as in sit here and
explain the game to people?

378
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,527
Pretty please? We're super
short‐staffed right now!

379
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,779
Help me, Tanoue,
you're my only hope!

380
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,323
Fine. You win.

381
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,866
I'll do my best for you!

382
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,659
Thanks! You rock!

383
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,204
Ha, ha. So I'm her only hope.

384
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,331
[STUDENT B]
Is this some kinda joke?

385
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,708
Why'd we get the
boy band wannabe?

386
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,043
[SHOUTA]
Uhh...!

387
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:42,877
[GAMER A]
Come on, three!

388
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,003
[GAMER B]
What do I do here?

389
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,589
[EMILIA]
You want to play like this!

390
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,091
‐‐[GAMER C] I don't have any.
‐‐[GAMER D] Got it! Goal!

391
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,968
[REN]
They've got standing room only?

392
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,386
Man, oh, man!

393
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,639
This has gotta be the
most popular event!

394
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,016
You're right. And I
chalk that up to you.

395
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,977
Your idea to share the info
on social media was brilliant.

396
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,354
This place is the proof!

397
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,564
Nah. That's not the only thing.

398
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,358
Gotta give credit
where it's due.

399
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,277
I think those girls and their
games more than earned it.

400
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,532
See, VP? I was right
about this café concept!

401
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,538
[MIDORI] Look. That customer
over there seems bored.

402
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,789
Talk to him.

403
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,666
Huh? Why me, though?

404
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,792
[YUTO]
Excuse us!

405
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,085
[BOTH gasp]

406
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,754
Any chance we could get
a game going over here?

407
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,130
But, President, we can't.

408
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,967
Ease up a little there, VP.
It's part of the job.

409
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,343
The president...

410
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,556
And the vice prez, too. Miki!
Be a doll and take care of them!

411
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,766
[gasping]

412
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,561
[MIKI]
Oh. Hi, Yoshioka.

413
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,688
I was just wondering
if you might

414
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,439
wanna play this game with us?

415
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,277
Oh, um. No harm in trying.

416
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,320
Could you show me how?

417
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,203
[MIKI] Okay. I'll go ahead and
explain the rules for everyone.

418
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,707
Today, we'll be playing a French
card game called <i>Dobble.</i>

419
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,168
Now, take a moment and
examine both of the cards.

420
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,964
Between these two cards,
there's only one shared symbol.

421
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,424
Can you pick it out?

422
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,758
[GROUP]
Hmm...

423
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,303
The clover.

424
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,682
[MIKI] That's correct.
What about these two?

425
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,350
Oh, they both have
a purple cat!

426
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,060
Yes! I think you've got it.

427
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,021
There are 55 cards in <i>Dobble,</i>

428
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,607
and anytime you take a card
and pair it with another,

429
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,860
they'll always share just one
matching symbol, no matter what.

430
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,613
What? I don't even see
how that's possible.

431
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,072
Me neither.

432
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,240
[KIMURA]
Whoa! She's right!

433
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,117
[YUTO]
That's kind of awesome!

434
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,578
To win, find the matching
symbol first.

435
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,080
Having a keen eye for
detail will help you out.

436
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,082
While there are five different
games we could play

437
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,668
using the <i>Dobble</i> cards
that are all equally fun,

438
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,045
I will be teaching
you how to play

439
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,381
the one known as "Hot
Potato" this time around.

440
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,092
First, play your card
facedown like this.

441
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,763
When I say "go," everyone
flips their cards face‐up.

442
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,431
If you find a symbol
on your card

443
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:04,310
that matches a symbol on an
opponent's card, shout "Cat!",

444
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,312
or whatever it is you
happened to match,

445
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,689
and put your card on top
of that player's hand.

446
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,150
This is called forcing
your cards on someone.

447
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,569
If you're the last remaining
person with cards in your hand,

448
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,737
you lose the game.

449
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,864
A speed game sounds
exciting to me!

450
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,408
I'm ready to play!
When do we start?

451
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,119
[MIKI] Oh! As soon as I
deal the cards out.

452
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,080
[RYUJI]
Uh...

453
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,207
[RYUJI]
People have fun with this?

454
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,002
[MIKI] On my mark, flip your
cards over. Ready, go!

00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,364
Huh?

470
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,826
She called it a tear,
but it's a raindrop.

471
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,870
Oh, it's okay. You can make
up any name you want.

472
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,372
The other player
just has to get it.

473
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,915
That's what's most important.

474
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:12,545
What? Oh, okay. That's fair.

475
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,549
[RYUJI] Is it, though?
That's such a confusing rule.

476
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,301
Especially with such
weird things to name.

477
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,137
Right. Moving on.

478
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,056
Ready, go!

479
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:24,890
[RYUJI]
Found one!

480
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,517
‐‐But what is it?
‐‐[REN] Cheese!

481
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,644
I have no idea!

482
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,354
The other player
just has to get it.

483
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,398
That's what's most important.

484
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,025
[RYUJI]
Got it! Smiley urchin!

485
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,904
Smiley urchin?

486
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,364
Hold up.

487
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,658
[laughing]

488
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,410
Ah‐ha! I see it.

489
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,287
I wanna see a smiley urchin.

490
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,414
Pfft. Now I have!

491
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,541
Oh, wow. Too funny!

492
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,877
Uh. Huh?

493
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,130
[MIKI] Don't worry.
You played the right way.

494
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,132
That's why it's fun!

495
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,637
That was the best
festival ever!

496
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,306
[STUDENT E]
Yeah! No kidding!

497
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,392
[YUTO] I think it's safe to say
today was a huge success!

498
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,853
Yeah, if it didn't suck so much.

499
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,689
How is it you always know what
the right thing to do is?

500
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:19,111
C'mon, VP. Now's not the time
to be down on yourself.

501
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,447
If you did something
wrong, learn from it.

502
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,283
Don't let it take away from
all the things you do right.

503
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,327
You made a lot of
people smile today.

504
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,538
Nothing wrong with that.

505
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,874
[REN]
There you go again.

506
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,335
I mean, now you're just
stating the obvious!

507
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:39,507
[YUTO chuckles] There's the
Ren Shibusawa I know!

508
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,050
[exhales]

509
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,719
[GAMER A]
That was so fun!

510
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,263
[GAMER AA]
Let's play again sometime!

511
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,557
[MIDORI]
Thanks for coming!

512
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,061
[MIDORI sighs]

513
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,063
[ALL]
All done!

514
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,689
I'm taking a nap, 'kay?

515
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,441
Good idea!

516
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,237
[MIKI] The festival may
have been a lot of work,

517
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,656
but the fun and laughter we
shared playing board games

518
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,408
all day more than
made up for it.

519
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,661
With the addition
of a new friend,

520
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,704
my world grew a
little bit bigger.

521
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,207
And a little bit
goes a long way.

522
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,383
[EMILIA]
I very much want to find out

523
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,595
what games Japanese
children like to play!

524
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:53,307
But what in the world do you
do to end a game like that?
