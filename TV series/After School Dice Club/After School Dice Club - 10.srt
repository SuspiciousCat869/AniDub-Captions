Thanks, hon. Good to see ya!

For the first time in two years,

00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,002
Aya's father traveled
back to Japan!

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,172
So tell us. How amazing
was Patagonia?

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,215
Well, for starters,

17
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:51,468
there were a ton of animals
that Africa didn't have.

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,469
Here's a sneak‐peek!

00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,763
[AYA]
Wow! A whole pack of alpacas?

20
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,140
No, not alpacas.
They're guanacos!

[HANA laughs]

[MIKI] Aya's father is a
famous wildlife photographer.

His job takes him
all over the world.

[KENJI] Whoa. Look at the way
this guy carries himself!

26
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,448
And he knows how to
work the camera, too.

wastes an opportunity!

animals to get your attention?!

[MIDORI] Huh? Your dad
hasn't made it home yet?

[AYA]
Mm‐hm.

32
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,308
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,977
I was under the impression he
was back in Japan right now.

34
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,312
He is.

35
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:11,441
But as soon as his plane landed,
he left for a meeting in Tokyo.

36
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,902
He hasn't gotten around to the
"home" part of coming home.

37
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,697
Okay. But lots of
fathers are like that.

38
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,032
And think of all the
catching‐up he has to do.

39
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,953
Aber. I bet you missed him in
the two years he was gone.

40
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,621
[AYA]
I sure did.

41
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,125
Plus, I was thinking it'd be
cool for him to meet you guys.

42
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,544
Ah! If you want to introduce us,

43
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,714
then why don't you invite your
papa to the Christmas party?

44
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,507
Oh! What a great idea!

45
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,508

Party?

46
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,676
Remember?

00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,886
Emmy's throwing a Christmas
party at her house.

48
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,430
To get us in the holiday spirit.

49
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,764
And the party's on a weekend,

50
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,850
so your dad should
be able to make it.

51
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,892
That's true!

52
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,729
Most publishers close up shop
on the weekends, don't they?

53
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,440
This plan is bound
to work! All right!

need regarding the contract.

with something else.

It would be really cool if
we could hang out and...

70
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,937
I could finally introduce
you to my dad?"

Hey. Is this real life?

Fortunately, yes. Congrats.

dad before we even date!

You must be pretty hungry, huh?

Lucky for you, I've been
cooking up a storm!

00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,295
Thank you, but I'm
actually not hungry.

79
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,755
I ate something on the train.

You what?

00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:58,965
Too bad.

00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,551
Maybe give us a heads‐up
the next time you do that?

83
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:05,388
Guess I'm not used to
home‐cooked meals these days.

You're in a good mood.
What's got you feeling so happy?

Well, I just landed
an awesome new gig.

00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,562
I guess it shows.

Is this new gig
for photography?

88
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,816
You know it!

00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,277
And this time your pops will
be shooting bears in the wild!

Ha! We're following
a local hunter

91
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,365
so we can get some great shots!

Awesome, right? Tomorrow.
I'm leaving for the mountains.

What? Tomorrow?

94
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,914
But Daddy, tomorrow is Saturday!

95
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,416
What about the Christmas party
you promised you'd go to?

96
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,753
Oh, yeah, that.
Must have slipped my mind.

97
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,714
But I'd be crazy to pass up
an opportunity like this!

98
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,885
[AYA]
I see. So you forgot about me.

Don't think that way.

I don't care.

Do what you want!
I don't care anymore!

Aya!

107
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,152
[HANA] She had every right
to react like that.

108
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,028
Why?

109
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,154
You should know.

110
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,240
This wasn't just some
random Christmas party

111
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,449
for you to blow off.

112
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,660
She wanted you to meet
all of her friends.

113
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,161
Ah, so that's why.

114
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,413
Dad, she loves you

115
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,998
and wants you to be
a part of her life.

116
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,959
So stop disappointing
her like this.

117

00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,991
Now rain?

122
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,367
[MIDORI] The first place
you thought to bring her

123
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,869
was the Saikoro Club?

124
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,870
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,371
It's fine, I guess.

126
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:58,043
[KENJI] Excuse me. Have any
of you seen my little girl?

Huh? Daddy?

There you are.

00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,589
[AYA]
What are you doing here?

130
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,506
Don't be mad.

131
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,967
I messaged Hana and
told her where you were.

132
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,595
We should get going.
Your sister's waiting for us.

133
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,931
No! Get away from me!

134
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,641
But, I...

135
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,767
That's harsh.

136
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,851
[TAKERU]
Okay then.

137
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:15,769
[BOTH]
Huh?

138
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,562
If you'd rather not
make your way home yet,

139
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,439
why not partake in a game?

140
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,691
For once, I'm not
in a gaming mood.

141
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,443
[TAKERU]
You're currently in a game shop.

142
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,570
If you're gonna stay here,
you're gonna play here,

143
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,198
otherwise you know
where to find the exit.

144
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,367
[MIDORI]
Read the room a little, boss.

145
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,078
What could he
possibly be thinking?

146
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,539
Fine, then. I'll play.

147
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,292
[TAKERU]
Hmph. Sir, would you be so kind

148
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,252
as to take the seat
across from her?

149
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,837
Me? I'm playing, too?

150
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,131
What? That's not
part of the deal!

151
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,842
Ah. But tough luck,
we need four players.

152
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,761
Midori and Miki should
have a seat, too.

153
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,054
Why can't you play with us?

154
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,973
[TAKERU]
This is <i>Blokus.</i>

155
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,809
It's a territorial strategy
game from France.

156
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,521
There are varied shapes of block
pieces in four sets of colors.

157
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,439
Everyone picks a color
and takes turns

158
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,316
putting their blocks
on the board.

159
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,569
The one who manages to put
down the most pieces wins.

160
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,321
You're required to
place your first piece

161
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,532
on your own corner
of the Blokus board.

162
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,533
Every piece after that

163
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:16,579
should touch a corner of
a previously placed block.

164
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,624
Your edges are not
allowed to touch.

165
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,292
That's pretty much the game.

166
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,920
You can begin with whatever
piece you want to.

167
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,881
And feel free to touch
the other players' blocks.

168
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,634
Let's see what the
four of you can do!

169
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,095
I'll start us off this time.

170
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,513
You'll notice the <i>Blokus</i> pieces

171
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,349
are composed of
one to five blocks.

172
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,810
For every piece you're
unable to play by the end,

173
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,104
you lose one point per block.

174
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,565
That's why most people play
the bigger pieces first

175
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,691
and foremost.

176
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,694
Also, they want to extend
to the center of the board

177
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,905
and invade the other players'
territories early on.

178
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:58,413
I'm gonna steer clear
of my dad's territory.

179
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,539
[MIDORI]
Not smart.

180
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,666
If you play pieces in
your own zone like that,

181
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,460
you'll run out of
space really quickly.

182
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,671
Like I care.

183
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,257
[KENJI]
Wow, she must really hate me.

184
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,896
Uh! What's the big idea?
I don't want you on my side!

185
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,815
Let's talk.
At least hear me out.

186
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,193
I have zero things
to discuss with you.

187
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,695
Just leave me alone.

188
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,048
I'm selfish. Always
doing what I want to.

189
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,175
I've been this way for
as long as I can remember.

190
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,343
[gasps]

191
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,137
Whenever I find
something fun and exciting,

192
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,599
I lose sight of
everything else around me.

193
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,268
Yeah, that's right!
You couldn't be more selfish!

194
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,563
You leave your family at the
drop of a hat and go wherever!

195
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,816
That's the reason Mom left you!

196
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,775
[BOTH gasp]

197
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,734
Easy there.

198
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,404
You're right.
Everything is 100% my fault.

199
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,365
Because that's who I am.

200
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,743
It's the essence of
Kenji Takayashiki.

201
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,873
[KENJI]
If I gave up that lifestyle,

202
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,584
I wouldn't
be me anymore.

203
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,795
Maybe that'll make you hate me,

204
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,966
and there's nothing I can
do about it. But I know,

205
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,760
even if I become the most
hated person in your eyes,

206
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,805
doesn't matter.
I will always love you.

207
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:45,770
And that'll never change.
From now until forever.

208
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,983
I just wanted to make
sure you knew that.

209
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,818
[AYA]
You know what's funny, Dad?

210
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,902
Uh?

211
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:53,736
[AYA cries]

212
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,240
[AYA] When I was little, I was
a completely different person.

213
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,993
Everything scared me,
right down to my own shadow.

214
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,995
And I cried nonstop.

215
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,414
But one day‐‐you
decided to take me

216
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,042
along with you
to see the sunset.

217
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,044
That's when you told me‐‐

218
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,006
the world's not a scary place,
so keep your chin up.

219
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,008
Because some of the
best days of your life

220
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,636
haven't even happened yet.

221
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,847
[gasps]

222
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,683
Some of the best days of your
life haven't even happened yet,

223
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,768
so gotta keep your chin up!

224
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,563
At least that's
what my dad says!

225
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,942
[laughing]

226
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,235
Your words gave me courage

227
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,654
and suddenly I wasn't
afraid of anything.

228
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,199
The world became a place
I could explore and live out

229
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,783
more of my best days in.

230
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,244
So hating you just
isn't an option for me!

231
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,662
[gasps]

232
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,583
I've filled my life with so many
fun things and experiences.

233
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,212
I just wanted to show
some of them to you.

234
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,422
You did?

235
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,013
[KENJI]
This shop. Your friends.

236
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,098
They're all a part
of that, aren't they?

237
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,683
[AYA]
Yep!

238
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,061
[laughs]

239
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,481
Let's play one more round.
Okay, Daddy?

240
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,691
[TAKERU]
Hope to see you again.

241
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,651
You, too.

242
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,445
I‐I'll make sure to have
my wallet though next time.

243
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,696
You guys rock!

00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,532
Seriously. Thank you
for everything you did!

245
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,367
Of course.

00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,952
We'll see you tomorrow.

247
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,163
[AYA]
'Kay. See ya!

248
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,373
[BOTH sigh]

249
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,959
What a relief.
I'm glad they made up.

250
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,002
But did you see
the <i>Blokus</i> board?

251
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,587
By the end of the second game,

252
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,048
they both managed to
play all of their pieces!

253
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,508
[TAKERU]
It's called Blokus,

254
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,969
but it's a smarter strat
not to block anyone.

255
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,929
You have a better chance
of playing more pieces

256
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,722
if you let other players in.

257
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,141
They focused more on opening
up and less on blocking,

258
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,559
so they won.

259
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,019
Is that why you
made them play it?

260
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,272
Were you thinking that message
might get through to them?

261
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,898
Yeah, okay.

262
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,566
'Cause I'm really
the type of person

263
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,402
who would do
something like that.

264
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,820
Gimme a break.

265
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,989
I just thought if they
were going to fight,

266
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,908
a board game was a
better battleground.

Merry Christmas!

Let's eat, drink, and have as
much fun as we possibly can!

Everyone's feeling festive.

00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,059
And I'm right there with them!

272
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,645
That's great, but what
happened with your father?

273
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,564
Oh, that. He went
off to photograph

274
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,150
the bears in the end.
It's all good, though!

275
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,736
He and I were able to talk
some stuff out last night.

276
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,071
He may be gone, but I
won't miss him as much.

277
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,615
Besides, he met my best friends.

278
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,409
Out of everything I
wanted to share with him,

279
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,828
you two were top priority!

280
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,371
[SHOUTA]
So that's what she meant

281
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,165
by introducing me to her dad.

282
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,167
And here I thought I was gonna
have to win his approval

283
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,627
or something. Honestly,

284
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm kinda relieved it
turned out like this.

285
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,424
But... Because I
jumped to conclusions,

286
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,719
I dragged Ryuji to this party.

287
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,678
Huh?!

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,056
It was nice of you
to drop by, Yoshioka.

with the games!

Play on, playa.

00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,107
[EMILIA]
Papa can handle the rest,

293
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,777
which means I'm officially
off hostess duty.

294
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,403
So it's game time!

<i>Ja!</i> If no one's opposed,

296
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,284
there's a game I've been
wanting to try for a while.

297
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,788
This one! <i>Ladies & Gentlemen.</i>

298
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,956
[MIDORI] Oh, the one where
you pair up and compete

299
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,293
over a whole week to see who can
dress the nicest for a party.

300
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,380
Leave it to Midori. Of course
you'd know this game!

301
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,174
It already sounds fun!
Let's give it a go!

302
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,717
Yeah! I'm in!

303
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,429
Mm... I'd play, but it
sounds like a girly game.

304
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,307
And you are incorrect
in that assumption.

305
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,477
Girls and boys pair up to
play this game together!

306
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,561
Girls and boys?

307
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,521
Pair up?

308
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,481
That's right! In
this board game,

309
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,275
the ladies are in charge of
purchasing the ensembles.

310
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,944
What about the gentlemen?

311
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,154
The men are responsible
for making money

312
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,365
so the girls can
buy their outfits!

313
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,867
Sounds a little bit like
a racket to me, but okay.

314
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,161
How about we divide
into pairs now?

315
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,665
I'll join the guy side since the
ladies outnumber the gents.

316
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,417
Sure thing.

317
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,711
Let's play rock‐paper‐scissors
to decide the pairs.

318
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,796
[SHOUTA, RYUJI gasp]

319
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,215
[MIDORI]
Here we go!

320
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,176
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

321
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,556
And the results are in.
Pair one is Tanoue and Aya.

322
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,307
It's in the bag, right Tanoue?

323
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,892
Uh. Right!

324
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,644
[MIDORI]
Then Yoshioka and Miki.

325
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,312
Um. Good luck to you.

326
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,106
Thank you. Same to you!

327
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,358
And, the third pair
will be Emmy and me.

328
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,195
<i>Sehr gut!</i> Please earn
lots of money, <i>ja</i>?

329
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,697
[SHOUTA]
It's a miracle!

330
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,283
[RYUJI]
We are not worthy.

331
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,160
[EMILIA] In this game,
the ladies and gentlemen

332
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,120
will be playing
at the same time.

333
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,705
To start things off‐‐

334
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,708
the ladies play a craftsman
card in front of a shop.

335
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,461
This will determine what's
available for purchase.

336
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,963
There are four categories
for these cards.

337
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,466
First is the "dress,"
with four types.

338
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,510
The second is "accessory,"
which has five types.

339
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,555
The third one, "jewelry,"
also has four types.

340
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,100
And 20 different "maids"
make up the last category!

341
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,603
We buy these things, dress
ourselves up for the ball,

342
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,354
and show up looking stunning!

343
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,939
[BOTH gasp]

344
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,941
Our role is a crucial one.

345
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,319
We have to make a profit
in the futures market.

346
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,278
Meaning?

347
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,323
We need money to provide
for our ladies.

348
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,035
There are 15 tokens with one of
six different goods on them,

349
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,704
and we place all 15 facedown.

350
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,790
The gentlemen then
simultaneously flip them over,

351
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,752
and collect three of
any type they choose.

352
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,629
Next we sell these
hard‐earned goods

353
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,422
for the rate
indicated on the card.

354
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,050
Keep in mind there's something
called a Contract card,

355
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,135
and the first player to
draw it gets a bonus.

356
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,095
I guess it's every
gentleman for himself.

357
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,889
It's first come, first serve.

358
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,516
Better bring your A game.

359
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,392
I'm counting on you,
so don't screw up!

00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,353
Um. Just do your best.

361
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,230
[RYUJI, SHOUTA]
Yeah. Okay.

362
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,023
Are you boys ready to play?

363
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,191
[RYUJI, SHOUTA]
Yes!

364
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,443

Get set, go!

that, we get to go shop!

Wow! They're all so cute!

There are so many choices!

we could have all of them.

their selections by now?

cute when asking for money.

settled for just the dress?

but then I remembered,
"'Tis the season to be giving!"

473
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,200
Right. 'Tis the season.

474
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,243
[laughing]

475
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,203
[SHOUTA]
Crisis averted!

476
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,788
[AYA]
Can I open it?

477
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,289
Yeah. Go for it!

478
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,499
[rustling]

479
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,293
[AYA]
Wow, what a cute pair of gloves!

480
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,920
They're warm, too!

481
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:21,507
You've been giving me stuff all
night tonight, haven't you?

482
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,593
Thanks a lot.
I couldn't be happier!

483
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,136
[gasping]

484
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,390
So! Does this mean you found it
in your heart to forgive me?

485
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,975
[AYA]
Huh?

486
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,477
[SHOUTA] I couldn't buy
you any gloves earlier.

487
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,814
I hope this makes up for it.

488
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,232
[MIKI]
I appreciate you walking me

489
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,150
all the way to the
station like this.

490
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,068
Just a second!

491
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,653
Huh?

492
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,197
[RYUJI]
I, uh...

493
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:50,494
[RYUJI] C'mon, say it! Tell her
"I want to see you again!"

494
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,622
[RYUJI] I hope you have
a happy new year!

495
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,916
[RYUJI]
I failed!

496
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,838
Yeah, see you again next year.

497
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,006
[gasps]

498
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,924
[RYUJI]
Again?

499
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:07,845
[MIKI] Mm? Oh, wow!
Would you look at that!

500
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,685
[AYA] How cool! It's really
starting to snow!

501
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:34,830
[MIDORI] I think it's about
time I headed home, too.

502
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,918
Darling. I love you so much!

503
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,838
Huh? What?!

504
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,301
[MIDORI] I've decided to submit
my game to a competition

505
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,802
all the way in New York!

506
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,721
I'm not running away anymore‐‐

507
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,765
whatever the results may be!
