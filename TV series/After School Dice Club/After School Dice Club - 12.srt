1
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:14,056
[MIKI] I never really mastered
the art of playing around.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,557
[MALE 01]
Come on, you slowpoke!

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,976
[GIRL 01]
I don't think I can.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,187
[MIKI]
Fun was just a word to me.

5
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,731
I never really understood
what it meant.

6
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,316
But I like to think
there are things

7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,693
in life worth waiting for.

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,778
[MIDORI]
Miki!

9
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,947
[AYA]
Look up here!

10
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,160
[MIKI] And that sometimes
it takes other people

11
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:39,289
to teach you to
have a good time.

12
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:43,794
Without meaning to,
I found those people.

13
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,713
[AYA screams]

14
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,261
[MIKI]
Oh my gosh!

15
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,973
[MIKI] Aya was the first
to cross my path.

16
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,599
And later that same day,

17
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,102
I was introduced to
tabletop games by Midori

18
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,396
and her manager
at the Saikoro Club.

19
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,855
[MIKI]
But that would mean...

20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,484
Yep! We're the
indisputable champs!

21
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,361
[MIKI]
Eventually, we met Emmy.

22
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,863
The school festival followed
this fateful encounter,

23
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,325
and with it came maid
outfits and lots of fun!

24
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,955
How's it going?

25
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,707
Kind've an early bird today.

26
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,083
Were you waiting long?

27
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,042
[MIKI]
Mm‐mm.

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,836
Shall we make our way to school?

29
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,129
Right.

30
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:02,724
[PRINCIPAL]
What you do today...

31
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,394
[MIKI] It's the final day of
our first year at Kamogawa

32
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,812
North High School.

33
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,896
[PRINCIPAL]
...by giving your best,

34
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,440
realizing they can never
come back again.

35
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,651
You only get one life, so
choose to make it a success!

36
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,405
[MIKI] I guess it's out with
the old me and in with the new.

37
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,449
All right! Bring on the
second year of awesomeness!

38
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,201
You sure seem psyched.

39
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,536
[AYA laughs]

40
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,664
Typical. Seriously, though.

41
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,916
I can't believe this
year's already over.

42
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,668
Yeah. I'm with you there.

43
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,753
Transferring made it
feel even shorter!

44
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,464
That, and because
it was so much fun!

45
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,427
Something on your mind, Miki?

46
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,302
Uh.

47
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,013
Whatever it is,
it's making you happy,

48
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,143
Oh. Yeah.

49
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:50,647
I was just remembering this past
year, and how much fun I had.

50
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,609
This has been
the best year... ever.

51
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,655
Miki, I'm so glad
I got to know you.

52
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,949
[EMILIA] Ja! Meeting you
helped make this year

53
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,451
a good one for me, too!

54
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,494
Emmy!

55
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,705
[MIDORI]
She beat me to the punch.

56
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,207
I'm also grateful we were
able to meet each other!

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,793
Same here. Thanks, Aya.

58
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,882
[MIKI] It'd be nice... if it
could always be like this.

59
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,427
If these fun times never ended.

60
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,846
[AYA] Omigosh! I just
thought of something!

61
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,431
How cool would it be
if all four of us

62
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,099
were in the same
class next year?

63
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,269
I'm sorry to burst your bubble,
but that won't be happening.

64
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,937
What? No chance at all?

65
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,648
Classes separate by major
starting from second year.

66
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,192
I would've thought
you knew that.

67
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,194
Emmy and I will be
focusing on science.

68
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,196
You and Miki will
be in humanities.

69
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,531
‐‐[MIKI] Huh?
‐‐[AYA] Wait! Are you for real?

70
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,285
Then, two of us are going to
be separated, no matter what.

71
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,996
Or even worse! What if
none of us are together?!

72
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,956
Don't think that way!

73
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,209
Maybe we could take
a trip somewhere

74
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,336
during spring break if
that's how it turns out.

75
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,337
Good plan!

76
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,338
Absolutely.

77
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,923
All right!

78
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm sorry, but I can't join you.

79
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,801
Huh?

80
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,845
This year, I'm spending my
spring break in Germany.

81
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,388
It's been ages since I've gone,

82
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,474
and I'll be seeing my
grandma this time around.

83
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,267
Both of my parents
are going as well,

84
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,645
so it will be a
whole family affair.

85
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,188
Aw, okay.

86
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,233
You shouldn't miss out on
quality time with your family.

87
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,235
That's right!
Your family should come first.

88
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,071
Plus, your grandma must be
really looking forward to it.

89
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,324
True! Thank you
for understanding.

90
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,450
Uh?

91
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,327
But that's not the
only reason I'm going.

92
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,829
I have another motive.

93
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,830
Huh?

94
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,583
My Papa is well acquainted with
an editor at a game publisher.

95
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,211
And I have every intention
of showing him my game.

96
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,254
[GIRLS gasp]

97
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,465
In Germany, aspiring
game authors must first

98
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,883
bring their games
to an editor‐‐

99
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,427
which is typical for
any kind of author.

100
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,847
If they happen to like what
they're shown, the editors,

101
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,848
more often than not,

102
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,891
will publish the games
just like that.

103
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,101
[MIKI]
I had no idea.

104
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,979
If you're setting up editor
visits, you must've made a game!

105
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,524
Ja! The dedication Midori
put into prepping her game

106
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,651
for that competition
was inspiring.

107
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,819
Was it really?

108
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,904
Ja, of course.
It made me want to work

109
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,866
that much harder to
realize my dream, too.

110
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,868
Emmy.

111
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,246
Actually, the results for said
competition are right here.

112
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:11,830
[BOTH gasp]

113
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,625
Okay! So is it good or bad?
You cool with us taking a look?

114
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,168
Sure.

"To the fledgling game

[EMILIA, GEORGE]
First of all,

117
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,178
thank you for applying to
our company's competition.

118
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,972
My team and I thoroughly enjoyed

119
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,308
playing the game
you submitted to us.

120
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,352
The board's design was
outstanding, as was the concept

121
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,022
of freely arranging
furniture around it.

122
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,483
Several team members rated
your game remarkably high.

123
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,111
Wow! That's pretty
impressive, Midori!

124
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,446
Well done!

"However"...

127

[GEORGE] ...I still believe
some indispensable pieces

00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,332

was especially strong

in regard to the mechanics‐‐

130

they're in need of
some improvement.

131
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,546
Unfortunately, due to
these shortcomings,

132
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,089
your game has failed.

134

[GEORGE]
But please don't be discouraged.

135
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,055
If you are serious about
becoming a game designer,

136
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,432
improving is just
part of the job.

This is my way of pushing
you to new heights

138
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,854
you never even knew you
were capable of reaching.

139
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,232
[GEORGE] I recommend that you
come visit us here in America

Are you going to
take him up on that?

00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,663
But I might not
benefit from that.

161
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:20,000
Living in Germany might be more
suitable for my career path.

162
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,043
That's accurate.

163
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,088
It's not located in Germany,
but George's company

164
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,341
does make a decent amount
of Euro‐style games.

165
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,135
So... I am considering it.

166
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,804
Bad Dwarf might not
be such a bad idea.

167
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,264
[MIKI]
Uhh...

168
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,355
[MIKI] Midori and Emmy are
really admirable, aren't they?

169
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,524
[AYA]
Without a doubt!

170
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,693
Both of them are
so goal‐oriented.

171
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,070
They're living proof that
hard work pays off.

172
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,655
Hey! You know,

173
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,366
walking along the Kamogawa
River just the two of us

174
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,535
reminds me of the
day we first met!

175
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,121
Yeah! I'll never forget
a scare like that.

176
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,957
Or how you took your bike
for a test drive on the water.

177
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,044
That is true. I saw my life
flash before my eyes!

178
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,086
[AYA laughs]

179
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,171
[MIKI]
I'm relieved.

180
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,007
She's the same now
as she was then.

181
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:09,966
Hey, Aya?

182
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:10,842
[AYA]
Hmm?

183
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,677
Is there anything
that you want to do?

184
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,762
Any dreams you have?

185
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,346
[AYA]
Yeah! You bet!

186
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,181
Oh?

187
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,183
My ultimate dream would
be to live someplace

188
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,061
where there are tons
of animals roaming free!

189
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,104
I'll be a photographer,
like my dad,

190
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,315
and capture epic
shots in the wild!

191
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,233
Or I'll become a
veterinarian who knows

192
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,070
just what to do when an injured
critter comes along!

193
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,404
‐‐I've got lots of options.
‐‐[MIKI] Quick question!

194
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,740
Shouldn't you major in sciences
if your "ultimate dream"

195
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,408
is to become a veterinarian?

196
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,411
I guess so! Then again,

197
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,830
I wanna try and do so
many different things!

198
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,416
Living in South America
sounds cool, too!

199
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,043
Huh? No way!

200
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,504
[AYA] Hmm? What's the matter?
You okay?

201
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:52,050
Uh. Yeah. I was just thinking
how fitting that was.

202
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,093
[AYA]
Right?

203
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,844
[AYA laughs]

204
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,399
[MIKI] They all have ambitions
they're striving to achieve.

205
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,777
Midori and Emmy.

206
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,363
Even Aya.

207
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,156
So is it just me, then?

208
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,119
Am I the only one who wants
things to stay the same?

209
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,662
[MIKI grunts]

210
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:31,923
Hey, thanks for answering.

211
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,633
[FEMALE VOICE] You have
reached the voicemail of...

212
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,926

...Aya Takayashiki!

213
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,011
[FEMALE VOICE]
Please leave a message aft‐‐

214
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,607
It's good to see you.

215
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,942
Why hello there.

216
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,820
Oh! Hi, Miki. My apologies.

217
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,531
Emmy is out and about
shopping at the moment.

218
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,950
She should be back
in an hour or so.

219
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,910
You could wait for her here.

220
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,203
Oh! That's all right!

221
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,498
I just sort of came here on a
whim, nothing urgent to report.

222
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,041
I'll be back.

223
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,544
Huh.

224
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,967
[YUTO] Sorry I kinda forced
you to go shopping

225
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,344
for games with me. I owe ya.

226
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,054
Well, it's not for nothing.

227
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,473
I seem to recall you
promising me cake.

228
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:27,312
[YUTO laughs]
You got it! A deal's a deal.

229
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,356
[REN] I may be small,
but my appetite is anything but!

230
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,568
[YUTO] That's fine. If I can
afford it, you can eat it.

231
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:39,699
Hey. Welcome. Are you
flying solo for a change? Hm?

232
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,867
Where's Midori?

233
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,078
I'm sorry, kid. Midori
isn't scheduled today.

234
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,165
[gasps]

235
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,335
Why does no one seem
to be around today?

236
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,922
Are you feelin' all right?
You're lookin' a little pale.

237
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,423
[MIKI]
No. I...

238
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,760
I'm feeling fine.
Sorry to bother you.

239
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,888
Hey, hold on!

240
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,475
[MIKI]
Huh? That game...

241
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,581
[MAKI] Hey, it's me. I just
pulled up to the complex.

242
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,416
It's a great day to be outside!

243
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,044
I guess we lucked out, then.
I'll be right down!

244
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,297
[MAKI] Better hurry!
Just kidding. Take your time.

245
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,259
Oh, good morning, Hana.
Is there any breakfast?

246
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,511
Breakfast? Sis.
It's midday already.

247
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,263
[gasps, laughs]

248
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,015
Well, I'm on spring break,
so cut me some slack.

249
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,269
I might, if you acted
your age once in a while.

250
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,729
[AYA]
I missed a call from Miki!

251
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,527
[phone ringing]

252
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,364
Why is he calling?
Hello, Ono speaking.

253
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,700
[TAKERU] Hey, Midori.
How's it goin'?

254
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,286
[EMILIA]
What? Miki stopped by?

255
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,620
Ja.

256
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,164
I wonder if something happened.

257
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,294
[SHOUTA] Dude! Come on and
get the lead out, will ya?

258
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,004
We're gonna miss
the previews, man!

259
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,338
You're blaming me?

260
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,882
I hope you know you
were the late one.

261
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,926
We should just nix
our movie plans.

262
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,221
It's such a waste
of a nice day. Huh?

263
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:29,600
[SHOUTA]
Uh... What's the hold up?

264
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,979
Mm? Is that Takekasa?

265
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:37,191
[RYUJI] Yeah, it is.
But why does she look so sad?

266
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,906
It was an impulse buy.

267
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,243
But this little guy kind of
looks like the stuffed doll

268
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,121
my dad bought for me
a long time ago.

269
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,206
So fluffy!

270
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,502
From now on,
your name is Mojarin!

271
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,463
Here! Drink up!

272
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,631
[MIKI] Something as simple
as giving him a name

273
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,134
made me feel like
he was actually alive.

274
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,720
At least he was easy to talk to.

275
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:14,812
What a silly face.
This one is just a baby.

276
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:19,233
This one is an incurable
prankster brimming with energy.

277
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,111
This one is a spoiled brat.

278
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:26,074
And this one is a shy introvert.

279
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,119
[MIKI]
Just like me.

280
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,544
She won't answer her phone!

281
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,922
[MIDORI] Think ladies.
Where would she have gone?

282
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,423
I'm worried about her.

283
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,299
[phone rings]

284
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,218
Ah! I bet that's her now!

285
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,594
Or not.

286
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,267
Hi, everyone. Looks like
you're on your way out.

287
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,770
Yes! We're going on
a picnic together!

288
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,564
I've been looking forward
to stuffing my face all day!

289
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,275
Is that how you keep
your bulbous physique?

290
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,903
You know, you're
welcome to join us!

291
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,697
I don't want to impose,
but that would be nice.

292
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,282
Well, then tag along!

293
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,077
I need someone to help me
enjoy the extra food I made!

294
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,663
Wow! I mean, when you
put it like that.

295
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,999
Hey, you guys!
I want to go on the picnic, too!

296
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,334
What's stopping you?

297
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,169
There's no reason
we can't all go!

298
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,463
Yay! Thank you bunches!

299
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,881
What's this?

300
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,802
Yo! You there! You should
totally come with us!

301
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,804
Hey, uh... Don't bother
with that one.

302
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,722
What? But why?

303
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,516
[CARD CHARACTER D]
Because that one doesn't want to

304
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,979
join the fun. Let's get going.
The hill I picked is a bit far,

305
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,647
but the view is
well worth the trek.

306
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,607
Yeah! Let's go see
this crazy‐awesome view!

307
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,025
[CARD CHARACTER A]
I can't wait!

308
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,861
[CARD CHARACTER D]
Is everyone ready to head out?

309
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,364
Hold on. Please don't go.

310
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,908
I thought we could
stay here forever.

311
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,078
We'd never part ways or
allow things to change.

312
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,331
So please come back
and stay with me.

313
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,585
Forget about your plans.
Just stay.

314
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,756
[MIKI] I get it. I'm nothing
but a weakling.

315
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,135
I'm afraid to move forward.

316
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,972
But... What's wrong with
being content where I am?

317
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:16,058
For the first time, my life is
full of fun people and things,

318
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,436
and I don't want it to change!

319
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,896
[MOJARIN]
Come on now.

320
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:20,813
[MIKI]
Huh?

321
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,273
[MOJARIN]
That's a bad habit.

322
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,984
You letting your thoughts
turn into a sea of negativity

323
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,737
you can't help but drown in.

324
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,447
Mojarin.

325
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,115
[MOJARIN]
They're your friends, right?

326
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,828
You should want the best for
them. If you like 'em, that is.

327
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,622
[MIKI cries]

328
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,500
Yes. I love them.

329
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,001
[MOJARIN]
Then there's no problem!

330
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,795
Love and support them like
friends are supposed to.

331
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,631
Besides, I'm sure the
feeling is mutual. See?

332
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,299
[AYA]
Hey! Miki!

333
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,634
[MOJARIN]
See?

334
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,512
[MIDORI]
There you are!

335
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,846
You came!

336
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,723
[AYA]
We looked for you everywhere!

337
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,183
[MIKI]
How did you find me?

338
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,769
Tanoue spotted you
and gave me a call.

339
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,020
[MIKI]
Tanoue did?

340
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,397
[AYA] Speaking of calls,
I'm sorry I missed yours.

341
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,775
I tried calling you back,
but it wound up turning into

342
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,985
the most one‐sided game
of phone tag ever!

343
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,489
Huh? But I didn't
even hear it ring.

344
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,075
That's why... The battery died.

345
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,743
I also received a call.

346
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,704
My boss told me you weren't
exactly acting like yourself.

347
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,997
When I got home from shopping,

348
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,792
my Papa told me that you
dropped by while I was out.

349
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,002
You didn't answer your
phone the entire day.

350
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,004
So we were worried
something bad happened.

351
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,340
We formed our own search
party as a result.

352
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,843
[MIKI]
A search party for me?

353
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,637
[MIKI cries]

354
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,721
[GIRLS gasp]

355
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,266
Hey! What's with
the waterworks, Miki?

356
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,393
Sorry. Really.

357
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,562
I wish I wasn't so weak.

358
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,274
It's just that... this past
year has been amazing.

359
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,985
But I felt like everything
we built was crumbling down

360
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,654
because of the different paths
we're beginning to take.

361
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,865
You'll all working
towards your dreams.

362
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,866
Meanwhile...

363
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,744
I'm dreading the day the
future becomes the present.

364
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,914
Because... I just want
us to be together!

365
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,667
More than anything
else in the world!

366
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,502
Miki.

367
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,837
[MIKI]
If you three aren't around,

368
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,297
I don't know what I'll do!

369
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,924
[AYA] It's all right.
I feel the same way.

370
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:15,720
[MIKI gasps]
You do?

371
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,763
[AYA] Remember when I had
that fight with my dad

372
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,765
and ran out of the house?

373
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,144
Your friendly face
saved me that night.

374
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,188
You helped me, too!
That plan you made?

375
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,566
It bridged the gap
between Midori and me!

376
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,609
Emmy's right.

377
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,777
I kicked my pride to
the curb and opened up.

378
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,780
I don't think I could've done
that if it weren't for you.

379
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,742
Happy to help. Anytime.

380
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,703
You're indispensable to us.
I thought you knew.

381
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,581
And nothing is going to
change that fact, ever.

382
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,959
Even if we're not in the
same class, or continent,

383
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,295
our friendship'll withstand
time and distance!

384
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:53,007
You're not alone. Suffice it
to say you're stuck with us.

385
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,552
Yeah. Thank you
for cheering me up.

386
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,849
Uh. That's Toddles‐Bobbles.
Is it yours?

387
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,352
Yes. I bought it
from the Saikoro Club.

388
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,895
I know this one!

389
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,938
It's a Russian memory
game in which you give

390
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,649
funny‐looking creatures
nicknames.

391
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,526
I'm into it! Let's play!
Sound good?

392
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,321
Excellent!
Put your game‐faces on.

393
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,155
[MIKI]
Right!

394
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,032
[AYA]
On and ready!

395
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,119
This is a unique game,
so pay attention.

396
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,289
First, shuffle the cards
well and make a deck.

397
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,375
The moment your
turn rolls around,

398
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,502
flip a card from
the top like this.

399
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,629
You then say a random
name like "Bob!",

400
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,674
thus naming the creature
depicted on the card.

401
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,176
You repeat this process
until eventually you see

402
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,095
a creature someone
already named.

403
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,471
That's when you shout...

404
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,389
[MIDORI]
That's Bob!

405
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,807
[MIDORI]
Or whatever it was called.

406
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,684
The first person to say
its name out loud

407
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,645
gets all of the flipped
cards up until that point.

408
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,105
Got 'em!

409
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,690
Whoever collects the most cards

410
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,233
by the end of the
game is the winner.

411
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,944
Boy, oh boy! Sounds fun!

412
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,612
Why don't you go first, Aya?

413
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,572
[AYA]
Roger that!

414
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,867
Hmm... Mamekichi!

415
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,120
I'll go next if no one minds.

416
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,913
Madam Curl!

417
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,457
Okay, my turn now.

418
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,543
GrieÃŸing Nars!

419
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,169
Um. Greasy?

420
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,423
German names might make
the game a little trickier.

421
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,468
Uh? Mojarin.

422
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,971
It's time for round two!
Another new one!

423
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:26,267
And he's cute, too!
I think I'll call him... Mon!

424
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,018
What kind of a name
is that, Aya?

425
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,563
It was my pet flying squirrel's
name from when I was younger!

426
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,815
What? You had a flying
squirrel as a pet?

427
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:33,816
Yep!

428
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,152
Somehow, that's not surprising.

429
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,111
[MIKI]
Mojarin!

430
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,487
[AYA, MIDORI]
Huh?

431
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,239
Oh.

That... was fast!

00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,076
Because Miki's a pro!

Everything is like I told you.

00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,255
[MIKI] It is.
Thanks a lot, old friend.

437

Well don't stop now!
The fun's just starting!

00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,363
Aw... She dominated
the whole thing!

[MIKI laughs]

444
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,950
[EMILIA] Even if we're
in separate classes,

445
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,119
we'll always find time
to play our games.

446
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:31,290
We can meet up after school,
and it'll be just like this.

447
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,625
That's true.

448
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,712
I know! We'll make our own club!
Something special, just for us!

449
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:37,546
[MIKI]
Uh!

450
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,673
Count me in!
But what should we call it?

451
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,177
Let's see. Maybe...
"The Analog Game Group."

452
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,012
No way. That's too bland.

453
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,680
[MIKI]
What about "Dice Club?"

454
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,848
[BOTH]
Huh?

455
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,059
We'll call it "The After
School Dice Club."

456
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,270
And we'll stay connected through
the club if nothing else.

457
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,898
Hey, I like that.
"After School Dice Club."

458
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,235
We've got a winner!
No need to deliberate further.

459
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,277
I agree!

460
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,404
I guess that means
from this day forward,

461
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,699
we're official members
of the ASDC!

462
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,495
[MIKI]
I'll be okay.

463
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,914
I've outgrown the
person I used to be.

464
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:12,957
And I'll continue to grow

465
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,793
because I'm not afraid of
making changes anymore.

466
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,462
This newfound courage is
thanks to my friends who,

467
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,964
without even realizing it,

468
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,800
helped me master
the art of "fun."
