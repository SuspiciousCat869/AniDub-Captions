I never really understood
what it meant.

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,650
But I like to think
there are things in life

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,485
worth waiting for.

it takes other people

to teach you to
have a good time.

It was a usual morning.

In my usual classroom.

What? That rule is so silly!

15

My old school wasn't like that.

00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,439
[MIDORI] Well, Kamogawa
is your new school,

17
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,649
and that's how it is.

18
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,359
[MIKI] Everyone is
always so talkative

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,487

If you're free this Sunday, you
should come do karaoke with us.

It'll just be the girls
from our class.

29
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,634
Kind of a nice way to bond.

If it piques someone's interest,
it won't even catch mine.

If there's a crowd,
I'm the one avoiding it.

00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:20,033
One thing I do enjoy
is walking by the water.

00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,585
somehow eases my body and
gives me a sense of peace.

I just moved here recently,

so I don't know the
popular spots yet.

since you're always alone.

[MIKI] Do you always carry
a change of clothes?

67
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,200
[AYA] Since I'm new to
the area, I wanted to do

68
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,161
a little sightseeing and
exploring after school.

69
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,372
I brought extras to change into
so I'd be more comfortable.

70
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,209
Although it is a little breezy
without underwear on.

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,252
So you got any plans
for the afternoon?

Uh. Oh. I actually...

73
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,173
[AYA]
Cool! Mind showing me around?

74
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,716
Well, to be honest.

75
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,885
I, uh, don't really
get out that much.

76
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,428

Oh, you betcha!

00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,701
We should start by
heading in this direction.

Wait. Hold on.

84
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,790

or we'll end up getting lost!

fantastic idea, Miki!

I kinda don't feel
comfortable traveling

93

Hey, Miki! Look over there!

This is great.

You've never been out
here before, right?

We don't know where
we are right now,

103

and we don't have
any kind of map.

104
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,595
If we keep wandering
around like this,

105
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,681
we... really will end up lost.

106

107
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,275

Please don't cry.

108
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,070
[AYA] I get the feeling that
you're lacking the sense.

109
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,281
Lacking sense? Sense of what?

110
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,407
Adventure!

111
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,283
Huh?

112
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,661
Like, you remember our
destination, don't you?

113
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,539
Uh, we, we never decided on one.

114
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,125
Right! Miki,
in order to get lost,

115
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,793
you have to have a destination.

116
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,588
Since we don't have
one of those, we're okay!

117
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,714
Uhh...

118
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,758
[AYA] Say it's your first
time going to a shop

119
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,051
you've been wanting
to check out,

120
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,552
but you take too
many wrong turns

121
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,096
and eventually end up on
the opposite end of town!

122
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,308
Now that would definitely
classify as "being lost."

123
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,267
So you see,

124
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,270
without a goal,
we can't possibly get lost!

125
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,315
That is a very valid point.

126
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,401
[AYA laughs]
One of the many secrets of life!

127
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,570
We're not lost‐‐not even close.

128

Adventuring?

130
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,284
Yup! Exploring the un‐explored!

131
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,870
Stressing over how we're going
to get home is just going to

132
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,623
take the fun out of
everything for you.

133
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,376
You should take it in.
All of it.

134
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,129
The sights,
the sounds, the smells.

135
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:47,092
There's beauty everywhere,
so try to enjoy it!

136
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,551

141
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,202

in this town, but...

Huh?

150
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,856
Some of the best days of your
life haven't even happened yet,

151
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,108
so ya gotta keep your chin up!

152
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,694
At least that's
what my dad says!

153
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,862
[laughs]

154
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,030
Uh?

155
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,745
[MIKI] I truly believed
that I was immune

156
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,331
to any and all types
of fun in the world.

157
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,126
But for the first
time in my life,

158
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:07,505
I was starting to
second‐guess that theory.

159
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:12,260
Because, at that moment,
I was smiling.

00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,604
See? That wasn't so bad.
You had fun, right?

161
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,438
Yeah.

162
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,106
[laughs] I knew you would!

163
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,232
An‐‐ Uh!

164
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,902
Huh? Hm?

165
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,530
That girl on the sidewalk
there. It's our class rep!

166
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,699
[MIKI]
What's she doing here?

167
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,880
Isn't this the
entertainment district?

168
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,048
So?

169
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,135
So she's a pot who likes to
call the kettle black, is all.

170
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,137
And don't forget to
mind the curfew.

171
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,724
No places of entertainment
or cafes after six pm.

172
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,310
Of course, that's only weekdays.

173
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,772
[AYA] It's already way past six!
Let's trail our rule‐breaking

174
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,316
class rep and see what
she's up to. C'mon!

175
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,651
Uh...!

176
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:22,664
[AYA] Seems like a pretty
boring building to me.

177
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,290
Be prepared for anything.

178
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,167
Uh. Kay.

179
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,307
[AYA]
Saikoro Club?

180
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,560
She went in here?

181
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:52,861
[gasps] Look at all
the pretty pictures!

182
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,612
[AYA laughing]

183
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,953
[MIKI]
Weird. What language is this?

184
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,121
[MANAGER]
It's German.

185
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,581
[AYA, MIKI yelp]

186
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,458
Hey, ladies. Welcome to
the Saikoro Club.

187
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,586
[AYA, MIKI scream]

188
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,461
Hold on!

189
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,296
Don't freak out!

190
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,089
[MIDORI] I've told you
time and time again

191
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,717
not to sneak up on
customers from behind!

192
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,676
[BOTH gasp]

193
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,637
You own a mirror, so you
know how scary you look.

194
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,513
Huh?!

195
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,723
[BOTH]
Oh, no way!

196
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,143
They're... my classmates?

197
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,987
How did you two even
find this place?

198
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,363
What is it you want?

199
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,574
[MIKI] Well, we happened
to spot you walking past

200
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,700
our bus stop and we‐‐

201
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,118
[AYA]
I call shenanigans!

202
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,871
How can you go around slapping
people in the face with rules

203
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,332
when you aren't even
abiding by them yourself!

204
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,584
Not to mention the company
you like to keep.

205
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,418
What?

206
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,171
He's my manager
and this is my job.

207
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,341
Not that it's any of your
business, but I got special

208
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,927
permission from the school
to work here after six.

209
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,678
Unless you have
similar permission,

210
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,263
you two need to leave.

211
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,890
That's not fair!

212
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,559
Yeah, well.
Life isn't all that fair.

213
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,895
Whoa, take it easy
there, Midori.

214
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,772
Your friends just
stopped by to say hi.

215
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,648
No harm done.

216
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,692
My friends? They're
only my classmates.

217
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,820
Since you two are here,
you should stick around.

218
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,906
Have a little fun
before you head home.

219
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,867
[AYA] I like fun!
But what would we do?

220
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,787
[laughs] We're in the middle
of a game store,

221
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,997
so why don't we bust out
some games, eh?

222
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,584
A game store?
So, you're saying...

223
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,796
All of these pretty boxes
are different games?

224
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,548
[MANAGER] Wait, you didn't
realize that already?

225
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,885
Yeah, this shop specializes
in tabletop games.

226
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,013
[MIKI]
Games? But there are so many!

227
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,640
[MANAGER]
It's mostly European merch

228
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,600
with the majority of
our stuff imported

229
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,060
all the way from Germany.

230
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,145
Your store is so cool!

231
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,522
[MANAGER]
It's the definition of cool!

232
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,523
Wanna give one a try?

233
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,483
Oh, yeah! You bet!

234
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,818
Let's see...

235
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,695
What? Really?

236
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,529
[MANAGER]
Right.

237
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,156
The name of the
game is <i>Marrakech.</i>

238
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,449
[MIDORI grumbles]

239
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,617
[AYA]
Come on, Class Rep!

240
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,536
You should play with us, too!

241
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,371
[MANAGER]
I picked one of your favorites.

242
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,498
No thank you.

243
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,876
Alrighty then, guess that
just leaves us three.

244
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,836
Woo!

245
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,046
[MIKI]
Thank you for letting us play.

246
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,673
Now the best asset
you can have

247
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,093
for a game is your imagination.

248
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,429
[MANAGER]
So imagine you're in Morocco.

249
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,390
The board represents
an exotic, thriving city.

250
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,350
Its name? <i>Marrakech.</i>

251
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,185
And the three of us are
competing to become

252
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,688
the best rug merchant
in the land!

253
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,482
Midori, why don't you
explain the rules?

254
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,818
You were doing fine!

255
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,278
This is Mr. Assam.

256
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,780
First, you decide which
direction our little wooden

257
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,284
friend will travel, and
then, you roll the die.

258
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,537
By the way, this die only
has values one through four.

259
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,665
Two and three are
both on here twice.

260
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,252
Mr. Assam moves the number of
spaces indicated by the die,

261
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:00,048
then you're free to place a rug
tile adjacent to where he lands.

262
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,924
You can put the rug
anywhere around him,

263
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,509
you just can't
completely cover up

264
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,720
another merchant's wares.

265
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,057
If Mr. Assam lands on another
player's rug during your turn,

266
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,975
count the squares that
their connected rugs

267
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,561
cover and pay one
dirham for each.

268
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,146
Lather, rinse, repeat.

269
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,522
Metaphorically speaking.

270
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,316
And then the player
with the most money

271
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,526
at the end of the game
is dubbed the winner.

272
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,903
Oh, I gotcha.

273
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,655
So you want to lay out
as many rugs as possible

274
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,533
to up your chances of making
more money and winning the game.

275
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,951
[MIDORI]
That's basically it.

276
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,370
Do you have any questions?

277
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,704
Of course!

278
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,414
If this is one of your
favorite games,

279
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,874
why don't you play us?

280
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,167
I don't want to.

281
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,419
[AYA] Then what's the point
of working in a game shop?

282
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,631
Know what? I should probably
go back to dusting.

283
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,883
[AYA]
Yeah, but you're missing out!

284
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,927
Perhaps I need to
spell it out for you.

285
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,930
That it? This is my
place of employment.

286
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,723
It's my duty to make
sure it functions

287
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,850
at the highest levels
of productivity.

288
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,893
Make sense?

289
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,021
Um. Yeah. I guess so.

290
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,774
Now. Back to the wonders
of <i>Marrakech.</i>

291
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,984
Choose your colors
and we'll get started!

292
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,444
[MIKI, AYA]
Sure

293
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,320
[MANAGER]
All right.

294
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,491
Rock‐paper‐scissors will
decide who goes first.

295
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,160
[AYA] Ooh! Mama needs
a new brown rug!

296
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,496
One or four... One or four!

297
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,374
No whammies, please!

298
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,002
No! [whines]

299
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,505
For landing on my
turquoise textile,

300
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,298
it's three dirhams, my dear.

301
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,427
[AYA sighs] The universe
must hate me today.

302
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,638
Y'know, sir, you should
go easier on us.

303
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,391
This is our first time
playing after all.

304
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,685
[MANAGER]
Your name is Takayashiki, right?

305
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,061
Uh!

306
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,064
[MANAGER] If I'm playing a game,
I'm playing to win.

307
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,733
Doesn't matter if my
opponent's an adult,

308
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,612
a child, or even
a high school girl.

309
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,156
I don't hold back.

310
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,449
[BOTH gasp]

311
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,662
So then, Miss Takekasa.
Where's Mr. Assam heading next?

312
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,248
[gasping]

313
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,916
What's wrong?

314
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,543
The clock's ticking!

315
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,048
What are you doing?

316
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,009
Stop messing with them, boss.

317
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,219
You know it doesn't sound
funny when you say such

318
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,931
intimidating things. If you
go that way, you'll be safer.

319
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,224
Go ahead and roll now.

320
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,393
Ah, okay.

321
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,313
[MANAGER]
Midori. Such blatant disrespect.

322
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,606
[gasps]

323
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,691
[MANAGER] Jumping in on
someone else's game like that

324
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,361
is forbidden. It's at the top
of the Saikoro Club rulebook.

325
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,905
How odd.

326
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,700
You never quite struck
me as a rule‐breaker.

327
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,827
Point taken.

328
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,163
[MIKI]
Wait! I...

329
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,041
I'm terrible at games
and that sort of thing.

330
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,667
I have no idea what I'm doing

331
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,878
and it's really
stressing me out.

332
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,216
So maybe, could you... maybe...?

333
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,301
Are you okay?

334
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,762
[cries]

335
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,388
[MIDORI]
Hey, boss.

336
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,556
[MANAGER]

337
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,141
[MIDORI]
After some consideration,

338
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,644
I've decided to join the game.

339
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,645
Huh?

340
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,606
But I will be joining
as her teammate.

341
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,359
Talking strategy with
a fellow team member

342
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,946
isn't against any Saikoro
Club rule I'm aware of.

343
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,863
Correct?

344
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,200
[MANAGER grunts, growls]

345
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,118
If you had any kind
of super power,

346
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,621
it would be finding loopholes.

347
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,458
[MIKI] Thanks a lot. Really.

348
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,670
[MIDORI] No worries. I'm in it
to win it now. So...

349
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,796
Thing is,

350
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,966
I don't think winning is even
an option for us at this point.

351
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,134
Your boss has a huge lead.

352
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,678
Very true.

353
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,681
We definitely have our
work cut out, don't we?

354
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,433
But the rug layout
isn't too complex yet.

355
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,644
We still have a fighting chance.

356
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,271
[MIKI gasps]
You think?

357
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,898
Absolutely. Stick with
me and you'll be

358
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,776
the best merchant that
<i>Marrakech</i> has ever seen!

359
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,738
[grumbles] No fair, guys!

360
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,407
I wanna be the
best merchant, too!

361
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,617
[MIDORI]
Rival merchants won't sway me.

362
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,327
You'll have to rely
on your own strength.

363
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,455
[AYA] What strength?
I'm the weakest link!

364
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,916
[MIDORI]
You need to be able to predict

365
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,836
what comes next if you
want a leg up in this game.

366
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,754
Things like how
your rug placement

367
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,340
affects the other
players' decisions.

368
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,010
And what kind of traps the other
players are trying to lure

369
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,888
you into. Let's change
things up a bit.

370
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,268
We'll focus on our profits and
gain back any money we spend.

371
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,729
The best defense
is a good offense.

372
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,565
Here, you roll.

373
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,899
Kay!

374
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,622
[gasps]

375
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,540
My oh my, what to do?

376
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:49,420
I will admit, that was a
pretty smooth move, but...

377
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,465
[MIKI] Wait a second.
That's enemy territory.

378
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,425
I know that. Look, though.

379
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,552
The payoff is too
good to not risk it.

380
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,639
Yeah, but if we
land on his rug...

381
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,141
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

382
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,602
We'll owe 7 dirhams!

383
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,770
Which means, our defeat

384
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,813
would be inevitable if
that were to happen.

385
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,107
This turn will make or break us.

386
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,692
If we roll a 3 or 4,

387
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,904
we can turn this bad situation
into something good, though.

388
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:19,950
[gasps] "Turn a bad situation
into something good"?

389
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,036
Avoiding the problem
isn't solving it.

390
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,372
It'd be best to
face him head‐on.

391
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,541
I mean, you never
know unless you try.

392
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,337
[MIKI]
You never know unless you try.

393
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,423
[MIDORI] It all boils down to
you and your luck, Takekasa.

394
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,841
[MIKI]
Uh...

395
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,259
[MIDORI]
No pressure.

396
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,972
Miki, I'm rooting for you!

397
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:47,311
Thanks. You're too sweet.
All right. Here goes!

398
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,190
[MIKI] Three or four.
Please. Three or four!

399
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,986
[AYA]
A four! Miki, you did it!

400
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,322
Way to go! Knew you could!

401
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,534
Well, it appears the
tables have turned.

402
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,329
[MANAGER]
No matter which way I go,

403
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,083
I'll have to roll a four,
or I pay eleven dirhams!

404
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,626
We're waiting.

405
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,002
[MANAGER grunts]

406
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,052
[gasps]

407
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,389
[MIKI]
A two! But that would mean...

408
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,642
Yep! We're the
indisputable champs!

409
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,103
[MIKI]
I can't believe this. We did it.

410
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,646
We beat your boss!

411
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,566
We sure did! All thanks
to you, you lucky girl!

412
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,277
I wanna join in on the
victory celebration!

413
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,863
You're still the enemy. Sorry.

414
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,322
‐‐Don't be so mean!
‐‐Stop it.

415
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,408
I was rooting for your team,
too, you know!

416
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,036
[MANAGER] I didn't know
Midori had such good friends.

417
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,253
Ha! Today was so much fun!

418
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:59,341
I really liked that game.
I kinda want to try some more.

419
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:03,429
So long as it's okay with Class
Rep, I'd love to visit again!

420
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,265
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to advise you against it.

421
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,392
Tonight was all my boss's fault.

422
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,310
[AYA]
Huh?

423
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,187
[MIDORI] If I catch either
of you loitering around

424
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,397
this district at
this hour ever again.

425
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,692
I'll have no choice but to
report it to the school.

426
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,110
[gasps]

427
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,613
That said, if you ever
want to have a rematch...

428
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,198
[MIKI, AYA]
Uh?

429
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,408
The weekends and
holidays are an exception

430
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,160
to the school's rule.

431
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,079
You don't say.

432
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,124
But I honestly don't
care either way.

433
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,919
Just throwing it out there if
you ever want to play again.

434
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,420
[AYA]
Round two is a go!

435
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,755
And we're back to the clinging.

436
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,173
What? Clinging?

437
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,090
[MIDORI]
Never mind.

438
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,469
Ah‐ha! By the way, it's
just an observation,

439
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,013
but you act pretty cute
when you get excited!

440
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,223
[MIDORI]
I highly doubt that.

441
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,308
[AYA] What? Being cute
is a good thing!

442
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,020
[MIDORI] I suppose you think
you're being cute right now?

443
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,730
[MIKI]
She was right.

444
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,565
I'll keep my chin up,
because some

445
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,653
of the best days of my life
haven't even happened.

446
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,949
Hey, Miki! Put some
pep in your step!

447
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,285
[MIKI] I hope there are more
days like this, though.

448
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,162
Because I finally
learned what it was like

449
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,915
to have fun with friends.

450
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,342
[MIKI] We decide to
try playing a game

451
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,801
with Ono's childhood friend,

452
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,637
and things start
out well enough.

453
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,181
But I'm sensing
something strange.

454
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,682
Don't tell me!
