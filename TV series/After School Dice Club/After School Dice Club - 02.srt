00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,430
[MIKI]
Same old morning.

2
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,807
Same old route.

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,019
And same old me.

4
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,688
[STUDENTS chattering]

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,692
[STUDENT A] Hey, how'd you do
on the math test?

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,570
[STUDENT B]
Bad. Like super‐mega bad!

7
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,906
[exhales]

8
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,616
[MIKI]
I just don't get it.

9
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,827
Having fun seems second
nature to everyone but me.

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,206
[AYA laughs]
Top of the mornin' to you, Miki!

11
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,250
Oh, hi, Takayashiki.

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,086
Hey. I thought we were past
the point of formalities!

13
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,129
Just call me Aya from now on.

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,215
Your... first name?

15
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:51,426
Yep! C'mon, we're gonna be late!

16
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,805
[MIKI]
That's right.

17
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,974
Not everything is
the same as before.

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,475
[AYA]
Hey, what's up, Midori?

19
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,103
Uh! What? Did you just...?

20
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,813
Hi. Good morning.

21
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,772
You seem well.

22
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,858
Hold up. What's with the face?
You miss breakfast?

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,277
That's not it.

24
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,154
What made you decide to start
using my first name?

25
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,322
[AYA]
Because it didn't feel right

26
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,074
to keep calling you "Class Rep."

27
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,367
You're more than that.

28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,743
[MIKI]
I agree.

29
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,747
Even so, being on a first
name basis, that's a big step.

30
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,957
No worries.

31
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,668
I'm an ace at skipping stairs
and it's great cardio!

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,129
I meant a proverbial staircase!

33
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,632
All stairs aside, I owe you one.

34
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,553
For helping me yesterday.
So thank you.

35
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,764
But I will be joining
as her teammate.

36
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,392
Oh. That wasn't a big deal.

37
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,644
[MIKI] It was. I had
no clue what I was doing

38
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,439
and the longer we played,
the more anxious I got.

39
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,940
But thanks to you, Ono,

40
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,943
I was able to relax
and actually have fun!

41
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,779
[gasps] You really mean it?

42
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,282
Well, I suppose it
can't be helped.

43
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,074
Uh?

44
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,244
Call me Midori, and I'll
start calling you Miki.

45
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,203
[MIKI, AYA gasp]

46
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,455
It's only fitting.

47
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,125
Fellow champions should be on
a first‐name basis, right?

48
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,001
I guess.

49
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:06,960
Right!

50
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,422
[MIKI]
Oh. In that case, um...

51
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,592
Then Midori it is.

52
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,054
[MIDORI]
That sounded nice.

53
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,680
Very nice.

54
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,931
Uh.

55
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,433
Say what? Okay.

56
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,686
So, how many steps were
skipped for that level?

57
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,115
[MIKI]
I have to admit I was surprised.

58
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,160
I had no idea you were so
knowledgeable about games.

59
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,662
Let alone that you work in
a shop dedicated to them.

60
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,414
That's thanks to my family.

61
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,500
I've been exposed to all sorts
of games since I was little.

62
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,878
I may have lost,
but it was fun!

63
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,046
I really liked <i>Marrakech</i>!

64
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,381
We should try it again!

65
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,968
[AYA] Yeah! You got any games we
could play right this second?

66
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,969
Please say yes!

67
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,345
Impeccable timing.

68
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,598
Class will be starting
in just a few minutes.

69
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,808
Oh. I forgot.

70
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,269
We can play one of my games
when class lets out.

71
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,021
[AYA]
So you did bring some?

72
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,107
Wait. Then the school doesn't
mind you having them?

73
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,401
[MIDORI] As long as we partake
in them after school hours,

74
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,527
we're in the clear.

75
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,820
I can't wait!

76
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,322
Bring on the games!

77
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,740
How psyched are you?

78
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,534
[MIKI] Very! I wonder
what kind she brought.

79
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,869
Uh?

80
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:50,749
[MIKI] Is he spacing out?
Or is he staring at us?

81
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,209
[AYA]
Hey, Earth to Miki.

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,836
[gasps] Sorry about that.

83
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,339
So! What type of games
did you bring?

84
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,799
[MIDORI] Classified.
You'll have to wait and see.

85
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,717
[SHOUTA]
Wow. That smile of hers

86
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,136
really lights up
a room, doesn't it?

87
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,185
[AYA]
Ooh! Looks like I found my seat!

88
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,229
I'm Aya Takayashki.

89
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,980
Nice to meet you, neighbor!

90
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,816
You as well.

91
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,068
Same goes to you,
my other neighbor.

92
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,196
Uh. Sure. Back at ya.

93
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,825
[laughs]

94
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,619
[SHOUTA]
I can count the number of words

95
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,704
we've exchanged since
then on one hand.

96
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,542
She barely even knows I exist,
and I sit right next to her!

97
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,963
I can change this!
I <i>will</i> change this!

98
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,214
[TEACHER A]
So in this case,

99
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,591
you want to focus
on a specific numeral.

100
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,010
Take a look at the order
and coefficient.

101
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,346
[SHOUTA]
Now's my chance.

102
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,850
[SHOUTA]
Huh? No!

103
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,185
Here.

104
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,272
[SHOUTA]
Oh, you're the best.

105
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,108
[AYA]
Oh, no! I forgot my dictionary!

106
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,734
Uh, hey, if you want...

107
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,236
You can just share mine!

108
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,405
You're a lifesaver!

109
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,282
[SHOUTA grumbles]

110
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,494
[AYA] Finally! Once we clean,
we're home free!

111
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,080
Then it's game time! You ready?

112
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,707
[SHOUTA]
Failure is no longer an option!

113
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,627
Perfect timing! Hey cleaning
crew, here's the dustpan!

114
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,254
[AYA]
Yay! Let's get to work!

115
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,047
[sighs]

116
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,384
[GIRL A]
Time to head home.

117
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,636
Wanna grab a snack first?

118
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,846
[exhales]

119
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,682
[SHOUTA] I didn't mange
to get a single word in.

120
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,351
What the heck?
How'd I screw this up?

121
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,521
She was right there
in front of me!

122
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,691
Ah, well. Tomorrow's a new day.

123
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,902
[gasps]

124
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,486
[SHOUTA]
It's Takayashiki!

125
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,946
And Takekasa...?

126
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:45,947
[MIKI]
But he was quite nice...

127
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,824
[SHOUTA] Why are they
hanging out after school?

128
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,827
Ah, who cares?
This could be my shot!

129
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:51,745
[MIDORI]
What are you doing?

130
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,039
[yelps] Oh. 'Sup, Ono?

131
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,166
"What's up" is your weirdness.

132
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,460
Do you mind stepping aside
if you're not going in?

133
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:03,548
Um... Whoa, chill out. I just
remembered I forgot something.

134
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,967
Oh, there she is! Hey, girl!

135
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,136
Huh? You brought a friend?

136
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,388
Oh. Hey.

137
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,475
[MIKI] He was the boy staring
at us earlier today.

138
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,685
Wait. You're one
of my neighbors!

139
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,271
Midori, do you two
know each other or...?

140
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,398
I know you can ignore
him the way I do.

141
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,358
[SHOUTA]
Harsh!

142
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,526
He's just some guy I've
been stuck in classes with

143
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,527
since pre‐school.

144
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,947
Oh! He's a childhood friend.

145
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,281
[MIDORI]
More like childhood pain.

146
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,824
[AYA]
Hmm!

147
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,700
[SHOUTA gasping]

148
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,788
[SHOUTA] Oh, man.
She's the epitome of cuteness!

149
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,415
[MIKI]
This guy. Don't tell me...!

150
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,001
Huh? Practicing catching
flies, or what?

151
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:40,961
Uh!

152
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,713
Remember what you forgot?
Grab it and go home already.

153
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,714
[growls]

154
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,383
[SHOUTA]
Dammit, Ono!

155
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,552
This is the closest I've been to
making any progress whatsoever,

156
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,513
and yo'u're ruining everything!

157
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,723
[AYA]
Aww. Don't go now.

158
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,976
Stick around and
play a game with us!

159
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:56,893
[SHOUTA, MIKI]
Uh?!

160
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,979
Hold on. Are you
sure about that?

161
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,021
Of course!

162
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,983
Things like this are more fun
with more people, y'know?

163
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,944
Hey, do you like board
games and stuff like that?

164
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,780
I do! Absolutely, 100% love 'em!

165
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,408
What? Since when are you
a game enthusiast?

166
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,826
Since shut up!

167
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,078
I'm playing, and that's that!

168
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,789
Tanoue, you're such a headache.

169
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,874
All right!

170
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,177
So, um. Could you remind me
what your name is?

171
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,595
Yeah. Sure.

172
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,764
It's Shouta Tanoue.

173
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,558
That's right! Tanoue!

174
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,020
I felt like a horrible neighbor
for not remembering your name.

175
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,314
To make up for it, I wish you
the best of luck, in this game!

176
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,066
Thanks, good luck to you, too!

177
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,444
The cutie across
from you is Miki.

178
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,820
[MIKI]
Hi. Pleasure to meet you.

179
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,698
Same here.
Nice to make it official.

180
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,159
That leaves...
game master, Midori!

181
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,952
But I know you two go
way back so... Duh!

182
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,288
[SHOUTA] Just when I thought she
couldn't get any more amazing!

183
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,623
She's every bit as sweet
as she is adorable!

184
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,251
Oh, be still my heart!

185
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,713
So, game master.
What are we playing today?

186
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,257
[MIDORI]
Right. Just a sec.

187
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,760
Ooh!

188
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,345
Wow. You've gotta be kidding!

189
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,931
[MIKI]
You carry all of these with you?

190
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,559
[MIDORI] Yes! Card games
are easy to transport.

191
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,686
I've never played a
single one of these.

192
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,813
And they all look
pretty different.

193
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,065
[MIKI]
Yeah.

194
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,025
Card games come in many forms.

195
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,195
There's poker and
<i>Uno,</i> and, well,

196
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,946
they even make
trading card games

197
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,448
featuring anime and
game characters

198
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,075
you might be familiar with.

199
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,203
And in Europe, especially
Germany, new tabletop games

200
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,289
are created every year
due to popular demand.

201
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,500
There're lots of genres
and types, too!

202
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,044
Some require things like
intellect and strategy,

203
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,838
while others are based
on pure, dumb luck!

204
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,923
[SHOUTA]
Man.

205
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,717
Just how big is the
library of her brain?

206
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,969
Then again, she's always
been like this.

207
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,471
Ever since we were kids.

208
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,556
Okay then. How 'bout...

209
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,225
...we give this one a try.

210
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,519
<i>Kakerlaken Poker.</i>

211
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,480
I've never heard of
that one, but okay.

212
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,357
Interesting. That name...

213
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,193
Yeah. It means
"cockroach" in German.

214
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,862
But that's not the only pest
we'll have to deal with!

215
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,407
Flies, scorpions, spiders,
toad, rats, bats, bugs.

216
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,367
If it creeps you out,

217
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,078
chances are there's a card
for it in this game!

218
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,663
The best advice I can give?

219
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,124
You have to be really good at
bluffing with a straight face.

220
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,835
That's how you force your pest
cards on the other players.

221
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,336
You said bluffing?

222
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,671
Never heard of that.

223
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,674
To put it more simply, bluffing
means the same thing as lying.

224
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,468
[gasps] What? Lying?

225
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,512
This might get a
little tricky, huh?

226
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,972
[BOTH]
Uh...

227
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,598
Let's break it down!

228
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,809
The first player hands
another player a card,

229
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,562
making sure to keep it
facedown on the table.

230
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,646
They then say the name

231
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,149
of one of the eight creepy
crawlies featured in the game.

232
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,776
It's a cockroach!

233
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,987
[MIDORI] They can be honest
and say what it really is,

234
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,282
or they can bluff and say
the name of a different pest.

235
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,117
The one receiving
the card then guesses

236
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,410
if that was a lie or not.

237
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,205
If the receiver makes a verbal
decision, they flip the card.

238
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,792
Liar. This is not a cockroach!

239
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,793
Uh!

240
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,253
[MIDORI]
If the guesser gets it right,

241
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,173
the card is returned
to the sender, faceup.

242
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,549
If the guesser gets it wrong,

243
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,677
the card is placed
faceup in front of them.

244
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,388
The one who ends up with
the pest begins the next turn,

245
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,640
choosing a receiver and
playing a new card.

246
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,434
Better believe it's a toad!

247
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,352
You don't have to make
a guess, though.

248
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,438
You can also decide to pass.

249
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,481
If that's the road you take...

250
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,692
This is a bat, for sure.

251
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,902
I'm passing.

252
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,154
[MIDORI] ...you declare the pass
and then look at the card

253
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,822
without showing it
to anyone else.

254
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,824
You then claim the name
of one of the eight pests

255
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,492
and hand the card, facedown,

256
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,369
to any player who
hasn't seen it yet.

257
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,954
This is a spider.

258
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,540
Here's the fun part.
You can say the name

259
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,294
of whatever pest you want no
matter what was said before.

260
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,880
If you end up with four of
the same pest cards faceup

261
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,299
in front of you, or if
you manage to collect

262
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,719
all eight types of
pests, you lose.

263
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,679
See? Pretty easy, right?

264
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,056
I guess.

265
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,935
I think I get it, but
I also think I don't.

266
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,311
Uh?

267
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,354
[MIKI]
Mm!

268
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,814
You'll get the hang of it
once we start playing.

269
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,900
Let's begin!

270
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,070
[AYA humming]

271
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,115
Okay.

272
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,493
So, Tanoue, why don't you start?

273
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,286
Uh, sure!

274
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,412
[SHOUTA]
This is it!

275
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,455
Time to make my move

276
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,667
and truly bond with my dream
girl through this game!

277
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,002
My card's comin' to you,
Takayashiki!

278
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,421
Fine! Bring it on!

279
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,508
[SHOUTA]
This is... a cockroach.

280
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,177
[AYA] Uh, okay. So now
I'm supposed to guess

281
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,096
if this is a cockroach
or not, right?

282
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,473
Right. If you suspect
it's a cockroach,

283
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,142
say, "This is a cockroach,"
and flip the card.

284
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,687
If you suspect it's another
pest, you still flip the card,

285
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,315
but first you say,
"This is <i>not</i> a cockroach."

286
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,733
[AYA]
Hmm...

287
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,152
It's a total shot
in the dark, huh?

288
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,071
I'll just guess, then!

289
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,658
This is not a cockroach!

290
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,535
Oh, no! It is one!

291
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,911
[gasping]

292
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,913
You got me this time.
Pretty slick!

293
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,873
[stammers, laughs nervously]

294
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,835
[SHOUTA] Way to make a first
impression, Shouta, you jerk!

295
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,461
What the heck are you doing?

296
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,213
Since you guessed wrong
this time around,

297
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,924
make sure to keep that card
faceup in front of you.

298
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,551
[AYA]
'Kay...

299
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,927
[MIDORI]
Don't be too bummed, Aya.

300
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,138
The one who fails gets
to start the next round.

301
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,515
Right! It's payback time!

302
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,018
Here, have a fly, Tanoue!

303
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,604
Oh. Um. Let's see here...

304
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,106
[AYA]
We haven't got all day.

305
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,359
Is it a fly, or is it not?

306
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,403
[SHOUTA]
I'm at a total loss.

307
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,698
But she doesn't
seem to be lying.

308
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,158
I say fly...

309
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,201
[gasps]

310
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,579
No! But what gave me away?

311
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,040
Nothing did!
I was just guessing!

312
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,041
[SHOUTA]
I mean...

313
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,586
It's really hard to picture such
a sweetheart lying to anyone.

314
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,047
[AYA grumbles]
Now I have two.

315
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,300
[MIDORI] You failed again, Aya.
So you know whose turn it is.

316
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,676
Oh, I sure do!

317
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,429
How 'bout a lovely,
little scorpion?

318
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,680
[SHOUTA]
Oh, crap.

319
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,309
I'm pretty sure it's a scorpion,
but I can't keep beating her.

320
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,811
She'll really start
to resent me.

321
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,939
Man. That's a tough call.

322
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:21,110
[MIKI] I think he's
head over heels for Aya.

323
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,488
That would explain this morning.

324
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,909
Gee. You're really good
at this bluffing thing.

325
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,577
Guess I'm gonna have to pass it!

326
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,996
Sha‐bam!

327
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,040
[SHOUTA]
Knew it was a scorpion.

328
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,376
I pass to Takekasa!

329
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,837
Okay. This is... a fly!

330
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,550
[SHOUTA]
What's with that look?

331
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,761
[MIKI]
This is not a fly.

332
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:51,182
[AYA] Whoa! Awesome!
Miki, are you psychic, or what?

333
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,141
[MIKI]
Not at all.

334
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,728
I was just getting weird vibes,
like he might be lying.

335
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,896
You idiot.

336
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,981
If you hesitate before
declaring a card,

337
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,734
it's extremely obvious
that you're bluffing.

338
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,362
[SHOUTA] Ooh. This chick
is a real piece of work!

339
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,905
Hey. Ono!

340
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,907
This is a stink bug!

341
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,034
It's a stink bug.

342
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,119
[SHOUTA yelps]

343
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,286
You realize

344
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,831
this is your first time
ever playing this game.

345
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,333
That would mean it's your first
time seeing all eight creatures,

346
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,751
and memorizing them
is a bit harder

347
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,336
for newer players to manage.

348
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,839
'Stink bug' is not
a common insect.

349
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,048
If you wanted to fool me,

350
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,217
you should've said something
like a fly or a cockroach.

351
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,594
Those are
extraordinarily common.

352
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,679
[SHOUTA]
Good grief.

353
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,680
I didn't know we were playing

354
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,307
the <i>Kakerlaken Poker</i>
world champ over here.

355
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:37,019
Got it? If you do, then go ahead
and play your next card.

356
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,480
[SHOUTA]
Fine. Here, Takekasa.

357
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,815
This is a toad.

358
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,150
[MIKI]
I choose to pass.

359
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,193
Here you go, Aya.
This is a toad.

360
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,945
[AYA]
This is not a toad!

361
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,239
No! Foiled again!

362
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,699
[AYA]
This is a rat!

363
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,952
[SHOUTA]
I pass. Want a nice, fat rat?

364
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,911
[MIKI]
It is a rat.

365
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,038
[SHOUTA]
Gah! You're good at this!

366
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,790
This is a stink bug!

367
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:58,833
[MIKI]
It is, indeed.

368
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,751
[SHOUTA]
Wha‐‐? No fair!

369
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,211
‐‐[AYA] It's a fly!
‐‐[COACH] Here we go!

370
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,379
‐‐[MIKI] Yes, it is.
‐‐[ATHLETES] Left, left...!

371
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,964
‐‐[AYA] Aww!
‐‐[ATHLETES] Right, right...!

372
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,009
[AYA] Okay, Miki!
Believe this is a cockroach?

373
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,303
I do, as a matter of fact.

374
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,805
[AYA]
What? Stop it!

375
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,641
That's quite impressive.
You're on a roll!

376
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,937
Thanks. I really like this game.
It's right up my alley.

377
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,316
[AYA]
No! What a disaster!

378
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,859
[SHOUTA]
It's looking grim.

379
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,652
Takayashiki has
three cockroaches

380
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,946
as well as three flies.

381
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,532
She gets either one
and she loses the game.

382
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,950
It's not her fault!

383
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,870
She's so angelic she's
incapable of deception.

384
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,997
She's too precious
for this world!

385
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,373
Cheer up, Aya.

386
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,250
It's your turn again,
so choose well.

387
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,793
Roger that.

388
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,086
[SHOUTA]
What can I do to make sure

389
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,339
she doesn't lose this round?

390
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,218
The time has come!
This is a cockroach!

391
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,595
[SHOUTA]
Whoa. Talk about a gutsy move.

392
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,680
If I agree that it's a
cockroach and it turns out

393
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,807
she's telling the truth,
that's game over man!

394
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,100
She loses!

395
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,727
That's way too risky.

396
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,980
Oh, I get it.
She's finally lying.

397
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,484
This must not be a cockroach.

398
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,529
She really is the worst liar
I've ever seen in my life.

399
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,447
But I can't exactly
call her out.

400
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,492
That would be just as mean as
making her lose at this point.

401
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:19,330
I should play it safe and
pass like the nice guy I am.

402
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,083
Wait a minute! I'm on
the verge of losing, too!

403
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,211
If this card turns out
to be a bat, I'm toast.

404
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,005
That's it! I figured
out her strategy!

405
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,800
That must be why I'm her target!

406
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,469
I could always pass and
have a showdown with Ono.

407
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,347
If I want to be crushed
like a stink bug!

408
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,100
And Takekasa has a
damm near perfect score.

409
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,186
It'd be just as
tough beating her.

410
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,689
[MIKI] I bet he's considering
every possible outcome

411
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,524
in hopes of saving Aya.

412
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,735
[SHOUTA] Her intuition is as
sharp as a scorpion's stinger.

413
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,153
I'm practically an
open book for her

414
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,614
to skim through
whenever she likes.

415
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,449
What play do I make?

416
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,159
If I pass to protect
Takayashiki,

417
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,787
I could be next on
the chopping block!

418
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,998
No. I refuse to lose!

419
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,499
[MIDORI]
Hurry up!

420
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,750
So what'll it be?

421
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,294
A showdown? Or a pass?

422
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,380
Uh. I'm still thinking!

423
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,550
[SHOUTA] If I trust my gut, then
that card is definitely a bat,

424
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,385
which means I can send
it back to Takayashiki

425
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,053
without any repercussions.

426
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,139
She doesn't have any bats yet!

427
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,515
Here goes nothing!

428
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,558
You're lying!

429
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,559
Huh?!

430
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,478
[SHOUTA]
This is... not a cockroach!

431
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,566
What the heck? A fly?

432
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,568
You have four flies.

433
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,194
Meaning the loser is...

434
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,239
No! It can't be!

435
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,324
It can be.

436
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,327
If you put the card that loses
you the game into play.

437
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,705
But I thought for sure he'd pass
just like all those other times.

438
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,333
I thought getting rid
of it was so smart!

439
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,044
Wah! Why, Tanoue?

440
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,004
[AYA cries]

441
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,673
[SHOUTA] I passed her cards
for the entire freaking game,

442
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,677
yet the one who dealt the
finishing blow... was me!

443
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,929
How could I be so stupid?

444
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,473
[SHOUTA cries]

445
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,557
Why are you acting like

446
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,976
you're the one who
lost the game?

447
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,686
[MIKI]
Aw, poor Tanoue.

448
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:09,023
He was trying so
hard for Aya's sake.

449
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,485
[sighs] I guess... I should
be heading home now.

450
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,736
[AYA]
Not so fast!

451
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,446
Uh...

452
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,531
Could I talk to you for a sec?

453
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,672
So, what's up? Are you okay?

454
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:37,635
[AYA] Please feel free to
correct me if I'm wrong.

455
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,136
Before we played the game,

456
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,181
you said you forgot
something in the classroom.

457
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,724
That was a bluff.

458
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,976
Huh? Um. I, uh...

459
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,061
[AYA laughs]

460
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,105
What gave you a
crazy idea like that?

461
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,524
Then show me what
you left behind!

462
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,068
Like... Right now?

463
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,490
Lighten up, will ya?
I already figured it out.

464
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,450
You did what now?

465
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,411
There's no need to
keep it secret.

466
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,455
I kinda stink at games.
As you know.

467
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,750
But my keen women's intuition
more than makes up for that!

468
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,253
[SHOUTA]
No way! There's just no way!

469
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,005
She figured out that
I have a crush on her?

470
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,132
[gasps]

471
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,217
[SHOUTA]
She's taking it remarkably well.

472
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,094
Is it because she likes me back?

473
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,262
Tell me.

474
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,723
And answer honestly.

475
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,058
You're totally hung up
on Midori, aren't you?

476
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,519
Huh? Midori?

477
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,105
You... You can't
possibly be serious!

478
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,440
Never in a million years!

479
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,567
Ono and I barely
qualify as friends.

480
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,485
It's a tale as old as time.

481
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,529
You fell for you
childhood friend!

482
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,989
Know what gave it away?

483
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,949
The only time a boy
plays a silly game

484
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,659
with three girls is
when he likes one!

485
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,538
[SHOUTA] Well. You might
be onto something there.

486
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,498
What is taking them so long?

487
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,125
Must have a lot to say.

488
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,002
[AYA]
I can see why you fell for her!

489
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,421
She is a little weird,
but she's super pretty.

490
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,798
And I know she tends to keep
her guard up around everyone,

491
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,675
but I'll try to help
you out with that okay?

492
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,136
‐‐Listen! It's not like that!
‐‐Eh, love will endure!

493
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,804
We'll get through this together!

494
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,014
On that note, I'll see ya!

495
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,182
Ah! Hang on!

496
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,933
[AYA]
Hey! Let's play another round!

497
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,727
I'm feeling lucky!

498
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,854
[SHOUTA]
Absolutely unbelievable.

499
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:16,150
Her woman's intuition is about
as keen as her card playing!

500
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,945
[AYA]
Wow. Two fun days in row!

501
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,947
I hope we're starting a trend!

502
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,990
[MIKI]
Mm‐hm.

503
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,533
Wanna know a secret?

504
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,286
It turns out that Tanoue
has a thing for Midori!

505
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,829
It was kind of obvious.

506
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,914
[gasps]

507
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,416
Think we've got a
heartbreaker on our hands.

508
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,251
Hey, Aya, did you
say something?

509
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,753
Nope, not this time!

510
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,215
Say. How about the next
time we play games,

511
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,841
we invite Tanoue!

512
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,635
Ugh. But why him?

513
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,261
[AYA]
We've been through this before!

514
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,722
The more the merrier!

515
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,140
[MIKI]
I suppose

516
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,643
hanging out with classmates
was as foreign to me

517
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,896
as the wonderful games
Midori introduced us to.

518
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,942
I never knew it could be...

519
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,777
...so fun.

520
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,446
[AYA]
Miki! Don't fall behind!

521
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,948
Gotta keep up!

522
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,116
[MIKI]
Coming!

523
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,370
[MIKI] I hope the way home
is always this much fun.

524
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,247
Always.

525
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,217
[AYA] We're breaking out the
games at my house next time!

526
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,471
My sister's friend, Maki,
even gets in on the action.

527
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,724
Huh? Miki, do you know
her from somewhere?
