1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,013
[MIDORI] What? Did you
say George Beresford?

2
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,432
[TAKERU] Yeah. Do you
remember him from before?

3
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,392
Like I'd ever
forget that guy.

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,061
He was so annoying.

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,021
Well, that annoying guy's
big‐name company,

6
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:24,233
Bad Dwarf, has a competition for
unpublished games coming up

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,943
in the very near future.

8
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,028
The best games in the bunch
have a serious shot

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,030
at getting published
and made official.

10
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,742
Okay. But why tell me this?

11
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,369
Because I was asked to.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,955
Just so happens George
recently got in touch with me.

13
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,415
[GEORGE]
Ah, that's right.

14
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,335
Could you relay something
to that would‐be designer?

15
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,380
"Such a shame. I still haven't
been able to play your game.

16
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,006
Yet."

17
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,843
[MIDORI]
Emphasis on the yet.

18
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,514
So he's calling me out now?
Is this a challenge?

19
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,267
Uh, I mean, it's up
to you if you do this or not.

20
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,893
It's totally your call.

21
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,812
School starts back up
tomorrow, though.

22
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,231
That won't leave much time
for designing your game.

23
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,039
[AYA] Say what? You're
gonna be in a competition?

24
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,123
Yes.

25
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,501
I might not
know what that means.

26
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,502
[MIKI grunts]

27
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,672
It's a contest. They're
accepting unpublished games.

28
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,882
They'll play‐test and
analyze all of them,

29
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,218
then choose which
game is the best.

30
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,512
And I have every
intention of competing.

31
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,180
Oh! I gotcha.

32
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,682
How impressive, Midori!

33
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,725
But which competition is this?

34
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,602
The one put on by
Bad Dwarf in the US.

35
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,813
Oh‐ho! You don't say!

36
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,815
Yeah, but contests like this...

37
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,567
Professional authors are
bound to be interested, too.

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,902
[MIDORI] That's why
I don't think I stand

39
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,362
any chance of winning.

40
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,198
I might even be
completely overlooked.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,826
That said, I refuse to run away.

42
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,412
Whatever happens,
I'll see this through.

43
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,163
Your mind's made up?

44
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,873
More or less.

45
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,668
But I still need to give my
revamped version a trial run.

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,045
So will you help me test it out?

47
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,506
I kinda thought
that was a given!

48
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,426
Truly. I'm very much
looking forward to this!

49
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,013
[MIDORI]
One Room, version two.

50
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,307
I improved the
overall mechanics.

51
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,308
Wow.

52
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,477
It looks even more
like a game than before!

53
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,604
How cute.
They're furniture cards!

54
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,605
[MIDORI]
Right.

55
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,025
The main objective is to collect
furniture for your own room.

56
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,902
The first thing you do
is draw ten cards from

57
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,280
the top of the deck.

58
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,407
And there you have it.

59
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,827
That's how One Room is played.
Did you follow all that, Emmy?

60
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,079
Ja! I pretty much have it.

61
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,707
You work to make money
and buy furniture and trinkets

62
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,502
to fill your room with.
Furniture items have points,

63
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,713
and bonuses are given
by getting multiple pieces

64
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,091
of the same color, or by
completing an entire set.

65
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,593
[MIDORI]
Sounds like you've got it.

66
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,512
There is one huge difference
from the first version, though.

67
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,390
You can score points
in a lot more ways now.

68
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,768
Buying pricey stuff
is still a good idea.

69
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,603
So not everything has changed.

70
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,688
One thing I noticed
is there's way more

71
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,816
furniture types than before!
And we have pets now!

72
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,818
I like the new
work schedule.

73
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,987
Having it as a chart
is a nice touch.

74
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,989
[MIDORI] Yeah. I
figured fixing the values

75
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,116
might make the
choices more difficult.

76
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,036
Nice work.
With just one small change,

77
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,288
players are forced to act more
strategically when deciding

78
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,082
to go to work or go shopping.

79
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,918
Way to put those brains
of yours to use!

80
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,629
Thanks. You'll find
I made a lot of adjustments.

81
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,380
The basic flow is the same.

82
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,174
But I can already tell it's
come a long way from

83
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,675
the game it was before.

84
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,803
Oh, this is going
to be so much fun!

85
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,387
The sooner we start, the better!

86
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,098
Okay. Guess that means
it's time to give it a try.

87
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,767
[GIRLS]
Yeah!

88
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,940
We've all placed our workers
where we want 'em to be.

89
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,067
[AYA] Which means
I get to go first!

90
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,237
It was pay‐day for me,
so I'll buy this table!

91
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,074
I got paid, too,
so I'll be taking this sofa.

92
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,202
Then I'll accept my
seven gold and end my turn.

93
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,496
Just like that,
round one is complete.

94
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,674
[MIDORI] Finally, we factor in
the bonus points for each score.

95
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,342
Aya, 92 points.

96
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,969
Emmy, 84 points.

97
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,929
Miki, also 84 points.

98
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,598
And Boss, 79 points.

99
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,808
That's the game.

100
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,686
So what are your
honest opinions?

101
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,728
Well?

102
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,814
That was amazing!

103
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,149
It actually feels like
a real game now!

104
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,527
Yes! I genuinely had
much more fun playing it

105
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,029
‐‐this time around.
‐‐And you liked it, right?

106
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,906
Ja! It's neat
and clean design

107
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,617
made it evident that this
was a trademark Midori game.

108
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,452
It's super‐duper‐mega awesome!

109
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,330
You're gonna knock their
socks off in the competition!

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,500
[MIKI]
Um, Midori?

111
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,377
Boss, what are your
final thoughts on it?

112
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,754
Truthfully, I'm surprised.

113
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,214
First time
I tried your game,

114
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,883
it was full of holes
and problems.

115
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,384
It substantially improved.

116
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,094
[MIKI, AYA giggle]

117
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,512
‐‐[TAKERU] However...
‐‐[MIKI, AYA] Huh?

118
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,683
[TAKERU] I don't see it getting
very far in the competition.

119
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,976
[AYA]
Uh?

120
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,020
[TAKERU]
The game is too neat 'n' tidy

121
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,855
for better and for worse.

122
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,025
What? Since when is being
neat and tidy a bad thing?

123
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,651
You really think this
game can't compete?!

124
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,861
[MIDORI]
It's okay, Aya.

125
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,779
Yeah, but what
about your dream?

126
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,532
[MIDORI]
It's fine. Honestly.

127
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,619
I felt like there was something
off while I was making it.

128
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,454
I can't put my finger on it.

129
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,291
But my game is still missing
a very crucial element.

130
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,500
[AYA]
Midori...

131
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,044
That may be,
but you don't need

132
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,962
an instant solution for this.

133
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,006
You're still in your
first year in high school.

134
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,633
You have plenty of time
to make it further

135
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,092
than you already have.

136
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,762
Forget about the competition for
now and just focus on taking‐‐

137
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,971
I can't do that.

138

[gasps]

139
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,308
Forgetting the contest would be

140
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,145
the same as running away.
Running from him.

141
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,566
[EMILIA] I feel like
you're overthinking this

142
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,069
when you don't need to.

143
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,570
[MIDORI]
Emmy.

144
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,697
It happens when
I make games as well.

145
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,992
Moments where things don't turn
out like I thought they would.

146
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,870
So, I start thinking
in simpler terms.

147
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,121
Meaning what?

148
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,123
[EMILIA] Well...
Just do what you want to!

149
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,042
It doesn't get
much simpler, does it?

00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,004
Just do what I want, huh?

151
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,464
Okay.

152
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,676
[MIDORI gasps]
What was my motivation?

153
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,972
What did I want to accomplish
by creating this game?

154
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,181
Think back...

155
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,688
[MIDORI] For some reason,
ever since I was a little girl,

the showroom for the furniture
company my dad owns

157
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,900
has been my favorite place.

[SAKAMOTO]
Hello, Miss Midori!

159
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,362
Ah. Hi, Sakamoto.

160
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,823
Are you alone today,
or is your father here?

161
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,865
I came alone.

162
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,617
But it doesn't
matter if he's here.

163
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,743
Oh, dear me.

164
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,454
You must've had
another disagreement.

165
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,539
In that case...

166
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,709
Perhaps I can cast a spell on
you to make you feel better.

167
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,127
You must be joking.

168
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,587
Jeez. How old do you
think I am, anyway?

169
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,715
I'm not a child anymore.

170
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,259
Child or not, please
indulge me for a moment.

171
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,095
Give this armchair a try,
if you would be so kind.

172
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,097
[MIDORI] I have one
just like this at home.

173
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,306
So.

174
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,146
Can you describe
how it feels, Miss Midori?

175
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,522
[MIDORI]
It's not bad.

176
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:49,779
I am so very delighted
you find it to your liking.

177
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,407
Your recommendation
is on point once again.

178
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,617
Dad always brags that
you're the best floor master

179
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,412
and interior coordinator
he's ever known.

180
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,247
Not just here,
but in the industry.

181
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,875
I'm unworthy of such praise,
but he's very kind.

182
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,127
You don't have to be
modest around me, y'know.

183
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,962
Anyway, is this a new piece?

184
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,715
Yes. It came to us
all the way from Germany.

185
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,341
What's striking about
this piece is how,

186
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,385
in pursuit of
functional perfection,

187
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,304
it has arrived at a
bold new aesthetic and‐‐

188
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,557
[MIDORI] You really love
furniture, don't you, Sakamoto?

189
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,559
Yes. I would even
go so far as to say

190
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,311
it's my true calling.

191
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,022
Gosh. Talk about
an exaggeration.

192
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,942
[SAKAMOTO] Oh, no! I wasn't
exaggerating in the slightest!

193
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,612
One may love furniture,
but there is only so much

194
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,363
a solitary person can afford,

195
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,699
no matter how great
that love might be.

196
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,201
However, in my profession,

197
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,870
I have access to all of this
furniture and I can arrange it

198
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,872
in any way I see fit.

199
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,749
In truth, it is
the kind of luxury

200
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:47,337
no ordinary person could enjoy.
I know how fortunate I am.

201
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,506
That's why my occupation
is‐‐without a doubt‐‐

202
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,091
what I live for.

203
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,884
Your true calling.

204
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,351
[MIDORI] All of this
furniture was picked by

205
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,020
my dad according to his tastes.

206
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,232
But if I had a say
in the matter...

207
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,069
...I'd choose this
desk‐‐and this chair!

208
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:16,324
[gasps]
But it costs‐‐270,000?

209
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,161
And the desk is‐‐450,00?

210
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,164
[sighs]
Well, that's an eye‐opener.

211
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,166
Good furniture is so expensive.

212
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,418
I was clueless even
though I grew up with it.

213
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,714
[MIDORI]
Sakamoto has a valid point.

214
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,552
So, someday, if I have a chance
to pick out the furniture

215
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,429
I want as well as
place it where I want,

216
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,100
I would get to experience
that rare luxury firsthand.

217
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,148
If I could arrange
everything how I wanted.

218
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,816
[gasps]

219
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,526
Hey! What's with
the sudden outburst?

220
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,945
You really scared me just now!

221
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:58,408
[MIDORI] That's it. How could I
forget something so basic?

222
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,952
The thing that
I really wanted to do...

223
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,958
[MIDORI] At this point,
my game is only half‐finished.

224
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,975
[TEACHER 11A]
If the remainder is 13X...

225
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,852
[AYA]
Really? I know it's math class,

226
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,396
but she should be counting
numbers, not sheep!

227
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,065
[TEACHER 11A] Why don't we
hear an answer from Ono?

228
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,821
A equals open
parentheses 4X cubed

229
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,157
minus X squared plus
4X squared minus

230
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,827
X minus 12X plus 3
close parentheses.

231
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,122
Plus 13X minus 5 would
have to equal 4X cubed

232
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,750
plus 3X squared minus 2.

233
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,628
[TEACHER 11A]
Well done. That's correct.

234
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,837
[CLASSMATE 11A]
Whoa! Nice one, Ono!

235
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,464
[CLASSMATE 11B]
Impressive!

236
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,716
[snorin]

237
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,105
[EMILIA] Midori isn't
acting like herself?

238
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,523
[AYA]
It's horrible, Emmy!

239
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,651
She won't play
any games with us.

240
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,653
And she always seems
sleepy or like she's off

241
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,780
in her own little world.

242
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,449
Every thing she does
puts the "weird" in weirdo!

243
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,952
I want the old Midori back!

244
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,496
[EMILIA giggles]
It'll be all right.

245
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,580
[AYA, MIKI gasp]

246
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,958
[EMILIA] Let's give her
some space for now.

247
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,211
Before you know it, she'll have
a really fun game for us!

248
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,259
Greetings to you, Miss Midori.

249
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,718
I've been awaiting your arrival.

250
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,265
[MIDORI] I apologize for
bothering you during work hours.

251
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,101
I just need to grab
a few more photos.

252
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,687
[SAKAMOTO gasps]
Good gracious!

253
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,605
You haven't hurt
yourself, have you?

254
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,606
I'm fine.

255
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,900
I just tripped over
my own feet, is all.

256
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,318
[SAKAMOTO]
I hate to be presumptuous,

257
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,903
but I must ask...

258
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,447
Are you getting the proper
amount of rest lately?

259
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,325
You appear to be rather
unwell, young miss.

260
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,828
[MIDORI] I might've gone
a few days without sleep.

261
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,162
Then you're sleep deprived!

262
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,706
[MIDORI]
I'm all right.

263
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,417
Believe it or not, I actually
feel sharper than ever.

264
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,918
[SAKAMOTO]
Even so...

265
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,378
Can I tell you something?

266
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,546
[SAKAMOTO]
Of course.

267
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,257
[MIDORI] You once said that
furniture is what you live for‐‐

268
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,301
your true calling in life.

269
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,346
I used to think that was just
hyperbole, but now I understand.

270
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,142
[MIDORI]
I found one, too.

271
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,727
A "thing to live for."

272
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,063
[MIDORI]
I thought a professional game

273
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,357
had to be a certain way.

274
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,610
I was trapped in that mindset,
without an escape.

275
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,779
And thanks to
those imaginary rules,

276
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,116
I never bothered to factor my
own desires into the equation.

277
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,870
[MIDORI]
Emmy was absolutely right.

278
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:53,416
This is my game.
I can do whatever I want to.

279
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,209
There's nothing holding me back!

280
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,010
[MIKI] I'm worried.
You think Midori's okay?

281
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,763
She's been out with a cold
for three whole days now.

282
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,015
Not to mention how
strange her behavior was.

283
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,768
[AYA] That does it. I'm gonna
go check on her myself!

284
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,561
Then I'm coming with you!

285
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,521
[EMILIA]
Both of you. Calm down.

286
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,857
I'm sure Midori is doing fine.

287
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,446
For some reason, the snow
is really heavy this year.

288
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,614
Well, that worked out.

289
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,491
The three of you
are already here.

What in the world?
What's gotten into you, Aya?

293
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,917
You're such an idiot!

294
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,543
We've been worried
sick about you!

‐‐Please, don't cry!

296

Does this mean that
you're feeling better now?

297
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,134
Miki. I'm sorry.

298
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,471
I suffered a case of tunnel
vision on top of my cold.

299
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,932
But I'm on the road to recovery.

300
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,726
[EMILIA] Sounds to me like you
successfully managed to finish.

301
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,103
Way to go!

302
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,313
Thank you. Finally.

303
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,065
What do you mean by "finally"?

304
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,067
Wait! Are you talking about...?

305
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,569
[MIKI gasps]

306
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,614
[AYA] Furniture tokens!
How cute is that?

307
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,866
It's amazing that you
made all of these by hand!

308
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,285
Yes. They're based
on some pictures I took.

309
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,121
I can only imagine
the amount of work

310
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,872
you put into making them.

311
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,000
[MIKI] That hard work paid off!
So, this is what we choose from?

00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,919
Yep! You're looking at the shop!

313
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,921
It's still a little
awkward, though.

314
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,340
Oh, and there's this!

315
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,552
[EMILIA] Ah! These boards serve
as the players' accommodations!

316
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,470
[MIDORI] Right! So you
get the gratification

317
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,931
of buying something
from the "shop board,"

318
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,934
and finding a place for it
on your "room board."

319
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,854
Pretty soon, you'll have your
own personalized living space.

320
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,442
[AYA] Whoa! It's just like
building a dream home!

321
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,152
It's a game that enables
you to choose things

322
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,447
you like and customize
your own unique room.

323
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,450
That concept was what first
inspired me to make this.

324
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,578
The point is to give
you creative freedom.

325
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,996
So what do you think?

326
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,998
I think it looks super fun!

327
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,833
Ja! It's amazing
how much difference

328
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,293
the new boards and tokens made!

329
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,962
Heck yeah! Let's hurry
up and play it now!

330
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,964
[MIDORI]
So enthusiastic.

331
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,716
Okay.

332
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,469
The basic flow is essentially
the same as before.

333
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,555
When your turn comes, determine
your income and purchase order

334
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,058
for that round by placing your
marker on the work hour board.

335
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,894
Next is shopping.

336
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,021
[AYA] Huh? This little
black piece is new!

337
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,439
[MIDORI]
It's an existing shopper.

338
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,107
If a customer is in the store,

339
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,610
you have to find
somewhere else to shop.

340
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,820
The black piece moves
every single round.

341
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,822
Be sure to time your
shopping sprees accordingly,

342
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,741
otherwise you
might be in trouble.

343
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,784
Does that rule mean we
can't go in the same stores

344
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,119
other players are in?

345
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,537
It does. Pretty sharp.

346
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,372
If a store is occupied,
it's off‐limits

347
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,832
to everyone else that turn.

348
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,792
Aw. I had a feeling.

349
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,127
It's first‐come‐first‐serve,

350
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,379
so if you don't act fast,
you won't get what you want!

351
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,840
In other words,
it's a shopping race!

352
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,925
[MIDORI]
This time around,

353
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,093
you're aiming to
collect ten items total.

354
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,596
As soon as someone does,
the game ends.

355
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,806
By the way, the person
who purchases ten items

356
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,226
also receives a ten‐point bonus!

357
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,685
Now that there are
so many choices,

358
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,230
I'm having a hard time
deciding where to start.

359
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,066
I had a similar thought and
developed these as a result!

360
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,901
[AYA]
Ooh! Show me! Show me! Show me!

361
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,320
Catalog cards.

362
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,197
They list a bunch
of things you can buy.

363
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,407
If you manage to get everything
written on your card,

364
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,785
you receive an additional
bonus to your score!

365
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,329
I bet you had a tough time
coming up with these cards.

366
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,372
Didn't you?

367
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,250
[MIDORI gasps] You can tell?
Just by looking at them?

368
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,626
I knew you'd understand!

369
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,378
Adding in catalog
cards was‐‐by far‐‐

370
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,879
the most difficult thing I did.

371
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,673
But... they should be worth it!

372
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,049
[MIKI]
Midori and Emmy really seem like

373
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,926
they're on the same wavelength.

374
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,387
Well. Let's get this
play‐test underway!

375
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,307
[EMILIA] If you're ready,
let me hear you say "Oh, ja!"

376
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,142
‐‐[AYA] Oh, yeah!
‐‐Oh, yeah!

377
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,439
'Kay! I'm going first!

378
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,527
I'll collect my six gold,
and I'll buy this cute rug!

379
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,697
Wow, reminds me of when
I originally moved here!

380
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,782
I didn't have a single
piece of furniture,

381
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,951
so it made my room seem huge!

382
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,620
[MIKI] Since it's my turn next,
I'll grab this chair.

383
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,789
Oh! You've got
some good tastes, Miki!

384
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,874
Affordable, yet stylish!

385
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,378
[EMILIA]
Midori and I will earn our pay

386
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,338
and end our turns this round.

387
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,091
What? But how can you
pass up a chance to go shop?

388
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,093
Easy. I'm trying
to save my gold

389
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,013
so I can buy the expensive
furniture and earn more points!

390
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,180
[AYA, MIKI]
Huh?

391
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,849
[AYA]
Ah! She's right!

392
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,517
[MIKI]
I didn't even notice.

393
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,479
[AYA] Wait! This girly pink
cabinet is‐‐14 whole points?

394
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,106
[MIKI]
I should start saving now.

395
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,233
You both get excited so easily.

396
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,234
[AYA, MIKI]
Huh?

397
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,737
Going for the more
costly items is a big risk.

398
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,071
How so?

399
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,157
[EMILIA] Well... Since the
game is over when someone buys

400
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,784
ten things, time is against me.

401
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,244
In other words...

402
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,496
So then, if the game
ends while you're saving,

403
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,373
all that hard‐earned
money goes to waste!

404
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,126
Right. It's not
an outcome I'm hoping for.

405
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,754
Also, there's another
nice bonus up for grabs

406
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,631
that goes to the person
with the most furniture

407
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,965
at the end of the game.

408
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,551
Huh? No prob! Just buy
a bunch of cheap stuff

409
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,887
and you'll win before anyone
else knows what happened!

410
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,472
[MIKI]
Mm‐hmm! That could work.

411
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,641
Oh, but what about these?

412
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,560
Ah! I forgot about
the catalog card bonuses!

413
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,271
These points would make
or break a victory, no doubt!

414
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,774
So... I need to save up, ASAP!

415
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,692
Okay. I'll start by
getting what's listed

416
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,903
in the catalog.
Will I have enough time...

417
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,780
[MIDORI]
They're all strategizing.

418
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,407
They're totally absorbed
in my game!

419
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,201
[EMILIA] I'm pretty sure
I know what I want to buy.

420
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,453
[MIDORI]
This is great!

421
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,457
I'm just so incredibly
happy right now!

422
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,920
[MIDORI]
Game over!

423
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,256
[AYA groans] That cabinet just
wasn't meant to be mine.

424
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,009
Let's add up the bonuses
and see who won.

425
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,594
Miki got 82.

426
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,262
Emmy got 84.

427
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,264
Aya got 84 as well.

428
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,934
And I managed
a whopping 92 points.

429
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,269
What? Midori won by a landslide!

430
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,437
It's not fair!

431
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,356
Well. I am
the game's creator.

432
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,234
I'm bound to be fairly decent
at playing, y'know.

433
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,318
[GIRLS gasping]

434
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,653
[MIDORI]
What? What's wrong?

435
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,279
‐‐I forgot.
‐‐Me, too.

436
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,447
[AYA] We're best friends
with the person

437
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,740
who invented this game!

438
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,742
That important fact
must've slipped our minds

439
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,869
since we were so
wrapped up in playing!

440
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,997
Ah! Stop. You really
don't have to flatter me.

441
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,041
[EMILIA] I assure you,
this isn't flattery.

442
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,126
[gasps]

443
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,711
This game has so many choices‐‐

444
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,131
so much creative freedom!
You did a great job!

445
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,132
She's right.

446
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,968
The previous version didn't have
nearly as many ways to play!

447
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,386
It's cool!
I still can't get over

448
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,639
how you made such an
awesome game all by yourself!

449
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,599
[MIDORI]
By myself?

450
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,811
[MIDORI]
No. You're wrong.

451
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,522
There is no way I could've
made this on my own.

452
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,523
[AYA]
Huh?

453
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,275
Not without you three.

454
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,985
Thank you for everything.

455
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,528
Whaddaya mean?

456
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,280
Silly.

457
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,699
We didn't know what you were
doing while you were gone.

458
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,493
We had no idea you were
working so hard on your game.

459
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,911
Yeah. We didn't help at all,

460
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,289
so I don't think we're
very deserving of your praise.

461
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,540
Of course you are!

462
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,709
You took time to
play‐test it for me.

463
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,836
We're besties.
That's normal, isn't it?

464
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,463
[MIDORI] Just because
it's normal doesn't mean

465
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,757
that I expect that of you!

466
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,176
I would've been stuck
without people to play it.

467
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,762
You guys are the reason
I was able to move forward.

468
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,388
[AYA, MIKI]
Aw, Midori.

469
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,391
[MIDORI] A while back...
I was given some advice.

470
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,769
This guy said I'd never
complete my game.

471
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,897
Not if I kept my guard up
and refused to let others play.

472
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,484
I thought he was just being
a jerk and snapped back at him.

473
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,903
But after sharing
One Room with you,

474
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,237
I think I get it now.

475
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,115
So this guy... Who is he?

476
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,326
His name's George Beresford.

477
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,536
One of my goals for this
competition is to make him

478
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:31,415
play my game. Call it
a hidden agenda, I guess.

479
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,917
You said Beresford?

480
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,002
As in the designer
from Bad Dwarf?

481
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,004
Midori... You're so lucky!

482
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,298
[MIDORI]
He's my boss's friend, not mine.

483
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,674
I can tell you
he's as pretentious

484
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,051
as he is stubborn, though.

485
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,552
But you're that much closer

486
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,680
to becoming a real game author!
You're ahead of me.

487
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,723
Not quite.

488
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,226
I wouldn't have remembered
what I wanted on my own.

489
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,644
That one was all you.

490
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,355
That's why I think it's fair
to say you're ahead of me.

491
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,482
Midori...

492
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,234
You both have amazing dreams!

493
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,611
It's really cool! Right, Miki?

494
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,447
Uh, yeah. Definitely.

495
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,866
[MIKI]
Why am I feeling like this?

496
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,829
I'm happy for her,
but also a little... sad.

497
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,259
[MIKI]
This past year was lots of fun.

498
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,929
But am I the only one who
wouldn't mind if things

499
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,723
stayed just like this forever?
