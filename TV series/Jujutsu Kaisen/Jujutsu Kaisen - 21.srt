1
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:11,751
In the end, I didn't

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:11,751
really do anything at all.

3
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,125
I wonder if they'll be mad.

4
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:17,250
(wall rumbling)

5
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,125
(wall exploding)

6
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:23,792
Ah.

7
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:25,250
You on the other hand, though,

8
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,667
you really worked way too hard.

9
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:31,876
Awe.

10
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:34,959
(gasps)

11
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,584
(chuckles) Oh, you poor thing.

12
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,083
(eerie music)

13
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,918
Shall I put you

14
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,918
out of your misery?

15
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:52,500
Hold on now.

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,209
Don't go acting on

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,209
your own, human,

18
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,626
or you'll die.

19
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:01,792
Oh, stop, I was just being kind,

20
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:04,000
which a curse might

21
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:04,000
not quite understand.

22
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:08,876
(eerie music continues)

23
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:14,083
So, got the goods?

24
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,918
(chuckles) Without a hitch.

25
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:22,626
All six of the special-grade

26
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:22,626
Sukuna's Finger cursed objects

27
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,209
that Jujutsu High possessed,

28
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:27,500
and the other special-grade

29
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:27,500
cursed object,

30
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:30,209
Cursed Wombs Death

31
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:30,209
Paintings, One through Three.

32
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:35,209
[Suguru] Most of the

33
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:35,209
temples at Jujutsu High

34
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:36,375
are actually just a facade.

35
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:41,542
Tengen's barrier keeps their

36
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:41,542
positions changing every day.

37
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:47,250
And within those, only one

38
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:47,250
of over a thousand doors

39
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:49,500
actually leads to the storeroom

40
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:52,667
that holds cursed objects

41
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:52,667
as dangerous as the fingers.

42
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,709
Each day, only Tengen knows

43
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:02,125
which door leads to

44
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:02,125
the true storehouse,

45
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,709
so I doubt anyone

46
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,709
will interfere.

47
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,083
Who's this Tengen

48
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,083
you're talking about?

49
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,167
A sorcerer with

50
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,167
immortality technique.

51
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,751
Ah! He must be even

52
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,751
stronger than Gojo!

53
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:15,542
Immortality, but

54
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:15,542
not eternal youth.

55
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,375
You can think of him

56
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,375
as sort of just a tree.

57
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,167
Tengen basically doesn't

58
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,167
interfere with the world,

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,250
aside from maintaining barriers,

60
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,167
so you really don't

61
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,167
have to worry about him.

62
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,000
Remember the finger we

63
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,000
let Jujutsu High retrieve?

64
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,334
I put a charm comprised of

65
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,334
Mahito's cursed energy on it

66
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,167
before they collected it.

67
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,709
It's under a single-layer seal,

68
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,209
so they won't

69
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,209
bother to remove it.

70
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,375
He'll be able to find it easily.

71
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,000
And are there gatekeepers?

72
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,542
Tengen does keep two attendants

73
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,876
between the door

74
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,876
and the storeroom.

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,417
Both chumps.

76
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,751
More importantly, before

77
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,751
the veil actually goes down,

78
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:52,709
I'd like you to very quietly

79
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:56,209
thin out the sorcerers

80
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:56,209
stationed at the school

81
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,000
to lighten the burden on Hanami.

82
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,000
Mm-hmm.

83
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:00,250
[Hanami] Why not just

84
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:00,250
seal Satoru Gojo

85
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:02,250
inside the veil while

86
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:02,250
we have the chance?

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,125
[Suguru] Because we don't

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,125
want to draw his attention

89
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,751
toward Mahito's main mission.

90
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,542
And we need him to

91
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,542
exercise his full power,

92
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,042
or it won't be a proper

93
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,042
test of the veil.

94
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,375
Trapping the students inside

95
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,375
will be more effective.

96
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:22,292
[Hanami] Is it okay to kill

97
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:22,292
all but Sukuna's vessel?

98
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,125
[Suguru] That's fine, but

99
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,125
I wouldn't recommend it.

100
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,167
[Hanami] Hmm?

101
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,083
[Suguru] So far,

102
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,083
Sukuna's actions

103
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,876
have not been quite

104
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,876
what I expected.

105
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,250
This is just my

106
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,250
guess, but I believe

107
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,167
one of the other students acts

108
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,167
as kind of a land

109
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,167
mine for Sukuna.

110
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:46,584
Worst case scenario,

111
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:46,584
if we step on that,

112
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,542
all of our current

113
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,542
plans will be ruined.

114
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:49,792
Then why don't we just go

115
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,792
and kidnap Itadori

116
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,792
ahead of time?

117
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,626
We'll be using him as a pawn.

118
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,834
But Itadori, or

119
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,834
rather Sukuna himself,

120
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:01,000
is also a type of

121
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:01,000
land mine for us.

122
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,417
That applies to both

123
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,417
us and Jujutsu High.

124
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,375
We shouldn't agitate it until

125
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,375
the moment we want more chaos:

126
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,292
October 31st in Shibuya.

127
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,667
Everything we can use

128
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,667
to seal Satoru Gojo

129
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:22,626
we should keep in

130
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:22,626
reserve until then.

131
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,709
We'll have a few curse

132
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,709
users accompany us, too.

133
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,334
But Juzo Kumiya,

134
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,334
he's disposable.

135
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,667
He's not the kind of person

136
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:36,125
who can follow a plan

137
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:36,125
all the way through.

138
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,792
He'll just get in our way later.

139
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,000
And we'll have a different

140
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,000
human as a monitor

141
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,375
for our test run of the

142
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,375
veil, so get along with them.

143
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:47,125
Yeah, you hear that,

144
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:47,125
Jogo? So get going.

145
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:49,250
(grunts) I'm not going, anyway.

146
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,667
Come on, Hanami, wake up.

147
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,959
Let's go.

148
00:04:58,792 --> 00:04:59,709
[Hanami] Mahito?

149
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:00,751
Hm?

150
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,709
[Hanami] Trying to pump

151
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,709
the brakes on my hostility

152
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,334
is incredibly stressful.

153
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,542
You're sounding more like

154
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,542
a curse every day, Hanami.

155
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,876
(opening theme music)

156
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:24,542
(singing in Japanese)

157
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,334
(birds chirping)

158
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,334
Next up are the casualties.

159
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,959
Three second-grade sorcerers,

160
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,959
one semi-first-grade sorcerer,

161
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,375
five supervisors,

162
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,375
and two guards.

163
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:57,292
They were all on

164
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:57,292
standby at the school

165
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,209
and all of them were

166
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,209
there working separately

167
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,876
from Gojo and Principal Yaga.

168
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,959
We're still waiting on

169
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,959
the report from Ieiri,

170
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,459
but we're nearly

171
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,459
certain it was the work

172
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:08,834
of the same cursed spirit

173
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:08,834
that

174
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:08,834
Nanami encountered before.

175
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,292
(Satoru grunts)

176
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,459
What do you think?

177
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,459
Should we share this

178
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,459
information with the students

179
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,876
and the other sorcerers?

180
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,375
No.

181
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,834
It's probably better to

182
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,834
keep this among ourselves.

183
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,250
We don't want to give

184
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,250
curse users certainty

185
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:24,459
that special-grade

186
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:24,459
objects were stolen.

187
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:27,042
Has our captured

188
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:27,042
curse user spilled?

189
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,500
(sighs) Well, it's no

190
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,500
problem getting him to talk.

191
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:34,626
But what he says? It's all

192
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:34,626
just irrelevant nonsense.

193
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,584
Although, it's interesting

194
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,584
that he's claiming

195
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,250
he was only in the attack

196
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,125
because he was ordered to come

197
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,125
as part of a certain deal.

198
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,667
I just wanted to make

199
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,667
myself a coat rack.

200
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:48,876
The monk promised me that.

201
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,042
I don't know his name.

202
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,417
In fact, I don't even know

203
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,417
if it was a man or a woman.

204
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,417
Just a brat with white

205
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,417
hair in a bob cut.

206
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,876
A mysterious androgynous

207
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,876
monk kid with a bob haircut.

208
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,250
Ring any bells?

209
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:04,834
Nah. The guy sounds

210
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:04,834
like a bullshitter.

211
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,834
Have we got anyone

212
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,834
skilled at confessions?

213
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,417
How did these outsiders

214
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,417
and a cursed spirit

215
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,876
get through all of

216
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,876
Tengen's barriers?

217
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,709
[Satoru] That was

218
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,709
probably the work

219
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,876
of the special-grade

220
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,876
cursed spirit

221
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,292
the students were fighting.

222
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,417
That one has a unique presence.

223
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,292
Even though it's

224
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,292
a cursed spirit,

225
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,083
it's incredibly close

226
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,083
to a natural spirit.

227
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,709
According to Aoi, it was

228
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,709
able to hide among plants,

229
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:32,083
and Tengen's barrier doesn't

230
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:32,083
function against plants.

231
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,542
Remember, Tengen's

232
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,542
barrier puts all its power

233
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,876
into hiding, not protecting,

234
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,542
so once you get in,

235
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,542
it's kind of weak.

236
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,542
Are they worried

237
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,542
about Sukuna's fingers

238
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,083
enhancing Yuji's potential?

239
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,542
Or are they trying to

240
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,542
enhance themselves?

241
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,167
Something isn't sitting right.

242
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,459
Well, for the time being,

243
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,542
at least our students

244
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,542
are all safe.

245
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:00,709
(Gakuganji grunts)

246
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:04,959
But obviously the exchange

247
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:04,959
event will have to be

248
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:04,959
canceled.

249
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:07,751
Hold on! Since when is that

250
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:07,751
a decision we get to make?

251
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,500
[Group] Huh?

252
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,584
So how's it possible

253
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,584
that you get along

254
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,584
with a gorilla like Todo?

255
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,792
Well, the two of us got along,

256
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:21,125
but it was like, I mean,

257
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:21,125
I do remember everything,

258
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,167
but it feels like I wasn't

259
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,167
exactly myself at the time.

260
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,500
What do you mean?

261
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,500
Were you drinking?

262
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:28,959
You seriously believe I

263
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:28,959
could've been drinking liquor

264
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:29,751
in a situation like that?

265
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,792
That woulda been insane.

266
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,417
Anyway, I'm just

267
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,417
glad your injuries

268
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,417
weren't too serious, Fushiguro.

269
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,792
To your health and this pizza.

270
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:41,751
[Fushiguro] You could've

271
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:41,751
brought me something

272
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,792
easier to digest.

273
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,626
No complaining.

274
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,959
Apparently, I got off easier

275
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:52,167
because my cursed

276
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:52,167
energy was all gone,

277
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,375
and Ieiri was still

278
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,375
able to fix me up

279
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,542
as soon as the

280
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,542
roots were removed.

281
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:58,542
[Itadori] Huh, so

282
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:58,542
that's what happened?

283
00:09:58,626 --> 00:09:59,667
[Kugisaki] You should know.

284
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:00,584
You fought against

285
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:00,584
them too, didn't you?

286
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:03,459
Itadori.

287
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:04,709
Huh?

288
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,000
[Fushiguro] You know,

289
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,000
you've grown a lot stronger.

290
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,459
Hm?

291
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,000
Before,

292
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,584
we both said that we

293
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,584
stood by our convictions.

294
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:13,667
I still think that's true.

295
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:18,792
But then on the other hand,

296
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:22,626
one could say that we're

297
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:22,626
both wrong about all of that.

298
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,709
Huh?

299
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,667
Some questions don't

300
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,667
have any answers.

301
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,709
Don't think so hard.

302
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,709
You'll go bald.

303
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:32,167
You're right,

304
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:32,167
there is no answer.

305
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,751
I know it's just a matter

306
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,751
of trying to accept it.

307
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,083
But why accept something

308
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,083
you don't want?

309
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,876
Only weak sorcerers do that.

310
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:43,918
So I've decided

311
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,292
I'll surpass you.

312
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,834
(laughs) You never change.

313
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:55,500
Did I get left out of

314
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:55,500
the conversation again?

315
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:58,876
There ya go. That's my brother

316
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:58,876
and his friends for ya.

317
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,209
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

318
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,584
Wait, where are

319
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,584
you going, Brother?

320
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,000
Hey, hold up!

321
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,834
Look, I'm grateful to you,

322
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,834
but come on, give me a break!

323
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:08,876
You know damn well

324
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,792
that I wasn't thinking

325
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,792
straight back then!

326
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:12,292
[Todo] What are you saying?

327
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,667
We've been so close ever

328
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,667
since middle school, Brother!

329
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:16,042
[Itadori] Since middle school?

330
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,083
I didn't go to

331
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,083
your middle school!

332
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,500
[Miwa] Hello! Useless Miwa here.

333
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:29,250
And even though I

334
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:29,250
call myself useless,

335
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:31,709
I don't actually think

336
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:31,709
that I'm all that bad.

337
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,417
But it is true that

338
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,417
while everyone else

339
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,417
was risking their lives fighting

340
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,626
during the special-grade

341
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,626
cursed spirit's attack,

342
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,292
I was fast asleep.

343
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,667
And now I feel ashamed.

344
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,334
Also, I wonder who

345
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,334
broke my sword?

346
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,876
Was it Mai's older sister?

347
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,334
After all of that,

348
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,792
we thought the exchange

349
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,792
event would be canceled,

350
00:11:54,876 --> 00:12:00,083
but now, after taking a

351
00:11:54,876 --> 00:12:00,083
day off, here we all are.

352
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,459
[Satoru] Play ball!

353
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,584
[Miwa] Playing baseball!

354
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:08,375
(upbeat theme music)

355
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,709
(casual theme music)

356
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:18,292
(birds chirping)

357
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:22,500
So anyway, that happened

358
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:22,500
and some people died.

359
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,083
But what now?

360
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:24,959
Keep going?

361
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:29,459
Uh, I have no idea

362
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:29,459
what to say to that.

363
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,459
Get real.

364
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,876
Huh?

365
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,792
[Todo] The Exchange Event

366
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,792
will continue, of course!

367
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:36,417
[Itadori] Todo!

368
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:38,709
What are your reasons?

369
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,542
For one, only those who

370
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,542
have a direct connection

371
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:42,959
to the victims have any

372
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:42,959
right to mourn them.

373
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:46,209
It would be rude of

374
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:46,209
us to butt in there.

375
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:47,918
And secondly, if

376
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:47,918
people have died,

377
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,334
that's all the

378
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,334
more reason for us

379
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:52,626
to work to become stronger.

380
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,375
Acquired strength can only come

381
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:55,751
from the accumulation

382
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:55,751
of results.

383
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:59,125
Tasting defeat and

384
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:59,125
savoring victory,

385
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,709
these are the things

386
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,709
that lead us to grow!

387
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,876
The most important thing now

388
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,542
is for those results

389
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,542
to continue to exist.

390
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:07,834
This is surprising. Todo

391
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:07,834
sounds almost reasonable.

392
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:10,792
Reasonably crazy.

393
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:11,918
Third, when a student feels like

394
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,834
they weren't able to

395
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,834
bring out their best,

396
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,959
it'll hang over

397
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,959
them until they die.

398
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:17,751
[Satoru] How old are you?

399
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:20,375
Yeah, I'm fine with all that.

400
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,834
We'll still win anyway.

401
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:23,584
He does have a point there.

402
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,417
Kamo, shouldn't you be resting?

403
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:25,918
I'm in.

404
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,918
[Inumaki] Salmon.

405
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
How do we pair up for

406
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the individual fights?

407
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:33,584
Huh? There are no

408
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:33,584
individual battles.

409
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,042
The Exchange Event always has

410
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,834
the principals of

411
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,834
the two schools.

412
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,167
Each propose a form of

413
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,167
competition for the two days,

414
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,167
or that's how it's

415
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,167
supposed to be.

416
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,834
Every year 'til now, the

417
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,834
first

418
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,834
day has been team battles

419
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:49,375
and the second

420
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:49,375
individual battles.

421
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:50,375
[Inumaki] Salmon.

422
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,000
(all grumbling)

423
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,876
I don't like routines but

424
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,876
this is how it's done.

425
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,083
Every year we put the

426
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,083
competition methods here

427
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,250
and pull one out.

428
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:00,292
Huh?

429
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,709
Principal Gakuganji's

430
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,709
previous visit was to discuss

431
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,292
what items might be needed

432
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,292
on the day of the event.

433
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:14,000
[Itadori] Huh? What?

434
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,209
-Huh?

435
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,209
-Whoa!

436
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,209
Baseball?

437
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:18,459
You too?

438
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:19,876
[Gakuganji] What's

439
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:19,876
going on here, Yaga?

440
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,250
[Yaga] I don't know!

441
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,792
I was sure I put individual

442
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,792
battles in there.

443
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:26,250
Hey! Get back here, Satoru!

444
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:28,792
(lively music)

445
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:34,459
(Maki grunts)

446
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,292
(Miwa grunts)

447
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,459
Fly ball!

448
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:42,250
Nishimiya, no! Don't run yet!

449
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:43,500
[Satoru] Out!

450
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,500
Huh? But why?

451
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,125
Momo, if you don't know

452
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,125
the rules, then say so!

453
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,083
I do know them! When

454
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,083
the ball's hit, I run!

455
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,083
A sacrifice fly? What's

456
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,083
that,

457
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,083
some new form of torture?

458
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,709
[Iori] You're just plain stupid!

459
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:02,083
[Kamo] I heard you fought

460
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:02,083
off a special-grade.

461
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,083
Huh? Oh, yeah.

462
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,500
Mostly thanks to Todo

463
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,500
and Gojo really.

464
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:08,667
No helmet, dude?

465
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,459
Itadori,

466
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,125
why did you want to

467
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,125
be a jujutsu sorcerer?

468
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,918
At first, it just

469
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,918
kinda happened,

470
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:22,042
but I'm kind of a loner so I

471
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:22,042
want to save lots of people

472
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,250
so that I'll have lots of

473
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,250
them

474
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,250
watching over me when I die.

475
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,334
[Young Kamo] If

476
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,334
you're not there, Mom,

477
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,959
then I won't become

478
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,959
a jujutsu sorcerer!

479
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,876
Listen, Noritoshi,

480
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,876
you have talent.

481
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,959
You can use it to

482
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,959
save lots of people.

483
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,292
-(Young Kamo sobbing)

484
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,292
-The more people you save,

485
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,500
the more you'll be recognized.

486
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:45,918
Then in turn, all kinds

487
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:45,918
of people will help you.

488
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,083
You'll only be alone for now,

489
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:52,375
and one day, once you've

490
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:52,375
become a great sorcerer,

491
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,167
I know you'll come and get me.

492
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay.

493
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,542
That's a good reason.

494
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:04,709
Strike!

495
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,209
Batter out! Change up!

496
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,000
[Iori] Kamo, you'll never

497
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,000
get a hit if you don't

498
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,000
swing!

499
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:15,083
They call me Tanaka of Tohoku!

500
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,334
No, Tanaka's the

501
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,334
Tanaka of Tohoku.

502
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:18,000
And Tanaka's a pitcher!

503
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,918
[Inumaki] Bonito flakes.

504
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,959
(Kugisaki growls)

505
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,959
Huh?

506
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,000
What the hell is that?

507
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,834
Uh oh, Kugisaki snapped!

508
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,834
It's a free-for-all!

509
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,209
Hey, using a pitching

510
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,209
machine is against the rules!

511
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:36,751
I don't know what

512
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:36,751
you're talking about.

513
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,542
This is just a spare.

514
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,542
It's a spare Mechamaru.

515
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:42,626
We had no other choice, since

516
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:42,626
your Panda broke our main one.

517
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,959
Huh, a pitching machine, eh?

518
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,876
I guess I don't understand,

519
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,626
but you know a lot

520
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,626
about machines.

521
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:49,626
Hey, are you an otaku?

522
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,083
It's just one thing after

523
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,083
another with you, huh?

524
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:56,375
And yet somehow you're

525
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:56,375
still a student here.

526
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,375
(grunts) Fine! I'll

527
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,375
get a hit anyway!

528
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,209
[Itadori] All right,

529
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,209
she got on base!

530
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:05,250
[Fushiguro] Fueled by rage.

531
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:08,459
(casual catchy music)

532
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,042
[Satoru] Out!

533
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,083
(intense music)

534
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,709
(Mai scoffs)

535
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,000
(Maki grunts)

536
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,876
[Itadori] Yeah!

537
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,500
Gone! Home run.

538
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,417
Huh?

539
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,417
Oh!

540
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,834
Ah!

541
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,209
Ah! Cheater!

542
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:08,375
[Inumaki] Bonito flakes!

543
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,667
Kugisaki, go back.

544
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,667
Catcher, huh?

545
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,042
As catcher, you'll

546
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,042
call the shots,

547
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,292
lead the defense, et cetera.

548
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,292
One has to say it's a

549
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,292
fitting

550
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,292
position for my brother,

551
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,959
but I want a real face-off,

552
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,083
a face-off with Pitcher Itadori.

553
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:33,334
Todo.

554
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,125
You could have

555
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,125
been their pitcher.

556
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,334
No, he couldn't.

557
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,876
Mechamaru had to pitch

558
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,876
because it's all he can do.

559
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,459
Promise me this, brother.

560
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:46,292
In a second, if I hit

561
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:46,292
a home run right here,

562
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,709
next time you'll pitch.

563
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:48,709
Ow!

564
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,500
(gasps) Todo! Hang in there!

565
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,709
Hey, nice pitch!

566
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,167
[Both] Nice pitch.

567
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,375
-Nice pitch!

568
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,375
-Nice pitch, Maki!

569
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,250
-Nice pitch!

570
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,250
-Really, it wasn't bad.

571
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:06,751
-Way to go!

572
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:06,751
-That was a good one.

573
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,167
-Cool, man.

574
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,167
-Nice pitch, Maki.

575
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:11,709
Wow, bro.

576
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,167
Everyone really hates

577
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,167
you. I mean, everyone.

578
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,500
Do you still hate young Itadori?

579
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:25,751
It's not about

580
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:25,751
liking or hating him.

581
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,250
The fact is that Itadori

582
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,125
isn't allowed to exist

583
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,125
under jujutsu laws.

584
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:33,125
He's only still alive due

585
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:33,125
to Gojo's selfishness.

586
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,375
We must not bend the

587
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,375
rules of the group

588
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:38,042
for any one individual,

589
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,751
especially as we know

590
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,751
that many others may die

591
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,751
because Itadori lives.

592
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:47,542
But there are lives that were

593
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:47,542
saved thanks to him, too.

594
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,250
Case in point, he worked

595
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,250
together with Todo

596
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:52,375
to fend off the special-grade.

597
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,417
Not that this applies

598
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,417
only to our students,

599
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,375
but they're going to

600
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,375
stack up many regrets

601
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,834
as their lives go on.

602
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:03,792
I wish I had done that.

603
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:03,792
I wish they'd done this.

604
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:07,334
I should have said that. I

605
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:07,334
wish someone had told me this.

606
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,375
To be honest with you,

607
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:13,292
I don't know what

608
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:13,292
the right decision is

609
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,792
when it comes to Itadori.

610
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:22,584
For now, let's just watch

611
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:22,584
over him, all right?

612
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:25,250
(energetic music)

613
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,959
Whoa, he made it!

614
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,792
Yeah, Inumaki's

615
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,792
surprisingly fast, huh?

616
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:33,083
[Inumaki] Salted roe.

617
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,584
[Iori] Mai, Miwa! Watch

618
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,584
out for the steal!

619
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:40,292
How about we save our

620
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:40,292
regrets for another day?

621
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,000
(energetic music continues)

622
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,250
Nailed it.

623
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:08,125
Yes!

624
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:21,292
(Satoru laughing)

625
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,626
[Gakuganji] Yaga, do

626
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,626
something about Gojo first.

627
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,834
(closing theme music)

628
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:41,250
(singing in Japanese)

629
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,959
[Cast] Juju Stroll!

630
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:58,959
[Inumaki] Salmon.

631
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:03,000
I'll say rice.

632
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,751
But then again, I

633
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,751
do like bread too.

634
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,500
Hey, wait! Does it

635
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,500
come with roe on it?

636
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:10,125
I'm rice.

637
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:10,834
Rice, I suppose.

638
00:23:10,918 --> 00:23:13,417
What? No way, I'm a bread girl!

639
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:15,959
[Inumaki] Salted rice ball.

640
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:18,959
Obviously it's bread

641
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:18,959
because I'm a panda!

642
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,042
You want me to kill you or what?

643
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,626
I don't know.

644
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:26,584
This one feels kind

645
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:26,584
of forced somehow.

646
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,792
It's not you.

647
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,792
They're out of ideas.

648
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,417
Time to go home.

649
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,626
(intense music)
