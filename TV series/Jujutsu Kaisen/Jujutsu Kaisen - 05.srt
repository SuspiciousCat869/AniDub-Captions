1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,083
(shoes tapping)

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:06,250
What are you waiting for?

3
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:08,500
If you're gonna switch

4
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:08,500
then do it already.

5
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:14,083
Something wrong, brat?

6
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:39,584
The Innate Domain's closed off.

7
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:40,500
The special grade is dead.

8
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,584
Now we just need Itadori

9
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,584
to return safely.

10
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:51,584
Yeah, sorry but he isn't

11
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:51,584
going to be coming back.

12
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:54,459
There's no reason to be scared.

13
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm in such a great

14
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,000
mood right now.

15
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,459
Let's just chat for a bit.

16
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:02,959
The kid had it coming

17
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:05,584
for just using me without

18
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:05,584
making any kind of a deal,

19
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:06,792
and now it feels like,

20
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:08,500
he's having some

21
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:08,500
trouble switching back

22
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,918
but then no matter what he did,

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,792
this would've ended up the same.

24
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:20,626
So I've been thinking

25
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:20,626
about the different ways,

26
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,125
I can do this.

27
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:29,042
(laughs)

28
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,334
What are you doing?

29
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm taking this brat a hostage.

30
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:42,500
What do you mean?

31
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,959
It's simple.

32
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,959
See, I can live without this,

33
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:47,167
but that ain't true

34
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:47,167
for your punk friend.

35
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,292
Switching out with

36
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,292
me means he dies.

37
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:56,209
Oh, and also for good measure.

38
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:02,292
Sukuna's finger.

39
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,292
That special grade

40
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,292
cursed spirit in there,

41
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,334
must have swallowed it.

42
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,500
And with that, I'm

43
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,500
now is free as a bird,

44
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:11,667
and now you can be frightened

45
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:15,292
because I'm about to kill

46
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:15,292
you just for the hell of

47
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:15,292
it.

48
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,584
And just like that, our

49
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,584
positions are now reversed.

50
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:31,792
(Opening Theme Music)

51
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,834
The only thing granted

52
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,834
equally to all,

53
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:03,542
is an unfair reality.

54
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,334
You don't get it, but I do.

55
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:21,000
Itadori is coming back,

56
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,500
even if that means he'll die,

57
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,834
that's just who he is.

58
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:27,459
You give him too much credit.

59
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,042
He's just a little tougher

60
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,042
and a whole lot denser

61
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,292
than other human beings are.

62
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,459
You should've seen

63
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,459
him a minute ago.

64
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:37,667
He was scared out of his

65
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:37,667
mind and about to lose it.

66
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:41,834
Prattling on about his

67
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:41,834
regrets and all that

68
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:41,834
nonsense.

69
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,250
So it's obvious the guy

70
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,250
doesn't have the guts

71
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:45,584
to kill himself.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,584
His left hand's been restored.

73
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,334
Healing.

74
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,500
He can use reverse

75
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,500
curse techniques

76
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:01,250
and Sukuna's incarnated.

77
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,500
So even though he can

78
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,500
live without a heart,

79
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:06,250
it should still be

80
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:06,250
damaging to him.

81
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,334
I'll make sure he heals that

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,334
heart before Itadori returns.

83
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,876
I just have to convince

84
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,876
him he can't beat me

85
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,292
without a heart in his body.

86
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:17,167
But can I do that?

87
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,083
I froze up when that

88
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,083
other special-grade

89
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:21,459
was in front of me.

90
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:29,334
It's not about

91
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:29,334
whether I can do it,

92
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:30,834
I have to do it.

93
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,292
Oh, it feels so good to

94
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,292
be back outside again.

95
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,292
Let's use all this open space.

96
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,417
(grunts)

97
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,709
How interesting.

98
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,584
You can use your Shikigami,

99
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,083
but you still come

100
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,083
at me yourself.

101
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,584
(grunts)

102
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,459
Give me more.

103
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:04,083
And more.

104
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:12,209
Put more curse behind it,

105
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,459
when you strike me.

106
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,667
(laughs)

107
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Orochi.

108
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Gang up on him now.

109
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:42,042
Now, what did I say?

110
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,834
Let's use the open space.

111
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,167
It's not even a

112
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,167
matter of jujutsu,

113
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,626
his power and his agility

114
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,626
are on a different level.

115
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,250
That's a nice technique there.

116
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:18,500
(grunts)

117
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,459
Now what?

118
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,083
I used up one of my Shikigami

119
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,083
to escape that Innate Domain.

120
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:40,042
Demon Dog White and

121
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:40,042
Orochi are both destroyed

122
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,584
and Nue's at his limit.

123
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,751
I should release him before

124
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,751
he gets destroyed too.

125
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,209
I get it now.

126
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:56,876
You use the shadows to

127
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:56,876
create your Shikigami.

128
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,334
It makes no difference

129
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,334
if he knows that now.

130
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,417
So what's it to you?

131
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,542
It's not a generic

132
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,542
technique that uses charms,

133
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:08,709
it's adaptable as well.

134
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,667
There's just one

135
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,667
thing I don't get.

136
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,417
Why did you run back then?

137
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,334
Kind of a waste of your talents.

138
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:21,626
Whatever.

139
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,167
Either way that certainly

140
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,167
won't be enough to fix this.

141
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,083
So he's figured it out.

142
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,584
Risking your life

143
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,584
for meaningless shit.

144
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:33,417
This punk isn't even close

145
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:33,417
to being worth the effort.

146
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,584
[Itadori] Why'd you

147
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,584
bother saving me then?

148
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:45,125
[Megumi] The only thing

149
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:45,125
granted equally to all,

150
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,834
is an unfair reality.

151
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,918
If I have the time

152
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,918
to curse someone,

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,542
I'd rather spend it thinking

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,542
about people I love.

155
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:57,709
[Megumi] There was

156
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:57,709
never any doubt as to

157
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,459
what a good person she was.

158
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,709
She deserved happiness

159
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,709
more than anyone ever did,

160
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,834
but Tsumiki was still cursed.

161
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,751
While the father

162
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,751
who named Megumi,

163
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:16,125
with no regard for my gender,

164
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,626
is still off somewhere

165
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,626
living as he pleases.

166
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,667
Karma isn't fully automatic.

167
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,000
Evil people are only

168
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,000
judged under the law.

169
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,667
Jujutsu sorcerers

170
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,667
are just another cog

171
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,292
in that machine of retribution.

172
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,667
I want good people

173
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,667
to enjoy fairness,

174
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,125
even if only a few will.

175
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,667
And so, I save people unequally.

176
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,459
That's the way.

177
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,751
So this is when you start

178
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,751
burning through your life.

179
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:08,751
Now I see.

180
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:12,667
Well, in that case,

181
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,918
Megumi, show me what you got.

182
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:23,375
Sacred treasure, swing and ring,

183
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,500
ring Eight Grip.

184
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,584
Oh and just so you know,

185
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:37,500
I didn't have any logical

186
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:37,500
reason for saving you back

187
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:37,500
then.

188
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:40,584
Even though it was dangerous,

189
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,500
I just couldn't bear to see

190
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,500
a good person like you die.

191
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:45,167
Sure I had my reservations,

192
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:49,500
but ultimately I did it for

193
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:49,500
selfish emotional reasons,

194
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,167
but that's fine though.

195
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:55,792
I'm a jujutsu sorcerer.

196
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,500
I'm not a hero.

197
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,167
In all this time,

198
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:05,292
I've never once

199
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:05,292
regretted saving you.

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,542
Right,

201
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,876
you're really a pretty

202
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,876
smart guy Fushiguro.

203
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,626
I know you've put a lot

204
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,626
of thought into this.

205
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,667
I think your conviction

206
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,667
is a good one,

207
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:24,000
but I don't think mine

208
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:24,000
is exactly wrong either.

209
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:30,876
Sorry, I guess I'm done for.

210
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,876
At least I won't be here

211
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,876
worrying about you anymore,

212
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,334
or Kugisaki or Gojou.

213
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:40,918
I hope you live a long life.

214
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,209
(dramatic music)

215
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:11,250
(upbeat music)

216
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,667
Well, you're gonna tell me,

217
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,834
what possibly could

218
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,834
have been so important

219
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,167
that you decided to use a

220
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,167
precious finger on Sukuna?

221
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,626
Tried to see how strong he is?

222
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,292
Well, the test was half

223
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,292
baked, I'll admit that,

224
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,709
but we did still

225
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,709
learn a few things.

226
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:49,292
I can only pray

227
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:49,292
that's not an excuse.

228
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:52,500
(mumbles)

229
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:53,709
Stop talking already,

230
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:58,167
no one can understand you.

231
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,375
Yet the meaning flows

232
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,375
right into our minds.

233
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,792
It creeps me out.

234
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,334
Hello and welcome.

235
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,375
Would you like a

236
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,375
table for one, sir?

237
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,375
Yes, thank you.

238
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,500
One for lunch.

239
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,000
I told them that if

240
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,000
they encountered one,

241
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,459
their choices were

242
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,459
either run or die.

243
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:33,459
I specifically warned them

244
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,542
that fighting was

245
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,542
absolutely not an option.

246
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,792
It was intentional huh?

247
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:42,459
What do you mean by that?

248
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,876
The special grade

249
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,876
sending first years

250
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,834
to rescue five people

251
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,834
who may already be dead,

252
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:50,375
should have been

253
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:50,375
out of the question.

254
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,209
Besides with Yuuji,

255
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,667
I was the one who

256
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,667
forced the issue

257
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,918
and got the kid's execution

258
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,918
sentence suspended.

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,709
Some higher-ups

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,709
didn't like that,

261
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,584
and so they took

262
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,584
advantage of my absence

263
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,375
and used the special

264
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,375
grade to dispose of Yuuji.

265
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,083
If the other two

266
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,083
had died as well,

267
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,959
it'd mean more trouble for me,

268
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,042
and they would have killed

269
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,042
two birds with one stone.

270
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:15,709
Yeah, but wait, when the

271
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:15,709
initial dispatch went out,

272
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,459
no one knew it would

273
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:18,459
become a special grade.

274
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,792
Trying to pin the

275
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,792
blame is such a pain.

276
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:24,292
Maybe I ought to

277
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:24,292
just cut to the chase

278
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,500
and go kill off all

279
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,500
those higher-ups.

280
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,417
You're not usually

281
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,417
this emotional.

282
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,918
Good to see you, Miss Ieiri.

283
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,125
Sounds to me,

284
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,417
like you took quite

285
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,417
a liking to this one.

286
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:43,751
I've always been the kind of guy

287
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,083
who cares about his students.

288
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,083
Regardless, you shouldn't

289
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,083
torment Ijichi too much.

290
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:52,000
It's hard for him to be stuck

291
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:52,000
between us and the higher-ups.

292
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,292
Yes, I don't care about

293
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,292
another man's hardships.

294
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,459
Keep going, keep going.

295
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:56,751
Is that so?

296
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,417
So this here is

297
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,417
Sukuna's vessel huh?

298
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:06,918
I can cut him up, yes?

299
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,959
Just make good use of him.

300
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,042
Oh I will.

301
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,417
Who do you think I am?

302
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,042
He said live a long life?

303
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,667
Guess that doesn't mean

304
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,667
much when you die yourself.

305
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,375
First time having a partner

306
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,375
of yours die on you?

307
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,250
-One my age?

308
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,250
-Yeah.

309
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,876
You're taking it well though.

310
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:36,500
Yeah, you too.

311
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:38,334
Well, of course.

312
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,959
Two weeks ago, I

313
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,959
didn't even know him.

314
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm not the type to break

315
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:44,500
down and fall to pieces,

316
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:46,250
when a guy I barely know dies.

317
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,167
I mean, jeez.

318
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:02,834
It's hot, huh?

319
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,125
Yeah, wonder if it's

320
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,125
time for summer uniforms.

321
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:18,500
So what's this?

322
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,334
You're looking even more

323
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,334
bummed-out than usual, Megumi.

324
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,417
Having a wake?

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,542
What's up Zenin?

326
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:29,375
Stop calling me by my last name.

327
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,375
Maki, Maki.

328
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:31,000
Hey I'm talking here, shut it.

329
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,334
Are you serious right now?

330
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,334
You don't know why

331
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,334
they're so down now?

332
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,709
No, should I?

333
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,209
Someone died yesterday, a boy.

334
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:41,000
He was one of the first years.

335
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,125
Bonito flakes.

336
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,751
Well, why didn't you say so?

337
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,667
Now I look like some

338
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,667
kind of heartless,

339
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:48,042
cold-blooded ice-demon

340
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,876
Yeah, that's how you came off.

341
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:50,876
Tuna and mayo.

342
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,417
-Don't say that.

343
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,417
-So who are these guys?

344
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,584
You're supposed to try

345
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,584
to make me feel better.

346
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:55,709
The second years.

347
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:59,209
You have to try to be kinder

348
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:59,209
to your underclassmen.

349
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:02,250
Hey, being soft on them

350
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:02,250
isn't gonna help them.

351
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,417
[Megumi] Zenin is the

352
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,417
best of all the students

353
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,417
at wielding curse tools.

354
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,542
Salmon roe.

355
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,959
[Megumi] And that's the

356
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,959
Cursed Speech user, Inumaki.

357
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:11,959
He can only speak in

358
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:11,959
ingredients of rice balls.

359
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:16,375
He is a little bit softer

360
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:16,375
whenever Yuuta's around though.

361
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,209
And that's Panda.

362
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,584
There's one more.

363
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,042
His name is Okkotsu,

364
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,125
and he's actually the only

365
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,125
second year I genuinely

366
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,125
respect.

367
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:27,250
But he's overseas right now.

368
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:28,459
Panda?

369
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,209
That's all you're

370
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,209
giving me is Panda.

371
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:33,667
Sorry to hit you up with this

372
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:33,667
now when you're in mourning.

373
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,417
Bad timing.

374
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,918
Please forgive us for that.

375
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,334
But see, we'd like you both

376
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,542
to be in the Kyoto Sister

377
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,542
School Exchange Event.

378
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:45,792
Kyoto Sister School

379
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:45,792
Exchange Event?

380
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,792
What is that?

381
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,542
It's a get-together with the

382
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,542
other Tech school in Kyoto,

383
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,626
but isn't that event mainly

384
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:55,500
for second and

385
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:55,500
third year students?

386
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,417
Turns out the idiot third

387
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,417
years got themselves suspended,

388
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,667
so you need to participate.

389
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,250
So what exactly do

390
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,250
you do at this event?

391
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:05,459
Smash bros?

392
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,292
I rule at the Wii version.

393
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,042
I'll Meteor Smash your butts.

394
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,125
We'll make a three man team.

395
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:13,167
The whole event starts

396
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:13,167
with the principals

397
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,334
of the Tokyo and Kyoto schools.

398
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,834
Each principal proposes

399
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,834
a form of competition

400
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:20,709
that will be held

401
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:20,709
for an entire day,

402
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:23,042
over the course of two days.

403
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,209
At least that's how

404
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,209
it's supposed to go.

405
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,918
It goes like this.

406
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,292
Day one's team battles and

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,292
day two's individual

408
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,292
battles.

409
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,167
Salmon.

410
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,125
Team battles and individual?

411
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:37,292
You mean we fight other

412
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:37,292
jujutsu sorcerers.

413
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,125
Yeah, they're jujutsu battles

414
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,417
where anything short of

415
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,417
killing is fair game.

416
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,125
Don't worry, we'll train you up.

417
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:46,792
So you probably

418
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:46,792
won't get killed.

419
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:52,334
Do we have enough

420
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:52,334
jujutsu sorcerers?

421
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:54,000
I thought we were really short.

422
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,542
Do you have the time?

423
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:56,876
Hey, good question.

424
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,500
For now we're good.

425
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:01,250
The dark emotions people harbor

426
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:02,876
from late winter through spring,

427
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,542
cause an outburst of

428
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,542
curses in early summer,

429
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:07,709
so that's our busy season.

430
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,167
Sometimes we're

431
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,167
busy all year long,

432
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,000
but things should be settling

433
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,000
down here soon enough.

434
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,542
Yeah?

435
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:15,250
So are you in?

436
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,375
I understand your

437
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,375
partner just died.

438
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:18,876
-We're in.

439
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:18,876
-We're in.

440
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,000
Cause I...

441
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,083
Cause I...

442
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,709
Have to get stronger

443
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:26,709
and I'll do anything

444
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:26,709
to achieve that.

445
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,751
But if I decide your training

446
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,751
exchange event is pointless,

447
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,042
I'll quit instantly.

448
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,125
Same here.

449
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:34,417
Well, people this corky,

450
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,250
are all the more

451
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,250
worthwhile to train.

452
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:38,834
Bonito flakes.

453
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,792
So you're saying that your boss,

454
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:45,125
wants to reverse the

455
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:45,125
current relative positions

456
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:47,209
of humans and curses.

457
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,209
Is that right?

458
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:51,584
Yeah, that's pretty close,

459
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:52,500
but it's slightly different.

460
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,792
Humans are practically

461
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,792
made of lies,

462
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:59,751
for every positive action

463
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:59,751
and emotion they show,

464
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,292
there's always a flip side,

465
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,417
and yet negative emotions like

466
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,334
hatred and hostility are

467
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,334
truths without falsehood.

468
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,626
Since we curses are born

469
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,626
from those raw true emotions,

470
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:15,959
that makes us true pure beings.

471
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,834
Imitation should be eliminated.

472
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:19,792
Yet at the moment,

473
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,834
you're the ones who

474
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,834
are getting eliminated.

475
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:24,292
And that's why we've

476
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:24,292
come here to ask you,

477
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,626
what can we do to defeat

478
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,626
the jujutsu sorcerers?

479
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:33,584
If you want to win, you'll

480
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:33,584
need to fulfill two

481
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:33,584
conditions.

482
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,751
Good, what are these conditions?

483
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:40,334
The first thing, concerns

484
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:40,334
the strongest sorcerer.

485
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:44,792
You must somehow render Satoru

486
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:44,792
Gojou incapable of fighting.

487
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,459
The second, is to

488
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,459
get Ryoumen Sukuna

489
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,334
and Yuuji Itadori on your side.

490
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,667
But hold on a minute,

491
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,667
he died, didn't he?

492
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:57,209
Wait, that Yuuji

493
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:57,209
Itadori, he's dead.

494
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,626
Yeah?

495
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:00,709
Did he die?

496
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,125
I'm not so sure.

497
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:08,626
Don't poke around inside me

498
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:12,292
without my permission, punk-ass.

499
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:21,709
(Closing Theme Music)

500
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:47,918
[Both] Juju Stroll.

501
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,042
[Toge] Salmon.

502
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:50,751
[Maki] You stink.

503
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:52,209
[Panda] I don't stink.

504
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:54,751
[Maki] You stink.

505
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:55,834
I do not stink.

506
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,167
Why you be so mean?

507
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,334
You're treating

508
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,334
you like an animal.

509
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,500
Because you're a Panda.

510
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:03,751
Mustard leaf.

511
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,751
And you smell like an animal.

512
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,584
I keep telling you to take

513
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,584
a bath, but you don't.

514
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,959
I don't mind getting all wet.

515
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,334
Unlike you humans all us

516
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,334
panda bears don't sweat,

517
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,584
but I Febreze every day.

518
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:18,667
So I know I don't stick.

519
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:25,334
Here's your first task,

520
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,417
step up and take a whiff.

521
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,626
(sniffing)

522
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,042
He doesn't really stink.

523
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,375
