1
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,042
Hey, are you listening to me?

2
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:06,083
I told you!

3
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:09,375
The auto-locking door was

4
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:09,375
left hanging wide open!

5
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:10,209
Don't make me repeat myself!

6
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,584
I already reported

7
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,584
this last week too!

8
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,584
Why am I paying such

9
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,584
high management fees

10
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,125
for such crappy service?

11
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:19,250
Huh?

12
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:20,250
What?

13
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:22,042
Screw you, you'll do it today!

14
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,083
Come inspect it right now!

15
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:26,209
Are you even listening to me?

16
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,959
You're dead!

17
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,876
(opening theme music)

18
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:05,667
Taichi Kanada in

19
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:05,667
Morioka, in June.

20
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,709
Osamu Shimada in

21
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,709
Yokohama, in August.

22
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,751
Hiroshi Yamato in

23
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,751
Nagoya, in September.

24
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,167
All three died in

25
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,167
similar circumstances.

26
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,209
They were stabbed to

27
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,209
death by a cursed spirit

28
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:23,542
at the entrances to

29
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:23,542
their apartments.

30
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:26,375
And all three of them just

31
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:26,375
days prior to their murders

32
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,000
had filed the same complaint

33
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,000
with their property managers.

34
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,167
They all claimed they'd

35
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,167
found the security doors

36
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,334
left wide open.

37
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,918
"Episode 22: The Origin

38
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,918
of Blind Obedience"

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,792
None of the other residents

40
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:38,542
were able to provide

41
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:38,542
any other clues.

42
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,209
But none of these dates

43
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,209
or locations match.

44
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:43,500
Maybe it's not the

45
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:43,500
same cursed spirit?

46
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,167
Hey wait, what if the spirit

47
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,167
is messing with the doors?

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,042
Do cursed spirits trigger

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,042
those sensors, you think?

50
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,959
They don't show up

51
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,959
on cameras, right?

52
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:54,292
Apparently, the cursed spirit

53
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,584
made the door operating

54
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,584
mechanism go crazy,

55
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:57,626
not the sensors.

56
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,125
Ohhh.

57
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,375
Mechanisms?

58
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,584
Yeah. And as for whether or

59
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,584
not the same cursed spirit

60
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:06,751
was behind all three.

61
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:10,042
We couldn't make a decision

62
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:10,042
based on the residuals.

63
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,209
Too much time had

64
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,209
passed by then.

65
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,918
So, we looked for connections

66
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,918
between the three of them.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,417
And we discovered that all three

68
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,584
had attended the same

69
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,584
middle school for two years.

70
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,042
Which would mean

71
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,542
that all three must have

72
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,542
received the same curse.

73
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,250
And it didn't activate

74
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,250
until years later?

75
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:28,125
Oh!

76
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,167
Precisely.

77
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,417
That's highly likely.

78
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,209
So that's why we're on our way

79
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,209
to their middle school now.

80
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:36,250
We'll be picking up a fourth

81
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:36,250
man who also went there

82
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,417
and knew all of the victims.

83
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,959
I'm assigning you

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,959
three as sorcerers

85
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,250
to see what you can

86
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,250
find out from him.

87
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,167
Way to go, Kugisaki!

88
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,125
Hah! No sweat.

89
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,250
(sighs)

90
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,417
"Spirit Lantern"

91
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,334
"Morishita Family Funeral 11:00"

92
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:54,459
[Itadori] A funeral?

93
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,292
Is this the home of

94
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,292
that acquaintance?

95
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,792
Yeah.

96
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,042
Or it used to be.

97
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,626
Well, this sucks.

98
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,250
Turns out he died the same

99
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,250
way the other three did.

100
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,334
He lived with his family, so

101
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,334
there was no auto-locking

102
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,334
door,

103
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:15,000
but he was killed

104
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:15,000
right at the entrance,

105
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,500
just like the others.

106
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:18,209
And he'd also recently told

107
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:18,209
other family members that

108
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,209
another time he'd

109
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,209
come home alone,

110
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,042
he'd found that "the

111
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,042
door was unlocked,

112
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:23,292
"but it wouldn't open."

113
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:30,000
I asked his parents about

114
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:30,000
the other three victims,

115
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,834
but they said they didn't

116
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,834
know what relationship

117
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:33,500
he might've had with them.

118
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:35,209
Man, there goes our only lead!

119
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,334
Aagh, don't worry!

120
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,292
I'm sure we'll find something

121
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,292
at the middle school!

122
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,834
I sure hope so.

123
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,292
I've made you guys an

124
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,292
appointment with a teacher,

125
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,876
so I'm counting on you.

126
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,334
[Itadori] Roger that.

127
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,417
Oh? (snicker)

128
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:51,834
Hey, check out these two punks!

129
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,667
How about we kick their asses?

130
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,709
[Itadori] What for?

131
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:55,709
Hmm?

132
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:56,751
Huh?

133
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,918
Hmmm?

134
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,667
Uhh, it's good to see you again!

135
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:04,375
Well, look at that.

136
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,250
You're getting some respect.

137
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:08,876
An aura just pours out,

138
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,667
even if you try your

139
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,667
best to hide it.

140
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:13,292
[Student A] We haven't seen you

141
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:13,292
since graduation, Fushiguro!

142
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:16,751
Huh?

143
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:21,709
I uh went to school here.

144
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,500
Well that's a surprise

145
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,500
but that's not the point!

146
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:25,667
Explain yourself!

147
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:26,667
What'd you do?

148
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,542
What happened when you

149
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,542
were at this school?

150
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,709
Wait! Maybe we should

151
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,709
just ask these two!

152
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,334
Hey, Idiot A and Idiot B,

153
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,334
just what'd this guy do to

154
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,334
you?

155
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:37,083
We both, along with

156
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:37,083
every other stoner

157
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,375
and slacker and delinquent

158
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,375
here at this school

159
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,751
got beat up by Fushiguro.

160
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:42,792
Huh?

161
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:49,125
Pretty much, yeah.

162
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:51,459
Why're you talking like a robot?

163
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:52,751
Would you look at me!

164
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,959
What is your deal?

165
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,959
What the hell's going

166
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,959
on here with you?

167
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,584
Hey you three!

168
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,751
Who are you?

169
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,542
Students from other schools

170
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,542
are not allowed in here!

171
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,751
Who're you to be

172
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,751
questioning us, huh?

173
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:04,417
He's clearly staff.

174
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,918
Take it down a notch.

175
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,417
We have permission

176
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,417
to visit today.

177
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,417
Hmm?

178
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,292
Ahh, the investigators?

179
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,375
How very young you all are!

180
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,459
Please keep your pass visible

181
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,459
for your entire stay here.

182
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,751
Oh!

183
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,000
Is that Fushiguro?

184
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,751
Hello.

185
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,792
[Both] He remembers you!

186
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:27,584
So this man has been here

187
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:27,584
for a long time then?

188
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,000
Probably.

189
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,375
Takeda was a member

190
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,375
of the staff.

191
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,459
Great, then I leave it to you!

192
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,375
How convenient.

193
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:40,417
Kanada, Shimada, Yamato

194
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:40,417
and now Morishita too, eh?

195
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,250
It's quite a shock

196
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,250
to hear about this.

197
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,250
But it must be

198
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,250
nearly 20 years now

199
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:48,042
since those boys graduated.

200
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:51,542
Still I remember it

201
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:51,542
like it was yesterday.

202
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:55,250
They were all

203
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:55,250
problem children too,

204
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,125
though not as bad as you.

205
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,042
What do you want to know?

206
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,500
Curious rumors, or dark rumors,

207
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:03,292
or connections to bad adults.

208
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,542
[Both] Hey, problem child!

209
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:09,042
Also anything of

210
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:09,042
ill omen, of course.

211
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,083
Dark rumors?

212
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:11,918
They could be difficult,

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,792
but it was just your

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,792
average middle school stuff.

215
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,375
Then again, ill omen?

216
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,500
Are you talking

217
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,500
about that old story?

218
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:21,667
The Yasohachi Bridge?

219
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,167
That one?

220
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,042
You're still here A and B?

221
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,083
What's the Yasohachi Bridge?

222
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,626
It's a suicide site.

223
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,667
Considered haunted by

224
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,667
some of the locals.

225
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,292
Oh yes you're right!

226
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,375
Back then it was all the

227
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,375
rage among delinquents

228
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,209
to bungee jump off Yasohachi

229
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,209
Bridge late at night

230
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:38,792
to test one's courage.

231
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,042
What a bunch of weirdos.

232
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,667
I'm surprised there are

233
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,667
people dumber than me!

234
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:44,542
What do you use for a cord?

235
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,542
No no, we don't bungee jump!

236
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:48,584
We just heard people

237
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:48,584
talking about it.

238
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,500
It's a thing from

239
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,500
back in the day.

240
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:53,209
One day Kanada and

241
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:53,209
the other three

242
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,083
all were absent

243
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,083
without permission.

244
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,125
By itself that wasn't strange.

245
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,709
Then, when we contacted

246
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,709
all of their families,

247
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,667
we learned that none

248
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,667
of the four boys

249
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:04,709
had come home from

250
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:04,709
school the day before.

251
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,542
It caused a pretty big stir.

252
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:12,834
Then they were found laying

253
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:12,834
under the bridge, unconscious.

254
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:15,500
They got chewed out

255
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:15,500
good as I recall.

256
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:18,209
But all four of them

257
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:18,209
swore up and down

258
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:20,125
that they didn't

259
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:20,125
remember a thing.

260
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,083
I think that's it.

261
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,876
As a matter of fact I've

262
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,876
been to that bridge.

263
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,918
To bungee jump?

264
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,918
Just like in schools,

265
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,167
curses can take root

266
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,167
in haunted locations.

267
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,292
So people from Jujutsu High

268
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,292
regularly patrol that bridge.

269
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,542
There wasn't anything

270
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,542
strange at the time.

271
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,626
Even though it became

272
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,626
a little famous,

273
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,083
it's still in use

274
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,083
as a normal bridge.

275
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,417
We still have to go and

276
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,417
check it out though.

277
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,125
I agree.

278
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:50,167
Fushiguro?

279
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:53,626
There's something I was

280
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:53,626
hoping to ask you about.

281
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:54,626
What is it?

282
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,918
When you were in school here

283
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,459
Tsukimi always took care of you.

284
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,876
Is she doing okay these days?

285
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,209
Yes.

286
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:06,626
Wait, who is Tsumiki?

287
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:07,626
My sister.

288
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:08,709
What?

289
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:12,125
How come you never tell us

290
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:12,125
anything about yourself?

291
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,709
Yeah, what she said!

292
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,751
When they find cursed

293
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,751
objects like these...

294
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,667
Why don't they

295
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,667
just destroy them?

296
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:21,500
They can't destroy them.

297
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:24,584
Not with the special-grades.

298
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,626
So they use a pact to

299
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,626
put their life on pause

300
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:31,167
to not harm others but

301
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:31,167
preserve their existence.

302
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,542
[Mahito] Sukuna's

303
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,542
fingers still cause harm.

304
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:35,500
That's an exception.

305
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:38,959
Sukuna's a monster that

306
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:38,959
will still attract curses,

307
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,792
even after it became

308
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,792
a cursed object

309
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,626
and was divided into 20 pieces.

310
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,751
So it can choose,

311
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,751
its own vessel.

312
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,209
Huh, well, then anyone will

313
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,209
work for this purpose, right?

314
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,542
(heaving breaths)

315
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,542
Hey listen...

316
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:57,542
Cash?

317
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:58,584
Cash!

318
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,792
Right? That's what

319
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,792
you want isn't it?

320
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:01,834
I can get it!

321
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:02,834
All you want!

322
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,375
So will this one work okay?

323
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:09,209
He still can't see me

324
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:09,209
even at this juncture.

325
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,417
His ability level is low.

326
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,834
Open up and say ahh!

327
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:15,042
(gagging)

328
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,209
(upbeat music)

329
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:22,626
"Jujutsu Kaisen"

330
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:27,667
(erie music)

331
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,042
"Jujutsu Kaisen"

332
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:35,042
(cars passing)

333
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:44,000
[Akari] We're here.

334
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,000
Koi no Kuchi Canyon,

335
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,000
Yasohachi Bridge.

336
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,250
Once you confirm a cursed

337
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,250
spirit

338
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,250
is here, I'll lower a veil.

339
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:52,417
You got it!

340
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:53,834
(erie music)

341
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:57,751
Hey. Sorry to ask you this

342
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:57,751
when you just woke up.

343
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:01,042
But could you go run a

344
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:01,042
little errand for me?

345
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,584
(monster howl)

346
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,667
(yawning)

347
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:12,792
What a bust.

348
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,709
Not hide nor hair

349
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,709
of a cursed spirit.

350
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,918
We didn't sense any presences

351
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,918
or any residuals either.

352
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,083
I see.

353
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:22,876
I guess this isn't it.

354
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,292
We're back to square one.

355
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,709
Won't matters get worse

356
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,709
if we don't hurry?

357
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,626
[Nobara] Why?

358
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,709
Well it's a famous

359
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,709
haunted location, right?

360
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,751
So, there might still be

361
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,751
plenty

362
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,751
of others who got cursed.

363
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:38,542
And right now, the death

364
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:38,542
rate's at a hundred percent.

365
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:39,751
We don't want to see

366
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:39,751
any others die, right?

367
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:42,918
[Nobara] Yeah, true.

368
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,250
Donngg!

369
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,417
Bungee jumping was all

370
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,417
the rage back then!

371
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,250
So maybe the act of

372
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,250
jumping off is the key?

373
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:49,918
Did she really just say "dong"?

374
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,918
Did I actually hear that?

375
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,918
She did, she did!

376
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,292
Doesn't matter, Itadori

377
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,292
already tried that.

378
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,292
Huh?

379
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,125
Aagh!

380
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:03,042
You didn't really jump with that

381
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:03,042
vinyl cord tied to you did you?

382
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:05,667
Gyaaah!

383
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:06,709
Agh!

384
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,918
Hey, there you are!

385
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,334
-Oh thank goodness!

386
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,334
-Hm?

387
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,375
Fushiguro!

388
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,918
Who's this guy?

389
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,042
He's that guy you

390
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,042
were making fun of.

391
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:17,918
I think you called

392
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:17,918
him "Idiot A".

393
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,834
Oh!

394
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:21,751
You were talking about

395
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:21,751
Yasohachi Bridge.

396
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,918
So I thought I

397
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,918
might find you here.

398
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,751
Fujinuma?

399
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:26,918
Hm?

400
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,459
A classmate.

401
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:29,500
My big sister

402
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,542
It's nice that you still

403
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,542
remember me, Fushiguro.

404
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,709
[Idiot A] I was talking to

405
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,709
my

406
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,709
sister about you yesterday

407
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:38,334
and... uh...

408
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,125
Yes well, Morishita's funeral

409
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:41,792
was held in our neighborhood.

410
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,167
So then when my brother said

411
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,959
that you were looking into

412
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,959
him and also Yasohachi Bridge,

413
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:52,751
I thought maybe the two

414
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:52,751
things were related.

415
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,626
What two things?

416
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,167
[Fujinuma] Morishita's

417
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,167
unexpected death,

418
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,959
and Yasohachi Bridge.

419
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:02,125
No they're not.

420
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:03,125
No connection.

421
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:04,542
You see, I...

422
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:06,000
I went there too!

423
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,000
In eighth grade I went to

424
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,000
the bridge late one night!

425
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:13,375
Has anything out of the ordinary

426
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,167
happened at home recently?

427
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,834
Any strange feelings that

428
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,834
seem to only affect you

429
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:17,876
and no one else?

430
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,167
That's just it!

431
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,667
You see my family runs

432
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,667
a shop here in town.

433
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,042
And lately I've been finding

434
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,918
the shop's automatic door

435
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,918
wide open when I come home,

436
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,751
but it only happens to me!

437
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:37,918
Mom and Dad both told me

438
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:37,918
it's just a coincidence.

439
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,792
But there was definitely

440
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,792
something there!

441
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,542
It scared me.

442
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:47,584
And yesterday my brother

443
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:47,584
told me about you three

444
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,834
and I remembered that

445
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,834
night out at the bridge.

446
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:54,000
[Akari] When did the issue

447
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:54,000
with your automatic door

448
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:54,000
start?

449
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,042
[Fujinuma] It's happened

450
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,042
about every other day

451
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,792
for exactly one week now.

452
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,584
So there's at least two weeks

453
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,417
between the time

454
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,417
when the four victims

455
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,876
first noticed something

456
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,876
wrong and the day they died.

457
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,584
We still have some time.

458
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,709
Wait, you didn't go

459
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,709
out to that bridge

460
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:09,959
all by yourself did you?

461
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,083
Do you remember

462
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,083
who you went with?

463
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,876
So then this really does

464
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,876
have something to do with--

465
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,500
No it's just about your door!

466
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,709
And it has nothing to do

467
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,709
with Morishita's death

468
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:19,959
or anyone else's!

469
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,626
Fushiguro and his friends here

470
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,584
are just helping me with

471
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,584
research for my college

472
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,584
report:

473
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:25,918
"Electromagnetic Waves

474
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:25,918
from Haunted Locations

475
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,709
"and their Effects

476
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,709
on Electronic Stuff

477
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,500
Such a pain in the neck!

478
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:33,250
But I need to get reports

479
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:33,250
from all kinds of sources.

480
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:36,459
So I'd love to hear who was

481
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:36,459
with you out at the bridge.

482
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,125
After lying to her like

483
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,125
this we'd better save her

484
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:46,250
It was a test of courage for

485
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:46,250
three of us in the same club.

486
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,334
And in fact, Fushiguro,

487
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:50,250
your sister Tsumiki was

488
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:50,250
there with us that night.

489
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,083
Tsumiki?

490
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,918
Not his sister?

491
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,250
I see.

492
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,959
I'll ask Tsumiki what

493
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,959
she remembers about it.

494
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:00,125
Okay!

495
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:03,751
Then I guess I can just give

496
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:03,751
these two a ride back home now.

497
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,292
You three keep working on

498
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,292
the report until I get back.

499
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,250
There's something going

500
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,250
on here isn't there?

501
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:11,417
Well I can't very well let

502
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:11,417
you both go home on one bike!

503
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:20,751
Fushiguro.

504
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,292
Fushiguro!

505
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,792
Fushiguro, you've

506
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,792
gotta snap out of it.

507
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,584
You gotta make sure

508
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,584
that she's safe!

509
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,876
I'm alright.

510
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,876
Hang on, I just need a moment.

511
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,292
Yes, I understand.

512
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,876
You need guard for

513
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,876
Tsumiki, right?

514
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,959
I'll try, but as

515
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,959
far as sorcerers,

516
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:53,667
second-grades are

517
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:53,667
all that's available.

518
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:54,834
Second grade...

519
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:56,167
And, since the number of victims

520
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,334
there far exceeds our estimates,

521
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,709
we'll probably

522
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,709
have to re-evaluate

523
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,209
the curse's grade, as well.

524
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:04,709
And another thing.

525
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,083
You were probably

526
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,083
assigned this mission

527
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,709
with Itadori's growth

528
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,709
taken into account.

529
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,542
So if it's even more dangerous

530
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,542
than was originally thought,

531
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:14,000
then it might be too much

532
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:14,000
for a second-grade sorcerer.

533
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,375
It's just as dangerous

534
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,375
for all of you, as well.

535
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,918
Personally, I

536
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,918
recommend you withdraw.

537
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:22,375
What do I do?

538
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,417
Do I go back by

539
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,417
myself right now?

540
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,209
No, the mission was already

541
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,209
dangerous for all three of

542
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,209
us.

543
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,709
I can't leave it to

544
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,709
just the two of them.

545
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,167
Gojo will return next week.

546
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,042
I could wait and ask him then...

547
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,542
No, I can't!

548
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:41,542
The time limit is

549
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:41,542
the big problem!

550
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,959
This isn't the type of cursed

551
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,959
spirit that attacks someone.

552
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,125
It's the type that

553
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,125
activates a cursed technique

554
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,334
from within a marked person.

555
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,584
So there's no point staying

556
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,584
nearby and protecting them!

557
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,584
I have to exorcise

558
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,584
it right away!

559
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,876
Why were you talking

560
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,876
to Ijichi just now?

561
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,250
About your sister?

562
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:57,083
Is she okay?

563
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,751
Yes she's fine.

564
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:02,417
But this mission's danger

565
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:02,417
level just shot up.

566
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,792
Other sorcerers will be

567
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,792
taking over the case.

568
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,083
You two can go home now.

569
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,250
Wait, why just us two?

570
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:12,250
Hey!

571
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:13,250
What about you?

572
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,250
I'll leave after I

573
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,250
say goodbye to Takeda.

574
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,959
Now just go!

575
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,000
(cellphone rings)

576
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,167
Hello, Nitta.

577
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,417
Thanks for your help.

578
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,626
There's something

579
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,626
I want to ask you.

580
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:35,000
[Nitta] About the

581
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:35,000
procedure, right?

582
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,167
Fujinuma didn't go over the

583
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,167
side of Yasohachi Bridge.

584
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,083
They held their test of

585
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,083
courage underneath the bridge.

586
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:44,250
Itadori went under it, too.

587
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:47,250
[Nitta] Most likely, you

588
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:47,250
can't

589
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:47,250
get below it from up above.

590
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,083
The cursed spirit is

591
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,083
within its barrier,

592
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,000
so the procedure's important.

593
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,250
You go at night,

594
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,250
from underneath.

595
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:55,417
And one more thing...

596
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,042
It's impossible to

597
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,042
constantly keep a domain

598
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,626
imbued with a technique

599
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,626
deployed forever.

600
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:04,292
Which means it's

601
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:04,292
like that barrier

602
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,959
at the juvenile

603
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,959
detention center,

604
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,500
an incomplete domain.

605
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,667
I'm actually lucky

606
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,667
this time around.

607
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,667
Since I won't need a veil.

608
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,292
You really don't tell us

609
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,292
enough about yourself.

610
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,042
Sure don't.

611
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,125
If you didn't

612
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,125
notice us until now

613
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:28,334
you're seriously lost in space.

614
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,125
We're not saying you have

615
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,125
to tell us everything

616
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,500
but come on, at

617
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,500
least let us help.

618
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,334
We're friends, aren't we?

619
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,125
Tsumiki...

620
00:18:48,334 --> 00:18:49,250
Is still bedridden.

621
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:50,292
(light gasps)

622
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,167
The curse of the

623
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,167
Yasohachi Bridge

624
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,292
only appears to its victims.

625
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:01,334
Since she can't

626
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:01,334
communicate herself.

627
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,125
I have no idea when she'll

628
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,125
be killed by the curse.

629
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,083
So I want to exorcise

630
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,083
it right away.

631
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,584
But now that our mission's

632
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,584
danger level increased...

633
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:14,709
Okay, okay!

634
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,167
Geez, we get it now.

635
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,083
You should have just told us

636
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,083
all of that from the start.

637
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,751
(pleased soft chuckle)

638
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,876
The cursed spirit is

639
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,876
within its barrier,

640
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,042
so the procedure's important.

641
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,292
You go at night,

642
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,292
from underneath.

643
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,834
And one more thing...

644
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:36,250
At the bottom of the canyon

645
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:36,250
there might be a river.

646
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,918
Crossing a river or other border

647
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,792
acts that symbolize crossing

648
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,792
over to the afterlife

649
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:50,209
these carry important

650
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:50,209
meanings in sorcery.

651
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:03,751
(monster chittering, warbling)

652
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,000
There it is.

653
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,375
I'm looking forward to this.

654
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:11,292
(monster warbling)

655
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,459
Huh?

656
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,000
What's this?

657
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,959
Someone beat me here?

658
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:27,876
Huh?

659
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,792
Fushiguro, this

660
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,792
one's different, huh?

661
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:31,792
Yeah.

662
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,667
Then why don't you two

663
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,667
focus on that first one.

664
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,083
I'll exorcise this one.

665
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,417
Is that so?

666
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,000
You're going to play

667
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,000
with me now, are you?

668
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,584
(ending theme music)

669
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,125
[Unison] Juju Stroll!

670
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:20,209
Help, stop that guy!

671
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:22,209
-He stole my purse!

672
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:22,209
-Huh?

673
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,918
Thanks!

674
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,542
This was so kind of you!

675
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,751
Allow me to treat

676
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,751
you to a free meal.

677
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:32,417
[Kugisaki] Oh we

678
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:32,417
couldn't accept that.

679
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,292
[Itadori] Of course we could!

680
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,375
Thank you!

681
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,375
I'd love to eat!

682
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,500
This restaurant has

683
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,500
been in my family

684
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:41,542
for four generations now.

685
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,542
That was supposed to come

686
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,542
to an end with my father.

687
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:45,584
But I stayed.

688
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,125
I insisted on trying to

689
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,125
keep it up and running.

690
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,959
I just wanted to

691
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,959
keep the restaurant,

692
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:52,334
and our special style

693
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:52,334
of cooking alive.

694
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,792
[Both] Ahhh!

695
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,792
What a nice story!

696
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,334
[Woman] Sorry for the wait!

697
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,334
Here's our pride and joy,

698
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,792
the gyoza meal passed

699
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,792
down for generations!

700
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:04,042
[Unison] Let's dig in!

701
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,626
Thank you for the meal!

702
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,417
So, guys.

703
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,584
Is it really gyoza

704
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,584
when there's no meat?

705
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:19,125
Basically just cabbage

706
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:19,125
and some thickener?

707
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,042
I'm so glad you said that!

708
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,209
Yeah, right!

709
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:25,292
And she was a really nice

710
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:25,292
woman and all that but come on!

711
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,334
But apparently, gyoza is

712
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,334
meant to be a vegetable dish,

713
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:30,042
not a meat dish.

714
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,125
[Unison] Seriously?

715
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,751
(upbeat instrumental music)
