-(birds chirping)

3
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,959
We'll be starting the

4
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,959
Event in one minute!

5
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:12,209
But, before we begin,

6
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:12,209
let's hear a few words

7
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:15,125
of well-appreciated

8
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:15,125
encouragement

9
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,209
from the always-eloquent

10
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,209
Utahime Iori!

11
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:18,209
What? Huh?

12
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:22,834
Well, I, uh, guess, uh,

13
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:24,584
although during this Event

14
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,876
some degree of injury

15
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,876
will be unavoidable,

16
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,584
you should, uh, uh, uh,

17
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,584
help each other out,

18
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:32,626
or something,

19
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:32,626
(chuckling) if you can?

20
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:34,375
[Gojou] Okay, sorry, time's up!

21
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:37,250
[Utahime] Ugh, Gojou

22
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:37,250
you jerk, I wasn't done!

23
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:41,417
[Gojou] Now, let the sister

24
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:41,417
school Exchange Event begin!

25
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,918
-(feedback squeaking)

26
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,918
-(energetic music)

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,209
[Utahime] You should

28
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,209
respect your seniors!

29
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:47,292
Ichiro?

30
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,292
So stupid.

31
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,083
Where did Toudou go?

32
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,417
How the hell should I know?

33
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,292
I'm not his babysitter!

34
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,709
[Kasumi] Can't we

35
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,709
all just get along?

36
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:59,626
(energetic rock music)

37
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:04,709
-(insects chittering)

38
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:04,709
-(birds chirping)

39
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:07,083
Where do you think the

40
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:07,083
cursed spirit boss is?

41
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,250
It was probably

42
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,250
unleashed at the midpoint

43
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:10,667
between the two groups,

44
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,459
but we can't expect

45
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,459
it to stand still.

46
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,667
At the pre-arranged

47
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,667
time, we'll all split

48
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:17,083
into the Megumi Squad

49
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:17,083
and the Panda Squad.

50
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,250
After that, it's on you.

51
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:21,042
Got it, Yuuji.

52
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,042
Got it!

53
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,876
(Demon Dog barking)

54
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,292

55
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,876
(creature babbling)

56
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,500
Just small fry.

57
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:35,834
(air whooshing)

58
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:36,417
(Demon Dog snarling)

59
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,042
Zen'in, stop running!

60
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,334
(creature chittering)

61
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:46,334
-(blow booming)

62
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:46,334
-(Toudou yelling)

63
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,167
Yeah, you're all together!

64
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,918
Now come at me, all at once!

65
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,292
-(Yuuji grunting)

66
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,292

-(Yuuji grunting)

71
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,167
[Maki] Scatter!

72
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,292
(footsteps thudding)

73
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,959
I wonder why Toudou was alone.

74
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm not too sure,

75
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,500
but we were right

76
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,792
to give Yuuji that job.

77
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,542
He is a monster, that

78
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,542
much is for sure.

79
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:14,542
Yup!

80
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:16,542
But don't worry about him now.

81
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:17,542
[Toge] Tuna.

82
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:18,542
(both grunting)

83
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:19,292
-(blow booming)

84
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:19,292
-(both grunting)

85
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,542
-(both thudding)

86
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,542
-(both grunting)

87
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:24,375
(Toudou chuckling)

88
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:31,500
(opening theme music)

89
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,584
(singer singing in Japanese)

90
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,083
Toudou will definitely be

91
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,083
out to crush us right away,

92
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,417
and Mai might just follow

93
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,417
him in order to get to me.

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,250
(air whooshing)

95
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,626
Toudou is a monster.

96
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,042
(body crashing)

97
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,667
The worst possible outcome

98
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,667
would be that we all face him

99
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:16,334
and we all get wiped out.

100
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,500
(air whooshing)

101
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:22,667
So our plan was to leave

102
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:22,667
one of us, not sure who,

103
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,334
either Panda or Megumi,

104
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,334
behind to deal with him.

105
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,834
So now, Itadori, we'll

106
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,834
leave that role to you.

107
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,375
[Yuuji] Hm?

108
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,292
We can't afford to lose

109
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,292
any of our better scouts.

110
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,459
You don't have to beat him,

111
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,626
just try to hold out

112
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,626
and buy us some time.

113
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,209
I say be daring against him!

114
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,834
To be blunt, we weren't

115
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,834
counting

116
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,834
on your abilities anyway,

117
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,459
so it won't matter too

118
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,459
much if you have to quit.

119
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,375
Oh, thanks a lot!

120
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:52,667
I'm sorry, Megumi, I know

121
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:52,667
you wanted to take on Toudou.

122
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,459
No, I'm fine either way.

123
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,125
[Panda] You're super low-key.

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,042
I'll play along,

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,042
if you want me to.

126
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,542
-Hm?

127
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,542
-Huh?

128
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,042
And I'll win too.

129
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,500

130

(Toudou spitting)

132
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,667
At least your speed's decent.

133
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:12,709
[Yuuji] Seriously?

134
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,667
I thought I landed a good one!

135
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:15,334

(knuckles cracking)

138

So I'll return the favor!

139
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,083
Act like your life's at stake!

I thought it got blown off!

00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:49,417
If that cursed spirit

153
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:49,417
hadn't gotten in the way,

154
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,751

00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,959
-(Toudou gasping)

177
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,167
-(Toudou laughing)

178
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,167
-(energetic electronic music)

179
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,751
Man, are you for real?

180
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,417
(Yuuji groaning)

181
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,083
What gives you the right

182
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,334
to just stomp all over

183
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,334
my head like that?

184
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,792
What if you made me even

185
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,792
dumber than I already was?

186
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,083
Don't worry about that.

187
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,626
Takada says, "Men are perfect

188
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,626
when they're a little dumb,"

189
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,500
and I have a

190
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,500
feeling she's right.

191
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,292
Takada?

192
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,250
I don't care about any idols!

193
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:10,125
Really?

194
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,042
So you don't care

195
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,042
about idols, huh?

196
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,042
Well, I bet you know who she is.

197
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:15,500
What's your name, first-year?

198
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,834
Yuuji Itadori.

199
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:21,334
All right, Yuuji Itadori.

200
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,626
I have one question

201
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,626
that I need to ask you.

202
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:25,584
(Toudou chuckling)

203
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,459
What kind of woman is your type?

204
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,667
Huh?

205
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,375
Uh, you wanna know my type?

206
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,000
Why would you be

207
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,000
asking me that now?

208
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,667
Nevermind why, I'm

209
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,667
just evaluating you.

210
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,792
Uh...

211
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,209
Well, I don't get

212
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,209
why it's important,

213
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,125
but I guess if I had to say,

214
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:52,334
I like a tall woman with a

215
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:52,334
nice big ass, just sayin'.

216
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,584
Like Jennifer Lawrence!

217
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,334
(Toudou gasping)

218
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,667
-(Toudou gasping)

219
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,667
-(gentle dramatic music)

220
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,709
-Hey, Usiji!

221
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,709
-Yeah, I know!

222
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,000
-I totally understand.

223
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,000
-Got my lunch money?

224
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,042
-Yeah, it's my lunch money!

225
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,042
-He doesn't even like me.

226
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,292
He won't talk to me.

227
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,417
-(pages rustling)

228
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,417
-(gentle guitar music)

229
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,083
You know what, this new

230
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,083
series is pretty good!

231
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,334
Yeah?

232
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:17,083
-(students chattering)

233
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:17,083
-My mom knows-

234
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,083
Huh.

235
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,584
[Student] I just wish

236
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,584
it would snow already.

237
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:25,751
-(bell chiming)

238
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:25,751
-(students chattering)

239
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:29,167
(footsteps thudding)

240
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:31,584
I'm gonna tell

241
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:31,584
Takada I love her.

242
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,918
Huh? No, don't do that!

243
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,125
Then you'd be crying

244
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,125
on my shoulder for days

245
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:38,542
and that would suck!

246
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,626
Why are you assuming

247
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,626
I'll get rejected?

248
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,459
(footsteps thudding)

249
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:44,918
An even better question is

250
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,125
why do you think

251
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,125
she'll say yes to you?

252
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,083
I remember something

253
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,083
that Anne Sullivan said

254
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,083
at one point to Helen Keller.

255
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,083
She asked her, "What

256
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,083
fool thinks of defeat

257
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,250
"before even trying?"

258
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,292
So-

259
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,876
Uh, that was Inoki?

260
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,083
(paper tearing)

261
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:02,417
I'm really sorry, but I'm

262
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:02,417
already in love with someone.

263
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:08,500
(footsteps thudding)

264
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,918
(Toudou sobbing)

265
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:23,667
[Toudou] Any chance that the

266
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:23,667
'someone' she loves is me?

267
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:24,626
No, no chance at all, man.

268
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,000
Come on, let's get some ramen.

269
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,709
My treat, what do you say, bud?

270
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,751
(footsteps thudding)

271
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,000
(hand tapping)

272
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,751
(Toudou sobbing)

273
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,042
So you never lost to anyone

274
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,042
in your hometown, huh?

275
00:09:56,918 --> 00:10:01,167
You and I were destined to

276
00:09:56,918 --> 00:10:01,167
be best friends like we are!

277
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,459
Hold on, you just

278
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,459
learned my name!

279
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:04,626
(air whooshing)

280
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, keep heading

281
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,000
the way you are.

282
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:07,792
He's with Toudou though.

283
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:08,792
Not a problem.

284
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,626
He was the one who told

285
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,626
us to do what we want.

286
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,083
-(air whooshing)

287
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,083
-(gunshot booming)

-(gunshots booming)

00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,584
-(suspenseful music)

290
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:23,334
[Kasumi] New Shadow

291
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:23,334
Style, Simple Domain!

292
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,000
-(air whooshing)

293
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,000
-(footsteps thudding)

294
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,250
Quick Draw!

295
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:31,792
-(sword whooshing)

296
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:31,792
-(Yuuji grunting)

297
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:33,584
What reflexes!

298
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,250
I mean, I know I hesitated,

299
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,667
but my counter didn't

300
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,667
even scratch him!

301
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:41,209
-(air whooshing)

302
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:41,209
-(Yuuji gasping)

303
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,751
(energy whooshing)

304
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,083
[Yuuji] I'm surrounded!

305
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:46,584
Wait!

306
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:48,584
Why does it feel like these guys

307
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,626
(air whooshing)

308
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:56,209
are actually trying to kill me?

309
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:57,626
(hands clapping)

310
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:58,584
(both gasping)

311
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,209
(both gasping)

312
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,250
What the hell?

313
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,375
-Huh?

314
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,375
-Did Itadori and I

315
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:06,083
just switch places?

316
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,292
Hey.

317
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,709
-(Toudou grunting)

318
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,709
-(blow thudding)

319
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:14,792
Didn't I tell you I'd kill

320
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:14,792
you if you interfered with

321
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:14,792
me?

322
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:15,959
(scoffing) No, you didn't.

323
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,709
You just said you'd kill us

324
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,709
if we ordered you around.

325
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,792
Was that switch

326
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,792
Itadori's technique?

327
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,125
Or was it Toudou's?

328
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,709
[Toudou] Same thing!

329
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:26,792
Now piss off!

330
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:29,459
(tense music)

331
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,042
(footsteps thudding)

332
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:36,417
He's retreating.

333
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,000
How lame.

334
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,709
[Kasumi] Thank goodness!

335
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,459
Make sure you kill him.

336
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:43,876
I'd say all that

337
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:43,876
depends on Itadori.

338
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,709
And quit givin' orders!

339
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:47,626
[Yuuji] What's

340
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:47,626
with these people?

341
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,626
Trying to kill me

342
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,667
and then arguing with

343
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,667
each other about it?

344
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,292
It's lucky for you I'm

345
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,292
not an inconsiderate type

346
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,959
who'd ever hold back against

347
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,959
his best friend in a fight!

348
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,626
(air whooshing)

349
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:06,125
(Momo groaning)

350
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,459
This is why I said they

351
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,459
ought to leave him be.

352
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:10,751
We're off to a bad start.

353
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,292
We can't start hunting

354
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,292
down cursed spirits

355
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,459
without me scouting

356
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,459
from the air either.

357
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,918
(Momo sighing)

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,792
They're all just so annoying!

359
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,667
But hang in there, me,

360
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,667
you're the cutest one!

361
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:26,083
Go get her!

362
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:26,918
(electricity crackling)

363
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,918
Oh.

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,751
(electricity crackling)

365
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:33,876
Mai, Mechamaru,

366
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:33,876
go help Nishimiya!

367
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:34,959
[Mechamaru] Right.

368
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:37,167
Yeah, we're in big trouble

369
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:37,167
without our air cover!

370
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,959
-(footsteps thundering)

371
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,959
-(suspenseful music)

372
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,500
(Kasumi gasping)

373
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:46,375
-(weapons clanging)

374
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:46,375
-(both grunting)

375
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,876
(Megumi and Noritoshi grunting)

376
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,167
(both grunting)

377
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,209
Kamo is your team trying

378
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,209
to kill Yuuji Itadori?

379
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:01,250
(energetic music)

380
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,000
(frantic music)

381
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,792
-(wind whooshing)

382
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,792
-(birds chirping)

383
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:13,834
It's odd.

384
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,542
This is strange.

385
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,751
All the Kyoto students

386
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,751
are moving together.

387
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,167
They're heading for

388
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,167
where we left Yuuji.

389
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,876
It would seem unlikely

390
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,876
that that's a coincidence.

391
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,417
Aren't they just headed

392
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,417
toward the cursed spirit?

393
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,375
No way.

394
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,834
Unless the special-grade

395
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,834
is especially cunning,

396
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:32,542
Demon Dog would've sensed it.

397
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:34,459
(Demon Dog barking)

398
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:35,834
You think...

399
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:38,584
Could they be trying

400
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:38,584
to kill Itadori?

401
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,584
What the hell?

402
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,584
How can that be?

403
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,834
(tense music)

404
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,417
It could be.

405
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,792
[Toge] Kelp.

406
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:51,042
I didn't sense that

407
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:51,042
level of hostility

408
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,209
from them when they arrived,

409
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,709
but that was before we found

410
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,709
out Yuuji was still alive.

411
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:56,125
(Nobara gasping)

412
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,417
(flute trilling)

413
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,042
It is conceivable that

414
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,042
Principal Gakuganji

415
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,709
would order this move.

416
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:03,918
So are the Kyoto

417
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:03,918
students all such cowards

418
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,918
they kill on someone's orders?

419
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,584
That's pathetic.

420
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,209
You have to realize

421
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,209
that they don't

422
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:11,876
see Yuuji the way you do.

423
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,709
The two of you have spent

424
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,709
day after day with him.

425
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,709
We've just become

426
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,709
familiar with him.

427
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,083
He's a good person.

428
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,959
I'd say he's happier than

429
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,959
most sorcerers I've known.

430
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,000
But still,

431
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:24,918
for those who don't know

432
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:24,918
anything about Yuuji,

433
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,250
just the fact that he's

434
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,250
the vessel of Sukuna

435
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,042
makes him an object of fear.

436
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,792
So for them, killing him

437
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,792
wouldn't feel any different

438
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:35,417
than exorcizing a curse.

439
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,751
Even for normal

440
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,751
jujutsu sorcerers,

441
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:38,876
that line can

442
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:38,876
easily get blurred.

443
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,500
[Maki] Megumi, we're

444
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,500
going back for him.

445
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,292
I'm sorry.

446
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,959
What are you

447
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,959
apologizing for, dummy?

448
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,292
If you let a friend die,

449
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,751
winning or losing an

450
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,751
event doesn't matter.

451
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,125
Yuuji's not answering

452
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,125
his phone anymore either.

453
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,959
Nobara and I will go back

454
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,959
to confirm that he's safe.

455
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,042
As for you, Toge, you keep

456
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,042
hunting the cursed spirit.

457
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,459
[Toge] Bonito flakes.

458
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,334
I know you're worried

459
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,334
about Yuuji too,

460
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,000
but if my prediction

461
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,000
here is correct,

462
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,626
the Kyoto students plan

463
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,626
here is to use the chaos

464
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,876
and confusion of this

465
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,876
battle to assassinate Yuuji.

466
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,334
Their attempts will end as

467
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,334
soon as the battle does.

468
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,667
Makes sense.

469
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,042
[Toge] Salmon.

470
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,959
I'm worried about Maki too.

471
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,792
We won't let them kill Yuuji,

472
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,667
and we're gonna win this fight!

473
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:33,667
Copy that!

474
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:35,542
(phone line beeping)

475
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:36,584
Hm?

476
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:38,667
(Nobara growling)

477
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,959
Why don't you answer

478
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,959
your phone, Fushiguro?

479
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,959
So lame!

480
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,042
Why didn't they give

481
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,042
us wireless radios

482
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,334
or at least Bluetooth earbuds?

483
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:50,167
I don't like those things,

484
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:50,167
they're distracting!

485
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,042
I get startled when

486
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,042
when calls come in.

487
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,500
So then you just take

488
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,500
'em off during combat!

489
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:55,667
(air whooshing)

490
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:58,542
(Momo crashing)

491
00:15:58,626 --> 00:15:59,584
(Momo groaning)

492
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,626
That hurt!

493
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,626
So that's Fushiguro's Nue, huh?

494
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:07,375
Electrified wings.

495
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,375
That's gonna limit my

496
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,375
movement for a while.

497
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,125
-(blow booming)

498
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,125

00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:22,000
♪ Come down and play ♪

501
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:22,918
[Momo] Ugh, how childish!

502
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,834
That is not cute at all!

503
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,000
[Megumi] Kamo, are you guys

504
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,000
planning to kill Itadori?

505
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,751
And if I said we were?

506
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,542
What does it matter?

507
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,000
It would mean that

508
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,000
you've all failed.

509
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,542
Itadori could never be

510
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,542
defeated in such a short

511
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,542
time.

512
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:44,834
We've no reason to kill him.

513
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:46,584
Yes, you do.

514
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,000
The major three clans

515
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,000
and the higher-ups.

516

Wow, what amazing toughness!

535
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,459
He's actively using

536
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,459
the landscape

537
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,000
to his advantage as well!

(Toudou gasping)

539
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:29,459

set up his next move!

545
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,417

548
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,000

00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,167
-(punch booming)

550
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,167
-(Toudou grunting)

551
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,000
he has such tremendous power!

552
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,918
His raw strength is

553
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,918
greater than mine,

554
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,709
despite his smaller body!

555
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,626
Which is why his blows

556
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,626
are still effective

557
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,417
with so little cursed energy!

558
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,417
And because there's

559
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,417
so little of that,

560
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,083
it's hard to read his movements!

561
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,042
But the way his cursed

562
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,042
energy hits after a time lag?

563
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,751
Well, that is just

564
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,751
that's just, it's just

565
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,167
Wrong!

566
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,042
Wrong!

567
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,667
Wrong!

568
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:15,042
Wrong!

569
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,667
Wrong!

570
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:17,292
Wrong!

571
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,459
Wrong!

572
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:22,250
(leaves rustling)

573
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:25,876
Was that Toudou yelling?

574
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,250
Yeah, it was.

575
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:31,500
Since he was up against Yuuji,

576
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:31,500
I'm starting to understand

577
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:33,334
why you failed to

578
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:33,334
finish him off.

579
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,709
So why'd you separate

580
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,709
from Noritoshi?

581
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,125
Is your technique a secret

582
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,125
from your allies too?

583
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:45,459
(sword rattling)

584
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,334
I am sorry about Itadori.

585
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,125
Not to make excuses, but I'm

586
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,125
really not like the others.

587
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,918
Still, that doesn't

588
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,918
mean I'm about to quit

589
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,542
and just let you guys

590
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,542
win this Exchange Event!

591
00:18:57,626 --> 00:18:58,375
(upbeat music)

592
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:00,876
You know that sorcerers

593
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:00,876
advance in rank

594
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,417
through a recommendation

595
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,417
system, right?

596
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,000
The Exchange Event

597
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,000
has always been

598
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,334
a big deal to the sorcerers

599
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,209
who don't have connections

600
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,209
higher up the chain.

601
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,542
Students who perform well

602
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,542
here are granted many chances

603
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:13,167
to advance while

604
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:13,167
they're studying.

605
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,083
By rule though, the

606
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,083
person in charge

607
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,334
of a student can't

608
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,334
recommend them.

609
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,250
For instance, Gojou can't give

610
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:25,000
Yuuji Itadori a

611
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:25,000
first-grade recommendation.

612
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:28,375
I want independence

613
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:28,375
as soon as possible,

614
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,250
that way I can earn some money.

615
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:35,167
[Maki] Why?

616
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:38,959
-(sword rattling)

617

-(tense music)

618
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:39,500
Because I'm poor!

619
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:41,250
And I'm the eldest.

620
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,250
Yeah, but how about you?

621
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:46,042
How do you tolerate Mai?

622
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,209
You seem too nice.

623
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,209
[Kasumi] What?

624
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,250
Hm, yeah, I might be.

625
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,209
I won't hold back, you know?

626
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,542
That's not a problem!

627
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,876
I didn't tell you all

628
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,876
that to get your sympathy!

629
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,918
Listen, my friend, that

630
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,918
time-lagged cursed energy

631
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,918
blast?

632
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,125
That is a bad habit

633
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,125
you've developed.

634
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:10,042
[Yuuji] Oh, you

635
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:10,042
mean Divergent Fist?

636
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,417
What the hell?

637
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,584
Where's he going with this?

638
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,083
If you rely on just

639
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,083
that one trick,

640
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,417
you'll never defeat me!

641
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,959
And if you're satisfied

642
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,959
staying on that level,

643
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:24,209
then sadly you and I can't

644
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:24,209
possibly stay best friends.

645
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,584
You okay with that?

646
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:30,459
I don't know, I don't

647
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:30,459
care about that.

648
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,959
[Toudou] You're okay

649
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,959
with staying weak?

stronger than I am.

Huh?

answer that question?

668

670
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:38,918
You guys know who

Sebastian Stan is?

Well, of course I

675
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,209
naturally have a thing

676
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:47,292
for hot-looking guys, just

677
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:47,292
the same as any girl would.

678
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:51,709
But, in my mind, a guy has

679
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:51,709
to be fun to hang out with!

680
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:54,584
And then, the most

681
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:54,584
important thing?

682
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,375
Well, he should make you feel

683
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,375
like he's the only one for you!

gone and embarrassed myself!
