I'm saying today's the day

19

Kyoto's principal comes here,

20
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,918
to go over the plans for

with the Higher-Ups

25
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,292
because they arranged

29
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,626

of those Higher-Ups, isn't

his position to worry about,

46

I'm only guessing.

51

But still,

Yes, they're twins.

Don't call me a twin, Fushiguro.

We came along with the principal

72

Calling him a vessel

85

makes it sound nice,

isn't such a bad thing.

176
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,042
It just goes along

177
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,042
with your kindness.

178
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,334
I don't really have a type.

179
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,042
As long as one's

180
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,042
character is unshakeable,

181
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,876
there's nothing

182
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,876
more I can ask for.

183
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:30,876
Mm-hmm.

184
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,500
That's not a bad answer.

185
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:36,959
If you had said big boobs,

186
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:36,959
I would've had to kill you.

187
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:38,083
Shut up.

188
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:41,250
(sniffling) I knew it.

189
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,334
You really are

190
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,334
boring, Fushiguro.

191
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:50,000
(Megumi Fushiguro gasps)

192
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,959
(both grunting)

193
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:53,959
[Megumi Fushiguro] Ah!

194
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,334
(gasps) Fushiguro!

195
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,792
Oh well,

196
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,167
there goes poor Fushiguro.

197
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,792
(Nobara Kugisaki grunts)

198
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:05,042
Even a talented Second

199
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:05,042
Grade Jujutsu Sorcerer

200
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,375
is nothing more

201
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,375
than a first-year

202
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,792
when he's up against the

203
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,792
top-grade Aoi Toudou.

204
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:11,542
I'll have to go and

205
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:11,542
comfort him later, huh?

206
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,667
I thought you and Maki were

207
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,667
identical, but you're not.

208
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:18,417
Maki's a hundred times

209
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:18,417
prettier than you are.

210
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,542
[Mai Zenin] Hmm?

211
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:23,292
Trouble sleeping?

212
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:23,292
You've got open pores.

213
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,292
(grunts) Maybe I

214
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,292
should teach you

215
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,834
-(pistol cocks)

216
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,834
-(Nobara Kugisaki gasps)

217
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:29,542
how to speak to others.

218
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,792
(dramatic music)

219
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:34,000
(Megumi Fushiguro grunting)

220
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,584
I knew it as soon as

221
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,584
I saw you, Fushiguro.

222
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,667
I could tell you'd turn

223
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,667
out to be a boring guy.

224
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,584
But then, you should

225
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,584
never judge a person

226
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,500
just by their looks,

227
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,500
isn't that right?

228
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:47,459
So I went out of my way

229
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:47,459
to ask you the question,

230
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,792
but you've just

231
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,792
trampled on my kindness.

232
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:53,918
Your head looks like a pineapple

233
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,626
and you're about as

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,626
smart as one too.

235
00:07:57,584 --> 00:07:59,042
Wait, Toudou.

236
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,167
That Toudou?

237
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,709
The who defended

238
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,709
against last year's

239
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,500
unprecedented

240
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,500
jujutsu terror attack

241
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,334
by the Curse User Geto,

242
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,042
during The Night Parade

243
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,042
of a Hundred Demons?

244
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,876
And when the parade

245
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,876
came to Kyoto,

246
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,584
he exorcised a Special Grade

247
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,500
and five First Grade

248
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,500
Cursed Spirits by himself.

249
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:17,584
That Toudou?

250
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,375
Still, there are some

251
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,375
First Grade Sorcerers

252
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,292
capable of beating

253
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,292
a Special Grade.

254
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:23,709
What's shocking is

255
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:24,709
I heard.

256
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,918
You don't use Cursed Techniques.

257
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,459
Huh? Oh, no, that rumor's false.

258
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,542
I did against the Special Grade.

259
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:35,626
He doesn't use them

260
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:35,626
against First Grades?

261
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:36,918
Is he a monster?

262
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,167
That's good to know.

263
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:41,375
Nue

264
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,918
plus Gama!

265
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,626
(intense music)

266
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,083
(toad croaks)

267
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,167
Bottomless Well!

268
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,083
(toads croaking)

269
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,542
(Aoi Toudou grunts)

270
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:57,125
I'm up against a hardcore

271
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:57,125
close-range fighter.

272
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,250
I'll keep my distance

273
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,250
and restrain him.

274
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:01,709
(Aoi Toudou grunts)

275
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,959
(toad croaks)

276
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,167
He's fast,

277
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,125
so he wasn't at

278
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,125
full speed earlier.

279
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,751
[Aoi Toudou] You're

280
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,751
flimsy and shallow.

281
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,667
Both your body

282
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,918
and your taste in women!

283
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,792

(Megumi Fushiguro groans)

291
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:30,584
[Megumi Fushiguro] Damn

292
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:30,584
it. His power is insane!

293
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,792

(Megumi Fushiguro groaning)

297
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:42,751
Just wait.

298
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,292
I'm not finished with you!

299
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,792

302

You're always just so boring!

(Aoi Toudou grunting)

304
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,334
Are you even trying to fight?

305
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,584
You're acting so proud,

306
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,584
but I've been holding back.

307
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,626
Fine then, if you insist,

308
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,000
then I'll show you.

309
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,125
Huh?

310
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,042
(laughing) Okay, bring it!

311
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,667
[Toge Inumaki] Don't move!

What the hell are you two doing?

315
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,918
Whew, just barely safe.

316
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,751

(Megumi Fushiguro exhales)

318
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:45,834
Okay, I guess that

319
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:45,834
might be an out.

320
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,876
(spits) Long time no see, Panda.

321
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,417
[Panda] Why couldn't

322
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,417
you just wait

323
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,209
until the Exchange Event?

324
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,792
Now go on home, or I'll

325
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,792
start screaming no!

326
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:58,792
You don't have to

327
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:58,792
tell me to go home.

328
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:03,125
Now where'd I put my jacket?

329
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,667
At least after this,

330
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:08,626
it looks like I might not

331
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:08,626
be bored the whole time.

332
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,626
Give Okkotsu a message.

333
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:15,292
Tell him he had better show up.

334
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,209
What a jerk.

335
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,751
I merely panda. No

336
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,751
understand human speak.

337

338

339
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,876
continue as a Jujutsu

340

Sorcerer,

341
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,626
you better watch who

342
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,626
you pick a fight with.

343
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,459
(Mai Zenin giggles)

(Mai Zenin gasps)

345
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,250
Just what do you

346
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,250
think you're doing

347
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,709
to our errand runner, Mai?

348
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,083
Ah.

349
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,083
You're such a loser I didn't

350
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,083
even notice you come in, Maki.

351
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,250
If I'm a loser then

352
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,250
you must be one too.

353
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:48,792
All you can do is imbue

354
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:48,792
objects with Cursed Energy,

355
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,042
and you've got shit

356
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,042
for Cursed Techniques.

357
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,709
Better than no

358
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,709
Cursed Energy at all.

359
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,792
My neck gets so sore looking

360
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,792
up at others all the time,

361
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:58,083
so I need you, dear

362
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:58,083
sister, to look down on.

363
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,918
[Maki Zenin] Ah, give it a rest.

364
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,125
We're both at rock bottom

365
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,125
and equally pathetic.

366
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:03,918
Nobara, can you stand up?

367
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,834
No way.

368
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:07,751
She won't be getting

369
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:07,751
up for a while.

370
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,083
I hurt her pretty good.

371
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:09,792
(Mai Zenin gasps)

372
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:13,000
What's this? A challenge?

373
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,918
(both grunting)

374
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,042
Nice support, Maki!

375
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,834
You put a bunch of holes

376
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,834
in my brand new tracksuit.

377
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:25,459
I oughta rip this rag off you

378
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,959
and use it to make it

379
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,959
my own summer uniform.

380
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:31,626
Next time I'll put the

381
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:31,626
holes in your body instead.

382
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,542
Plus, you can't wear this

383
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:35,250
with those stick

384
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:35,250
legs of (groans).

385
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:40,125
[Nobara Kugisaki]

386
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:40,125
Just shut your mouth.

387
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,792
[Aoi Toudou] Come on,

388
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,792
Mai, we're leaving.

389
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:42,876
[Nobara Kugisaki] What? No way.

390
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:46,834
Oh, there's my jacket.

391
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:49,500
Where's Fushiguro?

392
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:52,709
Don't worry, he's fine.

393
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:52,709
He's out with the others.

394
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,792
Looks like you're having fun.

395
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:55,959
(panting) I am,

396
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,959
but I'm just getting

397
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,959
started here.

398
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,834
No, you're not.

399
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:00,709
Unlike you, I still

400
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:00,709
have important business

401
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,417
to attend to here in Tokyo.

402
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:07,167
My personal handshake

403
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,834
and it's with Takada!

404
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:13,667
[All] Huh?

405
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,918
Who knows what I might do

406
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,918
if I don't catch that train

407
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,542
and I can't make it

408
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,542
to the hall on time.

409
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,000
Come on, Mai, let's go.

410
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,876
[Mai Zenin] (grunts)

411
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,876
You're so selfish.

412
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,834
[Aoi Toudou] I still can't

413
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,834
believe I lost the lottery

414
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:32,667
for the one in Kyoto.

415
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:33,834
As for you,

416
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:36,375
you won't get off this

417
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:36,375
easy at the Exchange Event.

418
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,209
Quit acting like you

419
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,209
beat me, damn it,

420
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,792
and gimme that uniform now!

421
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:42,209
Cut it out, you idiot.

422
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,834
Winning or losing a fight

423
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,834
here doesn't mean a thing.

424
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,876
Save that up for

425
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,876
the Exchange Event.

426
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,375
Maki, is Mai right?

427
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,375
She said you don't

428
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,375
have Cursed Energy.

429
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,751
Yes, that's true.

430
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,918
In fact,

431
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:58,959
I need these to even see Curses.

432
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:01,876
That's why I use Cursed Tools.

433
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,959
They already have

434
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,959
Curses imbued in them.

435
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:06,792
I can't pour my own

436
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:06,792
Cursed Energy into them

437
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,542
to do things like you all do.

438
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,250
Oh.

439
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,000
Like that thing

440
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,000
Gojo gave Itadori.

441
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,584
Then why be a Jujutsu Sorcerer?

442
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,375
To spite my family.

443
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,417
I can't wait to see their faces

444
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,792
when I become a

445
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,792
bigshot sorcerer.

446
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:30,792
After all, they've looked

447
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:30,792
down on me all these years.

448
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:33,250
Come on.

449
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,959
Let's hurry over and see Shoko.

450
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,751
[Nobara Kugisaki] You know,

451
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,751
I really respect you, Maki.

452
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:42,918
[Maki Zenin] Is that so?

453
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,167
(upbeat theme music)

454
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:52,959
(upbeat theme music)

455
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,292
(river babbling)

456
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,125
(birds chirping)

457
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,751
Why is Yaga still not here?

458
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,083
Time is a precious thing

459
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,834
to an old man who's coming

460
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,834
ever closer to death.

461
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,500
[Satoru Gojo] I'm sorry,

462
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,500
but Principal Yaga

463
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,500
won't be here for a while yet.

464
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:21,626
Oh?

465
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:27,125
Somehow, the schedule he

466
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:27,125
was given was incorrect.

467
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,959
After some threats to Ijichi.

468
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:34,667
Thank you for the other

469
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:34,667
day, Principal Gakuganji.

470
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:37,292
Sorry? What day are

471
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:37,292
you referring to?

472
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,334
Don't play dumb

473
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,334
with me, old man.

474
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,792
I'm talking about Yuji Itadori.

475
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:44,792
As head of the conservatives

476
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:44,792
you were involved too, right?

477
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:46,125
My goodness.

478
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,542
Youth these days.

479
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,500
Have you no manners anymore?

480
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,125
Have you lost all

481
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,125
respect for your elders?

482
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,667
I never had any respect

483
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,667
for you to start with.

484
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,334
Elders like you love

485
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,334
to act important

486
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,584
and frankly it just sucks.

487
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,626
[Kasumi Miwa] Watch it!

488
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,584
[Satoru Gojo] Hm?

489
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,000
Your conduct is unacceptable.

490
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,375
Stop it, or I'll report you

491
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,375
to the proper authorities.

492
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:08,542
Oh, wow!

493
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:12,542
It's Satoru Gojo in-person

494
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:12,542
sitting right in front of

495
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:12,542
me!

496
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:14,000
Knock yourself out.

497
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,709
I don't plan to

498
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,709
chat for very long.

499
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,083
(Kasumi Miwa grumbling)

500
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:21,292
[Kasumi Miwa] (giggling) He

501
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:21,292
spoke to me, he spoke to me!

502
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,542
[Satoru Gojo] Last

503
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,542
night, I was attacked

504
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:27,209
by two unregistered Special

505
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:27,209
Grade Cursed Spirits.

506
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:28,584
Oh?

507
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,209
Well, that is very unfortunate.

508
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,918
Don't get me wrong here.

509
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,542
It was about as much trouble

510
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,000
as answering a sidewalk survey.

511
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,918
[Kasumi Miwa] (moaning) So cool!

512
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,125
These two Cursed Spirits were

513
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,125
capable of communication,

514
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,959
and they probably have allies

515
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,959
who are just as strong.

516
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,083
And it's not just our foes.

517
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,334
Hakari, Okkotsu,

518
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,334
and your Toudou.

519
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,792
In recent years, the quality

520
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,792
level of our students

521
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:59,542
has risen dramatically as well.

522
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,334
Then there was last year's

523
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,334
incident with Suguru Geto.

524
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,125
And now, the appearance

525
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,125
of Sukuna's vessel.

526
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:13,751
What are you trying to say?

527
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,584
You're still not getting this?

528
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,417
The wave of power you guys

529
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,417
have been trying to hold back

530
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,042
with your pointless

531
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,042
status and traditions

532
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:21,959
has grown bigger

533
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:21,959
than you can handle

534
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,667
and is now descending upon us.

535
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,918
You won't be able to

536
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,918
measure the coming age

537
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,459
with just the classification

538
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,459
of Special Grade.

539
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:30,709
And if you really believe

540
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,918
I'm the only one who's

541
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,918
gonna fight back,

542
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,375
you're gonna wind

543
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,375
up hurt, old man.

544
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
I think

545
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,542
that you're way out

546
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,542
of line, young man.

547
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,209
Oh, I'm scared.

548
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,459
Well, I've said all I wanted

549
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,459
to say, so I'll be going now.

550
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:51,626
(Kasumi Miwa grumbles)

551
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,250
Oh, and Principal

552
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,250
Yaga will be along

553
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:54,459
in a couple of hours.

554
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,083
Later!

555
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,209
[Kasumi Miwa] A couple of hours?

556
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:02,417
(Yoshinobu Gakuganji sighs)

557
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,209
Miwa, would you

558
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,209
find me some tea?

559
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,334
Yes.

560
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:10,542
I'll be right back.

561
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,250
(Kasumi Miwa giggling)

562
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:16,209
If I can catch up to him,

563
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:19,667
maybe I can get him to

564
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:19,667
take a picture with me!

565
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:24,500
-(bright music)

566
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:24,500
-(crowd chattering)

567
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,209
Taka-tan Beam, if

568
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,209
you don't mind.

569
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,751
Awe! I'm happy to!

570
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,042
Tan, Taka-tan!

571
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,292
-(Aoi Toudou gasping)

572
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,292
-(crowd chattering)

573
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,334
[Worker] Time's up, pal.

574
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:57,459
(serene piano music)

575
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,375
Excuse me.

576
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,292
Did you do that

577
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:41,250
inside the theater?

578
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,125
(Mahito chuckles)

579
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:47,542
Wow,

580
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:50,209
so you can actually see me.

581
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:53,125
(ominous music)

582
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,918
(rain pouring)

583
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,250
It's a gruesome sight.

584
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,709
Are you ready to

585
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,709
witness it, Itadori?

586
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:16,167
(Yuji Itadori grunts)

587
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:23,334
(Closing Theme Music)

588
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:31,709
(singing in Japanese)

589
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,375
[Kasumi Miwa] (giggling)

590
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,375
Thank you so much!

591
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:57,417
[Satoru Gojo] Oh,

592
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:57,417
it's my pleasure.

593
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,417
[Kasumi Miwa] (giggling)

594
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,417
I got a photo with him!

595
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:14,667
My tea?

596
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:15,792
(Kasumi Miwa gasps)

597
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,042
[Announcers] Juju Stroll!

598
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:21,751
(crowd chattering)

599
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:22,709
[Fan] Man, she's hot,

600
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,334
but she's staring at

601
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,334
us like we're garbage.

602
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,292
[Fan] Stop looking at her!

603
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,542
Mai, sorry to be so long.

604
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:28,542
What's wrong?

605
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,751
Did something happen

606
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,751
while I was gone?

607
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:31,334
[Mai Zenin] Aside

608
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:31,334
from having to come

609
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,542
to this stupid event?

610
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,417
[Aoi Toudou] So this

611
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,417
moment has finally come.

612
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Huh?

613
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:37,459
What's this?

614
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,083
[Aoi Toudou] For the

615
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,083
next handshake event.

616
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,709
You should go experience how

617
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,709
wonderful Takada is in-person.

618
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,751
[Mai Zenin] This is

619
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,751
just plain annoying.

620
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,959
[Aoi Toudou] This

621
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,959
is my duty as a fan,

622
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,751
and as her future husband.

623
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,709
[Mai Zenin] And that's

624
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,709
just plain creepy,

625
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:51,542
but if I reject his offer,

626
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:54,918
he'll just get

627
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:54,918
even more annoying.

628
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,876
What's the matter?

629
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,417
-(high-spirited music)

630
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,417
-(crowd chattering)

631
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,959
(detector beeping)

632
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,500
Oh. Yeah, sure.

633
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,500
(worker gasping)

634
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:07,792
[Takada] Wow, a girl!

635
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:10,000
Is this your first

636
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:10,000
time coming to see me?

637
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,626
Yeah.

638
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:12,375
[Takada] What's your name?

639
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,584
[Mai Zenin] Mai.

640
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,000
[Takada] (giggling)

641
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,000
Mai, are you tired?

642
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,959
Did you have to

643
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,959
wait in line long?

644
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,751
[Mai Zenin] It was more the

645
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,751
people than the line really.

646
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,959
Then come back again when

647
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,959
you're feeling better.

648
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:27,125
I won't forget you ever, Mai.

649
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,334
[Aoi Toudou] Ah,

650
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,334
Mai, you're back.

651
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,000
How was it?

652
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,250
[Mai Zenin] Fine.

653
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:35,125
Yeah, I get it.

654
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:36,417
Takada is the kind of woman

655
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,834
who's difficult to

656
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,834
describe in mere words.

657
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:44,667
[Mai Zenin] (inhales)

658
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:44,667
She's not bad. (sighs)

659
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:48,584
(upbeat theme music)
