1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,292
(opening theme music)

2
00:00:06,584 --> 00:00:08,709
(singing in Japanese)

3
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:31,959
Maki?

4
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:34,751
The fact is, she's

5
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:34,751
a total weakling.

6
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:37,125
She can't even see curses.

7
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:40,125
She's just a normal person

8
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:40,125
swinging around cursed tools.

9
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:42,334
She'll be a

10
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:42,334
fourth-grade forever.

11
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:45,125
I don't know why she's a

12
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:45,125
jujutsu sorcerer at all.

13
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,125
(Utahime claps)

14
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:46,792
Okay break's over.

15
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,709
(Mai sighs)

16
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:49,709
[Miwa] I see!

17
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:52,292
Well, that's a relief!

18
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,792
Stupid Mai! This

19
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,792
woman is no weakling!

20
00:01:58,751 --> 00:01:59,667
(Miwa yells)

21
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:00,751
She's using a longer weapon,

22
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,292
so I'd like to

23
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,292
close the distance,

24
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,792
but all I can do is

25
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,792
dodge and parry her!

26
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:06,167
If she were using the blade-

27
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,334
(Miwa grunts)

28
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:07,918
I would've died twice!

29
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,334
And she's only fourth-grade?

30
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,792
She could easily defeat

31
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,792
second-grade cursed spirits!

32
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,125
(rock music)

33
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,626
[Miwa] And how is she able

34
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,626
to swing such a long staff

35
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,000
in this forest with so

36
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,000
much stuff in the way?

37
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,834
(Miwa yells)

38
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:27,500
(Miwa grunts)

39
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,584
(water splashes)

40
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:30,834
(Miwa pants)

41
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,834
(Miwa sighs)

42
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:36,792
(water splashes)

43
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:39,209
(rock music)

44
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,000
[Miwa] New Shadow Style,

45
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:46,709
Simple Domain!

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,667
This allows me to attack

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,667
anything that enters

48
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:53,834
the 2.21-meter radius of my

49
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:53,834
domain on full-auto reflex.

50
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:56,167
It's released if my feet move

51
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,834
from the point were

52
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,834
I activated it.

53
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,334
Plus, my Quick Draw

54
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,334
is specialized

55
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:02,667
against head-on attacks.

56
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:05,417
It's the fastest technique

57
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:05,417
of the New Shadow School,

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,042
wrapping my blade

59
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,042
in cursed energy

60
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,000
while it's in the

61
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,000
sheath to accelerate it.

62
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,209
But I don't think

63
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,209
this'll settle the match!

64
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,876
I still have to create

65
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,876
an opening first!

66
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,542
Iai-koh, huh?

67
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,000
Looks like she has

68
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,000
some tricks, too.

69
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,584
But there's a

70
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,584
difference in our reach.

71
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,500
Rather than hit me,

72
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:21,918
she wants to knock

73
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:21,918
away my cursed tool

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,042
and create an opening.

75
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:27,375
-So in that case-

76
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:27,375
-(weapon breaks)

77
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,250
[Miwa] She broke it?

78
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,792
She's giving up her

79
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,792
reach advantage?

80
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,876
(weapon swings)

81
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,876
[Miwa] She threw it!

82
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,918
(Miwa grunts)

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,250
A hidden weapon?

84
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:38,042
She's trying to close

85
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:38,042
the gap by using a decoy!

86
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,292
(Miwa grunts)

87
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:43,959
My legs moved!

88
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:45,125
But that's okay,

89
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:46,792
I'll pull back and draw her

90
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:46,792
in close enough, and then-

91
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:47,792
(Miwa grunts)

92
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:50,959
(water splashes)

93
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,042
[Miwa] Aikidou?

94
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,042
What a great move!

95
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,792
Huh?

96
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,292
Pretty nice sword you got here.

97
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:01,250
Sword stealing?

98
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:01,918
Give it back?

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,709
(music fades out)

100
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,417
(Mei laughs)

101
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,417
What an interesting girl.

102
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,751
You should just go ahead

103
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,834
and promote her to

104
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,834
second-grade already.

105
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:16,083
Believe me, I feel the same way.

106
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,626
But the Zen'in clan

107
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,626
keeps on interfering.

108
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,667
I wish they would just change

109
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,667
their position and accept her.

110
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,584
(Mei laughs)

111
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,959
I can't understand such

112
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,959
restraint unless it's money.

113
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:29,250
You're such a material girl.

114
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,918
I'm more concerned about the

115
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,918
way the coverage around Yuuji

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,626
keeps cutting out.

117
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:34,959
Animals can be fickle creatures.

118
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:38,083
And sharing senses

119
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:38,083
with them is tiring.

120
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,626
Yeah? I didn't know that.

121
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,042
Which side're you

122
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,042
on anyway, Mei?

123
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,292
Which side?

124
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,292
I'm on the side of

125
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,292
money, of course.

126
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,876
There's no value to anything

127
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,876
that can't be traded for

128
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,876
money.

129
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,667
If you can't make money

130
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,667
with it, what good is it?

131
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:52,667
(Satoru laughs)

132
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,918
[Satoru] Just how much

133
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,918
have you saved up?

134
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,334
I don't know what the

135
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,334
old man's planning,

136
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,876
but I do know he won't

137
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,876
find it that easy

138
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,667
to deal with Yuuji anymore.

139
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,125
(charm catches on fire)

140
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,667
Oh!

141
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,792
They're on the move!

142
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,334
(Curse 10A chitters)

143
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,083
The cursed spirits

144
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,083
released in the area

145
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:12,792
all have charms on them.

146
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:16,125
-So when one disappears-

147
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:16,125
-(curse explodes)

148
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,792
The corresponding charm

149
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,792
here in the viewing area

150
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:19,542
is extinguished.

151
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,334
Every charm is

152
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,334
extinguished differently

153
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,542
according to the

154
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,542
registered cursed energy.

155
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,876
When the Tokyo school

156
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,876
exorcises one, it burns red.

157
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,667
When the Kyoto school

158
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,667
exorcises one, it burns blue.

159
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,209
Since Maki is here,

160
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,334
charms extinguished

161
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,334
by unregistered energy

162
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:37,918
burn red as well.

163
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,542
Well, it's one to one.

164
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:44,083
So how come no one's paying

165
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:44,083
attention to the game?

166
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,167
Why can't both sides just

167
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,167
try being nice to each other?

168
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,083
I guess they're all

169
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,083
too much like you.

170
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,042
My only problem is you!

171
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,083
[Kiyotaka] For the record,

172
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:54,000
it was Panda who

173
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:54,000
took out Mechamaru.

174
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,000
Lucky!

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,042
[Nobara] Come down here,

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,042
you goddamned witch!

177
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,209
I've come down there

178
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,209
a few times already.

179
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:04,000
Maybe you oughta

180
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:04,000
try and catch me!

181
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,000
(intense music)

182
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,000
[Momo] First-year!

183
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,209
(ground explodes)

184
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,334
(Nobara grunts)

185
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,542
[Nobara] Her cursed energy

186
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,542
wind is like a hurricane!

187
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:11,918
It's full of rocks and branches!

188
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,167
If I drop my guard,

189
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,167
it'll rip my flesh!

190
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,876
(Nobara gasps)

191
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,459
(Nobara grunts)

192
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,918
You dare damage

193
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,918
my precious face?

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,083
A scar on the face is a

195
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,083
badge of honor for a man.

196
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,959
Though it's just an

197
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,959
ugly flaw on a woman.

198
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,751
Huh?

199
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,209
You think jujutsu

200
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,209
sorcery is just strength.

201
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:39,417
[Nobara] That's because it is.

202
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,918
That's only true

203
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,918
for the men, though.

204
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,500
[Nobara] What do you mean?

205
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,584
Even if they're strong,

206
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:47,542
women have to be cute, too,

207
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:47,542
or they'll be undervalued.

208
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,125
And of course, even

209
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,125
if they're cute,

210
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,751
they'll still be undervalued,

211
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,876
unless they're also strong.

212
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,876
Do you get it?

213
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,083
They don't demand strength

214
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,083
from female jujutsu

215
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,083
sorcerers.

216
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,918
They demand perfection!

217
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:02,459
And what's worse?

218
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,083
Mai has to fight against demands

219
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,125
that're even more outrageous!

220
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,000
One thing that I do

221
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,000
get is that you are

222
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,334
a pain in the ass!

223
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,626
(Momo slides)

224
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,125
(wind whips)

225
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:18,584
[Momo] She's only a first-year

226
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:21,292
and she's already this

227
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:21,292
accustomed to fighting?

228
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:23,626
She's still going strong

229
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,667
no matter how many

230
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,667
times I blast her.

231
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:27,500
That was nothing.

232
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,667
I'm used to getting

233
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,667
knocked around.

234
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:35,000
[Momo] If I up my output any

235
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:35,000
further, I might kill her.

236
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,626
No, that's just an excuse.

237
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,667
The real reason I can't

238
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,667
attack her is Inumaki.

239
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,042
(camera shutters)

240
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,834
What is cursed speech?

241
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:47,209
It just uses the power of words.

242
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,125
It imbues cursed

243
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,125
energy into sound,

244
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,959
so all you have to do

245
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,959
is to protect your brain

246
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:53,125
and your ears with

247
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:53,125
cursed energy.

248
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:56,125
Cursed speech is a

249
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:56,125
technique specialized

250
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,334
for use against cursed spirits,

251
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,042
and it's nothing to be

252
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,042
afraid

253
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,042
of if you know it's coming.

254
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,334
[Momo] Yes, but

255
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,334
if you don't know

256
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:03,959
whether it's coming or not,

257
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,667
then you're

258
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,667
constantly distracted!

259
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,292
And I'm not used to protecting

260
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,292
the inside of my head

261
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,167
in the first place!

262
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,334
He's such a nuisance,

263
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,334
whether he's here or not!

264
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,667
Done lecturing?

265
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:16,876
About time!

266
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:20,250
Even perfection is easy,

267
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,334
compared to what's always

268
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,334
been demanded of Mai!

269
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,334
She's from one of

270
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,334
the three major clans

271
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,334
of elite jujutsu sorcerers!

272
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,709
The Zen'in Clan!

273
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,918
Where perfection's

274
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,918
expected, and demanded.

275
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,709
They say, "Inherit the Zen'in

276
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,709
clan's hereditary technique!"

277
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,375
And any who don't

278
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,375
meet that demand

279
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,751
start their sorcerer

280
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,751
lives as failures.

281
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:41,542
What's even worse,

282
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:45,083
women aren't even allowed to

283
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:45,083
stand at the starting line.

284
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,083
Without the Zen'in clan lineage,

285
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,292
they're not considered to

286
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,292
be real jujutsu sorcerers.

287
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,709
And, if they're not

288
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,709
considered

289
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,709
to be jujutsu sorcerers,

290
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,542
they're not even

291
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,542
recognized as people!

292
00:08:57,292 --> 00:09:00,542
She's lived her

293
00:08:57,292 --> 00:09:00,542
entire life scorned

294
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:03,042
in a family without

295
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:03,042
a shred of affection.

296
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,209
The suffering Mai went through

297
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,000
to experience what we

298
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,000
all take for granted.

299
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:09,125
Why don't you try

300
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:09,125
thinking that over

301
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,542
with that confused

302
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,542
brain of yours?

303
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,375
You have a curse for a friend!

304
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,125
(Momo yells)

305
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,751
Shut up.

306
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,626
You think misfortune is a

307
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,626
free pass to do anything?

308
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:23,375
What, then?

309
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,292
You're okay with

310
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,292
those who are blessed

311
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,250
getting trash-talked

312
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,250
behind their backs?

313
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,584
That's just like Saori!

314
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,042
I can't stand her!

315
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,042
Regardless of her upbringing!

316
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,626
And I love Maki, who had to

317
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,626
endure the same upbringing!

318
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,792
Have any of you even

319
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,792
bothered to think about

320
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:45,167
what kind of person the idiot

321
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:45,167
you're trying to curse is?

322
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,959
What makes you think any

323
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,959
one of us is obligated

324
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:52,584
to attain perfection,

325
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:52,584
or such absurd demands?

326
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:56,959
Is your entire life just a job?

327
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:58,250
Straw doll-

328
00:09:58,334 --> 00:09:59,167
Hairpin Technique!

329
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,584
(trees shake)

330
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,792
[Momo] This must be why she

331
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,792
kept shooting those nails

332
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,334
that didn't land any hits!

333
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:12,250
(electronic music)

334
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,250
(Momo grunts)

335
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,209
(Momo sighs)

336
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:24,792
(Nobara grunts)

337
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,209
You came close, but you

338
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,209
still couldn't reach me!

339
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,876
(Nobara falls)

340
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:32,876
Wrong!

341
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,334
I reached you, alright!

342
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:36,626
This is plenty!

343
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,834
[Momo] A bristle from my broom?

344
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,292
She pulled it out just now!

345
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,834
I don't give a damn

346
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,834
about your "men are this"

347
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,500
and "women have to be that!"

348
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,459
You can keep all that

349
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,459
shit to yourself!

350
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,209
I love myself when I'm

351
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,209
pretty and all dressed up!

352
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:54,167
And I love myself

353
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:54,167
when I'm kicking ass!

354
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,918
(Nobara grunts)

355
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,500
(hammer strikes)

356
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,292
I am Nobara Kugisaki!

357
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,375
(Momo grunts)

358
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:03,542
[Momo] I can't control my broom!

359
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:07,292
[Nobara] If I hit her with

360
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:07,292
my hammer, I might kill her!

361
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,042
(Momo grunts)

362
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,500
-[Nobara] So-

363
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,500
-(Momo gasps)

364
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,334
[Momo] A squeaky hammer?

365
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,417
(Nobara yells)

366
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,042
(Momo shrieks)

367
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,459
(Momo grunts)

368
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,500
(Momo sighs)

369
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,042
Now, one more time!

370
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,459
(bullet strikes)

371
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,083
(Momo gasps)

372
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:32,042
(wind swooshes)

373
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,083
Just barely within

374
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,083
effective range.

375
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,709
And just in time.

376
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,709
One hell of a shot.

377
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,250
(intense music)

378
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,751
(intense music)

379
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,083
Hello, Momo?

380
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,584
Don't worry, it was

381
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,584
a rubber bullet.

382
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,709
More important, wasn't

383
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,709
that bright light

384
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,083
Mechamaru's Ultimate Cannon?

385
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:02,209
And now all of a sudden I

386
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:02,209
can't get a hold of him.

387
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:04,959
If he felt cornered enough to

388
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:04,959
use such a powerful technique,

389
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,375
and now he's missing,

390
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,250
then he probably lost

391
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,250
and Panda's still around.

392
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:10,083
You should get outta there

393
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,417
and go back to

394
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,417
patrolling from the air.

395
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,334
Without you, we're

396
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,334
all in trouble.

397
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,375
Mm.

398
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:18,125
Hey,

399
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:19,167
Mai, I, uh-

400
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:23,083
It's okay, Momo. I understand.

401
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,125
[Momo] Thanks.

402
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,083
What's this?

403
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,375
Aren't you going to

404
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,375
call your friends?

405
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,209
Well, it's fine by me.

406
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,959
I can still take

407
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,959
you, even two-on-one.

408
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:36,000
There are lots of different

409
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:36,000
ways to enjoy this, right?

410
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,334
Sure, I could have

411
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,334
everyone beat you together.

412
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,459
But I'm going to

413
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,459
enjoy beating you,

414
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,959
by myself.

415
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:46,250
You ought to call me "Big Sis,"

416
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:47,042
little sister.

417
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,334
So, hey. How do you

418
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,334
feel about Maki?

419
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:54,959
Aaagh, she's gonna hate

420
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:54,959
it no matter what I say!

421
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:58,125
Uh, I think she's a smart

422
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:58,125
and wonderful woman.

423
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,125
Huh?

424
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,626
I'm talking about as a sorcerer.

425
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:03,417
Oh, really? What a relief!

426
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,792
To be honest,

427
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:09,792
I still don't know all

428
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:09,792
that much about jujutsu.

429
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,459
But Maki's really

430
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,459
strong in a fight.

431
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,667
Maybe it's her balance?

432
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,626
Even just the way

433
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,626
she walks is scary!

434
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,375
Don't forget.

435
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,375
She's a fourth-grade.

436
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,500
Huh? Really?

437
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:22,626
She's from a famous

438
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:22,626
sorcerer clan family.

439
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,292
But she left them and so

440
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,292
they've been interfering

441
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,417
with her promotion

442
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,417
ever since she left.

443
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,167
Why's a sorcerer family

444
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,834
not accepting of a

445
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,834
sorcerer like her?

446
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:36,792
They refuse to acknowledge

447
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:36,792
what they've already rejected

448
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:38,542
because they're idiots.

449
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:40,375
Still, if she does

450
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:40,375
well in the Event,

451
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,042
and Maki's name starts

452
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,042
to become better known,

453
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,500
it's going to be harder for

454
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,500
them to harass her like that.

455
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:50,542
So let's start by winning

456
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:50,542
the group battle, you guys!

457
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:53,667
You have to fight like you're

458
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:53,667
about to die all over again!

459
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:54,667
Right.

460
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,209
[Maki] I can hear you, you know.

461
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,876
(Yuuji, Nobara, and Panda gasp)

462
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:58,918
Jeez.

463
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,584
I should know better

464
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,876
than to let myself get

465
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,876
distracted like that.

466
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,083
(gun clanks)

467
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,584
What're you smiling about?

468
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,709
(gun shoots)

469
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:09,417
(bullet slices)

470
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,459
(branches swinging)

471
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:14,542
(gun shoots)

472
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:16,459
So what if she

473
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:16,459
hides out of sight?

474
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:19,667
Are you just trying

475
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:19,667
to gain distance?

476
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:21,709
Well, that won't work!

477
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,209
-(sword swings)

478
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,209
-(tree breaks)

479
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:24,334
[Mai] Shit!

480
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,876
(gun shoots)

481
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:28,542
(Mai grunts)

482
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:30,876
[Mai] From below?

483
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:31,876
I should've known!

484
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,709
Maki has a talent I don't.

485
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:38,626
So, have you heard?

486
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:38,626
About Ougi's daughters?

487
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,459
One of them can't

488
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,459
even see curses,

489
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,083
much less use techniques.

490
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,083
Twins are always a

491
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,083
sign of ill fortune.

492
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,709
[Clan Elder] Thank heaven

493
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,709
they're daughters, at least.

494
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:51,083
I couldn't bear to see an

495
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:51,083
eldest son as a lowly

496
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:51,083
servant.

497
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,542
(somber music)

498
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,584
Mai? What's the matter with you?

499
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,751
Let's go! Hurry up!

500
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:02,626
I'm afraid.

501
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,751
[Maki] Afraid of what?

502
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,500
Come on, if we're late

503
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,500
again, we'll get in trouble.

504
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,959
It's them.

505
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:14,500
Again?

506
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:16,459
(Maki sighs)

507
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,626
All right, I'll help you out.

508
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,626
Are you ho- o-

509
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:24,918
[Maki] Come on, just

510
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:24,918
close your eyes.

511
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,500
(curse warbles)

512
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:32,125
If you can't see them, it's

513
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:32,125
like they're not even there.

514
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:33,959
(Mai whimpers)

515
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,500
[Mai] You always acted

516
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,500
like you had no fear,

517
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:40,959
and plowed forward

518
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:40,959
toward your future!

519
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,667
I always hated you for that.

520
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:44,751
(somber music)

521
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,500
So you're leaving

522
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,500
the clan, Maki?

523
00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:49,542
You seem to have plenty

524
00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:49,542
of servants around.

525
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:52,125
I doubt you'll miss me at all.

526
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,417
But I do intend to return

527
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,417
someday, Clan Leader.

528
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,417
(Naobito gulps)

529
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,417
(Naobito exhales)

530
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,417
Why would you return?

531
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,626
So I can become the

532
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,626
head of the Zen'in Clan!

533
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,000
(Naobito laughs)

534
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,209
Well, if that's the case,

535
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:10,459
I'll put you through ordeals

536
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:10,459
you'll be lucky to survive!

537
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:11,959
(somber music)

538
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:12,667
You can do as you please.

539
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,959
[Naobito] And Mai, as well.

540
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,792
Mai's not involved in this.

541
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:24,459
(somber music)

542
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:31,584
What a liar.

543
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:33,792
(sword clangs)

544
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,250
[Mai] I hate you!

545
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:38,792
(gun shoots)

546
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:42,209
(bullets fall)

547
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,792
(gun reloads)

548
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:45,000
(Mai inhales)

549
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,250
(Mai exhales)

550
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,876
(Maki sighs)

551
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,209
(gun shoots)

552
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:56,250
(footsteps running)

553
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,667
(gun shoots)

554
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,667
(gun shoots)

555
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,250
(gun shoots)

556
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:12,042
(footsteps running)

557
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,042
(out-of-tune music)

558
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:21,709
(gun shoots)

559
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,792
(sword slashes)

560
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,792
[Maki] That was your sixth

561
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,792
shot!

562
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,417
I won't let you reload!

563
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:26,751
[Mai] I hate you.

564
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:29,709
(gun shoots)

565
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:30,709
[Mai] I hate you.

566
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,918
I hate you!

567
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:38,083
Which is why

568
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,334
I never told you

569
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,626
about my first love,

570
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:44,125
or about my technique!

571
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,751
[Utahime] "Construction"

572
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,751
uses one's cursed energy

573
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:51,292
to create matter from nothing.

574
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,334
It differs from the

575
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,334
manifestation

576
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:54,292
of an innate domain

577
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,417
within the barrier of

578
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,417
a domain expansion.

579
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,667
The matter produced

580
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,667
by Construction

581
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:02,459
doesn't disappear when

582
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:02,459
the cursed technique ends.

583
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,918
Because of that, it consumes

584
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,918
a lot of cursed energy,

585
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,667
and puts a heavy

586
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,667
strain on the body.

587
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:12,667
Creating one bullet a

588
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:12,667
day, is Mai's maximum.

589
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,459
So she uses a revolver

590
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,542
to create confusion about how

591
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,542
many bullets she has left.

592
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:20,751
[Mai] I win.

593
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,000
I win!

594
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,792
(Maki grunts)

595
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,083
[Mai] She-

596
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,167
She caught the bullet?

597
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:34,792
(Maki grunts)

598
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:37,751
I should never do that

599
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:37,751
with my bare hands.

600
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,292
(Mai gasps)

601
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,083
(Mai grunts)

602
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,125
(Mai yells)

603
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,876
[Mai] Maki has a talent I don't.

604
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,334
(Mai grunts)

605
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,167
[Mai] Like Mechamaru,

606
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,167
she has a Heavenly Pact,

607
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,459
but hers is somehow different.

608
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:54,167
Normally, she would have been

609
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:54,167
born with a cursed technique.

610
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,500
(Maki grunts)

611
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:56,500
(Mai grunts)

612
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:57,792
[Mai] But in exchange for that,

613
00:18:57,876 --> 00:18:59,751
she was granted superhuman

614
00:18:57,876 --> 00:18:59,751
physical abilities.

615
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:02,709
(Mai sighs)

616
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:03,959
[Mai] The Zen'in clan

617
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:03,959
would never acknowledge it.

618
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,626
That this was a talent.

619
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:07,626
(Mai grunts)

620
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:08,000
[Mai] That I lacked!

621
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:12,334
Well, what now?

622
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,167
Is this settled, then?

623
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,834
Why?

624
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:19,125
Why did you leave the clan?

625
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,792
Come on! You know

626
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,792
the answer to that!

627
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:23,584
You joined Jujutsu High, too!

628
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,876
Wrong!

629
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:25,876
-(Maki gasps)

630
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:25,876
-(Mai sobs)

631
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,000
I never wanted to be

632
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,000
a jujutsu sorcerer!

633
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,667
It's all your fault!

634
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,584
Because you tried

635
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,584
so hard to be one,

636
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,000
I was forced to follow

637
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,000
in your footsteps!

638
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm so sick of facing

639
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:40,000
all these scary things!

640
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,751
What was so awful about being

641
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,751
ordered around back home?

642
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,667
We could have just

643
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,667
done a few chores,

644
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,918
and lived like

645
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,918
everyone else does!

646
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
(Mai sobs)

647
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,751
Why couldn't you have

648
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:56,459
just stayed and been satisfied

649
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:56,459
down at the bottom with me?

650
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,042
(sad music)

651
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,167
Because,

652
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,834
I would have hated myself

653
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,834
if I had done that.

654
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:08,834
That's why.

655
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,250
I'm sorry.

656
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,042
(Mai sobs)

657
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,250
(sad music)

658
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:18,876
[Mai] Big sister! Don't let go!

659
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,417
[Maki] I won't let go.

660
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,584
[Mai] You never will?

661
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,417
[Maki] Jeez, give it a rest.

662
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,792
[Mai] Never leave me behind.

663
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:28,209
[Maki] Of course I won't.

664
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,876
After all, we're sisters.

665
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:36,292
(piano music)

666
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,209
[Mai] What a liar.

667
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,250
I hate you.

668
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:49,083
(closing theme music)

669
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:59,334
(singing in Japanese)

670
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,042
[Miwa, Momo, and

671
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,042
Mai] Juju Stroll!

672
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,375
(bored music)

673
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,209
[Miwa] I'm so hungry.

674
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,959
Fortunately, I think my

675
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,959
left over edamame from lunch

676
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:33,709
is still in the fridge.

677
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,834
(Momo and Mai chewing)

678
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:36,834
-Hm?

679
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:36,834
-Hm?

680
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,959
(Miwa grunts)

681
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:44,584
(Momo chewing)

682
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,000
(Momo swallows)

683
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,375
Sorry.

684
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,000
[Miwa] You could at least

685
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,000
try to look a little

686
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,000
guilty!

687
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:54,334
[Momo] As a token of

688
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:54,334
my apology, have this.

689
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:55,042
(Miwa sighs) No,

690
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:55,042
I'm not interested

691
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,584
in late-night cup ramen.

692
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,250
(Momo laughs)

693
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,584
How about this?

694
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,876
Nishimiya-style

695
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,876
Seafood Cup Ramen!

696
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:08,375
Step one, use scissors to

697
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:08,375
chop up hot chili peppers

698
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:10,584
into the seafood cup ramen!

699
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,250
Two: Fill the container

700
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,250
halfway with milk.

701
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:17,042
Three: Add hot water

702
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:17,042
up to the line inside!

703
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,083
Since we're using milk, make

704
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,083
sure the water's boiling hot!

705
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,042
(Miwa slurps)

706
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,417
(Miwa gasps)

707
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,626
[Miwa] This is good!

708
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,626
It's really good!

709
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:30,626
[Momo] Right?

710
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,083
[Mai] Maybe I'll have

711
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,083
it next time, too.

712
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,584
Why didn't you eat this?

713
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:35,959
Instead of taking my edamame.

714
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,667
(Miwa slurps)

715
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,667
Well, you still pay the price

716
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:42,667
for late-night cup

717
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:42,667
ramen the next day.

718
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:43,125
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

719
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,709
(intense rock music)
