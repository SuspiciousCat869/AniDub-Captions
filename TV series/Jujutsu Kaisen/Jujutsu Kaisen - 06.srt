1
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:10,500
(liquid bubbling)

2
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:26,584
Don't you poke around inside me.

3
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,375
Not without my permission!

4
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,250
I hate that, punk ass!

5
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,209
Then you come down here

6
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,542
and I'll tear you open!

7
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,876
(opening theme music)

8
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,876
"Episode 6: After Rain"

9
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,709
You're being awfully

10
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,709
hostile, aren't you?

11
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:19,709
Ha!

12
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:20,918
You got that right!

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,167
You expect kindness

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,167
after you murdered me?

15
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,500
So that's the thanks I get

16
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,542
for healing your arm and hand?

17
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,334
Let's not forget

18
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,334
that right after that

19
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,542
you ripped out my heart!

20
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:33,375
Where are we anyway,

21
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:33,375
is this hell?

22
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,167
I'm not crazy about being

23
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,167
stuck with you for eternity.

24
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:40,167
But I'll make it work.

25
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,250
And you'll pay!

26
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,167
(charge yell)

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,584
I hope you're ready for this!

28
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:00,375
He was aiming for where I stood?

29
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,209
You fell for it!

30
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,209
Got you!

31
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,918
What the?

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,125
You're just so predictable.

33
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,250
Ah!

34
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,334
I was sure I'd landed

35
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,334
that one perfectly!

36
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:17,751
Damn it.

37
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,792
This isn't the afterlife.

38
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,042
This place is my Innate Domain.

39
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,918
Innate Domain?

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,918
Fushiguro talked about!

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,209
Or think of it as

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,209
being in my mind.

43
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,250
In short, you could say

44
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,250
we're not dead just yet.

45
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:32,250
Oh.

46
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,375
If you'll accept my conditions,

47
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,083
I'll fix your heart and

48
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,083
bring us both back to life.

49
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,584
Cocky bastard.

50
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,584
Don't act like you're

51
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,584
doing me a favor!

52
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,584
I know you don't

53
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,584
want to die either!

54
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,626
But the situation has changed.

55
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,751
Very soon I'll be able to

56
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,751
see something interesting.

57
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,167
I have just two conditions.

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,292
Number one is whenever I

59
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,292
chant the word Extension,

60
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,626
you'll surrender your

61
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,626
body to me for one minute.

62
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,250
Two, you'll completely

63
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,250
forget you made this promise.

64
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,250
No way!

65
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,417
I don't know what

66
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,417
you're really after here

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,459
but it's shady as hell.

68
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,334
I finally get what

69
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,334
you're really about now.

70
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,792
You are pure evil!

71
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:11,626
And I'm not lending

72
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:11,626
you my body ever again!

73
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,209
During that minute I won't

74
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,209
kill or injure anyone.

75
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,792
Is that enough to

76
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,792
address your concerns?

77
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,292
Loser.

78
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,292
[Yuuji] Like I'd

79
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,292
ever believe you!

80
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not about whether

81
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,000
you believe me or not.

82
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,292
This is a pact, a geas.

83
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,334
I'll be the one

84
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,334
punished if I break it.

85
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,125
(pain scream)

86
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,209
And if you pursue selfish

87
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,209
gain beyond your means,

88
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,125
you will suffer retribution.

89
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,125
I'm certain you've

90
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,125
experienced that for

91
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,125
yourself.

92
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:41,209
It wasn't a problem before!

93
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,209
Hm.

94
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:43,334
Huh?

95
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:47,667
Oh, you mean that time

96
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:47,667
I wanted to switch, too.

97
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:50,542
And you were just doing what

98
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:50,542
that sorcerer told you to.

99
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,709
A pact founded in

100
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,709
mutual interest.

101
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:59,417
That's one of the key

102
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:59,417
factors behind all jujutsu.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,167
Fine, then.

104
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,542
Get off of me already.

105
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:04,459
I'll accept your conditions.

106
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,834
I don't understand

107
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,834
exactly what you're up to,

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,417
just that it means

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,417
I'll come back to life!

110
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:20,918
I'd never accept that!

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,542
Bring me back to life

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,542
without any conditions.

113
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:26,500
It's all thanks to you I

114
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:26,500
died in the first place.

115
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:29,167
Well how about this then?

116
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,250
We'll fight to the death

117
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,709
and I'll do it without

118
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,709
conditions if you defeat me.

119
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:36,292
But if I win then you live

120
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:36,292
only under my two conditions.

121
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,292
Yeah!

122
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,667
I'll kick your ass for...

123
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,751
[Gojou] You know, I have a

124
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,751
deeply flawed personality.

125
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:49,751
[Ijichi] I know.

126
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:50,417
Ijichi, expect a forehead flick.

127
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,417
(gasp)

128
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,959
A forehead flick?

129
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,667
Being a teacher is not my style.

130
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:57,542
Do you know why I

131
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:57,542
decided to become

132
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,209
a teacher at this school

133
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,209
in the first place?

134
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,292
Ask me.

135
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,125
Why did you do it?

136
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,918
Because I have a dream.

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,918
[Ijichi] You have a dream?

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,918
Yup.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,125
As you can see in

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,125
this case with Yuuji,

141
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,209
the top of the jujutsu

142
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,209
world is a den of vice.

143
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,500
Conservative fools,

144
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,500
traditional

145
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,500
fools, arrogant fools,

146
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,375
just plain fools.

147
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,584
It's a bargain sale

148
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,584
on rotten mikan!

149
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:25,500
And I want to reset that

150
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:25,500
garbage jujutsu world.

151
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:30,792
Murdering all the fools at

152
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:30,792
the top would be an easy task.

153
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,417
But no fix, 'cause they'd

154
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,417
all just get replaced

155
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,250
and there'd be no revolution.

156
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,542
Plus if I did that, no one

157
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,542
would want to follow me.

158
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,417
That's why I chose

159
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,417
education instead.

160
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,709
As a way to raise up

161
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,709
strong, clever compatriots.

162
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,417
And sometimes it's also

163
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,959
why I send students

164
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,959
to do my missions.

165
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:53,125
It's tough love.

166
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,125
Or a chance for

167
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,125
you to slack off.

168
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,417
And they're all talented.

169
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,209
Especially Hakari,

170
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,209
the third-year,

171
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,834
and the second-year, Okkotsu.

172
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,375
They'll become jujutsu

173
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,375
sorcerers on a par with me.

174
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:06,459
Yuuji would have been

175
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:06,459
one of them as well.

176
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:10,834
Hey you two.

177
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:11,500
-Hm?

178
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:11,500
-Hm?

179
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:14,042
I'm going to get started.

180
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,667
Are you gonna watch from there?

181
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:18,083
(shock gasp)

182
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,042
Hm?

183
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,042
Whoa!

184
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,042
Where're my clothes?!

185
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,167
G-G-G-Gojou!

186
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:23,834
He's alive!

187
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:24,834
Are you seeing this?

188
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:25,500
-He's alive!

189
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:25,500
-Ijichi stop.

190
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:26,626
I'm a little bummed.

191
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,667
Yeah, well.

192
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:29,500
It's embarrassing

193
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:29,500
but, who are you?

194
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:30,500
[Gojou] Hi, Yuuji!

195
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,584
Huh?

196
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:33,584
Welcome back!

197
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,042
Yo!

198
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,167
Well thanks.

199
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,876
What a pain.

200
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,125
I'm going to have to

201
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,125
revise all the reports.

202
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,375
No, leave them as-is.

203
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,667
I want us to give Yuuji the time

204
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:54,876
to regain the minimum power

205
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:54,876
before he gets targeted again.

206
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,500
And so, I need you to

207
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,500
just leave him listed

208
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:59,334
as deceased on the records.

209
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,292
Ah.

210
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,876
So, you're gonna keep

211
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,876
Itadori hidden away?

212
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,000
No.

213
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,417
I'll have him back in time

214
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,417
for the Exchange Event.

215
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,417
[Shouko] Why?

216
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,667
The reason is simple.

217
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,500
No one can be allowed to

218
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,500
take the events of youth

219
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:13,667
away from the young people

220
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:13,667
they're designed for.

221
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,959
I bet this'll shock em!

222
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:17,626
Not anyone.

223
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,542
I've gotta get outta

224
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,542
here, right now!

225
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,667
I've always had a strong

226
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,667
sense of responsibility,

227
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:32,250
and I've been saving all my pay

228
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,876
so I can send my four younger

229
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,876
sisters to college, too!

230
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,250
But even I can't fight

231
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,250
my survival instinct!

232
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:39,709
And I know if I go near

233
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:39,709
that table, I'll die!

234
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,250
[Jougo] Satoru Gojou!

235
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:45,459
I wonder, could we kill

236
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:45,459
him if we joined forces?

237
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:48,918
No, he'd either flutter

238
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:48,918
out of your grasp

239
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,542
or, in the worst case,

240
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,542
you'd all get exorcised.

241
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,542
I would recommend you pour

242
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,542
your energy into sealing him

243
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:56,083
rather than killing him.

244
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,083
How?

245
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,417
Do you have a lead?

246
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,792
We'll use the special-grade

247
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,792
cursed object Prison Realm.

248
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,792
Prison Realm?

249
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,959
Table five hasn't

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,959
ordered anything.

251
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:08,751
I'll go and hurry him up.

252
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,209
He's taking up a whole table.

253
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,876
I'm sorry boss, but I quit!

254
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:15,792
Huh?

255
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:18,125
Hey, you come back here!

256
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:18,626
Prison Realm?

257
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:19,709
That horrible thing?

258
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:23,125
It's warm.

259
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,125
The AC quit working?

260
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,584
Relax, Jougo, or you'll

261
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,584
overheat the place.

262
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,292
How are you, sir?

263
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,626
Have you decided on...

264
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,083
Aagh!

265
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:39,292
(terror scream)

266
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,959
I wish you wouldn't cause

267
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,959
such a commotion, Jougo.

268
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,667
Oh this is nothing.

269
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:46,459
(horror scream)

270
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:47,459
What?

271
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,125
(horror scream)

272
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:56,542
(coughs)

273
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,375
Glad we didn't

274
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,375
choose finer dining.

275
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,834
(panicking)

276
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,709
Tell me, Getou.

277
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:12,626
How strong am I in terms

278
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:12,626
of Sukuna's fingers?

279
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,792
[Getou] As a

280
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,792
conservative estimate?

281
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,459
I'd say eight or nine fingers.

282
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:17,459
Yeah?

283
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:18,459
That's plenty!

284
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:19,626
Give me the Prison Realm!

285
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:21,834
I'll add it to my collection!

286
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:24,042
And in return I'll promise you,

287
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,292
I'll kill Gojou.

288
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:32,500
Help!

289
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,876
(melodious electronic music)

290
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:44,292
(upbeat electronic music)

291
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,000
By the time we

292
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,000
arrived on the scene,

293
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,042
your son was already dead.

294
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,667
I'm sorry.

295
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:53,918
To be honest,

296
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,626
I was skeptical about saving

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,626
any of the people in there.

298
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,500
However, my friend

299
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,500
was different.

300
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,459
He wasn't successful,

301
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:06,209
but after we confirmed

302
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:06,209
your son's death

303
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,918
you know he's tried to

304
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,918
bring his body back for you.

305
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,209
It's okay.

306
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,209
"Okazaki Tadashi"

307
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:21,876
(sigh)

308
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:22,959
Please take this.

309
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,292
I know it's not much.

310
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:31,959
I'm sorry we weren't

311
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:31,959
able to save Tadashi.

312
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,292
It's all right

313
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,709
Don't apologize.

314
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,918
I'm the only one

315
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,918
who will mourn him!

316
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:40,751
No one else will even care.

317
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,709
(sobbing)

318
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:51,292
(intense running efforts)

319
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,959
Yo, you're late, Megumi.

320
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,292
Kelp.

321
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,292
Where have you been?

322
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,000
And what does it matter to you?

323
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,751
Answer me something.

324
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:00,959
Hm?

325
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,709
As a sorcerer, what kind of

326
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,709
people do you want to save?

327
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:04,667
Huh?

328
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,584
What difference

329
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,584
should it make to me

330
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,292
whether my actions

331
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,292
save anyone at all?

332
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,959
I knew I shouldn't

333
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,959
have asked you.

334
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:10,959
Say what?

335
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,042
Fushiguro!

336
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,500
Quit asking interview

337
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,500
prep questions

338
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:16,334
and come switch places with me!

339
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,667
I am so totally sick of

340
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,667
these school uniforms!

341
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:21,292
Let me go buy some cute

342
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:21,292
tracksuits for this event!

343
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,334
And here we go.

344
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,375
(yelling)

345
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:26,959
What the hell are they doing?

346
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:28,459
Falling practice.

347
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:29,375
Mustard leaf.

348
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,792
You're both pretty

349
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,792
weak in close quarters.

350
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,876
So first.

351
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,125
See if you can

352
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,125
land a blow on us.

353
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:38,000
Do that and we'll talk.

354
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,542
You're already a

355
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,542
head above the rest

356
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,792
when it comes to

357
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,792
close combat, Yuuji.

358
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,334
So what you need to

359
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,334
learn to do next is

360
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,792
control cursed energy.

361
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:51,167
And we need to add to your

362
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:51,167
basic knowledge of jujutsu.

363
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,542
"Smile"

364
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:52,834
What's wrong?

365
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:53,834
Sorry.

366
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:56,792
I'm just happy 'cause

367
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:56,792
I know you're the best

368
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,417
and you're the one I

369
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,417
wanted to have train me.

370
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:03,209
Before, I was too weak and

371
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:03,209
I couldn't save anybody.

372
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,876
Worse, I nearly got

373
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,876
Fushiguro killed.

374
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,918
I won't be able to face

375
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,918
them the way I am now.

376
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,125
Make me strong.

377
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:16,876
Make me into the strongest!

378
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,000
(chuckles)

379
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,918
You've got a keen eye.

380
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,751
Well actually, you already

381
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,751
told me you were the

382
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,751
strongest.

383
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,375
All right, well

384
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,375
first take a look

385
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,334
at those two soda

386
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,334
cans over there.

387
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,667
Whoa!

388
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,000
[Gojou] This is

389
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,000
with cursed energy,

390
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,375
and that's cursed technique.

391
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:41,375
I see.

392
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,375
No I don't.

393
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,375
Uhh, okay.

394
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,792
Then think of cursed

395
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,792
energy as electricity,

396
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:50,459
and cursed technique as

397
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:50,459
electrical appliances.

398
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,209
Electricity by itself

399
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,209
is hard to use, right?

400
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,792
That's why we run that

401
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,792
electricity through

402
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,792
appliances

403
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,417
to achieve various results.

404
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,042
Here, I just fired off

405
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,042
pure cursed energy.

406
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,792
Whereas here, I

407
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,792
channeled cursed energy

408
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:04,667
into a cursed technique

409
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:04,667
to activate it,

410
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:06,542
twisting the can with jujutsu.

411
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:08,584
Alright!

412
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,209
So I get to learn a really

413
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,209
good cursed technique now huh?

414
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:12,209
[Gojou] No.

415
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:12,876
You can't use cursed techniques.

416
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:13,959
Huh?

417
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,918
Aside from simple Shikigami

418
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,918
and your basic barriers,

419
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,918
cursed techniques

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,918
are fundamentally

421
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,250
etched into your body

422
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,250
from the day you're born.

423
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:24,417
Huh?

424
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,083
So the power of a

425
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,083
jujutsu sorcerer

426
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,626
is about 80% innate talent.

427
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,042
(dazed)

428
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,042
You okay?

429
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,209
Yeah.

430
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,876
I just thought I'd be able

431
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,876
to pull off thunder or fire

432
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,626
or a power bomb or something.

433
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,083
You can do a power

434
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,083
bomb just like Ohnita.

435
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:40,834
Aww!

436
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:42,834
This sucks big time!

437
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:46,042
I wanted to pull off a

438
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:46,042
Spirit Gun or a Bankai

439
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,542
or a Rasengan or a Dodon Ray!

440
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:49,292
-What a drag!

441
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:49,292
-You just can't use them yet!

442
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,292
But eventually, Sukuna's

443
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,292
cursed techniques

444
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,125
will be engraved into your body!

445
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,500
I wanted to fire

446
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,500
off a Kamehameha!

447
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:56,459
Let's just ignore the

448
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:56,459
things you can't do

449
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,000
and work on enhancing

450
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,000
your strengths.

451
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,959
We will imbue your fighting

452
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,959
style with cursed energy!

453
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:03,125
I'm way more scared of

454
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:03,125
someone with solid basics

455
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,250
than I am of inferior jujutsu.

456
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,250
Like I said your

457
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,250
talent for close combat

458
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:07,918
is already top-notch.

459
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
(sudden realization gasp)

460
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,042
But wait a sec!

461
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:11,918
I already know how to do that!

462
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,292
Get up.

463
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,834
Against that special-grade,

464
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,834
I got it to work, somehow.

465
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,709
Then give it a try.

466
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:23,792
Hit me here.

467
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:25,792
Not that I think you can.

468
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,542
Don't blame me if you get hurt.

469
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,042
Come one, hurry up, try it.

470
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:36,125
That punch had

471
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:36,125
zero cursed energy.

472
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:37,500
But why?

473
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:39,792
Cause it requires

474
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:39,792
negative emotions.

475
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:41,334
In the fight that

476
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:41,334
you're recalling,

477
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:44,083
you were probably brimming

478
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:44,083
with fear and with anger.

479
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,167
Ah!

480
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,042
So you have to constantly

481
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,042
be flipping out

482
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,209
in order to use

483
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,209
your cursed energy?

484
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,792
But now that you mention it

485
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,542
Fushiguro's always ticked off.

486
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:52,876
Demon Dogs!

487
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,000
(barks)

488
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,083
Not quite.

489
00:15:58,584 --> 00:15:59,500
What's wrong?

490
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,083
I'm irritated all of a sudden.

491
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,209
-Huh?

492
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,209
-No, I don't mean with you.

493
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:05,334
-[Toge] Salmon roe.

494
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:05,334
-Only a month and a half

495
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:05,334
left.

496
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,375
So no daydreaming!

497
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,792
Now here, try your hand

498
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,792
at the long one next.

499
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,626
This actually feels pretty good.

500
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,375
All students are trained

501
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,375
to produce cursed energy

502
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,042
using even the faintest

503
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,042
sparks of emotion.

504
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,083
And they're trained in ways

505
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,167
to avoid wasting

506
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,167
their cursed energy

507
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,083
when their emotions

508
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,083
are flaring up as well.

509
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,584
(dismayed gasp)

510
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,709
There are several

511
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,709
training methods for this.

512
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:33,000
The one I'm going to use on

513
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:33,000
you is especially exhausting.

514
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,042
Okay, what's that?

515
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,792
Watching movies!

516
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,167
Watching movies?

517
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,083
Yup!

518
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:40,918
From classics to

519
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:40,918
C-grade horror movies

520
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,250
to terrible French movies.

521
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,626
Nonstop as long as

522
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,626
you can stay awake.

523
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,167
Of course you won't be

524
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,167
watching them all alone.

525
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,209
(snoring)

526
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,083
You'll be watching

527
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,083
them with this guy.

528
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,250
[Yuuji] What's with the

529
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,250
cute-but-creepy doll?

530
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:55,959
It's cute?

531
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,584
It's another cursed corpse.

532
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,584
From the Principal!

533
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,709
Yeah, I recognize his style.

534
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,584
But, I'm not seeing

535
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,584
the point here.

536
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:10,876
Don't be hasty, now.

537
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,584
You'll see soon enough.

538
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,584
That cursed corpse will wake up

539
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,209
and attack you just like that,

540
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,751
if you don't keep cursed

541
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,751
energy flowing into it.

542
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,626
Like I said before,

543
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,125
we've got all kinds of

544
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,125
movies here to choose from.

545
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,459
Tear-jerkers,

546
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,459
thrillers, comedies.

547
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:31,584
Movies to make you laugh

548
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:31,584
or cry or gross you out.

549
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,292
Your first assignment

550
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,292
is to watch an movie

551
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,083
from start to finish,

552
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,083
without

553
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,083
waking the cursed corpse.

554
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:40,209
This trains you to maintain a

555
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:40,209
steady output of cursed energy

556
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,292
no matter what

557
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,292
emotions you feel.

558
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,375
You can't use too

559
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,375
much or too little.

560
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:48,083
(aggravated flailing)

561
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,459
(relieved sigh)

562
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:52,626
For now I have it set to the

563
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:52,626
faint level of cursed energy

564
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:53,626
that you're able to produce.

565
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:56,459
But soon it'll start

566
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:56,459
demanding greater output,

567
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,834
so you can't let

568
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,834
your guard down.

569
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:01,334
I couldn't let it down

570
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:01,334
even if I wanted to.

571
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,918
Where do you want to start?

572
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,292
I recommend this one.

573
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,209
The heroine's annoying but she

574
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,209
dies gloriously in the end.

575
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:08,042
Thanks for the spoiler.

576
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,167
Hey, I know!

577
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,751
Let's start with an action ad...

578
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,083
Oh, come on!

579
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,042
Hey!

580
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,334
Keep that cursed energy steady!

581
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,542
Carrying cursed tools, huh?

582
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,042
I'm fine with supplementing

583
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,042
close combat with weapons,

584
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,125
but with my cursed technique

585
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:28,667
I want to be able to

586
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:28,667
have my hands free.

587
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:31,292
Swords cost you time sheathing

588
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:31,292
and unsheathing them.

589
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,042
So Zenin, you often carry around

590
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,292
two or even more around

591
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,292
with you don't you?

592
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,500
How do you do that?

593
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,459
Oh I make Panda carry them.

594
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,751
I knew I shouldn't

595
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,751
have asked, part two.

596
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,125
Some jujutsu sorcerers

597
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,125
keep cursed spirits

598
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,167
that can store and

599
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,167
retrieve objects.

600
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,751
Yeah, but he can't do

601
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,751
that, it's a rare ability.

602
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,709
And it takes time

603
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,709
to tame them, too.

604
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,876
But if you do find

605
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,876
any, let me know.

606
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,167
[Panda] It'll cost you a

607
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,167
year's supply of Calpas.

608
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:59,209
But there's just, one

609
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:59,209
thing I don't get.

610
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,167
Why did you run?

611
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,542
Kind of a waste of your talents.

612
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,209
Do I have the potential

613
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,209
to beat special-grades?

614
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,417
Is that what he meant by that?

615
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,375
Tuna, tuna.

616
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,375
Huh?

617
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,459
What's that?

618
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,250
Zen'in?

619
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,834
I think I know how to do it.

620
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:31,542
Ura-Hara?

621
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:32,584
Where's Ura-Hara?

622
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,709
Am I lost?

623
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,209
Do I cut the red

624
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,209
wire or the blue one?

625
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,459
I need to know!

626
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,918
In the area where I used to live

627
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,125
we had designated trash bags.

628
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,375
What are you talking about?

629
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,751
We're running out of time!

630
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,751
And the bags were

631
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,751
red for plastic

632
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,751
and blue for combustible trash.

633
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,209
I thought, shouldn't

634
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,209
it be the opposite?

635
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,209
It should be red!

636
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,626
Anyone would go with red!

637
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,209
Alright, I'll trust you.

638
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,334
(anxious breathing)

639
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,834
Ugh!

640
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:14,250
(boxing bell ringing)

641
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,167
(coughs)

642
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,250
Don't attack me while

643
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,250
I'm drinking soda!

644
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:19,792
Don't drink.

645
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,292
But you can't watch a movie

646
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,292
without chips and soda!

647
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,542
You have a point there.

648
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,167
Well, Gojou's got to get going.

649
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,834
So just keep hanging in there.

650
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:31,459
Is this really gonna

651
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:31,459
make me stronger?

652
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:34,250
(chuckles)

653
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,334
Oh, yeah.

654
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,292
While you were dead,

655
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,292
did you talk to Sukuna?

656
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,375
Not sure.

657
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,292
And before he

658
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,292
repaired your heart,

659
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,250
did he suggest any deals

660
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,250
or make conditions?

661
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:47,334
Ohh!

662
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:49,334
I think he did say

663
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:49,334
something like that.

664
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,500
But I can't remember

665
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,500
what it was.

666
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:54,959
I see.

667
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:01,834
We have some time

668
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:01,834
before your appointment

669
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:02,834
with the principal.

670
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,459
Do you want to stop anywhere?

671
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,834
No thanks.

672
00:21:05,918 --> 00:21:08,250
I'll surprise him and show

673
00:21:05,918 --> 00:21:08,250
up early for a change.

674
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:12,834
Stop here.

675
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:13,918
[Ijichi] Huh?

676
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,334
Right here?

677
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,334
You go on ahead.

678
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,500
[Ijichi] Agh!

679
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:19,042
Is this a test or something?

680
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:19,918
You're going to hit me

681
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,209
if I drive away without

682
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,209
you, aren't you?

683
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:24,500
Just what type of guy

684
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:24,500
do you think I am?

685
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,584
[Ijichi] Okay then.

686
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,834
All right.

687
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:38,834
(banshee attack wail)

688
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,709
(menacing laugh)

689
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,083
I see.

690
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,209
Who are you then?

691
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,250
("Lost in Paradise"

692
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,250
by ALI feat. AKLO)

693
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,459
[Voiceovers] Juju Stroll!

694
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,417
[Voiceover] It's Satoru

695
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,417
Gojou's Go Go Gojou!

696
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,000
We are here at my alma mater,

697
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,584
Tokyo Metropolitan

Jujutsu Tech High School.

699
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:28,792
Oh no!

700
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,417
A boy in trouble already?

701
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,792
He's a new student, having

702
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,792
trouble producing cursed

703
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,792
energy!

704
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:35,375
Let's try to help him!

705
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:38,792
Imagine yourself on a

706
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:38,792
narrow pathway at school.

707
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,083
Standing before you is

708
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,083
a row of college boys,

709
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,000
and you can see they

710
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,000
haven't noticed you.

711
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,459
You want to kill them all!

712
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:45,459
And so you--

713
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:46,542
Shut up.

714
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:51,459
(tense music)

715
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,709
