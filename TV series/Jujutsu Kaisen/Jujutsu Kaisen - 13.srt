1
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,918
Itadori, why is

2
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,918
his nose bleeding?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,292
I smashed in his face.

4
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,209
But when?

5
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:19,292
At the start of the fight.

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,125
And did his hand touch you?

7
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:22,250
Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,167
My attacks aren't

9
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,167
going to work on him.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,959
Huh? Wait, what?

11
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,083
But why not?

12
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:31,292
I'll explain it later

13
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:31,292
while I'm lecturing you.

14
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,209
It's either because, one:

15
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:35,292
his technique doesn't

16
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:35,292
work on Itadori.

17
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,000
Or two: there's some reason

18
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,000
he won't kill Itadori.

19
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,542
Either way, it's good for us.

20
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:43,292
However, I'll try to keep

21
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:43,292
him from moving around.

22
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,584
Then, once we've

23
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,584
both got an opening,

24
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,292
we'll shower him with blows.

25
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:52,667
We'll exorcise this

26
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:52,667
one, here and now.

27
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,292
Yeah!

28
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:06,167
I'll keep an eye

29
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:06,167
on Yuuji Itadori,

30
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,876
while I start by taking out

31
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,876
the Seven to Three sorcerer.

32
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:30,834
Hmmm.

33
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:33,292
I thought that would

34
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:33,292
be a good one to use.

35
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,417
But they both just dodged it

36
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,083
and then, they started

37
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,083
shaving away the weaker ends.

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,626
I guess it only

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,626
works on small fry.

40
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,834
Time to stop!

41
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,000
(roars)

42
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,542
(attack grunt)

43
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,167
Notice just before

44
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,167
he changes shape...

45
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,667
He stores cursed energy.

46
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:58,667
Right.

47
00:01:58,751 --> 00:01:59,500
(laughs)

48
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,834
Even though I've

49
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,834
made myself smaller,

50
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,292
there's still some

51
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,292
danger of Yuuji Itadori

52
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,042
killing me in one blow.

53
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,334
He really is my natural enemy.

54
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,167
So I'll need to make him behave.

55
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,667
(vomiting)

56
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,459
Transfigured humans!

57
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,876
He still had a

58
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,876
stockpile of them?

59
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,792
Kill the short-haired brat, you!

60
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,584
Look, he's running from them!

61
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,667
I knew he couldn't kill humans!

62
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,584
(attack chittering, gibberish)

63
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,000
You wanna play?

64
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,209
(attack chittering, gibberish)

65
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,292
Please kill me.

66
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,167
Please?

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,459
Next I should have him

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,459
attack you, sorcerer.

69
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:10,250
You think he'll cry then too?

70
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:13,292
He's a foolish brat who

71
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:13,292
can't reconcile reality

72
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,459
with his ideals.

73
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,250
You're wrong about that.

74
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:19,918
He's right in the process of

75
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:19,918
making that reconciliation.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,918
If you want to know

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,918
what I think...

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,584
I'd say you're the fool.

79
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,167
(surprised laugh)

80
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,792
Did you kill those three?

81
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,584
Damn, they know my tricks now!

82
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,667
They know I change shape right

83
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,667
before the moment of impact.

84
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,626
(agony yell)

85
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:54,500
They're not giving me enough

86
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:54,500
time to create a substitute!

87
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:55,959
Ahh!

88
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,626
What fresh inspiration this is!

89
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,125
Is this...

90
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:02,250
Death?

91
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,250
(building laughter)

92
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:16,083
I bet I could do it now!

93
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,125
Domain Expansion!

94
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:40,125
Self-Embodiment of Perfection!

95
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,250
No!

96
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,667
Right now, I'm just so

97
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,459
grateful to you.

98
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:56,292
(opening theme music)

99
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,918
"Jujutsu Kaisen"

100
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:24,125
"Episode 13: Tomorrow"

101
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,459
(punching efforts, grunting)

102
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:28,000
Quit screwing around!

103
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:32,667
Why'd he seal Nanami

104
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:32,667
inside and not me?

105
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:33,918
What do I do?

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,042
What can I do?

107
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:41,751
Domain Expansion.

108
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,918
Within an innate domain

109
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,918
constructed from cursed energy,

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,459
the ultimate

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,459
technique becomes one

112
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,584
that's guaranteed

113
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,584
to hit its target.

114
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,459
It's the height of jujutsu

115
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,459
sorcery I could never reach.

116
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,959
Most likely, his

117
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,959
cursed technique

118
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,292
requires touching the target

119
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,167
with his palm in its base state,

120
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,000
in order to interfere

121
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,000
with the victim's soul.

122
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,959
However, in a domain

123
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,959
that guarantees a hit,

124
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,959
that would mean that

125
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,959
now, I'm literally...

126
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,667
In the palm of his hand.

127
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:11,542
Shit.

128
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:15,167
Jujutsu sorcerers are shit.

129
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,042
They have to be prepared

130
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,334
to sacrifice their

131
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,334
lives for others,

132
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,334
and occasionally force their

133
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,334
comrades to do so as well.

134
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,834
That's why I quit.

135
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,083
Though, ran away

136
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,083
is more like it.

137
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,334
[Bakery Girl] You really like

138
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,500
our ham and cheese, don't you?

139
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,167
Huh?

140
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,000
(laugh)

141
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,000
You always order

142
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,000
the same sandwich.

143
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,959
Oh, uh, yeah.

144
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:40,209
They stopped selling it at

145
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:40,209
my local convenience store.

146
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:43,000
Ours is probably better

147
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:43,000
than theirs anyway.

148
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,209
Yeah, well you are a bakery.

149
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,083
Hey, give us a little credit!

150
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,334
See you next time!

151
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,083
A fly head.

152
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,542
Leaving it alone

153
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,542
won't hurt anything.

154
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,375
It'd be a bigger

155
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,375
pain to deal with it

156
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02,542
and have her think

157
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02,542
I'm some weird medium.

158
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,834
Hello, everybody!

159
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:09,584
Listen up!

160
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,667
Make those sales!

161
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:13,417
When people trust

162
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:13,417
us with their money,

163
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,375
they're trusting us

164
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,375
with their lives.

165
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:17,542
So it goes without saying

166
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,751
that we have to balance

167
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,751
the pursuit of profit

168
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,250
against the risks.

169
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,876
There's no need to do

170
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,876
anything special at the start.

171
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,083
Just be sincere

172
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,083
with the clients.

173
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,083
Mm-hmm.

174
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,042
Try never to forget that.

175
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:29,626
[New Guy] Right!

176
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,918
Nanami...

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,876
Don't be so damned

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,876
serious all the time,

179
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,667
you're freaking out the virgin.

180
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,792
New boy, what you need

181
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,792
to think about first

182
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:39,792
is the company's profits!

183
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,459
If we don't profit then

184
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,459
neither does the client!

185
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:45,876
Even when we con them

186
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:45,876
into buying shit stocks

187
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:46,876
with no growth potential?

188
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,876
Of course!

189
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:48,876
It's a well-deserved payment

190
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,792
given the fact that

191
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,792
we spend our days

192
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:52,792
staring at the markets

193
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:52,792
around the clock!

194
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:55,250
Nanami, this is your

195
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:55,250
second year, right?

196
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,792
You're clever, let

197
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,792
yourself run wild, okay!

198
00:08:57,876 --> 00:09:00,250
I expect great things from you!

199
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,584
I'm a person who's never

200
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,584
gotten the concept of

201
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,292
"reason for living" or

202
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,292
"something worth doing."

203
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,083
I figure I'll just

204
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,083
earn enough money

205
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:08,959
by the time I'm 30 or 40,

206
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,667
to enjoy the rest

207
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,667
of my aimless life

208
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:14,459
in some country with

209
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:14,459
a low cost of living.

210
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:17,292
It's been four years

211
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:17,292
since I left the school.

212
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,083
Now, whether I'm

213
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,083
awake or asleep,

214
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,209
all I think about is money.

215
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,459
Curses and other people

216
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,459
have nothing to do with me,

217
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,292
as long I have money.

218
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,375
Money.

219
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,667
Money.

220
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:29,792
Money.

221
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:31,876
Money, money.

222
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,667
As long as I have money.

223
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,375
Are you all right?

224
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,709
I mean are you

225
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,709
getting enough sleep?

226
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:40,667
What about you?

227
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,292
You look like you've

228
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,292
been carrying around

229
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,709
some serious stress.

230
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,209
Ha, you can tell that huh?

231
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:50,918
Lately I feel like there's

232
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:50,918
this weight on my shoulder.

233
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,834
I haven't been

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,834
sleeping well, either.

235
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,334
[Nanami] Essentially my job--

236
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,500
Hm?

237
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,709
Is to take money

238
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,709
from wealthy people,

239
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:02,500
and use it to make those

240
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:02,500
people even more wealthy.

241
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:03,709
That's pretty much all it is.

242
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:07,667
Frankly no one would even

243
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:07,667
mind if I were to just vanish.

244
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:09,125
But people who wanted bread

245
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,125
would definitely mind if

246
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,125
their bakery was gone.

247
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,959
Yet for some reason, my job,

248
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:17,876
which exists completely outside

249
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:17,876
of that natural human cycle,

250
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,375
pays better money.

251
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:20,709
When you think

252
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:20,709
about it logically,

253
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,209
it really doesn't

254
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,209
make any sense at all.

255
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,667
Are you bragging?

256
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:26,709
No, I'm not.

257
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,709
(cursed fly-buzzing laugh)

258
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:28,876
(laugh)

259
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,876
Sorry. That was a bit

260
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,876
complicated for me to follow!

261
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,709
Could you take a

262
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,709
step forward, please?

263
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:36,834
Uhh.

264
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:40,792
Hm?

265
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:42,375
How does your shoulder feel now?

266
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:43,375
Huh?

267
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,375
Oh! Wow, it's lighter!

268
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:46,459
It's all better!

269
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:49,375
If it still feels off you

270
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:49,375
should go see a doctor.

271
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:50,500
Goodbye.

272
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,000
Ahh!

273
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,209
Oh, uh wait!

274
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:55,751
Hold on!

275
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,626
Mister?

276
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,459
Hey, thank you!

277
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,709
I hope we see you again soon!

278
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,167
Thank you...

279
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,375
[Bakery Girl] Hey!

280
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,751
Did you hear me?

281
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,042
Thanks, and please

282
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,042
come back again soon!

283
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,876
[Nanami] I always thought I

284
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,876
was a person with no concept

285
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,125
of a "reason for living."

286
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,751
Hello, it's Nanami.

287
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,500
I need to talk to you.

288
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,709
Yes, I want to stop by

289
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,709
Jujutsu Tech tomorrow.

290
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:27,876
Why are you laughing?

291
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,792
Idle Transfiguration.

292
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,125
I'm so grateful to you.

293
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,542
Save your gratitude.

294
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:51,542
I've already received more than

295
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:51,542
enough of that from others.

296
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,000
I've no regrets.

297
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,000
(snickers)

298
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,709
(glass breaks)

299
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,334
(surprised gasps)

300
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,542
(short attack roar)

301
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,709
How was he able to get in?

302
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:12,709
That's it.

303
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,626
The more resistant the

304
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,626
inside of the barrier is,

305
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,292
the weaker it is to

306
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,292
attacks from outside.

307
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,667
Domains are barriers meant

308
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,667
for trapping something inside,

309
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:23,918
so they're actually

310
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:23,918
easy to invade,

311
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:27,709
because there's no

312
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:27,709
merit in doing so.

313
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,292
That's even more true with

314
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,292
Domains like Infinite Void

315
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,334
and Self-Embodiment

316
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,334
of Perfection,

317
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,626
which guarantee victory once

318
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,626
they've ensnared their target.

319
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,834
However, inside Itadori,

320
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:45,792
there lies something

321
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:45,792
that must not be touched!

322
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,167
I warned you,

323
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:59,584
there'd be no second time.

324
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:04,584
(shock gasps)

325
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,876
[Nanami] There is

326
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,876
no one in this world

327
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,876
more proud and conceited.

328
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,959
He lives guided by only his

329
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,959
own pleasure and displeasure.

330
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:18,209
Whether you die or you

331
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:18,209
die doesn't matter to me.

332
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:21,834
Aside from him.

333
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,209
I truly don't care.

334
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,042
(pain moan)

335
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,667
"JUJUTSU KAISEN"

336
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,042
"JUJUTSU KAISEN"

337
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,125
(pain moan)

338
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,042
What just happened?

339
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,000
(determined grunt)

340
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,375
(charge yell)

341
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:13,709
I'll kill you!

342
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,125
Domain Expansion really

343
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,125
burns cursed energy.

344
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,584
It truly is a trump

345
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,584
card, a final technique.

346
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:22,792
And that damn Sukuna just...

347
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:25,584
But this is the critical moment!

348
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,292
Squeeze it out!

349
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,125
The last of my cursed energy!

350
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:32,375
(monster roar)

351
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,125
The target's huge.

352
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,834
The flow of cursed

353
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,834
energy is calm.

354
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,083
There are no options.

355
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,626
I know I can land my attack.

356
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:42,125
This is my last chance!

357
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,959
I don't need any more tactics!

358
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:53,918
Divergent Fist!

359
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:05,626
Huh?

360
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:06,626
Huh!

361
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:07,918
What's this lack of feedback?

362
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,751
Bye-bye!

363
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,792
Hold it!

364
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:13,959
This was fun!

365
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,334
Shit.

366
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:23,834
Ino!

367
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:26,125
The core has escaped

368
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:26,125
back into the sewers.

369
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,500
Yeah.

370
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:29,667
Please scour everything

371
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,000
from my current location

372
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,000
to the southeast.

373
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:35,209
Even you could

374
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:35,209
exorcise him right now.

375
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:37,209
We need to go after him and...

376
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,334
Huh?

377
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,042
Itadori!

378
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,876
Come on body, move!

379
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,500
You're going to kill

380
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,500
that thing, aren't you?

381
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:46,250
You said you were gonna

382
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:49,000
-crush him into a pulp!

383
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:49,000
-Itadori!

384
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,125
Itadori!

385
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:58,584
(groan into panting grunt)

386
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,959
(giggling)

387
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,042
So that was the King of

388
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,042
Curses, Ryoumen Sukuna.

389
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,959
He should have less total

390
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,959
cursed energy than Jougo

391
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:22,876
at this point in

392
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:22,876
time, and yet...

393
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,709
That presence!

394
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:27,876
His soul's on a different level.

395
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,709
I'm certain of it.

396
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,500
Even if we're all wiped out,

397
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,083
as long as Sukuna

398
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,083
is resurrected,

399
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,000
the age of curses will come.

400
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,083
But damn, this still sucks.

401
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:42,667
Right now, I want nothing more

402
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:42,667
than to kill Yuuji Itadori!

403
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,584
Arrgghh, it's so frustrating!

404
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,918
But whatever, because,

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,542
unlike his body I can

406
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,542
keep killing his soul

407
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,000
over and over again.

408
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:03,292
So next time what would

409
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:03,292
be a fun way to kill it?

410
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:07,083
(malicious giggle)

411
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,417
[Nanami] You were told

412
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,417
to rest, weren't you?

413
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,751
[Itadori] Is this my lecture?

414
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,918
I have no lecture

415
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,918
at all to give you.

416
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,334
You're the one

417
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,334
who saved my life.

418
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:18,751
I saved you?

419
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,751
That patchwork's

420
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,751
cursed technique

421
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,918
is interfering with the soul.

422
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,792
Because you invaded

423
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,792
his Expansion Domain,

424
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,167
he wound up inadvertently

425
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,167
touching Sukuna's soul.

426
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,000
I was saved because of that.

427
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,083
But, I never swapped

428
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,083
out with Sukuna.

429
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,584
[Nanami] Sukuna never came out.

430
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,042
Our opponent went in.

431
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:44,334
Then it wasn't me who saved you.

432
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,083
It was just Sukuna's whim.

433
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:50,292
Nanami, I killed a person today.

434
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:52,792
People die.

435
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:54,125
There's no stopping that.

436
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,083
So I wanted them to at

437
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,083
least have proper deaths.

438
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,334
That's what I thought.

439
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:00,959
So I was always thinking about

440
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,375
how I could keep that

441
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,375
trigger from being pulled.

442
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:06,834
But, after pulling

443
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:06,834
that trigger myself,

444
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,626
I don't understand anymore!

445
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,459
What is a proper death?

446
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:11,125
I don't know what

447
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:11,125
that is, either.

448
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,459
Even if all good people

449
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,459
properly died in peace,

450
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,834
and all evil people

451
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,834
were punished in death,

452
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,292
the problem would be that

453
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,292
most people in this world

454
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,459
are neither all

455
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,459
good nor all evil.

456
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,209
Death is the final

457
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,209
destination for all of us,

458
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:27,000
but no one dies the same death.

459
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,834
Guiding all of them

460
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,834
to their proper end

461
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:30,375
would be quite arduous.

462
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,125
I personally wouldn't

463
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,125
recommend it.

464
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:34,209
I know you won't listen.

465
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:36,751
You'll still try won't you?

466
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,667
I hope you don't get

467
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,667
killed in the process.

468
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:43,834
And, just as I would've died

469
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:43,834
today if you hadn't been there,

470
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:46,626
you'll see that there are plenty

471
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:46,626
of other people yet to come

472
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,417
who are going to need you too.

473
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,167
Just remember, Itadori,

474
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,167
you're a jujutsu sorcerer now.

475
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:57,042
(overwhelmed breath)

476
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,876
The survey is

477
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,876
completely anonymous

478
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,417
so please don't

479
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,417
write your names.

480
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,292
When you're done put

481
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,292
them in this box.

482
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,209
"Survey on Bullying"

483
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:08,167
(mellow instrumental music)

484
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,876
It was you wasn't it, Itou?

485
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,209
You gave Yoshino

486
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,209
the scars, right?

487
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:30,751
(sneering)

488
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,459
That's rich, coming from

489
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,459
the so-called teacher

490
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,125
who was too scared to do

491
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,125
anything about it at the time.

492
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:38,918
Anyway he quit school and

493
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:38,918
moved away, didn't he?

494
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,083
So who cares?

495
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,709
'N what about me?

496
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,459
I've barely been able to move

497
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,459
my left arm since that day!

498
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,125
All we're concerned with

499
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,125
here and now are your crimes.

500
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,751
Use your own time to reflect

501
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,751
on the punishment you

502
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,751
brought on yourself.

503
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,709
And where's your punishment?

504
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,459
Mine is yet to come.

505
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,667
First I have to look at the

506
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,667
things to which I was blind.

507
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,918
Both you, and I,

508
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,459
will have to live with the

509
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,459
crime of killing Yoshino's heart

510
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:07,459
for the rest of our lives.

511
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:10,292
I'll be watching you, Itou.

512
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:16,125
♪ But I'll survive ♪

513
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:19,584
I don't really understand

514
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:19,584
what a proper death is.

515
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:20,667
So for now,

516
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,042
until I do understand,

517
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,667
until I kill him,

518
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,417
I will not

519
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:44,709
lose again.

520
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:52,876

00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,417
good meatballs.

528
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,417
So who made 'em?

529
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,417
Oh, I did.

530
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,083
They're easy to make.

"Put all the ingredients in.

532
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:41,459
Use twice as much ginger."

"Mix together well

534
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:44,918

"Shape with spoons and

536
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,500
toss into the pot."

543
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,292
[Nobara] So you like to

544
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,292
cook for yourself, huh?

545
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,334
Not too surprising, actually.

546
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:05,042
Well, Itadori taught

547
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:05,042
me how to make 'em.

548
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,584
(Panda chewing)

549
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,792
That's sad.

550
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,292
Itadori's legacy is a meatball.

551
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,000
[Maki] I don't

552
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,000
think that's right.

553
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,500
(sneezing)

554
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:27,459
These are some really

555
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:27,459
good meatballs.

556
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:30,417
Yeah, and guess what,

557
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:30,417
they're super easy to make.

558
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,334
Even Fushiguro can do it.

559
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:34,459
I taught him how.

560
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,250
I can't wait to see

561
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,250
those two again.
