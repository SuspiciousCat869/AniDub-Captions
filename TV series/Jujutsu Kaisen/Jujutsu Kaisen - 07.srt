1
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,834
We have some time

2
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,834
before your appointment

3
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:07,834
with the principal.

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:09,459
Do you want to stop anywhere?

5
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,083
No thanks, I'll surprise him

6
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:13,000
and show up early for a change.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,209
Stop here.

8
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:19,209
[Kiyotaka] Huh?

9
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:20,334
Right here?

10
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:21,459
[Satoru] You go on ahead.

11
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:22,667
(grunts in surprise)

12
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:23,918
[Kiyotaka] Is this

13
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:23,918
a test or something?

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
You're going to hit

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
me if I drive away

16
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:26,876
without you, aren't you?

17
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,876
[Satoru] Just what type

18
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,876
of guy do you think I am?

19
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,459
(sighs in relief)

20
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,959
-[Kiyotaka] Okay then.

21
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,959
-(tires screeching)

22
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:40,792
All right.

23
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,292
(shrieks)

24
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,125
(ground breaking)

25
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:49,834
I see.

26
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:51,125
Who are you, then?

27
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,584
(yells battle cry)

28
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:01,959
(fire roaring)

29
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:16,667
(chuckles)

30
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:17,959
That was a whole lot easier

31
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:21,167
than I expected it was gonna be.

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:21,959
Huh?

33
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:29,167
[Satoru] So then.

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,667
Just who are you calling "easy"?

35
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:33,834
(groans)

36
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:35,792
What a pain in the ass.

37
00:01:36,876 --> 00:01:39,667
He's a cursed spirit, but

38
00:01:36,876 --> 00:01:39,667
he can communicate clearly.

39
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,751
And the sheer amount of cursed

40
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,751
energy he just unleashed.

41
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,792
An unregistered special-grade?

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,375
He's likely even stronger

43
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,375
than Sukuna currently is.

44
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,209
Special-grades are

45
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,209
classified as such

46
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,876
because they're special.

47
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,834
Having them pop

48
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,834
up this frequently

49
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,042
throws everything off.

50
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,209
(laughs mockingly)

51
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,792
Aw, don't tell me I

52
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,792
wounded your pride?

53
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,125
No.

54
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,125
(knuckles cracking)

55
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,209
I'm starting to enjoy this.

56
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:11,626
(chuckles)

57
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,209
(Opening Theme Music)

58
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,834
(singing in Japanese)

59
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:45,751
[Jougo] So you think

60
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:45,751
this will be fun, do you?

61
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,876
No sense of danger?

62
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,918
None at all?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,918
Did he choose to attack here

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,918
in order to avoid people?

65
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:55,042
No.

66
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,167
He was just making

67
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,167
sure no other sorcerers

68
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,709
could come to back me up.

69
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:00,918
Ember Insects!

70
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, if you're aiming

71
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,000
this attack at me,

72
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,292
then you're right.

73
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,209
I'm not feeling any danger.

74
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:12,167
(ground breaking)

75
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,876
Well!

76
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,584
What if this hits me?

77
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,626
(insect chattering)

78
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,167
Sound?

79
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:25,834
(insects exploding)

80
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,459
A two-stage attack of

81
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,459
sound and explosions?

82
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,209
That's not bad.

83
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:35,167
(yells battle cry)

84
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,626
(fire roaring)

85
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,209
And there's more!

86
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,334
(ground breaking)

87
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,042
(fire exploding)

88
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,918
That's all it took?

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,375
Obviously, I overestimated him.

90
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,292
That human was just as fragile

91
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,292
as the rest of them are.

92
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,792
He wasn't living

93
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,792
any life of truth.

94
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:01,626
It's all so

95
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:01,626
nauseatingly repulsive!

96
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,209
I am going to go and

97
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,209
spread real strength.

98
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:07,459
The truth as only

99
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:07,459
death can reveal it!

100
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,792
(Satoru sighs) We just

101
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,792
went over this a minute ago.

102
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,042
Are you a slow learner?

103
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,876
(coughs) This smoke

104
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,876
is so irritating.

105
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,083
What's going on here?

106
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,042
(hums)

107
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,125
In simple terms, you missed me.

108
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:25,459
Impossible, I felt

109
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:25,459
the contact just now!

110
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:28,209
I touched you, and not

111
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:28,209
only that, I killed you!

112
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,209
No, what you actually touched

113
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:33,083
was the "Infinity" existing

114
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:33,083
between you and me.

115
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,292
Here, I'll show you.

116
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,417
Put your hand out.

117
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:39,751
(grumbles)

118
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:40,918
Oh, come on!

119
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,167
Come on, come on!

120
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,459
I don't sense

121
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,459
hostility or trickery.

122
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,626
Guess I'll see what it's about.

123
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,709
(gasps)

124
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:57,876
See?

125
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,125
I can't touch him!

126
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,250
I get stopped just short of him!

127
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:06,083
Is this Infinity?

128
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,167
Not exactly stopped,

129
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,125
but the closer you

130
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,125
get, the slower you go.

131
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,584
(groans)

132
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,334
So, what now?

133
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,292
We could just hold

134
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,292
hands if you like.

135
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:20,125
I refuse!

136
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,667
Oh, don't be shy now.

137
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:25,209
You're making me feel

138
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:25,209
self-conscious, too!

139
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:26,292
(growls)

140
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,083
You bastard!

141
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,626
-(punch landing)

142
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,626
-(groans in pain)

143
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:32,667
(coughs wetly)

144
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:33,876
So fast!

145
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't get it,

146
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,000
it's not just a blow

147
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,125
that's strengthened

148
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,125
with cursed energy!

149
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:39,334
So, what is it?

150
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:40,250
I must know!

151
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,709
There's still more!

152
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:45,167
-(punches landing)

153
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:45,167
-(grunting in pain)

154
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,292
(screams)

155
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,334
Infinity exists everywhere.

156
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:55,667
I just use my jujutsu to

157
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:55,667
bring it forward into

158
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:55,667
reality.

159
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,167
Convergence, divergence.

160
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,918
What do you think happens

161
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,918
when one touches this void?

162
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,334
Cursed Technique Reversal.

163
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:06,375
Red.

164
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:11,459
(grunts)

165
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:14,334
(ground breaking)

166
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:19,375
-(grunting)

167
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:19,375
-(trees snapping)

168
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,167
-(yells)

169
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,167
-(punch landing)

170
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,876
-(body thudding)

171
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,876
-(grunting in pain)

172
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,751
(grunting in pain)

173
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,209
(yells battle cry)

174
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,792
-(kick landing)

175
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,792
-(screams)

176
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:51,792
(body slamming)

177
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:53,375
Well, that's that.

178
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,334
(rain falling)

179
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,000
[Sugeru] You can try,

180
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,167
but you'll die.

181
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,250
Jougo.

182
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,417
(water splashing)

183
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,250
I guess it wasn't just talk.

184
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,751
(chuckles)

185
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:15,334
No matter.

186
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:18,167
If I can't hit him, I'll

187
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:18,167
just drag him into my Domain.

188
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,626
Wait.

189
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,834
Where'd he go?

190
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,500
Sorry about that.

191
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,042
-Huh?

192
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,042
-Hey, what's going on here?

193
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,292
Where in the hell are we?

194
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,292
How did I get here?

195
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,500
-Sorry.

196
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,500
-I don't get it!

197
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:31,167
What is this place, hey!

198
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,375
What the hell?

199
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,834
Sukuna's vessel?

200
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,500
To observe, I've

201
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,500
brought Yuuji Itadori.

202
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,626
Mount Fuji!

203
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,000
His head's Mount Fuji!

204
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,042
(footsteps tapping)

205
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,000
I aim to protect you!

206
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,209
I'll never leave you!

207
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:54,167
-(snoring)

208
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:54,167
-[Frodo] Sam.

209
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,584
(Sam sobbing)

210
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,167
Wow.

211
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,209
He learns surprisingly quickly.

212
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,125
-[Frodo] Come on, Sam.

213
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,125
-[Satoru] Yuuji!

214
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,334
(yelps)

215
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,876
Oh hey, so what's up, Gojou?

216
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,667
Talking to him doesn't

217
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,667
cause a problem, either.

218
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,959
You need something?

219
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,918
[Satoru] So we can

220
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,918
increase his output quickly

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,042
and move on to the

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,042
next stage soon.

223
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,083
We're heading out, let's go.

224
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,292
Huh?

225
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,542
[Satoru] It's a

226
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,542
field trip lesson.

227
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,876
I'm going to teach you

228
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,876
about the very pinnacle

229
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,292
of jujutsu battles.

230
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,792
Domain Expansion.

231
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,125
(water splashing)

232
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,459
What the hell's this?

233
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:35,042
How come I'm not sinking?

234
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:40,334
Gojou, I was at the school

235
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:40,334
just 10 seconds ago, right?

236
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,459
What's going on, here?

237
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, I warped us.

238
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,375
He's not gonna explain it.

239
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,959
Sukuna's vessel!

240
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,083
So he really is alive.

241
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,709
[Suguru] The first thing,

242
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:53,125
you must somehow render Satoru

243
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:53,125
Gojou incapable of fighting.

244
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:57,250
The second is to get Ryoumen

245
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:57,250
Sukuna and Yuuji Itadori

246
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:59,042
on your side.

247
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,834
I can't kill Itadori

248
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,834
because of our future plans.

249
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:05,584
Has Gojou figured

250
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:05,584
out what we're up to?

251
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,292
What'd you bring the

252
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,292
kid for, a shield?

253
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,459
A shield?

254
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,250
No, no, I already

255
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,250
explained this.

256
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,250
He's just here to watch.

257
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:16,292
You see, I'm in the midst of

258
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:16,292
teaching him a lot of things.

259
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,167
So forget about him

260
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,167
and let's just fight.

261
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,751
Having him tag along with you

262
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,751
isn't gonna slow you down?

263
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,417
It makes you look like an idiot.

264
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,751
Oh, no, it'll all be fine.

265
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,209
I mean, really.

266
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,292
You're kind of weak.

267
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,751
(chuckles)

268
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:35,167
(growls)

269
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,626
(fire roaring)

270
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,167
How dare you insult me like

271
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,167
that, you insolent ass?

272
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,959
I'm going to enjoy tearing

273
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,959
up that smug face of yours!

274
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,667
(fire exploding)

275
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:47,375
(water crashing)

276
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,334
This guy

277
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,209
is weak?

278
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:56,876
He's way more powerful

279
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:56,876
than any of the monsters

280
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,459
I've encountered so far!

281
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,459
(shudders)

282
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:04,626
(grunts)

283
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,375
You'll be fine.

284
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,042
Just stay here close to me.

285
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,417
(grunts)

286
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,792
Domain Expansion!

287
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:20,834
(gasps)

288
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:26,459
(ground breaking)

289
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,167
(gasps)

290
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,542
(lava bubbling)

291
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:40,459
(chuckles)

292
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:41,459
What is this?

293
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:42,375
Damn!

294
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:46,459
Coffin of the Iron Mountain!

295
00:11:57,626 --> 00:12:00,125
(lava bubbling)

296
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:03,292
(lava exploding)

297
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,417
What is this?

298
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,250
Damn!

299
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:08,042
[Satoru] This is

300
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:08,042
Domain Expansion.

301
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,375
(chuckles evilly)

302
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,042
The Innate Domain is made

303
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,500
-with cursed energy.

304
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,500
-(yelps)

305
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,542
Then, you imbue it with

306
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,542
a cursed technique.

307
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:16,626
(blows air rapidly)

308
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:19,209
What you three encountered at

309
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:19,209
that juvenile detention center

310
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,417
was an incomplete

311
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,417
Domain that hadn't been

312
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,417
imbued with any

313
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,417
cursed techniques.

314
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
If that had been

315
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
a proper Domain,

316
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:27,626
all of you first-years

317
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:27,626
would have died.

318
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,584
I think Megumi understood that.

319
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,626
Spreading out an

320
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,626
Innate Domain that way

321
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,876
always consumes a ton of energy.

322
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,876
But the advantages

323
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,876
make it worth it.

324
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,751
One of them is

325
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,751
the boost to stats

326
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,667
due to environmental factors.

327
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,083
Ah!

328
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,125
You mean like buffs

329
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,125
in video games!

330
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,834
Another one is...

331
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,375
(rock exploding)

332
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:50,500
What?

333
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,417
Most sorcerers would

334
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,417
have been burned to ash

335
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,042
the moment they

336
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,042
entered my Domain!

337
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,334
The techniques

338
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,334
imbued in the Domain

339
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:00,334
are always sure to hit

340
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:00,334
within that Domain.

341
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,918
That is guaranteed.

342
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,125
Guaranteed?

343
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:05,083
That's correct!

344
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,500
But don't worry.

345
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,459
There are several

346
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,459
ways to deal with it.

347
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,584
You can take the hit

348
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,584
using a cursed technique,

349
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,375
like just now, or, and I

350
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,375
don't

351
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,375
really recommend this one,

352
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,375
but you can try to go

353
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,375
outside the Domain.

354
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,167
That's usually impossible.

355
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,375
Now, you can also-

356
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,500
[Jougo] If I neutralize

357
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,500
that Infinity of yours

358
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:28,584
with a dense Domain, then my

359
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:28,584
techniques will reach you.

360
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,250
Yeah, they'll hit.

361
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:31,584
Infinity?

362
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,667
You have to give me

363
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,667
the Prison Realm!

364
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,542
To add to my collection!

365
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:39,834
I came here half in jest,

366
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,876
thinking I wouldn't really

367
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,876
care if I couldn't kill

368
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,876
him.

369
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,417
But now, having this

370
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,417
difference between us

371
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,292
thrust in my face, having

372
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,292
him insult my pride

373
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:53,626
as a cursed spirit,

374
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:53,626
ridiculing the new humanity,

375
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,167
this is completely unacceptable!

376
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:00,167
The most effective way

377
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:00,167
to deal with a Domain

378
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,375
is to lay out your own Domain.

379
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:06,584
When two Domains are laid

380
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:06,584
out at the same time,

381
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,500
the more refined one

382
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,500
will dominate that space.

383
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:14,375
Though compatibility and the

384
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:14,375
amount of energy can factor

385
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:14,375
in.

386
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,959
(foot stomping)

387
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:18,500
There won't even be ashes

388
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:18,500
left of you, Satoru Gojou!

389
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:23,542
(ground breaking)

390
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:26,334
(Jougo grunts)

391
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,667
Domain Expansion.

392
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:32,709
Infinite Void.

393
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,584
(crickets chirping)

394
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,667
(water splashing)

395
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,834
[Jougo] What just happened?

396
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,959
Can it be that my

397
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,959
Domain was overwhelmed?

398
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,459
I can't see anything.

399
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,375
I can't feel anything!

400
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:10,667
No!

401
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,542
I can see everything!

402
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,834
I can feel everything!

403
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:18,417
But the information

404
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:18,417
is never complete,

405
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,667
so I can't do anything!

406
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:25,709
This is the inner

407
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:25,709
world of Limitless.

408
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,417
Perception, contact.

409
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,459
Every act in life is

410
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,459
repeated

411
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,459
infinitely, over and over.

412
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:35,667
(grunts in shock)

413
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,584
Ironic, isn't it?

414
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:41,292
When granted every possible

415
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:41,292
thing, you can't use it.

416
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,959
All you can do is

417
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,959
die peacefully.

418
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,667
But I have some things

419
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,667
I still want to ask you,

420
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:49,667
so for right now, I'm going

421
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:49,667
to let you off the hook

422
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,584
with just this.

423
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:55,209
(flesh stretching)

424
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:59,167
-(flesh ripping)

425
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:59,167
-(blood splattering)

426
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,250
(glass shattering)

427
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:04,083
(head clattering)

428
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:07,417
-(foot stomping)

429
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:07,417
-Now, then.

430
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,876
Just who instructed

431
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,876
you to come after me?

432
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,709
He really is the strongest

433
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,709
jujutsu sorcerer!

434
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,292
As a living organism,

435
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,709
he's on another level!

436
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,459
[Sugeru] Oh dear.

437
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,292
What now?

438
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,083
Will you rescue him?

439
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:30,209
I can't let any of the people

440
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:30,209
from the school see my face,

441
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,417
so I'll be leaving here now.

442
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,042
I trust you to finish this.

443
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,709
If you want to save him,

444
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,709
then go ahead and save him.

445
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:43,167
Though I don't know, do your

446
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:43,167
kind have sentimental emotions?

447
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,250
(distorted backwards speech)

448
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:50,584
(footsteps tapping)

449
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,751
That's quite a statement

450
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,751
for a cursed spirit to make.

451
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,626
You don't seem like the

452
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,626
type to follow orders.

453
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,918
Was something good supposed

454
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,918
to happen if you killed me?

455
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,709
Regardless, you're going

456
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,709
to have to tell me.

457
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,334
Who sent you?

458
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:06,709
I want a name.

459
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:09,709
Come on, just tell me already.

460
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:10,959
(grunts in pain)

461
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:13,792
Like I'd ever tell

462
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:13,792
you, you little punk!

463
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:15,626
What a bad attitude.

464
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,375
And you're so compromised!

465
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,500
(grunts in pain)

466
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:19,792
Damn you!

467
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:23,209
If you don't tell me,

468
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:23,209
I'll exorcise you.

469
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,709
Though I will anyway.

470
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,167
So weird!

471
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,000
Curses are capable

472
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,000
of conversations?

473
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,709
Here, it almost seems normal.

474
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,792
(ground slamming)

475
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,584
-(grunts in shock)

476
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,584
-(gasps)

477
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:37,542
(flowers rustling)

478
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,250
Aww!

479
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:40,751
-So pretty!

480
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:40,751
-Flowers!

481
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:41,751
(grunts in confusion)

482
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:42,959
(laughs joyously)

483
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:43,959
-(grunts)

484
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:43,959
-(hand slapping)

485
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:45,375
It's just a curse!

486
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,876
And it's stripping

487
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,876
away my will to fight!

488
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,125
(screams)

489
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,167
Leave me, Gojou!

490
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,834
Go after them, I'll be fine!

491
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:59,751
(screams)

492
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:01,000
Wait, forget that, I lied!

493
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:01,876
I need help!

494
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,751
(blade slicing)

495
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,500
-(fire roaring)

496
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,500
-(grunts in pain)

497
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:08,959
(hums in admiration)

498
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,667
He got away.

499
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:12,792
He's good at hiding

500
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:12,792
his presence.

501
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,792
He's way more impressive

502
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,792
than Volcano Head.

503
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,792
(flowers rustling)

504
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm sorry about that.

505
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,417
So now cursed

506
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,417
spirits of that level

507
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,667
-are joining forces?

508
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,667
-But then you're the one

509
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:27,500
-who brought me here.

510
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:27,500
-It's getting interesting!

511
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:28,751
Yuuji!

512
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:31,000
I want you, as well as

513
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:31,000
all of your classmates,

514
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,792
to become strong enough

515
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,792
that you can beat that.

516
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:35,834
Me, beat that?

517
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:37,542
It's better to have

518
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:37,542
a concrete goal,

519
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:38,876
wouldn't you say?

520
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,626
Man, I'm glad I

521
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,626
brought you today!

522
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,083
Is he serious?

523
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,792
I've had no idea what was

524
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,792
going on this whole time!

525
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,542
Now that we've set you a goal,

526
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,209
all that's left is to

527
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,209
pursue

528
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,209
it and then attain it.

529
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,042
Let's speed up your schedule.

530
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,751
For the next month, you'll

531
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,751
still be watching movies,

532
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,709
but you'll also be

533
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,709
fighting against me.

534
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,584
Fighting with you?

535
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,000
(groans dejectedly)

536
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,500
Will I still even be alive

537
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,500
after a month of that?

538
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:04,209
Then it's combat training.

539
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:07,042
You'll be sent out on

540
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:07,042
more difficult missions.

541
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,250
The basics and

542
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,250
how to apply them.

543
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:11,834
And then finally, you can

544
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:11,834
show off all these new skills

545
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,375
at the Exchange Event!

546
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:14,542
Wait, teacher!

547
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,542
Yes?

548
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:16,542
And what's your question?

549
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:19,250
The Exchange Event is what?

550
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:20,959
(grunts questioningly)

551
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:22,500
[Satoru] I didn't tell you?

552
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,292
(growls)

553
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,751
(stammers)

554
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,292
(growls)

555
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,792
(stammers)

556
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,083
He's late!

557
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,125
(yelps)

558
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,959
(footsteps tapping)

559
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:47,834
(door creaking)

560
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,334
(door closing)

561
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,918
(door creaking)

562
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,751
(water splashing)

563
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:03,751
[Suguru] Sure is peaceful here.

564
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,876
How's Jougo doing, Getou?

565
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:10,918
Death's door.

566
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,751
Hanami wants to

567
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,751
save him, though,

568
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,918
so he'll probably be fine.

569
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
How irresponsible.

570
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,792
And you're the one

571
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,792
who egged him on.

572
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,167
Heavens, no.

573
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,500
I tried to stop him.

574
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:25,918
(door creaking)

575
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:28,417
[Mahito] Speak of the devil.

576
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,709
Jougo, Hanami!

577
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:32,918
Glad to see you're okay.

578
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,334
How the hell can you

579
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,334
look at me like this

580
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,000
and say I'm okay?

581
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:40,042
You're lucky that

582
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:40,042
you got off so easy.

583
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,375
(growls)

584
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:42,292
(hums mockingly)

585
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,667
Why, you...

586
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:46,250
[Suguru] Maybe now at

587
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:46,250
least you understand.

588
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:48,459
So we'll go about

589
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:48,459
sealing Satoru Gojou

590
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:51,334
at the appropriate time,

591
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:51,334
in the appropriate place,

592
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,626
once we've secured our

593
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,626
advantage over him.

594
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:58,000
D-Day is October

595
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:58,000
31st in Shibuya.

596
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,918
Later, I'll have more details.

597
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,959
Good, Mahito?

598
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,459
No objections.

599
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,834
Let's be cunning,

600
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:11,667
as curses should.

601
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:12,959
And humans should.

602
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,292
(chuckles)

603
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:21,334
(Closing Theme Music)

604
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,542
(singing in Japanese)

605
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:47,667
(playful music)

606
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:48,918
[Both] One!

607
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Two and!

608
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,250
Three and!

609
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,125
-Four and!

610
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,125
-What the hell are you doing?

611
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,125
We're warming up.

612
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:55,792
[Both] Six and!

613
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,500
I think I'm warmed up enough.

614
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,667
Me, too.

615
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:00,834
(hums questioningly)

616
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,500
What exactly are

617
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,500
you warming up for?

618
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:04,375
-(whistle blowing)

619
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:04,375
-(grunts)

620
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:05,500
(screams)

621
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,042
(lively music)

622
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,500
(panting)

623
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:14,542
Getou, cross!

624
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:15,417
(screams)

625
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,542
Thanks!

626
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,375
-Shoot!

627
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,375
-(screams)

628
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:21,918
(grunts in pain)

629
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,709
Mahito, here!

630
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,959
(screams)

631
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,167
Overhead

632
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,125
bicycle kick!

633
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,834
(screams)

634
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,334
(whistle blowing)

635
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:46,083
I'm gonna kill these

636
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:46,083
two for this later!

637
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,709
(intense music)
