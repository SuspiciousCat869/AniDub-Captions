1
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:03,042
Good morning.

2
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:09,792
(groaning)

3
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,834
(atmospheric music)

4
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,375
So which one of the

5
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,375
two are you right now?

6
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,375
Hey wait. Aren't you...

7
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:29,375
Satoru Gojou.

8
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm head of the first-years

9
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:32,000
at Jujutsu Tech.

10
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,626
Jujutsu?

11
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,125
Fushiguro!

12
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:37,125
Where is he-

13
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,209
-(ropes tensing)

14
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,209
-Huh?

15
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,375
(distressing music)

16
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,709
What the hell is this?

17
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,125
I wouldn't be worrying

18
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,125
about others right now...

19
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:49,292
Yuuji Itadori.

20
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,083
(gasps)

21
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,459
You see, it's been decided

22
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:55,459
that you're to be

23
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:55,459
secretly executed.

24
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:58,292
(Opening Theme Music)

25
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:17,626
(singing in Japanese)

26
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,125
(phone ringing)

27
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:30,250
[Nurse] Sugisawa Hospital.

28
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:31,083
This is Yuuji Itadori.

29
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,751
I just called earlier.

30
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:34,918
Yes.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,042
Yes.

32
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,709
I'm sorry to keep

33
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,709
calling, but...

34
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,375
how's my grandpa doing?

35
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,500
[Nurse] Huh? I thought

36
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,500
they already told you.

37
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:43,500
Oh, never mind.

38
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,000
Just hold on a minute.

39
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll go find out myself.

40
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,334
(soft guitar music)

41
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,375
Mister Itadori never

42
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,375
uses his call button.

43
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,250
It's kinda scary

44
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,250
that he doesn't.

45
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:55,375
[Nurse] Mister Itadori,

46
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:55,375
you have a call.

47
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:56,375
It's your grandson again,

48
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,125
asking if you want

49
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,125
him to bring you any-

50
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,125
Leave me alone!!

51
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,751
Tell him not to come here!

52
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,375
-(gasps)

53
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,375
-He should go to his club!

54
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:04,375
Go to his club!

55
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:06,250
[Nurse] I, uh...

56
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:09,375
I guess you probably heard that.

57
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,292
So what type club

58
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,292
are you in, Yuuji?

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,792
Yeah. I heard.

60
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:15,834
Thanks a lot.

61
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,209
(footsteps)

62
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,751
(dog barking)

63
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,959
(sirens)

64
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,167
They're keeping a

65
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,167
cursed object here,

66
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,792
in a place like this?

67
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,375
Could they be any more stupid?

68
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,626
(hutch door creaking)

69
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:42,626
Huh?

70
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,792
(groans)

71
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,417
There's nothing here.

72
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,417
[Satoru Gojou] Huh?

73
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,292
The Stevenson hutch is empty.

74
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,417
[Satoru] For real?

75
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,417
That's hilarious!

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,959
Maybe it took a

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,959
nighttime stroll.

78
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,167
I'm going to punch you.

79
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,250
[Satoru] Well, no going home

80
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,250
until it's recovered, okay?

81
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,250
(call disconnects)

82
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,834
I'm seriously

83
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,834
going to punch him.

84
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,626
(chattering)

85
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,209
Ready to go? What do you say?

86
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:14,459
Sasaki?

87
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:15,459
(grunts)

88
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:16,459
Iguchi?

89
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:17,459
(grunts)

90
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,459
Okay...

91
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:20,626
go!

92
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,876
Spirit gods, spirit gods,

93
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,918
which creature is the council

94
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,918
president barely weaker than?

95
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,334
(gasps)

96
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,334
[All Three] Ku..

97
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,334
ri...

98
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,542
o...

99
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,542
ne.

100
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:33,209
-A sea angel's tougher?

101
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:33,209
-(laughing)

102
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,667
Occult club!

103
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,667
Hey!

104
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:37,375
Plankton president. What's up?

105
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:38,500
(slams)

106
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,042
As you were previously informed,

107
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,667
a research club with

108
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,667
no real activities

109
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:43,292
must forfeit its club room.

110
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,000
So vacate now!

111
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,667
You really ought

112
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,667
to be more careful

113
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,918
not to underestimate

114
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,918
our members, President.

115
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,876
(slams)

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,083
And what is that?

117
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,918
You know about the

118
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,918
school's rugby field

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,375
being closed off, don't you?

120
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:58,375
[School President] Yes.

121
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,250
Some of the students

122
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,250
who got sick

123
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,709
actually had to be hospitalized.

124
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,334
And so you don't

125
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,334
find that alarming?

126
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:06,667
We're talking about some

127
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:06,667
tough rugby players here!

128
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:07,709
The players said that,

129
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:08,417
just before they

130
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:08,417
started feeling sick...

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,417
(bong)

132
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,417
(gasps)

133
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,709
they heard mysterious

134
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,709
sounds and voices

135
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:13,876
coming from the field!

136
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,500
And then we found this newspaper

137
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,500
article from 30 years ago.

138
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,542
It talks about the disappearance

139
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:19,959
of a certain Mister Yoshida,

140
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:21,667
who worked for the

141
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:21,667
construction company.

142
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,250
It says he was last sighted here

143
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,250
at Sugisawa Third High School

144
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,250
during its construction.

145
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:26,250
(groans)

146
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,876
Yoshida was struggling

147
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,876
to make ends meet,

148
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,751
so he turned to loan sharks,

149
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,250
and those organizations

150
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,250
were after him!

151
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,751
Which means the whole mysterious

152
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,751
disaster at the rugby field

153
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,751
was caused by the vengeful

154
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,751
spirit of Yoshida,

155
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,292
whose body is buried there!

156
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,459
No, actually it was just ticks.

157
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:44,584
(light percussive music)

158
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,751
Hard ticks, to be exact.

159
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,751
Large blood-sucking bugs.

160
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,959
If one bites you and

161
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,959
infects you with SFTS,

162
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,542
it can be fatal, so

163
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,542
you have to be careful.

164
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:54,167
So what if it was ticks?

165
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,417
The occult club is trying

166
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,417
to uncover occult activity

167
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,292
so it's still a valid

168
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,292
activity report!

169
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,542
This is not some

170
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,542
kind of kids' game!

171
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,542
Besides the biggest problem

172
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,542
is you, Yuuji Itadori!

173
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:06,125
You're registered with track

174
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:06,125
and field, not the occult

175
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:06,125
club!

176
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,375
So this club doesn't even

177
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,375
have the three members

178
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,167
required to be a club!

179
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,209
Uh...

180
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:11,542
You did that?

181
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:12,542
But I...

182
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:14,918
I'm sure I wrote "occult club"!

183
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,792
I'm the one who changed it.

184
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,125
Coach Takagi? What for?

185
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:22,167
Because! The track and

186
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:22,167
field team needs you on it!

187
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,792
[School President] So

188
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,792
says the only teacher

189
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,626
more problematic

190
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,626
than the students.

191
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,792
How many times do

192
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,792
I have to tell you

193
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:29,125
I'm not joining the team?

194
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:30,959
-You are.

195
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:30,959
-No I'm not!

196
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,500
However I'm not some demon.

197
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,417
So if you can defeat me I'll

198
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,417
excuse you from the team.

199
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,959
And we'll settle this fair

200
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,959
and square by competing!

201
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,000
That'll work! You've got a deal!

202
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,042
-Yay!

203
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,042
-Yay!

204
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,417
[School President] How

205
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,417
fair and square is it

206
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,417
to re-write a student's

207
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,417
club application?

208
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,626
(birds whistling)

209
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,417
[Fushiguro] What's

210
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,417
with this rugby field?

211
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
(gurgling)

212
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,000
Is there a dead body

213
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,000
buried here or something?

214
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,626
Even if there is, I'm

215
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,626
surprised

216
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,626
to see a cursed spirit

217
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,000
this high-level here.

218
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,000
That looks like a

219
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,000
grade-two curse.

220
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,042
Must be the influence

221
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,042
of that cursed object.

222
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,834
(growling)

223
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,000
Damn. Its presence is

224
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,000
too strong to pin down.

225
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,459
It feels like it's close by,

226
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:17,500
but it could

227
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:17,500
actually be far away.

228
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,584
This special-grade cursed

229
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,584
object's a serious pain.

230
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,584
Who could have moved

231
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,584
it? And where is it now?

232
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:29,459
[Male Student] Hey, come

233
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:29,459
here, check this out!

234
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:33,042
Coach Takagi is taking on

235
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:33,042
Itadori from West Middle!

236
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,500
[Male Student] Wow, what

237
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,500
are they competing for?

238
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,375
[Takagi] Yeah!

239
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,042
(grunt)

240
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:39,834
14 meters!

241
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,667
-(victorious music)

242
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,667
-(grunting)

243
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,709
(applause and cheering)

244
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,209
[Man] Wow, Takagi's

245
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,209
still got it!

246
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,959
Wow, is he famous or something?

247
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,709
It's just a rumor, but

248
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,709
I heard that he beat

249
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,334
all the stages of

250
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,334
"Ninja Warrior"

251
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,667
and that he's the

252
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,667
reincarnation of Mirko Cro

253
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,667
Cop.

254
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:56,542
[Sasaki] But Mirko's

255
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:56,542
not even dead yet.

256
00:07:56,626 --> 00:08:00,042
He earned the nickname

257
00:07:56,626 --> 00:08:00,042
"Tiger of West Middle."

258
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,042
That's lame.

259
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,209
Hey, so can I throw

260
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,209
it however I want?

261
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:04,334
Mm-hm!

262
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,500
For this challenge you can

263
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,500
throw however you want.

264
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:09,876
After all, I know this event

265
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:09,876
isn't your strong suit.

266
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,417
You've probably never

267
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,417
even really been...

268
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,459
(crash)

269
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,876
Uh...

270
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,334
about 30 meters, I guess.

271
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,334
(crowd gasps)

272
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,751
Yes! I crushed it!

273
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,083
Kinda more gorilla than tiger.

274
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,375
He threw that like a pitcher!

275
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,542
You'd do really well on

276
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,542
a sports team, Itadori.

277
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:29,918
(crowd chattering)

278
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,250
Don't force yourself to

279
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,250
stay in our occult club.

280
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:33,417
Huh?

281
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,250
Really?

282
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,167
But even though you

283
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,167
love scary stuff

284
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,751
without me you could never

285
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,751
go to haunted places!

286
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,751
But we like being scared.

287
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,250
School rules are I have

288
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,250
to be in some club.

289
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:44,918
And I could never keep this up.

290
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,751
You don't have to do anything!

291
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,751
You can be a ghost member!

292
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,375
After all we're the occult club!

293
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,375
(chuckles)

294
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,918
Yeah I did say that.

295
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,125
Besides, I want to be

296
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,125
able to go home by 6:00.

297
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,083
So if you two don't

298
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,083
mind I'll stay.

299
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,584
I really like being in your

300
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,584
club. It has a great vibe.

301
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,751
Well in that case we're

302
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,751
happy to have you back.

303
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,792
Yeah.

304
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,125
(laughing)

305
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,250
[Fushiguro] That

306
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,250
guy's incredible.

307
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,751
He pulled off that shot

308
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,751
without

309
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,751
using any cursed energy.

310
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,125
I wonder if he's like Zen'in.

311
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,959
Whoa! It's already

312
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,959
half past four!

313
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,751
Later Coach! Got stuff to do!

314
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,667
(hollers)

315
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,918
(flashing)

316
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,792
(gasp)

317
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:28,667
The presence of a cursed object!

318
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:29,542
Hey hold it!

319
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:32,125
How is he that fast?

320
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,667
I heard he can run the 50

321
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,667
meters in three seconds.

322
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:35,751
Faster than my car!

323
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,709
(gentle guitar music)

324
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:50,792
I told you not to come!

325
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:54,000
And stop bringing flowers

326
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:54,000
with you every time!

327
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,334
[Yuuji] You always say that.

328
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,959
But you know these

329
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,959
aren't for you.

330
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:58,167
They're for the nurses.

331
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,751
All the more reason not to!

332
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:00,667
What's happening with

333
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:00,667
your school club?

334
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,667
Why aren't you at your club?

335
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:05,209
[Yuuji] Oh, chill out, Grandpa.

336
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,250
The club meeting

337
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,250
was over hours ago.

338
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,000
If I didn't have extra time,

339
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,000
I wouldn't be visiting you.

340
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,000
Good!

341
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,792
Now, listen to me since

342
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,792
I've got free time too.

343
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:15,834
[Yuuji] Not interested.

344
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,792
Listen anyway, I've

345
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,792
got some things

346
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:20,000
I want to say before

347
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:20,000
I reach the end.

348
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,334
It's about your parents and

349
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:22,000
-I want you to-

350
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:22,000
-Come on!

351
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,626
I told you, I'm not interested.

352
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:26,584
Grandpa, please, could you

353
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:26,584
please stop trying to act

354
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,876
all cool before you die?

355
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,375
Every man has the

356
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,375
right to try to go out

357
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:31,584
with a little style.

358
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:32,709
Get a clue, you

359
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:32,709
useless grandson!

360
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,709
Quit all your complaining.

361
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:39,000
You don't have to

362
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:39,000
put on a show for me.

363
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:40,709
(scoffs)

364
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,000
You've had it too easy.

365
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:50,876
Yuuji...

366
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,500
[Yuuji] Hm?

367
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:55,209
[Grandpa] You're a strong

368
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:55,209
kid, so try to help others.

369
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,792
Save the people you can,

370
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,918
even if it's only

371
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,918
those closest to you.

372
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,125
It's okay if you lose your way,

373
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,709
and don't worry about whether

374
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,709
they'll thank you or not.

375
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:07,083
Just save as many as you can,

376
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:07,083
even if you can only save one.

377
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,417
When you die, you should

378
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,417
be surrounded by people.

379
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,709
Don't end up like me.

380
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,250
[Yuuji] Grandpa?

381
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:27,626
(phone beeping)

382
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,292
Yes? What can I do for you?

383
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:34,083
Are you there?

384
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:34,876
Mister Itadori!

385
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,751
(sniffling)

386
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,834
Hello, are you there?

387
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,083
[Yuuji] My grandpa...

388
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,083
is dead.

389
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,751
There. That's all the

390
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,751
paperwork we need from you.

391
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,792
[Yuuji] Yeah. Thanks

392
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,792
for helping me.

393
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,959
Are you sure you're

394
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,959
going to be okay?

395
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,125
Well, I...

396
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:24,751
I've never done this before

397
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:24,751
so it doesn't feel real yet.

398
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,292
But then I know Grandpa

399
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,292
would snap at me

400
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,792
if he saw me moping

401
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,792
around like this.

402
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:32,125
So I'll just have to

403
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:32,125
laugh as I roast him!

404
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,334
[Nurse] Be respectful.

405
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:36,959
[Man] Yuuji Itadori?

406
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,709
-Huh?

407
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,709
-Hm?

408
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,167
I'm Fushiguro from Jujutsu Tech.

409
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,751
I'd like to have a

410
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,751
word with you. Now.

411
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,334
[Yuuji] Uh, I'm in

412
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,334
mourning right now.

413
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,959
I understand, but

414
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,959
this can't wait.

415
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,500
The cursed object you

416
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,500
possess is very dangerous.

417
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:52,167
I need you to hand it over.

418
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,876
[Yuuji] Cursed object?

419
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:54,834
[Fushiguro] This.

420
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,959
Oh, yeah, that!

421
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,959
Yeah, I found that.

422
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:00,375
I didn't think much of it.

423
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,626
But my friends were

424
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,626
totally into it.

425
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:03,792
What's dangerous about it?

426
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,334
[Fushiguro] Every year

427
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,334
there are more than 10,000

428
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,834
unexplained deaths and

429
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,834
missing persons in Japan.

430
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,250
And most of those are

431
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,250
the result of curses.

432
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,918
From curses?

433
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,417
I don't care whether you

434
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,417
believe in them or not,

435
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,209
the fact is they exist.

436
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:21,792
Just listen.

437
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:24,375
Large pools of negative

438
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:24,375
energy form easily

439
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,167
in schools,

440
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,167
hospitals, and so on.

441
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,542
Hardship, regret, shame.

442
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,876
These emotions of mankind

443
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,876
become the source of curses.

444
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,542
That's why most schools

445
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,542
secretly keep a cursed object

446
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,375
to serve as a

447
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,375
protective talisman.

448
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,542
Just like the one you

449
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,542
and your friends found.

450
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:42,167
If it protects us, then

451
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:42,167
shouldn't we be grateful for

452
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:42,167
it?

453
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,417
[Fushiguro] Just let me finish!

454
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,417
(grumbles)

455
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,042
A cursed object needs

456
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,042
to be incredibly evil

457
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,876
to keep lesser evil curses away.

458
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,667
But its protection

459
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,667
isn't permanent.

460
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,876
The problem is that their

461
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,876
seals weaken over time

462
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,083
and then they serve

463
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,083
as a lure to attract

464
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,834
and strengthen other curses.

465
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:03,417
The object you found

466
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:03,417
is a dangerous one,

467
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,209
classified as special-grade.

468
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,250
Now hand it over before

469
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,250
people start dying.

470
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:10,459
Agh! I already told you that

471
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:10,459
I don't have it anymore.

472
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:11,500
Here's the box.

473
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,876
It's empty!

474
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,083
I've just been following a

475
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,083
trace left by the object.

476
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,250
Hold it!

477
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:20,459
Where is it?

478
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:21,375
Knock it off!

479
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,792
You see Mm friends

480
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,792
were planning to...

481
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:25,209
To do what?

482
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,209
Well they were saying

483
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,209
let's open it up

484
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,626
to see what's inside tonight.

485
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,125
-Uh...

486
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,125
-(gasps)

487
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,834
Why? Is that bad?

488
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,083
It's way worse than bad.

489
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:40,751
Your friends are going to die.

490
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:46,667
I can't get it open.

491
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:49,459
Did we really need to sneak

492
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:49,459
into the building for this?

493
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,083
I'm gonna go turn on the light.

494
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,125
No don't! We need

495
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,125
some atmosphere!

496
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,125
Enjoying the thrill is part

497
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,125
of occult club isn't it?

498
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:59,626
It's not like anything's

499
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:59,626
going to happen here anyway.

500
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:00,751
(wrapping peels)

501
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:00,751
(gasps)

502
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:01,751
Hey!

503
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:16,042
(mysterious music)

504
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,500
[Iguchi] Whoa, a human finger!

505
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,500
Is it real?

506
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,918
(gasps)

507
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:24,792
You think...

508
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:28,167
-(boom)

509
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:28,167
-(screams)

510
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,292
What's going on?

511
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,292
(voice trembling)

512
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,584
(snarling)

513
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:35,792
[Yuuji] Are talismans

514
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:35,792
that easy to open up?

515
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:38,125
No, it's impossible for

516
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:38,125
those without cursed energy.

517
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:39,125
Normally.

518
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:40,125
(sighs)

519
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:42,125
Go right here! Shortcut!

520
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,334
[Fushiguro] This time the

521
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,334
object itself is too

522
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,334
strong!

523
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,792
And the seal is ancient. It

524
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,792
might as well be plain paper!

525
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:50,876
[Yuuji] I still don't get

526
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:50,876
all this stuff about curses!

527
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,792
[Fushiguro] Is that the

528
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,792
building? Where are they?

529
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,334
Fourth floor!

530
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,667
(grunts)

531
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:58,334
(intense music)

532
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,000
Whoa, what is this pressure?

533
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll handle this.

534
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,334
Oh no way! I'm coming!

535
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,709
I may not know those

536
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,709
two that well, but...

537
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,167
but they're friends!

538
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,959
I have to help!

539
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:13,834
You're staying here.

540
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:17,209
(eerie music)

541
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:24,167
(whimpering)

542
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,542
(snarling)

543
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,542
[Monster] What time is it?

544
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:32,959
Just what is that thing?

545
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:36,167
[Iguchi] Sasaki?

546
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,375
-(gasp)

547
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,375
-Oh, Iguchi! Thank goodness!

548
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,375
Where have you bee-

549
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:40,375
Help me!

550
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,375
(choking)

551
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,250
(voice trembling)

552
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,417
What time is it?

553
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,417
(screams)

554
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,584
The curse has been unleashed!

555
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:51,959
Its presence is everywhere!

556
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,250
(panting)

557
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:55,375
(snarling)

558
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,667
Out of my way!

559
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:57,959
Demon Dogs!

560
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:01,584
(intense music)

561
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:05,042
(howling)

562
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,042
Eat it, boy!

563
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,834
Am I really just gonna

564
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,834
sit here and wait

565
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:11,459
because he told me to?

566
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,000
What the hell am I so afraid of?

567
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,083
Your friends are going to die.

568
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,375
[Yuuji] He was right.

569
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,209
I can sense death

570
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,209
all the way out here.

571
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,918
I'm afraid of dying.

572
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,626
Was I afraid of it before?

573
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,000
It didn't feel like I was.

574
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,000
I didn't cry because

575
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,000
I was scared.

576
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,834
I just felt a little sad.

577
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,834
But my grandpa's death and

578
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,834
the death I'm facing now...

579
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:40,042
How are they any different?

580
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,042
[Grandpa] You're a strong

581
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,042
kid, so try to help others.

582
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,459
(whimpering)

583
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,834
(blasting)

584
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:53,083
The curses are growing

585
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:53,083
in number! They're close!

586
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,083
(snarling)

587
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,292
There you are.

588
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,292
[Yuuji] Grandpa was crabby,

589
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,292
short-tempered and stubborn!

590
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,083
No one but me ever

591
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,083
even visited him!

592
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:13,125
"Don't end up like me," huh?

593
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:13,125
Well, no chance of that!

594
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:15,959
[Fushiguro] Damn!

595
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,334
Is it trying to swallow her

596
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,334
along with the cursed object?

597
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,709
(moans)

598
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,125
I'm not gonna make it!

599
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,834
(dramatic music)

600
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:27,334
(confused mumble)

601
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,459
(glass shattering)

602
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,834
(grunting)

603
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:31,792
Itadori!!

604
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:34,334
I think you had a

605
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:34,334
proper death, Grandpa!

606
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,292
(grunting)

607
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,250
But this kind of a death...

608
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,125
is just wrong!

609
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,042
(snarling)

610
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,751
(moaning)

611
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:53,083
So this is a curse? Not

612
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:53,083
what I was expecting.

613
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,167
(groans)

614
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:01,751
I should be asking what you're

615
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:01,751
doing here but good job.

616
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,334
You're pretty smug, aren't you?

617
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,876
So, just curious,

618
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,792
what are those things

619
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,792
munching on the curse?

620
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:10,876
My shikigami. Wait,

621
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:10,876
you can see them?

622
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,667
Normally a curse can't be seen.

623
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,542
Not unless you're on

624
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,542
the verge of death

625
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:16,250
or in special places like this.

626
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:17,959
Yeah, that makes sense.

627
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:21,334
I've never seen ghosts or

628
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:21,334
weird stuff like this

629
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:21,334
before.

630
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,209
Huh. But you're

631
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,209
not scared though?

632
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:26,751
I was. I mean for a

633
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:26,751
little while there.

634
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,125
But then I thought,

635
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,125
everybody's gonna die.

636
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,209
Huh?

637
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:33,250
So I want to make sure

638
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:33,250
that the people I know

639
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:35,167
all have a chance

640
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:35,167
at a proper death.

641
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,417
Not that I really understand it.

642
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,417
Whoa!

643
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,751
This it?

644
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:44,334
Yeah, the cursed object,

645
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:44,334
Ryoumen Sukuna's finger.

646
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,417
It's a miracle that

647
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,417
thing didn't swallow it.

648
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,167
Why would anything

649
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,167
eat this? Is it good?

650
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,125
Don't be dense.

651
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,542
You'd eat it to gain

652
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,542
stronger cursed energy.

653
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,042
Now hand it over,

654
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,042
it's dangerous.

655
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:55,250
Fine, here.

656
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,125
(gasps)

657
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:01,042
(snarling)

658
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,042
Run!

659
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,959
(crash)

660
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:06,918
(grunting)

661
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,792
(electricity crackling)

662
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,584
(growling)

663
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,792
Damn!

664
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:14,083
(growling)

665
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,417
Nue!

666
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,459
(grunting)

667
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:22,459
(groaning)

668
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,459
(roars)

669
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,417
(blast)

670
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,834
(dramatic music)

671
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:30,209
(grunting)

672
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,834
(roaring)

673
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,626
Damn it!

674
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:39,417
Why can't I think straight?

675
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,751
Itadori!

676
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:44,417
Your only chance is to take

677
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:44,417
those two and run for it!

678
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,334
(roars)

679
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,417
You're in big trouble yourself!

680
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,417
(grunting)

681
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,250
(yells)

682
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,459
Only a curse can beat a curse!

683
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,834
You cannot defeat this!

684
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:57,334
Is that your idea of a pep talk?

685
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,459
At this rate, we're

686
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,459
both gonna die!

687
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,375
If I quit now I'll be

688
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,375
having

689
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,375
this nightmare for weeks!

690
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:06,417
Besides...

691
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,709
(snarling)

692
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:11,626
I know what I have to do!

693
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:12,626
[Grandpa] Try to help others.

694
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:15,834
I'm living with a rotten

695
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:15,834
curse of my own already!

696
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:18,500
(grunts)

697
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:20,334
(intense music)

698
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:30,000
You idiot! Throw it down to

699
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:30,000
me or you'll both get eaten!

700
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,500
(grunting)

701
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,375
(growling)

702
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,417
[Yuuji] Why would anything

703
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,417
eat this? Is it good?

704
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,709
[Fushiguro] Don't be dense.

705
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,667
You'd eat it to gain

706
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,667
stronger cursed energy.

707
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:42,709
(straining)

708
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:45,042
There's a way I

709
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:45,042
can save everyone!

710
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,876
I just need to have my own

711
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,876
cursed energy. don't I?

712
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,292
Don't do it.

713
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,542
Don't do it!

714
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:52,500
(swallowing)

715
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:54,500
Ryoumen Sukuna's finger!

716
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,292
That's a special-grade

717
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,292
cursed object!

718
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,542
It's a deadly poison!

719
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,542
He'll die for sure!

720
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:04,167
But, there is a chance,

721
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:04,167
a one-in-a-million chance

722
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,959
(boom)

723
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,083
(grunts)

724
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:11,876
(roaring)

725
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,876
(blast)

726
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,792
(gasp)

727
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:36,000
(cackling)

728
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:48,375
[Yuuji] I knew it! The light

729
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:48,375
feels best in the flesh!

730
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,709
[Fushiguro] This is the

731
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,709
worst,

732
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,709
a one-in-a-million-chance,

733
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:52,918
worst-case scenario!

734
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,709
The special-grade cursed

735
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,709
object has incarnated!

736
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,959
Cursed flesh is so boring!

737
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,417
So now where are the

738
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,417
people? The women?

739
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,959
What a wonderful era

740
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,959
to be reawakened!

741
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:09,125
Women and children are crawling

742
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:09,125
everywhere like maggots!

743
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:10,459
How marvelous!

744
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:13,000
It'll be a massacre!

745
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,542
(cackling)

746
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,751
(confused mumbling)

747
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,250
[Yuuji] What do you think

748
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,250
you're doing with my body?

749
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:21,250
Give it back!

750
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:24,250
Hey, wait. How are

751
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:24,250
you doing that?

752
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:26,792
Well, it's my body!

753
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:28,250
Wait...

754
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:29,584
He's suppressing me?

755
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:32,167
[Fushiguro] Stay

756
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:32,167
right where you are!

757
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,751
You're no longer human!

758
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:34,751
Huh?

759
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,125
Under Jujutsu regulation....

760
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,834
Yuuji Itadori...

761
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,459
by law I will now

762
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,459
exorcize you...

763
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:43,459
as a curse!

764
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,417
(dramatic music)
