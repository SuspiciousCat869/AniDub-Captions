1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:02,125
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,209
Satoru, show him

3
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,209
to his dorm room.

4
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:08,250
Be sure to explain the

5
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:08,250
security

6
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:08,250
arrangements to him as well.

7
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:14,751
You're admitted,

8
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:14,751
welcome to Jujutsu Tech.

9
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:16,667
[Yuuji] Hey, Fushiguro!

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,417
Wow, you look all better now.

11
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,209
There's lots of other

12
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,209
empty rooms, you know?

13
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:23,584
Sure, but isn't it better

14
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:23,584
to have some company?

15
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:24,459
I thought it'd be good for--

16
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:26,000
Classes and the

17
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:26,000
missions are enough.

18
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,125
This is not welcome.

19
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,417
Whoa-oah, it's so

20
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,417
organized in here.

21
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,792
Back off.

22
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:34,167
I just told you

23
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:34,167
you're not welcome!

24
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,375
Huh, friends already

25
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:38,083
and together, we're

26
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:38,083
heading out tomorrow.

27
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:42,083
We're gonna go pick up the

28
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:42,083
third and final first year.

29
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,918
(whistle blows)

30
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,459
[Announcer] The train bound

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,459
for Shibuya and Shinagawa

32
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,584
is now arriving on track one.

33
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:55,209
For your safety, please

34
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:55,209
stand behind the yellow line.

35
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,334
[Nobara] Saori,

36
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,125
I'm finally here.

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm in Tokyo.

38
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,792
How are there only

39
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,792
three first years?

40
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:13,250
That's practically nothing.

41
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:14,334
Think about it.

42
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,000
Can you honestly say you've

43
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,000
ever met someone else

44
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,083
who sees curses?

45
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:21,250
Huh, I guess not.

46
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:24,959
Because jujutsu

47
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:24,959
sorcerers, they're rare.

48
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:27,334
[Yuuji] Didn't you say I

49
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:27,334
was the third first year?

50
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:30,209
[Fushiguro] The others

51
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:30,209
admission

52
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:30,209
was decided a while ago.

53
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:33,667
You know what our

54
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:33,667
school is like.

55
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:35,167
Everyone has unique

56
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:35,167
circumstances.

57
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,042
Sorry for the wait.

58
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,751
Oh, your uniform

59
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,751
made it in time.

60
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,500
Yeah, it fits great.

61
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:46,334
Though I noticed it's

62
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:46,334
slightly

63
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:46,334
different from Fushiguro's.

64
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:47,959
Mine has got a hood.

65
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,042
[Gojou] That's

66
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,042
because the uniforms

67
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,125
can be customized upon request.

68
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,209
Huh?

69
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,834
But I never put in any requests.

70
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:57,292
You're right, I was the one

71
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:57,292
who put in the custom order.

72
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,125
Huh.

73
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,292
Oh, well cool.

74
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,834
Be careful, Gojou has a habit

75
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,834
of doing that kind of stuff.

76
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,209
So why are we meeting

77
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,209
up here in Harajuku?

78
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,334
[Gojou] Because that's

79
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,334
what she asked for.

80
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,918
[Yuuji] Yay popcorn,

81
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,918
I want some!

82
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,125
Why hello there.

83
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you on the clock right now?

84
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,500
[Woman] No, not right now.

85
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:18,751
That's great, you see,

86
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,542
I'm looking for

87
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,542
potential models.

88
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,167
That's what I do.

89
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,709
Would you be interested?

90
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,375
[Woman] I'm in a

91
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,375
hurry right now.

92
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,250
[Talent Scout] Wait,

93
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,250
just hear me out.

94
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:32,083
Hey you, what about me?

95
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,042
[Talent Scout] Oh boy, her?

96
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,542
For that modeling gig.

97
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,792
Hey, I'm asking what

98
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,792
you think about me.

99
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,083
Oh well, I'm in a

100
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,083
hurry at the moment.

101
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:45,542
What the hell?

102
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:47,751
Don't run, come out

103
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:47,751
and say what you think!

104
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,459
Wait, she's the one we

105
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,459
have to go and talk to?

106
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,209
This is real embarrassing.

107
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,209
(scoffs) Yeah, so are you.

108
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,292
Hey, we're over here!

109
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,709
[Girl] Oh damn, what's

110
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,709
up with that blindfold?

111
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,250
Right, I'd like you to meet...

112
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:08,792
Nobara Kugisaki.

113
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:10,542
You should be honored, boys.

114
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:11,834
I'm your group's girl.

115
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,918
(Opening Theme Music)

116
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:35,876
(singing in Japanese)

117
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,792
Stare...

118
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,751
I'm Yuuji Itadori from Sendai.

119
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,000
Fushiguro.

120
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,334
He looks like a potato.

121
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,334
He's definitely the type that

122
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,334
ate his own boogers as a kid.

123
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,667
And just his name?

124
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,292
I can't stand

125
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,292
high-and-mighty dudes.

126
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,584
I bet he likes setting

127
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,584
oil-slicked seagulls on

128
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,584
fire.

129
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,375
(groans) This is what

130
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,375
I get to work with?

131
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,918
Great, just my luck.

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,334
She took one look and sighed.

133
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,500
That can't be good.

134
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,542
Are we going

135
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,542
somewhere from here?

136
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:21,083
(chuckles) Well we do have

137
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:21,083
all three of you together.

138
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,459
And since two of you kids

139
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,459
are from the countryside,

140
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,250
that means we're going to Tokyo!

141
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,250
[All] Tokyo! Tokyo!

142
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,334
Tokyo!

143
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,334
[Both] We love Tokyo!

144
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,334
-Huh?

145
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,334
-TDL!

146
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,709
I want to go to TDL!

147
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,459
Idiot! TDL's in Chiba!

148
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,375
Let's go hit up

149
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,375
Chinatown instead!

150
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:40,292
Chinatown's in Yokohama, dummy!

151
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,209
Well Yokohama's part of Tokyo!

152
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,459
How do you not know

153
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,459
that? Look at a map!

154
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,751
If you quiet down, I'll

155
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,751
announce our destination.

156
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:48,834
Roppongi!

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,375
[Both] Roppongi?

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,334
[Fushiguro] There's

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,334
a curse here.

160
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,292
-You liar!

161
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,292
-You liar!

162
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,542
-This isn't Roppongi!

163
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,542
-It's a cruel move

164
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,292
to toy with country folk!

165
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,083
[Gojou] There's a

166
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,083
big cemetery nearby.

167
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,918
That, plus an

168
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,918
abandoned building,

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,834
and you've got a curse.

170
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,375
So they pop up more

171
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,375
often around graves.

172
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,751
Huh?

173
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,709
It's not the cemetery itself.

174
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,459
It's the fact that people

175
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,459
associate cemeteries

176
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,125
with fear and uneasiness.

177
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,626
Right, it was the same for

178
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,626
schools, too, wasn't it?

179
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:22,792
Wait hold up here.

180
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:23,500
He didn't even know that yet?

181
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,542
To be honest...

182
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:28,959
(gulps)

183
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:32,000
He swallowed a

184
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:32,000
special-grade cursed object?

185
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,000
Gross!

186
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,334
That's so unsanitary and

187
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,334
disgusting I wanna hurl.

188
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:36,667
No way, no way, no way!

189
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:37,667
That's not nice.

190
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:38,792
I agree with her.

191
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:41,500
I want to know what the

192
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:41,500
three of you are capable of.

193
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,459
Just think of this as

194
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,459
a kind of field test.

195
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:45,792
Nobara, Yuuji,

196
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:48,417
you go exorcize the curse

197
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:48,417
inside that building.

198
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,751
(Nobara grunts)

199
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,000
Hold on.

200
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,626
I thought only curses

201
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,626
could exorcize curses.

202
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,167
I can't use jujutsu yet.

203
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,000
If you look at it, you're

204
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,000
basically half a curse

205
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,000
already.

206
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,626
Cursed energy flows

207
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,626
through your body.

208
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,459
Although, controlling

209
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,459
that energy

210
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,500
isn't something you

211
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,500
can learn overnight.

212
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:05,959
So you use this.

213
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,626
The Slaughter Demon.

214
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,542
A weapon imbued

215
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,542
with cursed energy.

216
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:14,375
So it'll work on curses too.

217
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,459
Ugh, how lame.

218
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:21,167
[Gojou] Oh, one more thing.

219
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,876
-Huh?

220
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,876
-Don't let Sukuna out, okay?

221
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,834
If you use him, you'll get rid

222
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,834
of all curses in that radius,

223
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,500
but anyone nearby

224
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,500
will get dragged in.

225
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,500
You got it. I won't let him out.

226
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,459
(Nobara grunts)

227
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,000
Would you hurry it up?

228
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,167
-All right, all right.

229
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,167
-Have fun!

230
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,542
(door creaking)

231
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,209
I think I'll go in too.

232
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,500
Don't push yourself.

233
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:55,417
You're still

234
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:55,417
recovering, you know.

235
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,334
[Fushiguro] But someone

236
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,334
needs to keep an eye

237
00:07:58,417 --> 00:07:58,751
on Itadori, right?

238
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,876
[Gojou] True.

239
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,042
But the one we're testing

240
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,042
this time around is Nobara.

241
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,834
What a pain in my ass.

242
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,459
I come all the way to Tokyo

243
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,709
and I still have to

244
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,709
deal with dumb curses.

245
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,000
Huh?

246
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,584
You didn't come here

247
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,584
to exorcize them?

248
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,042
Let's save some time.

249
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,417
You and I should split up.

250
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,417
I'll start from the top and

251
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,417
investigate floor by floor.

252
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,834
You start from the bottom.

253
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,542
Let's knock this out and

254
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,542
grab some sushi in Ginza.

255
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:23,751
Hold on a minute.

256
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,751
Let's take this seriously.

257
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,876
Curses are dangerous, you know.

258
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,626
(Nobara grunting)

259
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,626
(Yuuji screams)

260
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:31,542
I don't wanna hear

261
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:31,542
it from someone

262
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:34,125
who last week was

263
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:34,125
a clueless normie!

264
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,375
Now get moving! (grunts)

265
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,250
You're an out of control

266
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,250
roller

267
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,250
coaster of emotions today!

268
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:42,083
[Nobara] This is why

269
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:42,083
girls don't like you!

270
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,584
How do you know they

271
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,584
don't like me, huh?

272
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:47,500
Are you even popular

273
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:47,500
enough to talk?

274
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:48,584
Bitch.

275
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:51,751
Huh?

276
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:54,709
(splashing)

277
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:57,459
(upbeat music)

278
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,167
Do you need a receipt?

279
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:06,459
It's a curse!

280
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:08,542
(curse warbling)

281
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,792
(screaming)

282
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,417
(grunting)

283
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,250
Hmm-mm.

284
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:30,584
Have I got moves or what?

285
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,751
(guts splashing)

286
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,876
That Yuuji.

287
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,334
Some screws are loose.

288
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,751
He's fearless.

289
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,918
These things take the form

290
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,918
of terrifying creatures

291
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,250
and try to kill him.

292
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,042
Yet the guy has no

293
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,042
hesitation at all.

294
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,667
And he doesn't have

295
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,667
the familiarity

296
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:51,083
with curses that you have.

297
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,209
We're talking about a boy

298
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,667
who used to live a

299
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,667
normal high school life.

300
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:59,334
By now, you've seen plenty

301
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:59,334
of jujutsu sorcerers,

302
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:00,709
some talented.

303
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,334
And you've seen them give up

304
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,083
'cause they couldn't conquer

305
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,083
their fear or disgust, right?

306
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,626
So today's about seeing if

307
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,626
she's crazy enough for this.

308
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,459
(sighs) Hey. Whaddup, curse?

309
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,167
Yeah you, mannequin

310
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,167
in the center.

311
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,125
You actually think

312
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,125
you're hidden there?

313
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,918
Fine then.

314
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,292
I'll do this from here.

315
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,500
But Kugisaki has

316
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,500
experience, right?

317
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:35,375
So it's a little

318
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:35,375
late for that now.

319
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,709
As we know, curses are

320
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,709
born from human minds.

321
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,584
So their strength and numbers

322
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,584
grow in proportion

323
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,584
to the population.

324
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:47,334
(light upbeat music)

325
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,709
(Nobara grunts)

326
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:04,667
Do you think Nobara understands

327
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,751
Tokyo curses are on

328
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,751
a different level

329
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,542
than those in the countryside?

330
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,000
(upbeat music)

331
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,626
(upbeat music)

332
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,626
Curses are born

333
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,626
from human minds.

334
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,292
So their strength and numbers

335
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,626
grow in proportion

336
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,626
to the population.

337
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,334
Tokyo curses are on

338
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,334
a different level

339
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,125
than those in the countryside.

340
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:50,751
You know, you might

341
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:50,751
wanna pull those out,

342
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,667
(snaps fingers)

343
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,459
or my cursed energy

344
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,459
will flow into you.

345
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:03,167
(curse shatters)

346
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:11,250
Nailed it. (giggles)

347
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,167
A kid?

348
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:22,792
Must've snuck in here to play

349
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,667
but ran into the curse instead.

350
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:31,334
Hey, it's alright now.

351
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,417
Come on out.

352
00:12:33,876 --> 00:12:35,334
(kid whimpers)

353
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,334
(Nobara sighs)

354
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,876
(clears throat)

355
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,375
Guess he's intimidated

356
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,375
by my beauty.

357
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:43,500
It happens a lot.

358
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:45,834
-I'll call Itadori.

359
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:45,834
-Wait!

360
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,125
Don't leave me here! (screams)

361
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:52,876
(curse warbling)

362
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,834
(kid screaming)

363
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,834
(curse laughing)

364
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:10,667
[Nobara] It took him hostage?

365
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,417
This curse has intelligence?

366
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,626
When I say level,

367
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:18,459
I don't just mean the amount

368
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:18,459
of cursed energy they have.

369
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:20,167
It's their cunning.

370
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,209
Monsters that have gained wisdom

371
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,876
will often force cruel

372
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,876
choices upon you.

373
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,000
Where the weight of human

374
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,000
lives hang in the balance.

375
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,834
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

376
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:31,918
Damn it!

377
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,918
This curse isn't

378
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,918
even all that strong!

379
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,167
Grade 4.

380
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,125
Maybe even less,

381
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,125
like a low grade 3!

382
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:41,834
(kid whimpers)

383
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:43,209
But it's aware of that!

384
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,292
That's why it chose

385
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,292
to take a hostage!

386
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:50,292
Calm yourself down.

387
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,292
If I die, the boy dies, too.

388
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,584
But if he dies, I won't die.

389
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,792
Logically speaking, it's

390
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,792
better if at least I

391
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,792
survive.

392
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,918
I mean, right?

393
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,292
I'm unarmed now.

394
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,083
Let the boy go.

395
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:20,334
(curse laughing)

396
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:24,500
I'm such an idiot.

397
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:27,292
It's not letting

398
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:27,292
go of him at all.

399
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,167
(curse laughing)

400
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:36,125
Poor Saori, I wish I could've

401
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:36,125
seen her one last time.

402
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,500
(loud thud)

403
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:41,000
Huh? I missed?

404
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:52,459
(loud thud)

405
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:55,459
-(curse warbling)

406
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:55,459
-(upbeat music)

407
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:55,834
You okay, bud?

408
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:58,000
Uh-huh.

409
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,834
(curse warbling)

410
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:02,000
It's getting away!

411
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,250
No he's not!

412
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,000
-Itadori, give me that arm!

413
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,000
-Huh?

414
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,042
(curse warbling)

415
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,417
-I'll handle it.

416
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,417
-Hold on.

417
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,334
-A straw doll?

418
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,334
-Creepy.

419
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,792
Straw Doll Technique:

420
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:22,959
Resonance!

421
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:26,667
(curse warbling)

422
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,876
Oh good.

423
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,250
All right, she's crazy.

424
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,167
We beat it.

425
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:47,250
(soft piano music)

426
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:55,250
(truck beeping)

427
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,375
When I was in first grade,

428
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,626
Saori moved to our

429
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,626
village from Tokyo.

430
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,000
Huh?

431
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,042
She was as cute as a doll

432
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,042
and as kind as a nun.

433
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,500
Yet Saori was ostracized

434
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,500
by the villagers.

435
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,042
"She thinks us country

436
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,042
folk are dumb," they said,

437
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,250
they got swept up in

438
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,250
their own paranoia.

439
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:48,667
And in the end,

440
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,125
they drove her out.

441
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,167
Calling it sickening

442
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,167
wouldn't cover it.

443
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,375
She brought all these homemade

444
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,375
sweets I'd never heard of,

445
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,626
"The ones from the

446
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,626
bakery are even better,"

447
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,667
she'd smile as she

448
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,667
treated me to them.

449
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:20,167
If I had stayed in

450
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:20,167
that village, then I...

451
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,292
[Yuuji] This is why I told you!

452
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,167
I said it's dangerous

453
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,167
to go alone

454
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,792
and you need to

455
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,792
take it seriously!

456
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,292
Except you never said it

457
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,292
was dangerous to go alone!

458
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,959
I, wait, I didn't?

459
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,626
And dude, what have

460
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,626
you been eating

461
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,417
that lets you punch through

462
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,417
a wall with your bare hand?

463
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,000
[Yuuji] It wasn't

464
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,000
reinforced concrete!

465
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,083
[Nobara] So?

466
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,751
Most people couldn't

467
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,751
punch through that!

468
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,709
You really don't think so?

469
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,292
You know, you've asked

470
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,292
me a ton of questions

471
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,083
but I've got one for you.

472
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,667
Like why did you

473
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,667
come to Jujutsu Tech?

474
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,042
Why am I here?

475
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,667
Because the countryside sucked!

476
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:57,083
And I always wanted

477
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:57,083
to live in Tokyo!

478
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,417
(Yuuji screams)

479
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,918
This was the only way

480
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,918
a poor girl like me

481
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,250
could move to the city

482
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,250
without worrying about money!

483
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,334
You'd risk your life

484
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,334
to save a few bucks?

485
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:11,834
I would.

486
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,334
Since it means being

487
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,334
true to myself.

488
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:21,125
(soft music)

489
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:25,125
If I had stayed in that

490
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:25,125
village, I'd be as good as

491
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:25,125
dead.

492
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,209
Saori, I made it to Tokyo.

493
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:45,626
If we ever meet here,

494
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,083
take me to that

495
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,083
bakery you mentioned.

496
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:58,542
So as far as that goes,

497
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:58,542
I'm grateful to you, too.

498
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,000
If you hadn't been here,

499
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,709
and he or I had been killed,

500
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,459
the future wouldn't

501
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,459
be so bright.

502
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:05,834
So thanks.

503
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,542
Well, I guess we've

504
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,542
all got our own reasons

505
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:10,667
for being here.

506
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:12,542
Drop it!

507
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:13,167
I've given you my

508
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:13,167
thanks already.

509
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,876
We're even now! (giggles)

510
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:16,417
What is wrong with her?

511
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,500
I live over there!

512
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:21,584
Thanks again!

513
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:27,542
Did you know I get into a

514
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:27,542
bad mood when I'm hangry?

515
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,918
[Yuuji] When are you

516
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,918
not in a bad mood?

517
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:32,250
[Gojou] Hey there!

518
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:33,125
Huh?

519
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,876
We made sure the kid got home.

520
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,167
Now how about we grab some food?

521
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,542
-A juicy steak.

522
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,542
-Sushi!

523
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:45,375
Just leave it all to me!

524
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,209
Megumi, you in?

525
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,042
Huh?

526
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:51,250
Okay, let's go.

527
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:59,292
[Nobara] Oh, I forgot about

528
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:59,292
my biggest haul of the day.

529
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,584
Hey, you, go fetch my things.

530
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,209
[Yuuji] Huh? Why

531
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,209
should I do that?

532
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:05,334
I thought we were even now.

533
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,918
[Nobara] We won thanks

534
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,918
to my cursed energy.

535
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,751
Got a problem with that?

536
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,500
[Yuuji] What about

537
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,500
my raw strength?

538
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,083
[Nobara] That freak

539
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,083
strength you get

540
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:12,792
from eating weird shit?

541
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:14,792
[Yuuji] It's not just from that!

542
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:15,876
Right, Fushiguro?

543
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,209
Huh? Fushiguro,

544
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,209
what's the matter?

545
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:20,250
Nothing.

546
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,792
He's pouting 'cause he

547
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,792
didn't get to fight.

548
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:23,876
Poor little baby.

549
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:25,417
(Fushiguro grunts)

550
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,918
(Yuuji laughs)

551
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,876
[Kiyokata] Log: July 2018.

552
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:38,500
West Tokyo City, Eishuu

553
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:38,500
Juvenile Detention Center.

554
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,083
In the sky above

555
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,083
the exercise yard.

556
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,959
Hey, what is that?

557
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,042
What's what?

558
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,000
[Kiyokata] Unnamed Apparition

559
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,000
of Potential Special Grade.

560
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,459
Its curse womb was witnessed

561
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,334
by several

562
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,334
non-jujutsu sorcerers.

563
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,667
[Teen] That up there!

564
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,667
Looks like an egg.

565
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:05,500
[Tadashi] What are

566
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:05,500
you talking about?

567
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,667
[Kiyokata] Due to

568
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,667
its emergency nature,

569
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:12,292
three Jujutsu Tech first-years

570
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:12,292
were dispatched to the scene.

571
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,125
And one of them died.

572
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:21,918
(Closing Theme Music)

573
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:47,792
[All] Juju Stroll.

574
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,876
[Nobara] I'm going

575
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,876
with paper, Itadori.

576
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,083
[Both] Rock, paper, scissors!

577
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,083
-(Yuuji grunts)

578
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,083
-Yeah!

579
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,959
I guess we can go to the

580
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,959
sushi place in Ginza.

581
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,083
Ginza, yeah!

582
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:01,792
I want revolving sushi!

583
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:02,667
(Nobara grunts)

584
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:04,959
[Nobara] Itadori,

585
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:04,959
you're such a (grunts),

586
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,292
Fushiguro, say something to him!

587
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,209
If we're going, we should

588
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,209
get something good.

589
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:09,500
Since Gojou's paying.

590
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:11,250
Revolving sushi's its own thing,

591
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,792
like how yakisoba and instant

592
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,792
yakisoba are different!

593
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,751
Yeah but I wanna

594
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,751
eat big girl sushi.

595
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,000
[Yuuji] Sushi's a boring meal!

596
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,751
Revolving sushi's an experience!

597
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,292
Like a theme park! Or TDL!

598
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,167
And you said you were

599
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,167
from the country,

600
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,792
so have you ever even been

601
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,792
to a revolving sushi place?

602
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:25,792
My favorite is Sushi Go,

603
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:29,000
but I'd go with Splendid

604
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:29,000
Sushi for a first-timer.

605
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:29,542
You totally get it!

606
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:32,125
Hey, cool your jets.

607
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:34,000
Kugisaki, listen closely.

608
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,417
At Splendid Sushi,

609
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,959
the sushi is delivered

610
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,959
to you on a bullet train.

611
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,083
What?!

612
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,167
Driver, this girl's never

613
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,167
had revolving sushi.

614
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,500
Take us to Splendid Sushi

615
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,500
with the huge-ass parking

616
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,500
lot!

617
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:49,709
(upbeat dramatic music)
