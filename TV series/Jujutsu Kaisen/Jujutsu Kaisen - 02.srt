1
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:07,125
Yuuji Itadori, by law I will

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:07,125
now exorcize you as a curse.

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:10,584
(dramatic orchestral music)

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,751
No, really, I'm feeling fine.

5
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:13,959
Besides, you and I are

6
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:13,959
both pretty beat up.

7
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:16,083
Shouldn't we see a doctor?

8
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,083
[Fushiguro] I can't tell

9
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,083
if this is Itadori speaking

10
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,292
or the cursed object.

11
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,209
Dammit, what do I do now?

12
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,959
[Satoru] What's the situation?

13
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,250
Huh, Satoru Gojou?

14
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:29,083
What are you doing here?

15
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,209
Hey.

16
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:32,876
I wasn't planning on showing up,

17
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,792
but you got kind

18
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,792
of roughed up, kid.

19
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:36,209
I'll show the second years.

20
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:37,083
Say cheese.

21
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,209
(laughs)

22
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,792
I got an earful

23
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,792
from the higher-ups

24
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,292
'cause this special-grade

25
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,292
cursed object's still

26
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,292
missing.

27
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,167
Thought I'd do a little

28
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,167
sightseeing and stop by.

29
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,626
So, did you find it yet?

30
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:50,792
(Fushiguro sighs)

31
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:51,459
-Uh--

32
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:51,459
-Hmm?

33
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:54,209
Sorry, but I ate that thing.

34
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:57,250
Really?

35
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,125
-He did.

36
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,125
-I did.

37
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:00,125
Hmm?

38
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hmm.

39
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:08,584
(laughs)

40
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,250
Damn, it really did

41
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,250
combine with you.

42
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,626
That's hilarious.

43
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,417
Anything weird about your body?

44
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,918
Nah, it seems okay.

45
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,125
Can you swap with

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,125
Sukuna at will?

47
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,125
Sukuna?

48
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:20,459
[Satoru] Yeah,

49
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:20,459
the curse you ate?

50
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:23,918
Oh, mm-hmm, yeah, I

51
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:23,918
think I can do that.

52
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,292
Okay, give us 10 seconds.

53
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,667
Then change right

54
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,667
back into yourself.

55
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:30,125
Yeah, but..

56
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,459
Don't worry.

57
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,959
I'm way too strong for him.

58
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:35,542
Megumi, hold onto this for me.

59
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,500
So what is this?

60
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,709
Kikufuku from Kikusuian.

61
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,959
It's Sendai's specialty

62
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,959
and it's super good.

63
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,876
I recommend the zunda

64
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,876
and cream flavor.

65
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,292
[Fushiguro] This guy actually

66
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,292
went and bought souvenirs

67
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,292
while people were

68
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,292
out here dying?

69
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,459
It's no souvenir.

70
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,959
I'll be eating this on the

71
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,959
bullet train ride home.

72
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,334
(thunder crashes)

73
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:54,667
Look out!

74
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:55,292
-Kikufuku's just the best.

75
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:55,292
-(thunder crashes)

76
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,959
(intense music)

77
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,250
I think it's the

78
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,250
whipped cream inside

79
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:08,542
that really makes

80
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:08,542
the difference.

81
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:11,209
(Sukuna growls)

82
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:18,876
Since my student's watching, I

83
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:18,876
think I'll show off a little.

84
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah.

85
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,083
(fighters grunting)

86
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:25,334
Is he unbelievably fast?

87
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,709
No, that's not it.

88
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,667
(fighters grunting)

89
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,334
For crying out loud.

90
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:37,500
You jujutsu sorcerers are

91
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:37,500
always such a pain in the ass

92
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:38,500
in any era.

93
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:41,459
(building crashing)

94
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,709
(glass shatters)

95
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,375
Though time doesn't really

96
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,375
have much meaning for me.

97
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,918
Seven, eight, nine.

98
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,292
And that should do it.

99
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:00,751
[Sukuna] Dammit, again?

100
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,209
Why can't I seem to

101
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,209
take over this body?

102
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:07,334
Who the hell is

103
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:07,334
this Itadori punk?

104
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,250
[Itadori] Oh, how did it go?

105
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,292
How about that?

106
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,417
So you really can

107
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,417
control that guy?

108
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,584
He's kind of annoying

109
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,584
though to tell the truth

110
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,918
and I keep hearing his voice.

111
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,334
It's a miracle that's

112
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,334
all he's doing to you.

113
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,000
[Megumi] What'd you do to him?

114
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,751
[Satoru] I just knocked him out.

115
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,209
If he isn't possessed by

116
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,209
Sukuna when he wakes up,

117
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:40,459
then he might have

118
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:40,459
potential as a vessel.

119
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:44,459
Now I have a question for you.

120
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,751
What do you think we

121
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,751
should do with him?

122
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,667
Well, even if he is a vessel,

123
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,459
jujutsu regulations demand

124
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,459
Itadori be executed.

125
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:58,542
However, I don't

126
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:58,542
want him to die.

127
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,167
Personal?

128
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,375
I suppose.

129
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,250
So can you save him?

130
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,167
(Satoru chuckles)

131
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,250
A request from a

132
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,250
precious student?

133
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,667
Leave it to me.

134
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,500
But the end result is

135
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,500
still your execution.

136
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,500
Your recap doesn't match

137
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,500
with the current events.

138
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:20,834
Hey, sorry, I did my best.

139
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,250
You still have to die, but I

140
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,250
got your sentence suspended.

141
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:25,876
What's suspended mean?

142
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,500
You'll wait until

143
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,500
later to kill me?

144
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,918
Yep, I'll just

145
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,918
explain from the top.

146
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,334
This is the same kind of thing

147
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,334
as the cursed object you ate.

148
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:37,042
There are 20 of these in total.

149
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,876
We possess six of them.

150
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,459
[Itadori] 20?

151
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, each finger and toe?

152
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,709
No, Sukuna has four arms.

153
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:51,167
(finger exploding)

154
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,417
As you can see, we

155
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,417
can't destroy them.

156
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,876
The curse is that powerful

157
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,375
and the curse grows

158
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,375
stronger every day.

159
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:02,417
So our modern-day jujutsu

160
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:02,417
seals just aren't keeping up.

161
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,834
That's where you come in.

162
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:08,375
When you die, the curse

163
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:08,375
inside you will die as well.

164
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,500
You see, our elders are cowards.

165
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,834
They're demanding we

166
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,834
kill you right away.

167
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,542
But that would be a

168
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,542
waste, wouldn't you say?

169
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:19,167
-A waste?

170
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:19,167
-See,

171
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,083
there's no assurance

172
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,083
another vessel capable

173
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,918
of handling Sukuna will

174
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,918
ever be born again,

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,042
so here's what I

176
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,042
proposed to them.

177
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,542
Since they've already

178
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,542
decided to execute you,

179
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:30,876
why not wait until after

180
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,334
you've absorbed all

181
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,334
of Sukuna to do it?

182
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,918
And the higher-ups agreed.

183
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,500
So now, you have two

184
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,500
options before you.

185
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:42,918
You can die here and now or

186
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:42,918
gather all the parts of

187
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:42,918
Sukuna,

188
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
absorb them and then die.

189
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,667
(Opening Theme Music)

190
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:07,417
(singing in Japanese)

191
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:25,834
(person knocking)

192
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,000
[Sasaki] Itadori.

193
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,083
Hi.

194
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:30,792
Hello, Sasaki.

195
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:32,125
How's Iguchi doing?

196
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,834
Well, the doctors say

197
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,000
there's nothing

198
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,000
seriously wrong with him,

199
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,834
but he still hasn't

200
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,834
regained consciousness

201
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,083
and this whole thing's my fault.

202
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:46,792
I asked him to come to the

203
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:46,792
school and that night...

204
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,417
(sobs)

205
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,709
I know you won't believe

206
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,709
it, but we got attacked.

207
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,876
By some weird scary monster.

208
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,876
And it captured both of us.

209
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,876
I do believe you

210
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,500
'cause I know that

211
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,500
wasn't a monster exactly.

212
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,834
It was a curse.

213
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:04,918
Huh?

214
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,876
That finger was a

215
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,876
special-grade cursed object.

216
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,459
It has the power to

217
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,459
draw other curses to it

218
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,209
and make them stronger.

219
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,876
So none of what happened

220
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,876
here was your fault.

221
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,792
It was mine for giving it

222
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,792
to you in the first place.

223
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,792
(soft piano music)

224
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:25,542
So I'm sorry, but

225
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:25,542
it'll be all right.

226
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:28,876
Someone who can fix Iguchi

227
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:28,876
will be here tomorrow.

228
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,959
Itadori?

229
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,792
Sorry, Sasaki, but I have

230
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,792
somewhere I have to be.

231
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,167
Ba-bye.

232
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:47,918
[Satoru] Who passed away?

233
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,751
[Itadori] My grandpa,

234
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:52,167
although he was more

235
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:52,167
like a father to me.

236
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,125
[Satoru] I see.

237
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,542
Sorry it had to happen

238
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,542
at a time like this.

239
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,751
So, have you decided

240
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,751
what you want to do?

241
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,667
[Itadori] Are

242
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,667
casualties like these

243
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,417
from curses pretty common?

244
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,959
This one was a rather

245
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,959
exceptional case,

246
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,959
but in terms of damage,

247
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,959
it happens all the time.

248
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,500
It's a good night when

249
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,500
someone dies a normal death

250
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:16,000
after encountering a curse.

251
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,792
Finding a body

252
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,792
that's torn to pieces

253
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,209
is actually one of

254
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,209
the better outcomes.

255
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:30,500
If you plan to hunt down Sukuna,

256
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:33,667
you're going to witness

257
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:33,667
some gruesome stuff

258
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,125
and I can't guarantee you

259
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,125
won't end up that way

260
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,125
yourself.

261
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,250
So, I guess you can choose

262
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,250
which hell you want.

263
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,918
[Grandpa] You're a strong

264
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,918
kid, so try to help others.

265
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,709
[Itadori] If all the

266
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,709
parts of Sukuna were gone,

267
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,125
would it really help?

268
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,626
Would there be fewer people

269
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,626
getting harmed by curses?

270
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,334
Yes, of course.

271
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,626
So have you got that finger?

272
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,375
Looking at it again

273
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,375
here in broad daylight,

274
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,083
it's pretty disgusting.

275
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:38,209
(swallows)

276
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,876
Okay, that's the second one.

277
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,042
One tenth of the whole.

278
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,709
I wonder what's going to happen.

279
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:52,876
-(Itadori gagging)

280
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:52,876
-(Sukuna growling)

281
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,709
(Itadori chuckles)

282
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,209
Blech.

283
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,375
So gross.

284
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,417
I mean, so gross it's funny.

285
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,876
[Satoru] (chuckles) There.

286
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,542
It's not just a physical

287
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,542
tolerance that he has.

288
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:15,334
He can fight off Sukuna's

289
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:15,334
attempts to take over.

290
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,292
We haven't seen someone

291
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,292
with talent like this

292
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,792
-in 1,000 years.

293
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,792
-What's wrong?

294
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,834
-(rock music)

295
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,834
-Oh, nothing at all.

296
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:24,417
I take it this means

297
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:24,417
you've made up your mind.

298
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,626
Chosen your fate?

299
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:29,083
Not at all.

300
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,792
I still don't understand

301
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,792
why I have to be executed,

302
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,626
but I know I can't

303
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,626
just do nothing.

304
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,250
Grandpa, that last

305
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,250
request of yours

306
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,542
is going to be a

307
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,542
pain in the ass.

308
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:41,876
I'll eat every part of Sukuna.

309
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,125
After that, I don't care.

310
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,709
As far as how I'm gonna

311
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,709
die, I've already decided.

312
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:52,584
My guy, I love

313
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:52,584
finding guys like you.

314
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,709
A fun time in hell awaits.

315
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:57,292
Make sure you're packed

316
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:57,292
by the end of the day.

317
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,834
Am I going somewhere?

318
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,083
Tokyo.

319
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,083
Fushiguro!

320
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,292
Looking good, brother.

321
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,292
You think this is looking good?

322
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:04,918
Anyway, here's the deal.

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,834
You're going to the school

324
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,959
for jujutsu sorcerers

325
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,959
that I attend.

326
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,042
Huh?

327
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,834
Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu

328
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,834
Technical High School.

329
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,584
By the way, you'll be one of

330
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,584
only three first years there.

331
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:19,667
Only three?

332
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:23,667
(bird squawking)

333
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:29,918
Okay, I'm heading out.

334
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,792
Goodbye, Grandpa.

335
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:38,125
This is really deep

336
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:38,125
in the mountains.

337
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:39,334
Are we still even in Tokyo?

338
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:42,167
[Satoru] This is what the

339
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:42,167
outskirts of Tokyo looks

340
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:42,167
like.

341
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,167
[Itadori] Where's Fushiguro?

342
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,709
[Satoru] He's being

343
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,709
treated by a sorcerer

344
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:48,125
and at the moment,

345
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:48,125
he's fast asleep.

346
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:52,125
Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu

347
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:52,125
Technical High School.

348
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,209
It's one of only two jujutsu

349
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,209
educational facilities.

350
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,500
As a sort of cover,

351
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,334
it's known as a private

352
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,334
religious school.

353
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:03,334
Many jujutsu sorcerers

354
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:03,334
continue to use it as a base

355
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,584
after graduation,

356
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,584
so it's a pillar

357
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:08,792
of the jujutsu community,

358
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:08,792
not just in education,

359
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:11,709
but for support and

360
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:11,709
mediation in missions.

361
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,834
Anyway, you're about

362
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,834
to have an interview

363
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,834
with the Principal.

364
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:17,000
[Itadori] The Principal?

365
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,209
Screw this up

366
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,834
and he could turn you down

367
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,834
for admission just like

368
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,834
that.

369
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:21,834
Huh?

370
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:23,751
And what happens then,

371
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:23,751
immediate execution?

372
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:26,167
What's this?

373
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,834
So you're not the boss?

374
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:32,042
Any hierarchy other than

375
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:32,042
strength is worthless.

376
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,042
(Itadori yells)

377
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,417
I'm sorry about that.

378
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,918
Sometimes he just does that.

379
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What an amusing

380
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
body you have now.

381
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,918
I do owe you a big favor though.

382
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,167
Once I make this

383
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,167
punk's body my own,

384
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,542
you'll be the first one I kill.

385
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,709
It's my honor to be

386
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,709
targeted by Sukuna himself.

387
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,250
This guy is really that famous?

388
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:55,500
Ryoumen Sukuna is an

389
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:55,500
imaginary fierce god

390
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,792
with four arms and two faces.

391
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:01,709
But he once existed as

392
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:01,709
an actual human being,

393
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,417
although it was over

394
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,417
a thousand years ago.

395
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,584
In the golden age of jujutsu,

396
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,584
sorcerers gathered

397
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,584
all their might

398
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,000
to challenge him and failed.

399
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,792
Crowned with the

400
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,792
title of Sukuna,

401
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:15,083
we couldn't even

402
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:15,083
destroy his grave wax

403
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,792
as he traversed the ages after

404
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,792
death as a cursed object.

405
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:21,709
Without a doubt, he

406
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:21,709
is the king of curses.

407
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,918
[Itadori] Who's

408
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,918
stronger, him or you?

409
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,792
[Satoru] Well, if Sukuna

410
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,792
regained all his power,

411
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,876
he might cause me

412
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,876
a little trouble.

413
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,918
But would you lose?

414
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,167
I would win.

415
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,417
You're late, Satoru.

416
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,959
Eight minutes late.

417
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
As usual, not quite enough

418
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
to chastise you for.

419
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,292
I told you, fix that habit.

420
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,459
That old dude's

421
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,459
making cute things?

422
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,292
If it's not enough

423
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,292
to chastise me for,

424
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,500
then don't chastise.

425
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,834
Besides, you're just sitting

426
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,834
around making dolls anyway,

427
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:03,918
so what's eight minutes?

428
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,292
Principal Masamichi Yaga.

429
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,000
This is the boy?

430
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:09,918
Yuuji Itadori.

431
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,834
I'm into girls like

432
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,834
Jennifer Lawrence.

433
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:13,834
This is an honor.

434
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:15,542
[Principal] What

435
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:15,542
are you here for?

436
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,083
An interview?

437
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,959
But why Jujutsu Tech?

438
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:21,959
To learn jujutsu?

439
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:23,876
I mean beyond that.

440
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,000
What do you hope to find

441
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,000
once you've studied curses

442
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,792
and learned the art

443
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,792
of exorcizing them?

444
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:33,250
Well, I suppose,

445
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,667
I'm going to collect all

446
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,667
the fingers of Sukuna.

447
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,292
Can't just leave

448
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,292
them all out there.

449
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,792
-Why not?

450
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,792
-Hmm?

451
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,542
People you'll never

452
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,542
know die every day

453
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,125
due to crime,

454
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,125
accidents, and diseases.

455
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:48,042
It's just the natural

456
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:48,042
course of life.

457
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,042
Here he goes again.

458
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,959
But you're telling me

459
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,959
you can't overlook it

460
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:54,125
when that death is

461
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:54,125
caused by a curse?

462
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,500
It was someone's

463
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,500
dying request of me.

464
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:58,542
And I don't care

465
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:58,542
about the details.

466
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,584
I just want to save who I can.

467
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,417
Hmm, dying wish?

468
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,375
You're saying

469
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,375
you'll fight curses

470
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,834
just because someone

471
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,834
else told you to do that?

472
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,167
Insufficient.

473
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,042
(Itadori gasps)

474
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,834
(creature growls)

475
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:17,375
That's not a doll.

476
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,042
It's alive.

477
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,334
In a way.

478
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:21,584
They're corpses.

479
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,209
Dolls that I've

480
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,209
infused with my curse.

481
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:26,000
(Itadori gasps)

482
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,042
(Itadori grunts)

483
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,083
[Itadori] That's

484
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,083
one hell of a doll.

485
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:42,125
A person's true nature reveals

486
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:42,125
itself during a crisis.

487
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,459
I'll keep attacking you

488
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,459
until

489
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,459
I get an acceptable answer.

490
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,209
Look, man, it wasn't

491
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,209
just someone else.

492
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:52,083
It was my grandfather's

493
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:52,083
dying request.

494
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,042
(grunts)

495
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,959
Where is it?

496
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,959
(grunts)

497
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,876
Family's still

498
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,876
just someone else.

499
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,167
(doll squeaking)

500
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:21,584
[Itadori] All

501
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:21,584
right, it's a doll,

502
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,626
so it doesn't get

503
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,626
hurt or scared.

504
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,000
A jujutsu sorcerer

505
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,000
constantly faces death

506
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,626
and not just their own death.

507
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,125
Sometimes you must

508
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,125
ignore the victims

509
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:33,167
and rend the flesh from those

510
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:33,167
who the curse has murdered.

511
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,792
It's an unpleasant job.

512
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,417
You have to be highly motivated

513
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,250
and perhaps a little

514
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,250
crazy to handle it.

515
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:43,918
You'd do this because

516
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:43,918
someone else told you to?

517
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,250
Don't make me laugh.

518
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,459
It would be more believable

519
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,083
if you said you were doing it

520
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,083
to postpone your execution.

521
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,209
Oh, screw you.

522
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:51,918
-I--

523
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:51,918
-And tell me this.

524
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Are you going to blame

525
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
your poor grandfather

526
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,000
when you get killed

527
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,000
by a curse too?

528
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,292
Damn, old man.

529
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,709
You say some pretty

530
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,709
harsh things.

531
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,959
Teaching is making

532
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,959
people realize truths.

533
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,375
That's right, I guess.

534
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,834
(grunts)

535
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,834
(grunts)

536
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,459
[Principal] It's not easy

537
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,125
to imagine how you'll feel

538
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,125
on the verge of death.

539
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:23,918
However, I can say

540
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:23,918
one thing for certain.

541
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,918
At the rate you're going,

542
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,334
you might end up cursing

543
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,334
your beloved grandfather

544
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,292
for his dying wish.

545
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,834
Jujutsu sorcerers never

546
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,834
die without regret,

547
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:33,292
so I'll ask you just once more.

548
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,709
Why have you come

549
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,709
here to Jujutsu Tech?

550
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:38,626
(melancholy music)

551
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:41,125
As a kid, I was always

552
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:41,125
better than most

553
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,500
in sports and in fights,

554
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:47,209
but never once did I think

555
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:47,209
this

556
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:47,209
is something only I can do.

557
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,292
Never.

558
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:52,250
(grunts)

559
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:58,000
Consuming Sukuna is

560
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:58,000
something only I can do.

561
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,083
So even if I could

562
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,083
escape my death sentence

563
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,417
and run away from

564
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,417
this responsibility,

565
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,000
then someday I'd be eating food,

566
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,876
taking a bath, or reading manga

567
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,500
and the moment I

568
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,500
stopped to think,

569
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:13,167
I'd go, "Oh, I

570
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:13,167
bet that right now

571
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,792
"somewhere out there, someone

572
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,792
is dying because of Sukuna."

573
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,500
But that doesn't concern me.

574
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,500
It's certainly not my fault.

575
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,542
You expect me to

576
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,542
tell myself that?

577
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:26,209
-(rock music)

578
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:26,209
-Well, I refuse to do that.

579
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,375
I don't know how I'll

580
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,375
feel when I'm dying,

581
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,209
but I won't regret

582
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,209
the way I lived.

583
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,167
Satoru, show him

584
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,167
to his dorm room.

585
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,209
Be sure to explain the

586
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,209
security

587
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,209
arrangements to him as well.

588
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:46,292
You're admitted.

589
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,250
Welcome to Jujutsu Tech.

590
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,542
(Itadori yells)

591
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,250
Sorry, I forgot to

592
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,250
release the curse.

593
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,918
[Itadori] Whoa!

594
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,083
This place is huge.

595
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,751
All the second and third

596
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,751
years are out at the moment,

597
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,125
but you'll meet them

598
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,125
all soon enough.

599
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:09,000
There aren't many of them.

600
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,584
You know, there's no real

601
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,584
reason

602
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,584
for you to go fight at all.

603
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,959
Fushiguro and I could

604
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,959
retrieve Sukuna's fingers

605
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,083
while you just stay

606
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,083
here and chill out.

607
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:20,584
Yeah, nice try, guy.

608
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,542
I said I'd do it and I will.

609
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,459
Hey, dude.

610
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,042
Though I gotta say,

611
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,250
hanging out until Fushiguro

612
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,250
comes back all beat up

613
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:31,250
just to bring me a finger,

614
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:31,250
that would be funny.

615
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,292
Yeah, but you wouldn't

616
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,292
have refused to fight.

617
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,417
I already knew that.

618
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,292
Huh, that was a test?

619
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,792
If the fingers were

620
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,792
that easy to find,

621
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:43,876
don't you think we'd have

622
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:43,876
collected them all already?

623
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,167
Some have a presence

624
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,167
that's overwhelming.

625
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,626
Some keep very quiet

626
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:50,792
and some have already been

627
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:50,792
absorbed by a curse spirit.

628
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,209
These are the challenges

629
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,209
we've dealt with

630
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,834
when it comes to

631
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,834
searching for them.

632
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:58,209
But at last we have you.

633
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,459
The Sukuna within you will

634
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,459
try to regain his power

635
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,626
and that will lead

636
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,626
us to the fingers.

637
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:07,292
You're both vessel and

638
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:07,292
locator, our very own radar.

639
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:11,209
So you see, we won't get

640
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:11,209
very far without you.

641
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:13,918
Are you sure he's going

642
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:13,918
to be that cooperative?

643
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,334
Oh, I think we can come to

644
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,334
a win-win agreement there.

645
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,500
[Fushiguro] You're next door.

646
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:20,209
Hey, Fushiguro.

647
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:23,000
Wow, you look all better now.

648
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,334
There's lots of other

649
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,334
empty rooms, you know?

650
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,792
Sure, but isn't it better

651
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,792
to have some company?

652
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:29,000
I thought it'd be good.

653
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,375
Classes and missions are enough.

654
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,000
This is not welcome.

655
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,417
Whoa, it's so organized in here.

656
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,876
Back off.

657
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:38,250
I just told you,

658
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:38,250
you're not welcome.

659
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:39,250
Ha, friends already.

660
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:43,167
And together we're

661
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:43,167
heading out tomorrow.

662
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,250
We're going to go pick up the

663
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,250
third and final first-year.

664
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,709
(train horn)

665
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,167
[PA] The train bound for

666
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,167
Tokyo is now arriving.

667
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,417
Please stand behind

668
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,417
the yellow line.

669
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,375
(Nobara grunts)

670
00:21:57,459 --> 00:22:01,209
Four hours and I'm

671
00:21:57,459 --> 00:22:01,209
still only in Morioka,

672
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:02,876
but at least I can finally kiss

673
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,751
that damn countryside goodbye.

674
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,375
And I'll be in Tokyo

675
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,375
by this afternoon.

676
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,375
What should I do

677
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,375
if I get scouted?

678
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,584
Like by Stardust?

679
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:19,417
(Closing Theme music)

680
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:27,417
(singing in Japanese)

681
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:51,500
(ominous music)
