1
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:05,500
(hissing)

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,626
(grunts)

3
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,083
(cackling)

4
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:26,626
(grunting)

5
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:38,542
Haaaa!

6
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:39,042
I've got you now!

7
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:48,876
Huh?

8
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,792
What's in that

9
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,792
blood he spits out?

10
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:52,209
Some kind of poison?

11
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,042
What's this?

12
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,459
You're too strong.

13
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:00,667
That's not very much fun at all.

14
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,209
(warbling)

15
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:06,500
Straw Doll Technique: Resonance!

16
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:12,959
(upbeat music)

17
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,250
(chittering)

18
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:28,834
Tsk! How many of them are there?

19
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:31,500
I guess we just keep going

20
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:31,500
like it's whack-a-mole, huh?

21
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:32,626
Yeah.

22
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:33,834
Keep going.

23
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:36,000
Keep on exorcising them.

24
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,751
We'll just wipe out all of them.

25
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:40,292
It's unlikely to retaliate.

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,000
I do get what you're saying...

27
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,834
Its technique

28
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,834
covers a large area,

29
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:48,042
so its main body doesn't

30
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:48,042
have much offense.

31
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,918
I just said it's unlikely.

32
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:52,292
All the things we

33
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:52,292
were worried about,

34
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:56,834
its technique's range, the

35
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:56,834
number of victims, the

36
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:56,834
barrier.

37
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:59,209
All of those are subtracting

38
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:59,209
from its main body.

39
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:01,667
So we're lucky.

40
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,167
We'll be able to exorcise

41
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,167
it quickly, then.

42
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,584
Which means, the real

43
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,584
problem comes after.

44
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,209
(gasp)

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,542
Kugisaki!

46
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:20,167
I'll be fine.

47
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,042
You just whack the mole!

48
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:28,042
Damn it!

49
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,834
She keeps getting

50
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,834
sucked into things!

51
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:33,876
But what was that just now?

52
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:34,918
The mole?

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,876
That earlier one?

54
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,626
No, it's neither!

55
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,209
Kugisaki?

56
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,667
Oh, hey, it's my older brother!

57
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:44,167
Huh?

58
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,584
Me too, me too!

59
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:49,500
Huh?

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,959
It took off!

61
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,292
Should I just let it go?

62
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,125
No, go after it!

63
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,417
Kugisaki and that thing both

64
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,417
went outside the barrier!

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,751
She might be going

66
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,751
up against something

67
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,918
even more dangerous

68
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,918
than we assumed!

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,292
By contrast, things

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,292
here aren't so bad,

71
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,209
I can handle this by myself!

72
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,709
Save Kugisaki!

73
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:10,792
Go!

74
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:13,167
Alright but if

75
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:13,167
things go bad here

76
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,667
then you follow us and get out!

77
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,375
Why, you!

78
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:26,876
Don't touch me!

79
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:35,417
I didn't realize

80
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:35,417
you were a woman.

81
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,626
But you are.

82
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:38,876
Sorry.

83
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:40,375
Yecchh.

84
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,209
We brothers were tasked with

85
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,209
a certain errand you see.

86
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,417
But killing jujutsu sorcerers

87
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,959
isn't part of that arrangement.

88
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,125
So if you withdraw

89
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,125
we'll let you escape.

90
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,292
Young woman.

91
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,417
An errand?

92
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,751
Hmm?

93
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,042
I presumed you were

94
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,042
on the same errand.

95
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,125
A cursed spirit

96
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,125
or a cursed user?

97
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:05,709
Which is he?

98
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,626
And what is that smell?

99
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,000
(monster warbling)

100
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,542
(grunting)

101
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:23,751
Last one!

102
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,292
You're not even trying.

103
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,667
This is too easy.

104
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:36,876
I told you you're

105
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:36,876
making this too easy!

106
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,083
(sigh)

107
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,542
And that's the last of them.

108
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:50,000
So Tsumiki is safe

109
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:50,000
for the moment.

110
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,918
Now, I just have to...

111
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,292
(dripping)

112
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,375
One survived?

113
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,584
So that wasn't its

114
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,584
main body after all?

115
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,042
The barrier hasn't

116
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,042
collapsed, either!

117
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,167
What the?

118
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:14,250
I shouldn't be trying

119
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:14,250
too hard to find logic

120
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,584
in a cursed spirit's

121
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,584
behavioral patterns.

122
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,709
But the fact is,

123
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:21,918
that question has been

124
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:21,918
nagging me this whole time.

125
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,876
Why did it just now

126
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,876
start killing the

127
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,792
humans it had marked?

128
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,417
The first one was

129
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,417
killed back in June.

130
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:32,417
And in June...

131
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:40,375
Our only objective here

132
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,459
is get Sukuna's finger and

133
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,459
return it to where it

134
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,459
belongs.

135
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:48,167
(evil cackle)

136
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,751
(opening theme music)

137
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,751
(singing in Japanese)

138
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:22,459
Some have a presence

139
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:22,459
that's too overwhelming.

140
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,709
Some keep very quiet.

141
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,918
Some have already been

142
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,918
absorbed by a cursed spirit.

143
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,500
This is resonance.

144
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,000
Sukuna's finger kept

145
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,000
its power repressed

146
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,834
within the cursed spirit

147
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,834
that had absorbed it.

148
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,250
But back in June, when

149
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,250
Sukuna manifested in Itadori,

150
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:42,918
it released its cursed energy.

151
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,834
This one looks the same

152
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:47,667
as the one from the

153
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:47,667
juvenile detention center,

154
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:51,375
but it's probably

155
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:51,375
several degrees

156
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:51,709
(gasp)

157
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,083
(grunt)

158
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,459
stronger!

159
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,083
(chuckle)

160
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,167
Nue!

161
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,417
Aah.

162
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,751
Guess I win again.

163
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,417
This is unusual.

164
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,417
You rarely ask me to

165
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,417
train you, Megumi.

166
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Are you trying to

167
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
catch back up to Yuji?

168
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:31,459
Well, I guess beggars

169
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:31,459
can't be choosers.

170
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,250
It really bothers you that much?

171
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:33,709
To ask me for help?

172
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:37,042
Listen, Megumi.

173
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,250
I think you have

174
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,250
just as much ability

175
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:41,125
and potential as Yuji does.

176
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:45,250
The only thing holding

177
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:45,250
you back is your mindset.

178
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,334
Megumi.

179
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,918
You don't know how to bring

180
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,918
out your best, do you?

181
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,209
Huh?

182
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,584
Are you saying I haven't

183
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,584
been giving it my best?

184
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,792
I'm not saying you haven't,

185
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,792
I'm saying you can't.

186
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:59,626
For example, in the ball game...

187
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,167
Why did you lay down

188
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,167
that sacrifice bunt?

189
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:07,292
(grunt)

190
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,959
Was it to advance the runner

191
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,500
even though it meant

192
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,500
that you'd be out?

193
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,626
That is good team play.

194
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,834
But Yuji would always go for

195
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,834
a home run, and so would I.

196
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,542
I'm not saying a bunt is bad.

197
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,083
Baseball is a team sport.

198
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,584
And everyone has

199
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,584
their role to play.

200
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:30,459
But jujutsu sorcery is

201
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:30,459
an individual sport.

202
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,959
Isn't working with the

203
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,959
other sorcerers important?

204
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,459
Of course.

205
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,209
But no matter how many

206
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,209
allies you have around you,

207
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:39,959
when you die you'll be alone.

208
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:45,542
You can only piece

209
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:45,542
together undervalued data

210
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,751
on yourself and others.

211
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:51,334
You can't imagine a stronger

212
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:51,334
future version of yourself.

213
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,667
Maybe that's because

214
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,667
of your trump card?

215
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,542
You believe that

216
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,542
in the worst case,

217
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:59,125
you can resolve everything

218
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:59,125
at the cost of your life.

219
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:02,167
But at that point,

220
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:02,167
forget about beating me.

221
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,250
You'll never even

222
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,250
measure up to Nanami.

223
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,751
Dying to win and

224
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,751
risking death to win,

225
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:13,209
are completely

226
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:13,209
different, Megumi.

227
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,167
Give it your best.

228
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,292
Be greedier.

229
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,334
How many seconds

230
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,334
was I unconscious?

231
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:34,834
My Demon Dog's destroyed.

232
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,834
No, the technique was released.

233
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:40,500
(evil cackle)

234
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:45,250
So I guess, this is it for me.

235
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,876
Sacred treasure!

236
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,083
Sacred swing!

237
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,042
Hmph.

238
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,459
Kind of a waste of your talents.

239
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,834
(light chuckle)

240
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:04,459
Oh what the hell?

241
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,751
A jujutsu sorcerer's

242
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,751
growth curve

243
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,292
isn't necessarily

244
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,292
a gentle slope.

245
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:14,876
One thing I don't get.

246
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,834
Why did you run, back then?

247
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,292
Spit out the entire

248
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,292
depths of my shadow.

249
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:24,167
Worry about a specific

250
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:24,167
structure later.

251
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,500
Just push it out as soon as

252
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,500
I collect the cursed energy.

253
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:32,250
Imagine a future

254
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:32,250
version of myself,

255
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,876
who's freely

256
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,876
surpassed my limits!

257
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,542
Oh I can do that!

258
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:39,250
[Gojo] With a strong foundation

259
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:40,792
and a little bit of

260
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:40,792
sense and imagination,

261
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:45,375
it just takes the slightest

262
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:45,375
trigger to change a person.

263
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:47,792
Domain Expansion:

264
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,375
Chimera Shadow Garden!

265
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:00,751
It's incomplete!

266
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:04,042
And it's ugly work at best!

267
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,209
But for now, that's fine!

268
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,334
Broaden it

269
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,792
more freely!

270
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,751
The interpretation

271
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,751
of the technique!

272
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:38,834
(lightning strikes)

273
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:45,167
(intense music)

274
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,876
(rising roar)

275
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,584
(giggle)

276
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,751
Demon Dog Totality's claws

277
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:04,834
were able to injure that thing.

278
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,292
So they'd have no trouble

279
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,292
piercing through you

280
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,000
when you're caught off-guard.

281
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:25,876
I'm tired.

282
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,542
Now, for the other guys.

283
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:32,626
Where'd they go?

284
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:37,417
Good!

285
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,834
That's very good!

286
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,500
(retching)

287
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:55,876
"Jujutsu Kaisen"

288
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,667
"Jujutsu Kaisen"

289
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:09,042
There's one fundamental rule

290
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:09,042
for interacting with others.

291
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,542
You know what that is?

292
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:12,876
[Bully] No I don't.

293
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:13,918
It's simple.

294
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,918
It's "I won't kill you,

295
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,209
"so in return please

296
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,209
don't kill me either."

297
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,042
Substitute any word for "kill".

298
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,417
The point is drawing a line

299
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,792
so you don't infringe

300
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,792
on the other.

301
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,626
In order for both to

302
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,626
exist together

303
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,834
they need to honor that.

304
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,626
Just strutting around

305
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,626
breaking that rule,

306
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,792
so that others have to

307
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,792
try not to piss you off

308
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,918
must have made

309
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,918
you feel powerful,

310
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,292
Next time you do it

311
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,292
around me, I'll kill you.

312
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,918
Yeah but, what did

313
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,918
we ever do to you?

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,626
Figure it out yourself or die.

315
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:50,709
[Takeda] Hey you!

316
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:55,417
T-T-T-T-Today I tell off

317
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:55,417
Ikezawa and his gang!

318
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm not gonna be their

319
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,000
stupid gofer anymore!

320
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,834
Yeah you tell 'em

321
00:14:58,918 --> 00:14:59,834
Do it!

322
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:00,834
Oh but Aida,

323
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:02,834
that's just gonna make

324
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:02,834
me their next target!

325
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,417
So do me a favor and

326
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,417
don't try too hard!

327
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,167
Oh not a chance fatty!

328
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,626
I'm done messing around!

329
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:09,834
Starting today,

330
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:09,834
I'm gonna tell 'em

331
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:11,792
you're my new replacement!

332
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,000
Dude, you'd sell out

333
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,000
your best friend?

334
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,584
You're damn right I would!

335
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:16,959
[Tsumiki] Megumi.

336
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,209
Hey, look!

337
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:25,000
Isn't that Ikezawa and his

338
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:25,000
buddies piled up over there?

339
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,167
You told me you

340
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,167
wouldn't fight anymore.

341
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah well you're not my mom.

342
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,000
I hate bad people.

343
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:38,876
They act so damn superior

344
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,500
when their empathy

345
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,500
and imagination

346
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:42,918
are as empty as a vacant lot.

347
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,334
I can't deal with

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,334
good people either.

349
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,542
Because they forgive

350
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,542
those bad people.

351
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,959
And they view the act of

352
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,959
forgiveness as a noble thing.

353
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:54,751
Makes me want to vomit.

354
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:00,626
Tsumiki's a perfect

355
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:00,626
example of a good person.

356
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:02,584
I detest you.

357
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,500
Agh! Sorry!

358
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,209
I didn't think it

359
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,209
would come out!

360
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,250
When I was in first grade

361
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,083
my father and Tsumiki's mother,

362
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,459
the two of them hooked up,

363
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:21,167
and vanished without a trace.

364
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,167
A suspicious white-haired

365
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,167
man told us...

366
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,542
The thing about your dad...

367
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:31,083
He's from a big clan among

368
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:31,083
the jujutsu sorcerers

369
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,709
called the Zen'in.

370
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,042
They're so inept

371
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,042
even I'm freaked out.

372
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,792
Your father left the clan

373
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,792
in order to have you.

374
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:39,751
Megumi.

375
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,417
Your father was saving

376
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,417
you as the ultimate card

377
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,751
to use against the Zen'in clan.

378
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,042
Pisses you off, huh?

379
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,125
That solved the mystery

380
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,417
of how they got enough

381
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,417
money to disappear.

382
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,042
Apparently, I had been

383
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,042
sold to that Zen'in clan.

384
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:58,209
And yeah, it pissed me off.

385
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,209
Especially his lack

386
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,209
of tact about it.

387
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:05,292
And that irritating guy

388
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:05,292
stopped

389
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:05,292
my sale to the Zen'in clan.

390
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,209
And used the promise

391
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,209
that I would work

392
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,125
as a jujutsu sorcerer

393
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,125
as collateral

394
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,751
in order to get financial

395
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,751
aid from Jujutsu High

396
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:13,709
to support us both.

397
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:17,959
What's this jujutsu

398
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:17,959
sorcerer crap, anyway?

399
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:20,334
It's bullshit.

400
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,375
Who the hell would I ever save?

401
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,792
Hey, Tsumiki!

402
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,792
What the hell do you

403
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,792
think you're doing?

404
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:26,876
Hi Megumi!

405
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:28,792
Oh nothing.

406
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:29,792
Hey, hold on.

407
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,792
Did you give any thought

408
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,792
to the test of courage

409
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,375
I was telling you about?

410
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,834
I don't want to do it,

411
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:37,209
but I'll go because

412
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:37,209
I'm worried about you.

413
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:40,709
Shortly after I started

414
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:40,709
ninth

415
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:40,709
grade, Tsumiki was cursed.

416
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,626
The identity was unknown.

417
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,167
The origin was unknown.

418
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,834
But there were several victims

419
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,834
of the same curse nationwide.

420
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:51,959
All I found out was that

421
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:51,959
nobody knew anything.

422
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:54,792
And Tsumiki was left in a coma.

423
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,209
If I had the time

424
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,209
to curse someone,

425
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,209
I'd rather spend it thinking

426
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,209
about people I love.

427
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:03,834
She always smiled and

428
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:03,834
spouted noble ideals.

429
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,667
Not forgiving people

430
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,667
isn't such a bad thing.

431
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,751
It just goes along

432
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,751
with your kindness.

433
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,167
She even accepted my

434
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,167
strange disposition.

435
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,209
Yet Tsumiki would

436
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,209
get genuinely angry

437
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:17,334
whenever I hurt someone.

438
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:20,209
And that irritated me,

439
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:22,834
because I thought

440
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:22,834
it was hypocritical

441
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:24,125
in light of her

442
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:24,125
leave-others-be policy.

443
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,167
But now I realize I

444
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,167
had the wrong idea.

445
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,792
Just as I choose who I save,

446
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,167
she was choosing

447
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,167
me to worry about.

448
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:37,209
I'm sorry!

449
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,792
I was just a kid!

450
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:41,918
I apologize!

451
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:47,209
So wake up already

452
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:47,209
my stupid sister!

453
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,959
Damn my head hurts!

454
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,417
This Yasohachi Bridge curse

455
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,709
was just overlapping

456
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,709
the other one.

457
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:59,209
I doubt the curse that put

458
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:59,209
Tsumiki into a coma was undone.

459
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,209
Now I just have to tell Itadori

460
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,250
the news about

461
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,250
Sukuna's finger, but...

462
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,250
How?

463
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,167
"Fushiguro Fell Asleep"

464
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,083
(shock gasps)

465
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,167
A huge presence just

466
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,167
suddenly appeared.

467
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,334
Has Sukuna's finger

468
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,334
left the barrier?

469
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:25,042
If a sorcerer exorcised

470
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:25,042
the finger's host,

471
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,834
they're quite good.

472
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,918
But even if the others

473
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,918
have the finger,

474
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,792
and even if the special-grade

475
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,792
cursed spirit was defeated,

476
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,375
they wouldn't have

477
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,375
come out unscathed.

478
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:37,792
I hope they're okay.

479
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,918
Actually, on second thought,

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,083
please forget

481
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,083
everything I just said.

482
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,918
Hold it right there!

483
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,667
Damn, he's going

484
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,667
after the finger!

485
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,083
You think you can mock me?

486
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,417
Dancing around like that

487
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,417
and still getting away?

488
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,083
The thing is I'm a bit

489
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,083
insecure about my back

490
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,083
so it's only fair

491
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,083
that I warn you.

492
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,959
If you see my back,

493
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,959
I'll be forced to ki--

494
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:03,375
Oh!

495
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:05,709
Kugisaki!

496
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:06,209
Oh here you are, brother!

497
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,292
(screams)

498
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,375
-What the hell is that?

499
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,375
-Oh I'm sorry brother!

500
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:18,584
It wasn't on purpose!

501
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:18,584
I didn't mean to see that!

502
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:19,334
Now I have to kill you!

503
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,375
That must be the source

504
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,375
of that weird smell.

505
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:31,125
Why don't you just cover it up?

506
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,584
'Cause then it gets musty!

507
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,167
Rot Technique!

508
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,292
Supreme Art!

509
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:40,626
Wing King!

510
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,459
Death by Wasp!

511
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,417
(ending theme music)

512
00:20:56,709 --> 00:21:00,709
(singing in Japanese)

513
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,542
[Unison] Juju Stroll!

514
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,417
Gojo!

515
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,292
Kugisaki!

516
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,542
(annoyed sigh)

517
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:27,417
So annoying.

518
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,918
It's way too hot out here

519
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,918
for your nonsense, Itadori.

520
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,250
Fushiguro is getting hit on!

521
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:35,292
Formation B!

522
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,542
[Unison] Roger that!

523
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,042
[Both] Fushiguro, no!

524
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,417
Who is this woman, Fushiguro?

525
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,250
Don't tell me you've

526
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,250
forgotten that night?

527
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:44,959
That special night

528
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:44,959
we had together

529
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:46,626
when you looked longingly at me

530
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:49,626
and made that toast to

531
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:49,626
the beauty of my eyes!

532
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:52,167
Whoa, what's with you?

533
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,125
Seriously, you two?

534
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:56,125
Could you please take

535
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:56,125
your hands off him?

536
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,959
You homewreckers!

537
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,459
Megumi has violin

538
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,459
practice with me now.

539
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,417
Let's get you back home,

540
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,417
Megumi, so you can warm up.

541
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:05,417
Today I think we'll

542
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:05,417
try something new,

543
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,584
and I'll have you master

544
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,584
"Twinkle Twinkle Little

545
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,584
Star."

546
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:12,375
It's okay, don't mind them.

547
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,792
The station's straight ahead.

548
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:14,792
Just go that way.

549
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:16,375
Thank you so much.

550
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:18,292
[Unison] Huh?

551
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,792
Okay, seriously, what's up?

552
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:22,834
You three are totally

553
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:22,834
embarrassing me.

554
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:28,125
Stop doing that!

555
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:30,792
(embarrassed laugh)

556
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,417
(upbeat music)

557
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:40,709
"Episode 24: The Origin

558
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:40,709
of Blind Obedience"
