1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,751
(peaceful guitar music)

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,626
[Boy] What?

3
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:12,209
The Super Scary Movie

4
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:12,209
series went up to Five?

5
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:14,584
Seven in fact!

6
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:15,709
For real?

7
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,417
Whoa! Then the seventh one

8
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,417
must be really out there!

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,584
Yeah!

10
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:22,042
It turned into a completely

11
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:22,042
different thing by Seven.

12
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,959
It's not just a parody anymore.

13
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,083
What kind of movie is it then?

14
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,584
[Junpei] Hmm...

15
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,209
Like a convoluted sitcom,

16
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,209
plus lineage horror, maybe?

17
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:32,209
[Friend] Huh? What do you means?

18
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,542
[Junpei] By a total fluke,

19
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:36,417
the grandchild of the

20
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:36,417
main character from One

21
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,042
ends up living in a shared house

22
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,042
with the grandchild of

23
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,042
the culprit from Two

24
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,918
and the grandchild of the

25
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,918
first person who died in

26
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,918
Three.

27
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,792
But it turns out

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,792
it's a haunted house,

29
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,459
so they call in a spirit medium.

30
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:47,083
That's pretty much the plot.

31
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:50,250
Okay. Sounds like a bore.

32
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,083
[Junpei] It bored me to death!

33
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,083
So who would watch that?

34
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:55,334
There was one cool thing.

35
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,250
The guy from five

36
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,250
and six was in-

37
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,626
(door opens)

38
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:01,292
Huh? What are you doing in here?

39
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,459
Didn't I tell you

40
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,459
this room was ours now

41
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:05,500
and to stay the hell out of it?

42
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,292
(gasps)

43
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,292
Yeah, well...

44
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,792
But you haven't been using

45
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,792
it for weeks, so I...

46
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:11,792
I just thought it

47
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:11,792
would be all right!

48
00:01:11,876 --> 00:01:13,459
(slam)

49
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,542
(gasps)

50
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,083
[Itou] So...

51
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,042
So, well, I, um...

52
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,000
(slam)

53
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,417
(gasps)

54
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,042
Just get your asses out of

55
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,042
here already, you cockroaches!

56
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:27,834
Come on, Yoshino.

57
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,292
[Itou] Next time we

58
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,292
catch you in here,

59
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,459
we'll send you flying!

60
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:34,459
(phone beeps)

61
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:35,459
[Nishimura] Oh yeah, score!

62
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:37,417
Hey, Junpei, just forget it!

63
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,292
(sighs)

64
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,125
What now?

65
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:44,167
[Junpei] That belongs to me.

66
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,459
[Itou] So?

67
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,167
(tense music)

68
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:56,292
[Junpei] So...

69
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,417
move your foot.

70
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:02,792
[Friend] Junpei, just let it go!

71
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,167
No, this belongs to me.

72
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,626
Take your foot off of it.

73
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:11,292
(whimpering)

74
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,083
(slam)

75
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,083
-Oh damn!

76
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,083
-Oh shit!

77
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,125
(dramatic music)

78
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,542
(breathing heavily)

79
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:21,876
-Okay!

80
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:21,876
-I'm outta here!

81
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:22,250
Okay, okay, we're going!

82
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:29,709
(pats shoulder)

83
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,375
Close the door.

84
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,584
[Honda] Roger that.

85
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,209
(laughs)

86
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,209
(breathing heavily)

87
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:49,083
-(pounding)

88
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:49,083
-(grunting)

89
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:55,083
(Opening Theme Music)

90
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:13,500
(singing in Japanese)

91
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,334
(water dripping)

92
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,292
[Junpei] I wonder if

93
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,292
the first person to say

94
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,042
"the opposite of

95
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,042
fondness is indifference"

96
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,959
went to hell like

97
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,959
they should have.

98
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:43,834
Purposely treating people

99
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:43,834
with malice is never right.

100
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,292
A better choice would be

101
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,292
to just leave them alone.

102
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:51,375
"The opposite of

103
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:51,375
fondness is hate."

104
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,167
Japanese people love that idea.

105
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,167
They're proud to

106
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,167
take a simple answer

107
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,584
and make it complicated.

108
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,709
[Mahito] The man who coined

109
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,709
that phrase wasn't Japanese.

110
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:05,417
I'm talking about the

111
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:05,417
mistaken translation.

112
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,542
[Mahito] Hmm?

113
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,417
[Junpei] The original saying,

114
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,876
as it was first spoken

115
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,876
by some foreigner, was:

116
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,375
"the opposite of love

117
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,375
is indifference," right?

118
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,167
There are lots of different

119
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,167
definitions of love,

120
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,375
so it seems to me

121
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,375
that indifference

122
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:22,417
actually works as

123
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:22,417
an antonym there.

124
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,542
Yes, true.

125
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,709
But we generally don't use

126
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,709
the word "love" very much.

127
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,083
So I guess that's

128
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,083
why in this country,

129
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,375
it got changed to

130
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,375
"fondness" at some point.

131
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,375
Then that version spread

132
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,375
without any thought

133
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,918
as to whether the

134
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,918
opposing definitions...

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
of love and indifference

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
still held true.

137
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,083
Well, everyone enjoys

138
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,083
a little wordplay.

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,542
And after all, humans can't live

140
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:50,209
without making up

141
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:50,209
excuses for everything.

142
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,667
(eerie music)

143
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,209
What's this?

144
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,083
It was an experiment

145
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,083
to see just how large

146
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,000
I could make a single human.

147
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,459
I made the one you're holding

148
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,417
as an experiment to see how

149
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,417
small I could make them.

150
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:12,626
Are you saying...

151
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,209
this is...

152
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,334
a human?

153
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,542
[Mahito] Do corpses

154
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,542
bother you, Junpei?

155
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,417
I don't know.

156
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,334
If you had done this to

157
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,334
my mother, well then...

158
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:29,709
I might lose control

159
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:29,709
and end up hating you.

160
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:34,292
But I already know how

161
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:34,292
repulsive humans can be.

162
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,500
That's why I don't

163
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,500
expect much of anything

164
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:38,626
from other people.

165
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,542
Nor do I think much of it when

166
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,542
someone I don't know dies.

167
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:46,375
It's indifference.

168
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,500
That's the virtue one

169
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,500
ought to strive for.

170
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:54,125
Yet you want revenge...

171
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,042
despite that.

172
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,083
Do you see a conflict?

173
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,083
Between the two?

174
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,083
Do you believe human

175
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,083
beings have hearts?

176
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:07,500
Huh? Why, don't they?

177
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,375
[Mahito] No, they don't.

178
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:15,167
They have souls, but

179
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:15,167
souls aren't hearts.

180
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,709
That can't be right!

181
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,292
I'm the only person

182
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,292
in this world

183
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,167
who knows the

184
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,167
soul's composition.

185
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,000
After all, I change the

186
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,000
shape of other creatures

187
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,792
by making contact with them.

188
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:32,292
All emotions are the result

189
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:32,292
of the soul's metabolism.

190
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,584
They're far too

191
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,584
mechanical to call hearts.

192
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,542
People place too much value

193
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,542
on things they can't see.

194
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,542
I can see them, and

195
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,542
souls are no more special

196
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:46,042
than physical bodies.

197
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,542
They're just there.

198
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,542
Do you understand?

199
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:52,042
There's no value or

200
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:52,042
importance to life.

201
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,042
Life just continues its cycle,

202
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,542
same as the waters of the world.

203
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:58,500
That's true for both you and me.

204
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:01,542
Our lives are meaningless

205
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:01,542
and have no value.

206
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,834
And that's why we can

207
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,834
do anything we want.

208
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,000
We're free to live our

209
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,000
lives however we please.

210
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,042
(gurgling)

211
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:12,918
Don't let yourself get trapped

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
by some ideal concept

213
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
of indifference.

214
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:20,834
There's no need for

215
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:20,834
consistency

216
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:20,834
in living your life.

217
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,459
Just as you eat

218
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,459
when you get hungry,

219
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,250
so it is that if you

220
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,250
hate someone

221
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,626
you can simply kill them.

222
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,542
I'll sanction you fully.

223
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,542
(crumbles)

224
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,667
(emotional music)

225
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,959
(birds whistling)

226
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,667
[Kiyotaka] There he is.

227
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:57,626
[Yuuji] Huh.

228
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:57,626
Where's his uniform?

229
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,542
It looks like he hasn't

230
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,542
been attending school

231
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:01,834
for some time.

232
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,375
Well I guess you could

233
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,375
say the same for me too.

234
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,626
So, hey, how's everyone doing?

235
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,792
(yelling)

236
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:12,667
[Man] Tuna!

237
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:15,667
From what I hear,

238
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:15,667
they're doing quite well.

239
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:19,209
So what do we do now?

240
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:21,584
We're going to use that.

241
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:22,584
Huh?

242
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,667
Is that a cursed spirit?

243
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,584
It's a fly-head,

244
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,584
alow-level curse

245
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,834
that doesn't even

246
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,834
qualify as a grade Four.

247
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:32,292
When there are no people around,

248
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,167
we'll release this

249
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,167
curse to attack him.

250
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,459
Huh?

251
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,417
[Kiyotaka] Then one of

252
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,417
four things will happen.

253
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,918
One, if he's a normal person

254
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,918
who can't even see curses,

255
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,292
you will please save him.

256
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,792
Two, if he can

257
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,792
perceive the curse

258
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,334
but has no means to deal

259
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,334
with it, then likewise...

260
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:51,459
save him please.

261
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,459
Afterwards we'll question him

262
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,459
about the theater incident.

263
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,709
Three, if he exorcizes the

264
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:57,709
fly head with jujutsu...

265
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,167
then we immediately

266
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,167
restrain him.

267
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,834
Restrain him how?

268
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,334
By whatever force necessary.

269
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,042
If it's all a misunderstanding,

270
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,334
we'll apologize after the fact.

271
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,792
However...

272
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,417
Four, if Junpei Yoshino

273
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,417
has potential equal

274
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,792
to a grade Two sorcerer...

275
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:18,042
then we retreat and

276
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:18,042
report to Nanami.

277
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,959
From what I've

278
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,959
seen, I'm thinking

279
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,792
I can just handle a grade Two.

280
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:23,667
Not in this case.

281
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:26,375
[Yuuji] Hm?

282
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,667
[Kiyotaka] Fushiguro

283
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,667
might have mentioned this

284
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,000
to you before.

285
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,751
Typically, cursed

286
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,751
spirits are assigned

287
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,667
to sorcerers of equal grade.

288
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,834
That means a grade Two

289
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,834
sorcerer would be expected

290
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:39,667
to beat grade Two

291
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:39,667
cursed spirits.

292
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,000
So a grade Two sorcerer

293
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,000
possesses strength

294
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,125
close to a grade

295
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,125
One cursed spirit.

296
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,500
Why the hell wasn't I ever told

297
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:49,042
something as important as that?

298
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,042
[Kiyotaka] Because

299
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,042
Gojou is irresponsible!

300
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,667
(sighs)

301
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,375
We'll get out and

302
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,375
walk from here.

303
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,500
I have to tell you

304
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:04,042
it feels like I'm the one

305
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:04,042
doing all the work here.

306
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,167
(suspenseful music)

307
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,751
(dripping)

308
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:16,375
If you plan to come out,

309
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:16,375
please hurry up and do so.

310
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,792
They may be disfigured

311
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,792
and beyond saving...

312
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,667
but murdering people

313
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,667
still makes me sick.

314
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,709
Ah, what a relief.

315
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:34,250
I'd be in trouble if

316
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:34,250
Satoru Gojou were here.

317
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:35,918
Although the experiment

318
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:35,918
won't really work

319
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,209
if you're too weak.

320
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,876
I hate putting in overtime

321
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,876
if I don't have to.

322
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,250
So let's finish this quickly.

323
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:48,125
(energetic music)

324
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:56,876
(laughing)

325
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:02,209
[Satoru] I'll murder you!

326
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,959
[Kento] They're similar.

327
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:07,667
They both have that same

328
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:07,667
picture-perfect frivolity

329
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,459
with the sinister

330
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,459
strength behind it.

331
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,959
(splashing)

332
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,375
(grunting)

333
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:24,959
(laughs)

334
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:27,375
(grunting)

335
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,000
Huh?

336
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,334
I blocked it with cursed

337
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,334
energy, I thought.

338
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:36,834
Was that your technique?

339
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,584
What do you mean?

340
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,125
I hate abstract questions

341
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:44,626
that leave interpretation

342
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:44,626
up to others.

343
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,125
That's good.

344
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,083
But you don't hate

345
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,083
chatting evidently.

346
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,500
Not at this time.

347
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,709
This cursed spirit

348
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,709
converses quite well.

349
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:56,167
Just like the two unregistered

350
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,375
special grades in

351
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,375
Gojou's report.

352
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,626
It would seem highly likely

353
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,626
that there's some connection.

354
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,542
[Mahito] Hey, tell me...

355
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:10,000
which do you think came

356
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:10,000
first, the soul or the body?

357
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,167
[Kento] Hm?

358
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,167
Come on. You know.

359
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,375
It's just like the age-old

360
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,375
chicken-or-the-egg question.

361
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:17,834
Which of them came first?

362
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,375
Do you think the soul

363
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,375
resides in the body,

364
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,542
or do you think it's

365
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,542
the other way around

366
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:27,042
and the body forms

367
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:27,042
around the soul?

368
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,334
[Kento] I suppose I

369
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,334
have to listen to this.

370
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,167
The former.

371
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,417
Uh-uh.

372
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,542
It's the second one.

373
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:41,667
The soul comes first and

374
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:41,667
so exists before the body.

375
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:44,209
The shape of the body is

376
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:44,209
therefore always determined

377
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:44,876
by the shape of the soul.

378
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm not healing now.

379
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,500
I'm just maintaining the

380
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,500
shape of my own soul.

381
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,918
You understand now, don't you?

382
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,876
My technique is to make

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,876
contact with the soul,

384
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,709
and then alter its shape.

385
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:03,459
Idle Transfiguration!

386
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:07,792
(gasps)

387
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:10,876
I keep a human stockpile.

388
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,500
It's been difficult though.

389
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,500
Normal people die soon after

390
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,500
their shape is transfigured.

391
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,083
I wonder if jujutsu

392
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,083
sorcerers last longer.

393
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,751
It's 5:30 now, and I began

394
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,751
my day at 10:00 this morning,

395
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,375
so I'm quitting at 6:00,

396
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,459
regardless of what that

397
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,459
requires.

398
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
[Sotomura] Yoshino!

399
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,042
Huh?

400
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,125
Where were ya today?

401
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:45,459
(groans)

402
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:48,667
Missed you at school. You

403
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:48,667
shouldn't be skipping class.

404
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:50,751
Of course, sir. I know that.

405
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:55,250
Anyway, did you hear about

406
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:55,250
those theater murders?

407
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:56,209
It's all over the news.

408
00:14:56,292 --> 00:15:00,000
Sayama, Nishimura and

409
00:14:56,292 --> 00:15:00,000
Honda are all dead!

410
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,125
(gasps)

411
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,459
(cackling)

412
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,417
You were friends with all

413
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,417
three

414
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,417
of those boys, weren't you?

415
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,292
They spent time with you

416
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,959
when you had no

417
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,959
other friends, right?

418
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:10,834
But you didn't go

419
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:10,834
to their funerals.

420
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:12,918
[Junpei] Friends?

421
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,626
Me...

422
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:15,834
and them?

423
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:17,918
He must be insane.

424
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,542
You teachers...

425
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:23,167
You graduate from school,

426
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,292
and then you go to work

427
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,292
in those same schools.

428
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,042
So you never actually

429
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,042
experience

430
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,042
the real world, do you?

431
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,125
That's how we end up

432
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,125
with overgrown children

433
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,667
like you in charge, isn't it?

434
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,876
Here! Say "Ah"!

435
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,876
(cackles)

436
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,167
[Junpei] It's true of

437
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,167
every last one of them!

438
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,083
Smile! Say cheese!

439
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,292
[Mahito] You can

440
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,292
simply kill them.

441
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,125
I'll sanction you fully.

442
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,959
(gasps)

443
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,542
What in the world are you

444
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,542
mumbling about, Junpei?

445
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:55,959
Did self-isolation

446
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:55,959
fry your brain?

447
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:59,500
(laughs)

448
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,542
(gasps)

449
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,417
(dramatic music)

450
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,167
[Yuuji] Stop!

451
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,167
(yelling)

452
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,334
[Junpei] What the hell is that?

453
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:10,334
Whoa!

454
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,167
This guy...

455
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,417
can see the curse!

456
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,083
(shouts)

457
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,918
(grunts)

458
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,918
Ow! That freakin' hurt!

459
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,000
Look around.

460
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,542
Here we go, Itadori!

461
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:27,375
Time out! There's someone there!

462
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,375
Huh?

463
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:29,500
Oh, no!

464
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That was close!

465
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,417
What's this? Where

466
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,417
did you come from?

467
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,000
Hey, I've got a few things

468
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,000
I'd like to ask you about.

469
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,542
Got a sec?

470
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,250
Uh, I was...

471
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,042
[Yuuji] Come with me.

472
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,042
[Junpei] That button!

473
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,042
[Sotomura] Hold on,

474
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,626
Junpei and I were

475
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,626
having a conversation!

476
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:48,959
Don't be rude!

477
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:52,792
Ah, well, this concerns

478
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:52,792
something rather important.

479
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:53,500
What's important?

480
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,918
You're just another stupid kid!

481
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,250
And what kind of uniform is-

482
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:58,250
(shouts)

483
00:16:58,334 --> 00:16:59,792
(yells)

484
00:16:58,334 --> 00:16:59,792
Hey!

485
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:00,792
(gasps)

486
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:01,918
(yells)

487
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,250
What the hell do you think

488
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,250
you're doing, you brat?

489
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:05,083
Let go of my pants!

490
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,876
No, don't!

491
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,459
Stop! Get back here with those!

492
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,584
Come back! Wait!

493
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,167
(energetic music)

494
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,209
What was that all about?

495
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,209
Huh?

496
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,167
Okay, let's talk!

497
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,083
[Junpei] You went around

498
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,083
the block already?

499
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,209
That was fast!

500
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,459
Yeah.

501
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,626
You didn't have to go

502
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,626
to all that trouble.

503
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,167
You could have just

504
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,167
dragged me away.

505
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,125
[Yuuji] Yeah, sure,

506
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,125
I guess I could have.

507
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:36,709
But you hate that

508
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:36,709
guy, don't you?

509
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,667
Huh?

510
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:39,167
How did you...

511
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,083
Oh, just a hunch.

512
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,167
Or am I wrong?

513
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,083
[Junpei] No, you're not wrong.

514
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,626
You don't want someone you hate

515
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:49,292
hanging around outside

516
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:49,292
your house now do you?

517
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,792
So how 'bout we take a walk?

518
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,042
Sure.

519
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:02,792
(intense music)

520
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:09,876
(grunts)

521
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,209
Your speed's impressive.

522
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,417
(shouts)

523
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:26,042
This is so fun!

524
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,334
[Kento] So the person's

525
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,334
original mass is irrelevant

526
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,334
when it comes to

527
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,334
changing their shape.

528
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:36,626
Either way, it's a bad

529
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:36,626
match-up for my technique.

530
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,542
Please, help me!

531
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,250
There's nothing you can do

532
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,500
to save someone once

533
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,500
they're reshaped.

534
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:52,000
If they start to attack,

535
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:52,000
you must kill them.

536
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,876
It's better for the

537
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,876
victims that way.

538
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,751
Ah, yeah, sorry about that.

539
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,209
I had to really

540
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,209
practice a lot...

541
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:04,083
so they wouldn't die right

542
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:04,083
away when I changed their

543
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:04,083
size.

544
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,083
And yet...

545
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,167
do they know?

546
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,876
I don't know precisely

547
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,876
how aware they are.

548
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:13,375
And as a result sometimes

549
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:13,375
their

550
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:13,375
souls sweat like that one.

551
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:14,834
Don't let that worry you.

552
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:18,250
[Kento] I'm not

553
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:18,250
worried about it.

554
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:25,918
It's my policy not to bring

555
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:25,918
personal feelings into my

556
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:25,918
work.

557
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,417
(laughing)

558
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,334
You suck at lying!

559
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,042
Your whole soul is trembling!

560
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,125
So you're...

561
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:33,125
what grade?

562
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,375
[Kento] Grade One.

563
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:37,584
No wonder you're strong.

564
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,792
You'll make the

565
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,792
perfect test subject.

566
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,459
Luck's really on my side.

567
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:45,417
I'm grateful.

568
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:49,042
(groaning)

569
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:54,584
Are you surprised my

570
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:54,584
speed suddenly increased?

571
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,834
The fact is I can alter the

572
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,834
shape of my own soul, too.

573
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:00,375
Jujutsu sorcerers can

574
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:00,375
protect their bodies

575
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:04,250
with cursed energy, but they

576
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:04,250
aren't protecting their

577
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:04,250
souls.

578
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:08,042
For starters, you have to

579
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:08,042
be aware of your own soul.

580
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,792
It's not possible to

581
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,792
protect it if you're not.

582
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,417
But it looks to me like you

583
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,417
subconsciously covered your

584
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,417
soul

585
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,959
somewhat with cursed energy.

586
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:19,083
If you hadn't done that you'd

587
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:19,083
already be under my control.

588
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,167
Though, once I touch

589
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,167
you a few more times

590
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,334
you will cease to

591
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,334
be human anymore!

592
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,918
(grunts)

593
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:34,375
I'm not letting you go!

594
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:52,626
Was that it, grade One sorcerer?

595
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,292
You did well running around,

596
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,500
but you're at your

597
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,500
limit now, aren't you?

598
00:20:57,292 --> 00:21:00,125
(ticking)

599
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:02,334
(sighs)

600
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,751
Unfortunately...

601
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:07,792
[Mahito] What?

602
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,792
His cursed energy's increasing?

603
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,292
Thanks to you...

604
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,584
I'm going to have

605
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,584
to go into overtime.

606
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:19,959
(Closing Theme Music)

607
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:27,751
(singing in Japanese)

608
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,375
[Group] Juju Stroll!

609
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:49,375
(light percussive music)

610
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:51,083
Fushiguro!

611
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:52,918
Seen my uniform jacket?

612
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,459
I haven't.

613
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,751
Whoa, that's so weird!

614
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:56,500
I left it right here.

615
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,584
Oh!

616
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,584
Hey Panda?

617
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,042
Have you seen my

618
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,042
jacket anywhere?

619
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,250
Hm...

620
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:04,626
No, sorry...

621
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:08,250
Okay...

622
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:10,792
I wonder where it

623
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:10,792
could have gone.

624
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:14,334
-(shouts)

625
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:14,334
-(grunts)

626
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:18,500
Hey! My skirt's not here

627
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:18,500
either, you clothing klepto!

628
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:20,083
Now you've gone too far!

629
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:23,584
[Toge] Mustard leaf!

630
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,667
(snarling)

631
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:29,250
[Nobara] You're both trash!

632
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:30,792
Bonito flakes!

633
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,792
[Megumi] What am I looking at?

634
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:33,792
Huh?

635
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:35,042
What the?

636
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,667
This is Maki's skirt!

637
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,834
Hey, check me out!

638
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:43,209
I'm Nobara Kuuugisaki!

639
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:46,292
(laughing)

640
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,083
(dramatic music)
