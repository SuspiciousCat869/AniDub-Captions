1
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:04,626
Was that it, grade One sorcerer?

2
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:06,417
You did well running around,

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,667
but you're at your

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,667
limit now, aren't you?

5
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:14,042
(resigned sigh)

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,542
Unfortunately...

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,751
What?

8
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:21,751
His cursed energy's increasing?

9
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:23,709
Thanks to you.

10
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:26,959
I'm going to have

11
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:26,959
to go into overtime.

12
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,083
Overtime?

13
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,959
A time-based pact!

14
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,083
Was he limiting his own

15
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,083
cursed energy until now?

16
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:38,500
So much fun!

17
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,918
My cursed technique draws

18
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,918
a line along the target

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,709
and using a ratio

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,709
of seven to three,

21
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:49,792
then creates a weak point

22
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:49,792
at exactly that location.

23
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,083
I can create this

24
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,083
line along more

25
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:55,459
than just their full

26
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:55,459
height or wingspan.

27
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:57,918
And I can designate it

28
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:57,918
along various parts,

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,959
such as the head, upper

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,959
arm, forearm, and so on.

31
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,459
This cursed technique can affect

32
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:07,709
more than just living

33
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:07,709
creatures, as well.

34
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,542
He's revealing his technique?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,626
You're serious huh?

36
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:17,792
At present--

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,918
The first way I can see

38
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,918
to exorcise this cursed

39
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,918
spirit

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,167
is to continue damaging him

41
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,209
until he runs out

42
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,209
of cursed energy.

43
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:29,417
However, that's not

44
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:29,417
sustainable for me.

45
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:33,209
The second way is to

46
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:33,209
reduce him to smithereens

47
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:34,542
with a single blow.

48
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,209
Ratio Technique: Collapse!

49
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,334
What power!

50
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,500
And was that really

51
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,500
cursed energy I felt,

52
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:44,667
racing through it!

53
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:46,209
No way!

54
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:47,876
It's an expanded technique

55
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,667
that imbues the destroyed

56
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,667
target with cursed energy!

57
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,542
And, it's a wide-range attack

58
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:54,709
that probably puts

59
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:54,709
him at risk, too.

60
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:55,375
So...

61
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,792
I guess I should dodge this!

62
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,626
I'm going to withdraw.

63
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,375
You should get that

64
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,375
leg healed up quickly.

65
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:10,667
If we're both still alive,

66
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:10,667
let's meet up again.

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,042
Huh.

68
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:14,667
Huh?

69
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:21,876
(Opening Theme Music)

70
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:50,417
"Episode 11: Narrow-minded"

71
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,417
Huh?

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,250
Did the ground just shake?

73
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,167
Yeah, it did.

74
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,083
Intensity Two or so?

75
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,209
(phone ringing)

76
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,167
Damn it!

77
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,500
Ijichi's not answering!

78
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,459
I probably shouldn't

79
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,459
even talk to you.

80
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:07,626
Hm?

81
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:08,500
Is it really okay for me

82
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:11,626
to be asking him

83
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:11,626
questions like this?

84
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,584
How much am I allowed to reveal

85
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,584
about Jujutsu Tech, anyway?

86
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,125
[Phone Voice] The

87
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,125
person you have called,

88
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,459
is not available at this time.

89
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:20,834
[Itadori] Pick up, damn it!

90
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,125
(laughing chittering,

91
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,125
warbling sounds)

92
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,292
Come back here you little curse!

93
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,834
Ahh, I can't believe that guy!

94
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:28,751
What's going on?

95
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,334
[Junpei] A button

96
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,334
with a swirl on it.

97
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,334
So.

98
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:34,292
If you happen to meet

99
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:34,292
someone wearing a button

100
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,292
with a swirl like this,

101
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,292
then be friendly to them.

102
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,375
Because they're

103
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,375
jujutsu sorcerers.

104
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,375
I'm sure you'll find

105
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,375
that you get along.

106
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,125
But, the jujutsu sorcerers

107
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,125
are Mahito's enemies,

108
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:48,125
aren't they?

109
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,500
Aaargghh, forget it!

110
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:50,209
I'm just going to ask!

111
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:51,500
So then.

112
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:55,125
You were there in the theater

113
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:55,125
the day those guys got killed.

114
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,083
Huh?

115
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:57,459
Did you happen to see anything?

116
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,375
Maybe a weird little

117
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,375
thing like this?

118
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,751
Uhh.

119
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,751
No.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,542
Afraid not.

121
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:05,042
I've just started seeing

122
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:05,042
those things recently.

123
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,918
Gotcha.

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,250
Well I've got nothing

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,250
else to ask you then!

126
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:10,375
That was all?

127
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,042
But if you don't mind

128
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,876
could you wait until

129
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,876
the other guy shows up?

130
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,500
He's kinda like my boss.

131
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,542
Okay sure.

132
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:18,626
Cool, thanks!

133
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,584
So, what was showing

134
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,584
at that theater?

135
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,834
It was a repeat screening

136
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,834
of an old movie.

137
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:26,334
But I doubt you've

138
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:26,334
ever heard of it.

139
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,042
Aaaah, come on, try me.

140
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:31,042
[Junpei] Human Earthworm Three.

141
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,334
That movie was super boring!

142
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,918
I got punched so many

143
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,918
times over that one.

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,709
You got punched?

145
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:39,417
It was boring.

146
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,292
But after all it's

147
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,292
just a splatter film.

148
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,918
So maybe it's our own fault

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,083
for expecting it to

150
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,083
deliver any more than that.

151
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:45,542
Mm-hmm.

152
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:47,751
But Two.

153
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,083
Two was actually a pretty

154
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,083
good one wasn't it?

155
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:51,709
Yeah!

156
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:52,876
Yeah it was!

157
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,083
It was the only one you

158
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,083
could actually enjoy!

159
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:55,500
[Itadori] What do

160
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:55,500
you mean enjoy?

161
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,584
We've got him.

162
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,209
Well, you probably have

163
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,209
to watch the whole series

164
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,375
one after the other

165
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,375
to really get it.

166
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,959
[Junpei] At first glance,

167
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,959
Human Earthworm Two

168
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:05,209
looks like it's not

169
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:05,209
going to be any different

170
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:06,918
from One or Three.

171
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,542
But, in the end, it captures

172
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,542
the changing emotions

173
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:12,209
of the perfectionist

174
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:12,209
who abandons everything.

175
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,709
(fright gasp)

176
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:14,876
[Man] Mama.

177
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,000
[Itadori] Ah, so that's

178
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,000
why I was able to get

179
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,209
-through Two.

180
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,209
-Why, Mom?

181
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,459
At first, I couldn't

182
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,459
understand

183
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,459
what was so good about it.

184
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,334
So I watched it

185
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,334
three more times.

186
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,417
And that wasn't easy

187
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
'cause the gory scenes

188
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
are pretty realistic.

189
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:30,459
You're really serious about it.

190
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,459
Do you like movies, Itadori?

191
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:36,334
Well, I've had a reason to watch

192
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:39,167
a lot more of them lately.

193
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,500
But I haven't been going

194
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,500
to theaters to see them.

195
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:42,751
Wait, why not?

196
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,125
The emotional impact of seeing

197
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:46,125
a good movie at the

198
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:46,125
theater is huge.

199
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:48,751
Even if on-demand ones

200
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:48,751
are more convenient.

201
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,584
I can't even remember

202
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,584
the last time I did that.

203
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:54,125
You should take me the

204
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:54,125
next time you go to one.

205
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,250
Huh?

206
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,042
[Itadori] Oh, you

207
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,042
need my number?

208
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,167
Go ahead.

209
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,042
Wait, how do I

210
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,042
add friends again?

211
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,459
[Nagi] Oh Junpei!

212
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,834
there you are.

213
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:08,042
[Junpei] Mom?

214
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,375
How unusual to see you out here.

215
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,667
That a friend of yours?

216
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:12,500
Actually we just met.

217
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:15,292
Yeah, but we have

218
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:15,292
a lot in common!

219
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,459
So I think we're

220
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,459
gonna be good friends!

221
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,542
Really?

222
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:20,500
Well, I hope the two of

223
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:20,500
you become fast friends.

224
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,500
[Junpei] Mom!

225
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:22,626
Hm?

226
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,459
We agreed...

227
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:28,459
You promised me

228
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:28,459
you'd quit smoking.

229
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,292
Oh, right, sorry.

230
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,959
I did promise not to smoke

231
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,959
in front of you anymore.

232
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,834
So what's your friend's name?

233
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:37,751
I'm Yuuji Itadori.

234
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:40,876
You know, you look

235
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:40,876
weird with green onions.

236
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,042
Oh, you think so?

237
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,584
I don't really wanna be a

238
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,584
green onions type of woman!

239
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:45,709
What are you talking about?

240
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:48,709
[Nagi] Yuuji, would you

241
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:48,709
care to join us for dinner?

242
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:49,417
Wha-?

243
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:49,417
No, mom!

244
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,417
Quit bothering him!

245
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Oh yeah?

246
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:53,667
Are you saying my

247
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:53,667
cooking is a bother?

248
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:55,500
-Huh?

249
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:55,500
-Hm?

250
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,250
"Rumble"

251
00:07:58,334 --> 00:07:59,876
Are there any foods

252
00:07:58,334 --> 00:07:59,876
you don't like,

253
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,417
or anything you're allergic to?

254
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,542
[Itadori] Nope!

255
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,209
("hoo boy!" whistle)

256
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:17,500
Huh?

257
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,918
(laughter)

258
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,292
It turns out that sorcerer

259
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,709
is a whole lot

260
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,709
crazier than he looks.

261
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,918
The two of you went

262
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,918
at it quite hard.

263
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,918
Getou!

264
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,542
That guy was interesting.

265
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,459
I learned a whole lot from him.

266
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,667
Oh?

267
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,667
I learned even if I'm pulverized

268
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,626
I won't die as long as I

269
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,626
maintain my soul shape.

270
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:42,167
Cursed energy consumption

271
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:42,167
counts toward supplementation.

272
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,709
It looks like there's

273
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,709
really no risk to me.

274
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,584
No matter how much I tweak

275
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,584
the shape of my own soul.

276
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:50,375
Next time I'll let loose

277
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:50,375
and try all kinds of things.

278
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,375
Getou.

279
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:51,751
Some clothes?

280
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,918
No, sorry.

281
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,083
Where'd your opponent go?

282
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,083
I don't know.

283
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,250
He just told me he

284
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,250
was going to withdraw.

285
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:00,959
But he might've gotten buried.

286
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,334
What?

287
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,209
You're at Junpei

288
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,209
Yoshino's house?

289
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:05,918
That's a bit risky!

290
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,959
[Itadori] I know, but it's fine.

291
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,626
Gotta go, we're

292
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,626
about to have dinner.

293
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,167
You're having dinner?

294
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,959
I'll head over to you at once.

295
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:16,000
If you sense trouble, get

296
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:16,000
out of there immediately.

297
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,959
Even if Junpei was involved

298
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,959
in the theater murders,

299
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,584
I doubt he's capable

300
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,584
of killing Itadori.

301
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,125
But still, as his supervisor

302
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,209
this is a huge

303
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,209
blunder on my part.

304
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:31,334
I can get away with it with

305
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:31,334
Gojou, as laid-back as he is.

306
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,834
But if the adult of

307
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,834
adults, Nanami, finds out,

308
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,500
he'll chew me a new one!

309
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,751
I'll probably burst into tears!

310
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,083
I've got to get moving!

311
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,292
You don't want to cry

312
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,626
in front of others

313
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,626
at your age, do you?

314
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,459
(phone vibrates)

315
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:47,375
"Nanami Kento"

316
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,792
Ahhh, he wasn't supposed

317
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,792
to call me so soon!

318
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:51,500
He's gonna chew me out for sure!

319
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:52,667
Hello, I'm sorry!

320
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:55,167
Hm?

321
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,709
I've just sent you my location.

322
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,959
Please come and

323
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,959
pick me up a.s.a.p.

324
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:01,167
I need you to take

325
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:01,167
me to Jujutsu Tech,

326
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,542
to get some

327
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,542
treatment from Ieiri.

328
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:05,000
[Ijichi] Treatment?

329
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,375
Nothing serious.

330
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,792
Nothing that's going

331
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,792
to kill me at least.

332
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,000
That's good.

333
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, I'm about to

334
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,000
join up with Itadori.

335
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,000
Then we'll head your way.

336
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,000
[Nanami] What?

337
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,375
He's not with you?

338
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:17,375
Idiot!

339
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:18,667
Why'd you tell him that?

340
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:24,709
(short inhale into long sigh)

341
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,959
I had to really practice a lot.

342
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,042
You'll make the

343
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,042
perfect test subject.

344
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,667
Luck's really on my side.

345
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,209
That cursed spirit

346
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,209
is just a child.

347
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,834
It probably hasn't

348
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,834
been that long

349
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:42,876
since he sprang into being.

350
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,709
And he's greedily

351
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,709
enjoying his own growth.

352
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:50,209
The two special-grade cursed

353
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:50,209
spirits that Gojou fought

354
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:51,834
had mastered domain expansion.

355
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,709
If this one manages to survive,

356
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,792
it won't be much longer before

357
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,792
he reaches that stage, too.

358
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:00,042
On top of that,

359
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,876
his victim count far

360
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,876
exceeded our predictions.

361
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,125
Please, help me.

362
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:09,709
We need to exorcise him

363
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:09,709
as soon as possible.

364
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,125
Before it's too late.

365
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,709
(laughter)

366
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,417
[Nagi] What happened then?

367
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,542
So Takashi, he's all full of

368
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,542
confidence and he yells...

369
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:24,542
This is the larva

370
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:24,542
of a weird species!

371
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,042
It might even be poisonous!

372
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:26,876
Get back!

373
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:26,876
Don't touch it!

374
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,542
So then of course

375
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,542
I picked it up,

376
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,083
and it turned out to be a

377
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,083
konjac noodle from lunch!

378
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,417
(uproarious laughter)

379
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,417
[Nagi] Wait, no way!

380
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,083
Konjac? It was just

381
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,083
a konjac noodle?

382
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,876
Mom, you've had

383
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,876
too much to drink.

384
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,751
[Nagi] Oh, you are funny, Yuuji!

385
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,292
She's the worst kind of drunk.

386
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,542
Wilson!

387
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:47,542
Wilson!

388
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:49,209
Forgive me, Wilson!

389
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,250
Ha ha!

390
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,459
That's from Castaway, isn't it?

391
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:52,459
That's right!

392
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,459
Is that from a movie?

393
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:55,751
I don't get it.

394
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,584
It's fire!

395
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,751
(laughter)

396
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,792
(soft sleeping or snoring)

397
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:10,584
Your mom's really cool.

398
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:11,667
And nice.

399
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:13,959
Mm-hmm.

400
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,709
[Nagi] Staying home

401
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,709
from school again?

402
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:20,292
(sad sigh)

403
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,292
It's okay.

404
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,584
You don't have to go.

405
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:23,209
Huh?

406
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,876
All you kids at your age,

407
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,918
you tend to take these

408
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,918
things too seriously.

409
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,083
If you think about it,

410
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,083
school

411
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,083
is just a tiny aquarium.

412
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,959
After all, there's a

413
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,959
whole ocean out there.

414
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,959
Swim where you want to swim.

415
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,959
Hey, that was a pretty cool

416
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,959
thing to say, wasn't it?

417
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,000
What a brilliant saying!

418
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,083
Way to go, me!

419
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,209
(chuckle)

420
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:50,834
So hey, tell me about your mom.

421
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:52,709
What's she like?

422
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:53,751
Well I...

423
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:54,834
I never really got to know her.

424
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:58,417
Though I do have a few

425
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:58,417
faint memories of my father.

426
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:01,042
Fortunately, I had my grandpa.

427
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:02,834
(phone vibrates)

428
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:03,834
Oh!

429
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:04,918
Gotta take this call.

430
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,042
Hey there, Ijichi.

431
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:09,876
Yeah, I'm fine.

432
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:13,125
Actually, we were just

433
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:13,125
about to watch a movie.

434
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,459
Okay.

435
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:17,834
Two hours from now,

436
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,042
-got it.

437
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,042
-Two hours!

438
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:21,209
[Junpei] Itadori.

439
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,375
You're a jujutsu

440
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,375
sorcerer, right?

441
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah.

442
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,250
Should I have said that?

443
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:29,834
[Junpei] Have you

444
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:29,834
ever killed someone?

445
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:31,000
Hm?

446
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,834
No.

447
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,834
Someday, you'll have to fight

448
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:38,334
bad jujutsu sorcerers, right?

449
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,667
What will you do then?

450
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,959
If that happens, I still

451
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,959
won't wanna kill them.

452
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:44,918
Why not?

453
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,334
They're bad people.

454
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,209
I just think, if

455
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,209
I killed anyone,

456
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,834
the very option of killing

457
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,751
would then have forced

458
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,751
its way into my life.

459
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,459
The value of life

460
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,459
would become ambiguous.

461
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,375
I might start taking the

462
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,375
people

463
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,375
I care about for granted.

464
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And that scares me.

465
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,709
People don't have hearts.

466
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,167
That idea saved me.

467
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,167
It gave me strength.

468
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,918
But, if killing someone,

469
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,375
would mean tainting my soul,

470
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:25,459
(sighs)

471
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,918
then I can't kill anyone.

472
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,542
(gradual moaning, waking

473
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,542
into yawning and inhale)

474
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,083
Whoa, I fell asleep.

475
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,542
I guess Junpei's friend

476
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,542
must've gone home already.

477
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:42,459
Look at the time!

478
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,918
I need to clean up.

479
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,918
Hm.

480
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,083
Huh?

481
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,626
What is this?

482
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:48,751
Eww!

483
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
A finger?

484
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:00,918
"Jujutsu Kaisen"

485
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:07,000
"Jujutsu Kaisen"

486
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,834
"After the Satozakura

487
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,834
High School Incident"

488
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,626
[Ijichi] After the incident

489
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,626
at Satozakura High School,

490
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,083
we discovered the corpse of

491
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,083
Junpei Yoshino's mother, Nagi,

492
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:19,125
at their home, along with an

493
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:19,125
unsealed finger from Sukuna;

494
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,959
the pinky finger from

495
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,959
his second left arm.

496
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,125
We believe Nagi

497
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,125
Yoshino was attacked

498
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,042
by cursed spirits drawn

499
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,042
there by Sukuna's Finger.

500
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,876
Her remains were completely

501
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,876
missing from the waist down.

502
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,876
There were no visible

503
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,876
or detectable traces

504
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,876
of blood found on-site.

505
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,667
The victim's body was

506
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,667
found lying in her bedroom.

507
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,334
When the blanket covering

508
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,334
the corpse was pulled down,

509
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:44,250
there were only cold packs and

510
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:44,250
ice bags beneath the torso.

511
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,292
You're saying I'd just get

512
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,292
in your way, aren't you?

513
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,667
It's you that got hurt!

514
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,125
Next time take me with you!

515
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,042
My partner died.

516
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,959
But I wasn't with

517
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,959
him when it happened.

518
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:57,959
Why not?

519
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,250
Well, because I'm just a child!

520
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:06,417
You're a strong kid,

521
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:06,417
so try to help others.

522
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:08,709
Not again!

523
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,209
I have to go!

524
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:11,292
You can't.

525
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:13,542
As you have seen,

526
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:14,918
this patchwork cursed

527
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:14,918
spirit we're fighting

528
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,834
uses transfigured people.

529
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,459
There are some people

530
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,459
who are beyond saving.

531
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,709
If you continue with this work,

532
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,584
there will come a time

533
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,584
when you're forced

534
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,250
to kill a person yourself.

535
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,292
But this is not that time.

536
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:33,918
If that happens, I still

537
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:33,918
won't wanna kill them.

538
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,209
And that scares me.

539
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,083
Please understand this.

540
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,334
Being a child is not a sin.

541
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,542
And so for now,

542
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:47,334
I'd like you to continue

543
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:47,334
monitoring Junpei Yoshino.

544
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,083
I don't own any black clothing.

545
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:56,083
So I opened my mom's closet

546
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:58,709
and put on the first

547
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:58,709
thing that caught my eye.

548
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:02,584
The smell of the morning air,

549
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,459
and getting myself to

550
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,459
school were all familiar.

551
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,167
But today...

552
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:11,918
This is a cursed

553
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:11,918
object known as Sukuna.

554
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,751
Other curses are drawn to

555
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,751
it like a moth to a flame.

556
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,417
Yes but, what was that

557
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,417
doing in my house?

558
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,626
There are a lot of

559
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,626
curse users out there

560
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,042
who curse people for money.

561
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,083
It was probably

562
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,083
done by one of them.

563
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,250
If you have the money

564
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,250
and the connections,

565
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:28,125
it's easy to curse

566
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:28,125
someone to death.

567
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,918
Can you think of anyone?

568
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,626
Anyone who might hold a grudge

569
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,626
against you or your mother?

570
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:38,834
Or perhaps, someone

571
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:38,834
dark and gloomy,

572
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:40,125
with plenty of

573
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:40,125
money and free time?

574
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:43,417
And the certificate

575
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:43,417
of commendation,

576
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
and prize for the finest work

577
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:48,083
in the national book report

578
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:48,083
competition, goes to,

579
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,459
Shouta Itou!

580
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:50,459
(audience applauding)

581
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:51,918
Yay Shouta!

582
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,584
We love you Shoutah!

583
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,918
Stop it, that's embarrassing!

584
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:01,792
[Principal] Ahem.

585
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:03,250
Well, uh, we are extremely

586
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:03,250
pleased to have a student

587
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:05,292
from our very own school--

588
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,834
What did you do that for?

589
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,667
I told you to just

590
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,667
write whatever,

591
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,417
and here you wrote some

592
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,417
crap that won me this prize.

593
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,667
You wanna die?

594
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:14,667
No.

595
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:15,959
Sorry.

596
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,417
And, you didn't win

597
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,417
shit for yourself.

598
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:22,125
Shouta's just too cool

599
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:22,125
for school isn't he?

600
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,500
Yeah, no doubt!

601
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:24,834
You think?

602
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:27,042
Well I'll give him props

603
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:27,042
for being rich anyway.

604
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,459
Huh?

605
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,292
What's that black

606
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,292
thing in the sky?

607
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,125
[Male Student]

608
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,125
Whoa, that's weird.

609
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,042
Emerge from darkness

610
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,042
blacker still.

611
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,167
Purify that which is impure.

612
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,209
Hey, I did it.

613
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,709
Mahito, well done.

614
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,209
I can't afford to leave

615
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,209
any residuals of me behind.

616
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,584
What are the veil's effects?

617
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:59,167
[Mahito] No one can

618
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:59,167
escape from inside.

619
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,375
Some can enter from outside,

620
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:03,083
but only those with

621
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:03,083
weak cursed energy.

622
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:07,334
It's an unannounced veil,

623
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:07,334
in a residential area.

624
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:10,375
So the windows will

625
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:10,375
report it right away.

626
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:12,167
I do hope this all plays out

627
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,209
the way you believe it will.

628
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:16,042
I think it'll go just fine.

629
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:19,542
The course of events

630
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:19,542
was already set,

631
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,083
as soon as Junpei

632
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,083
landed Sukuna's vessel.

633
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll cause the two

634
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:25,000
of them to clash,

635
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,918
and force Yuuji

636
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,918
Itadori into a pact,

637
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,209
giving Sukuna dominance.

638
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:33,959
I only wish Jougo was as calm

639
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:33,959
and level-headed as you are.

640
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,542
But it's cute how

641
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,542
straightforward Jougo is.

642
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:37,375
And are you good with this?

643
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:41,292
That finger, was kinda precious.

644
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,584
It's fine.

645
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,292
Yuuji Itadori easily

646
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,292
absorbed the finger

647
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,209
from the juvenile center.

648
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:49,918
As for the one we planted

649
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:49,918
at Junpei's house...

650
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,918
Let Jujutsu Tech find it.

651
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,375
Ah.

652
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,751
Another ploy?

653
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:55,667
Of course.

654
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:58,751
Well, have fun, I'll

655
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:58,751
be taking my leave now.

656
00:19:58,834 --> 00:19:59,751
Wait?

657
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,042
You're not staying?

658
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,209
You should really

659
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,209
hang out and watch.

660
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:05,292
It's going to be

661
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:05,292
quite a bit of fun,

662
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,417
seeing all these

663
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,417
foolish kids die.

664
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,083
Ungh!

665
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:12,751
What the hell?

666
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,584
What's wrong with you guys?

667
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,626
Get up kids!

668
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:16,751
Are you okay?

669
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,626
[Junpei] They're not dead.

670
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,709
Huh?

671
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:22,292
Yoshino?

672
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,292
What's going on?

673
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:27,250
Do you know about this?

674
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:29,167
Do you know what happened here?

675
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,292
Teacher...

676
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,250
Just watch and you'll see.

677
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,250
Those...

678
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,542
Those scars!

679
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,584
The pain I had to go through,

680
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,417
you're going to feel it now.

681
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,250
Yoshino?

682
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:49,417
I have one question for you.

683
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,876
Are you the one who left

684
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,876
that thing in my home?

685
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:54,876
Huh?

686
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:55,334
What are you talking about?

687
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:02,834
What is this?

688
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,209
How are you doing that?

689
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,334
Wrong answer.

690
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,834
What makes you think

691
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,834
you're in a position

692
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:13,292
to answer my question

693
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:13,292
with your own questions?

694
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:16,292
You are going to die.

695
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,500
Whether your answer

696
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,500
is yes or no.

697
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:21,626
After all, I don't

698
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:21,626
have a technique

699
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:22,292
to see through your lies!

700
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,626
And believe me,

701
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:27,209
you've already done more than

702
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:27,209
enough to earn your fate!

703
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,292
So in your final

704
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,292
moments at least

705
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:34,250
-show some sincerity.

706
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:34,250
-I'm so sorry.

707
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,292
And?

708
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:41,042
Say it, you bastard!

709
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:46,334
(horrified gasp)

710
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,167
What are you doing?

711
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,542
Stop, Junpei!

712
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,542
Jujutsu sorcerer, back off.

713
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:06,500
(Closing Theme Music)

714
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,959
[Nobara] The layout's great,

715
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:33,584
but a three-burner

716
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:33,584
range portends death.

717
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,792
Set it ablaze, Mt. Hiei!

718
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:37,626
Matsutake for aroma,

719
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:37,626
shimeji for flavor!

720
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:38,918
The tones of autumn disappear

721
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,542
along with the tears

722
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,542
of the beloved!

723
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:41,834
Next on Jujutsu Kaisen:

Episode Twelve, "Bloody

725
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:44,000
Autumn Leaf-viewing."

726
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,209
The hunt is on for your heart.

727
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,918
(upbeat instrumental music)

728
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:55,334
