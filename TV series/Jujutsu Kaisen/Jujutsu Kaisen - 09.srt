00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:08,417
[Female Student] Hey guys,

00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,250
this creep was totally

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,250

00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:11,250

00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:12,667
[Male Student] Take that!

7
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:15,751
[Male Student] I can see

8
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:15,751
why you'd stare at 'em,

9
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:16,751
ya perv.

10
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:17,959
[Male Student] Yeah, she

11
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:17,959
does have a huge rack

12
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:20,375
so her boobs bounce

13
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:20,375
when she runs.

14
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:22,125
[Junpei] If I had a

15
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:22,125
button I could push

16
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:23,042
that would make

17
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:23,042
everyone I hate die,

18
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,167
I probably wouldn't push it.

19
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,167
Gross.

-Shut up, you guys.

-But, if there

22
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:31,083

26
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:39,083
I'd push it without hesitation.

27
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,167
[Junpei] Excuse me?

28
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:45,542
Excuse me?

29
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:48,250
Excuse me?!

30
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:49,334
Huh?

31
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:52,167
One adult ticket please,

00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,584
Oh, here.

36
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:04,167

38
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,751
[Junpei] Okay, thank you.

39
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,292
You see, I served as a

40
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,292
doctor for many years.

41
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,250
[Male Speaker] And it turned

42
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,250
out he had 50,000 on 'em!

43
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:14,626
-For real?

44
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:14,626
-Typical middle school brat.

00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,459
-That's awesome!

-This sucks.

[Junpei Voiceover]

50
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,292
High school kids

51
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,959
shouldn't skip school

52
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,959
to watch movies.

53
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,834
Not that I should talk.

54
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,792
And that's what I realized it.

55
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,834
[Junpei Voiceover] (sighing)

56
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,834
This seriously sucks.

57
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:34,876
I can't hear the movie at all.

58
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,334
There are always people

59
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,334
like these jerks,

60
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:39,500
even if they vary

61
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:39,500
to some degree.

62
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,459
So, you were looking

63
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,459
at her boobs?

64
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,459

00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,959
Tsubasa's lying to us?

70
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,459
He was definitely

71
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,459
looking at them.

72
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,667

73
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,667
are really asking for it.

74

[Male Student] Oh hey, I

75
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,209
just found a half off coupon.

76
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:54,459
[Male Student] Yeah, to where?

77
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:55,459
[Tsubasa] No way.

78
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:56,792
Teach him a lesson first.

79
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,459
[Junpei Voiceover] Shit,

80
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,459
the girl's just using me

81
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,375
to see where she

82
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,375
stands with these guys.

83
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,959
And she's getting off on it.

84

all know that too.

here fawning over you

97
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,751
is because they're hoping

you'll let them bang you!

00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:40,125
being could do that.

178
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,459
(man inhaling)

179
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:45,417
You just have to pretend

180
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:45,417
you never saw it,

181
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,375
if you want to make it to

182
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,375
retirement in this job

183
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,375
anyway.

184
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:52,209
Can you see it?

185
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,584
This is the residual

186
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,584
taint of cursed energy.

187
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:57,250
No, I don't see anything.

188
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,500
That's because you're

189
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,500
not trying to see it.

190
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,500
We typically see curses as

191
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,500
if it's perfectly natural

192
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,500
to.

193
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:04,834
When a curse technique is used,

194
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:05,500
it leaves traces behind.

195
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:08,000
That's what residuals are.

196
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,792
But residuals are much

197
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,792
fainter than cursed spirits,

198
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:13,667
so focus your vision

199
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:13,667
and look closely.

200
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:19,375
Oh, I can see them.

201
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,167
Of course you can.

202
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,792
A good sorcerer can sense

203
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,792
them even before seeing them.

204
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:27,792
(Yuji groaning)

205
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:30,834
Couldn't you give me a little

206
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:30,834
more praise or something?

207
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,042
I don't praise or

208
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,042
disparage anyone.

209
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,834
I adhere to facts and

210
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,834
judge on that basis.

211
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,584
That's who I am.

212
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,209
There was a time

213
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,500
when I mistakenly believed

214
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,500
society worked the same way,

215
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:42,918
but enough about that.

216
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,334
Let's follow them.

217
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,042
Yeah, all out.

218
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,042
No.

219
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,709
Moderate effort is all

220
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,709
that's required here.

221
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,125
(Yuji gasping)

222
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,209
Now, let's go.

223
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,417
[Yuji Voiceover] Me and this

224
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,417
guy are just not clicking.

225
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,876
It's like I can't

226
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,876
get anything right.

227
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,542
I won't be able to

228
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,542
lead you this time,

229
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:03,042
but don't worry about it, kid,

230
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,500
'cause I've called in an

231
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,500
old friend you can trust.

232
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:10,417
This is Kento Nanami,

233
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:10,417
suit turned sorcerer!

234
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,584
Please don't ever call me that.

235
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,000
Plenty of Jujutsu

236
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,000
Sorcerers are odd balls,

237
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,209
but since Kento here once

238
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,209
worked for a corporation,

239
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:19,083
he's got a good head

240
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:19,083
on his shoulders.

241
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,834
Oh, he's a first

242
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,834
grade sorcerer too.

243
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,459
I doubt anyone would appreciate

244
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,459
an introduction like that.

245
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,709
[Yuji Voiceover] Why do

246
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,709
so many of these people

247
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:28,250
wear glasses and stuff

248
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:28,250
to hide their eyes?

249
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:29,334
A company man?

250
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,459
Why didn't you want to

251
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,459
become a Jujutsu Sorcerer

252
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,876
from the start?

253
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,542
We should greet

254
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,542
each other first.

255
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,542
Nice to meet you, Itadori.

256
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:37,542
Oh, uh, yes.

257
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:38,834
Nice to meet you too.

258
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,375
I went to your school too,

259
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,542
and there, I learned one thing.

260
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:45,083
Jujutsu Sorcerers suck!

261
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,417
Huh?

262
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,709
Then I went to work

263
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,709
for a typical company

264
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,584
and learned something there too,

265
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,667
that having to work

266
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,667
for a living sucks!

267
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:53,792
[Yuji] Really?

268
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:55,083
So if both suck equally,

269
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,250
then I'll go with the

270
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,250
one I like better.

271
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,876
The fact is that's the

272
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,876
only reason I came back.

273
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,417
-That's dark.

274
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,417
-Right?

275
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,584
Now, Itadori, you

276
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,584
should understand

277
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,584
that I'm not at all the

278
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,584
same mindset as Gojo here.

279
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,500
I do trust him and

280
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,500
have great faith

281
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:11,167
in his powers and abilities,

282
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,584
(Satoru laughing)

283
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,500
but I have no respect for him!

284
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,125
[Satoru] Huh?!

285
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,292
I may hate the way

286
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,292
higher ups do things,

287
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,751
but I still believe in

288
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,751
rules and regulations.

289
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,500
This conversation's dragging on.

290
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:26,584
The point is I don't

291
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:26,584
recognize

292
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:26,584
you as a sorcerer either,

293
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,667
but even if you

294
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,667
are just a vessel

295
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,918
for the time bomb

296
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,918
we know as Sukuna,

297
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,667
I'm hoping you can prove

298
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,667
yourself to be useful.

299
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,209
(Yuji sighing)

300
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,959
Lately, I've been

301
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,959
forced to realize

302
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,000
how weak and useless I am.

303
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,667
(somber ambient music)

304
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,876
But I'll become strong.

305
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,334
I have to get strong,

306
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,626
or I won't be able

307
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,626
to choose how I die.

308
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:53,334
Hm.

309
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:56,459
And I'm certain I

310
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:56,459
can win your respect,

311
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,083
but you'll see in time.

312
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,167
Go sell that to the higher ups,

313
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,334
not to me.

314
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,209
(gasping) Yeah, right.

315
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,667
Because frankly, I

316
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,667
don't give a damn!

317
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:07,834
Okay, I get it.

318
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,209
So, there wasn't anything weird

319
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,334
on the surveillance

320
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,334
cameras, right?

321
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,500
Right.

322
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:17,959
There was only one young

323
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:17,959
man aside from the victims.

324
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,834
[Yuji] Then it was

325
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,834
a cursed spirit?

326
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,542
Well, most likely.

327
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,876
There's a small chance the

328
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,876
young man could be the killer,

329
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,834
but we can leave him to the

330
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,834
police to identify as...

331
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:34,250
(rain pattering)

332
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:37,709
La, la, la, lunchbox.

333
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,751
No, stop.

334
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:42,042
Let me take care of

335
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:42,042
this one, Itadori.

336
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,792
Let's see if you can

337
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,792
handle the one over there.

338
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,167
Good detergent.

339
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,709
If you decide you're in over

340
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,709
your head, give a shout.

341
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,584
Why do you think

342
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,584
so little of me?

343
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,209
Give me a chance.

344
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:59,000
It's not about whether I'm

345
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:59,000
underestimating you or not.

346
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,709
I'm the adult here and

347
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,709
you're still a child.

348
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:06,167
I have a duty to prioritize

349
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:06,167
your life over my own.

350
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:11,042
I'd rather you underestimate

351
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:11,042
me than treat me like a kid.

352
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,042
You've faced several

353
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,042
life or death situations,

354
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,918
but that does not

355
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,918
make you an adult.

356
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,626
Realizing your hair is

357
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,626
falling out on your pillow,

358
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,083
realizing your favorite bread

359
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,417
has disappeared from

360
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,417
the convenience store,

361
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,876
the accumulation of those

362
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,876
little

363
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,876
moments of despair in life

364
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,125
is what makes a person an adult.

365
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,709
(frenetic electronic music)

366
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:46,417
-(thunder crashing)

367
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:46,417
-(rain pattering)

368
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,125
My curse technique allows me

369
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,083
to forcibly create a weak point

370
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:56,792
I can exploit on any

371
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:56,792
opponent seven to three.

372
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:59,459
Striking the point at that ratio

373
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,959
when you draw a line

374
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,959
along the target's length

375
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,751
causes a critical hit.

376
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:07,292
That allows me to deal

377
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:07,292
a fair amount of damage,

378
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,167
even to those ranked

379
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,167
higher than me.

380
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,751
And if their cursed

381
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,751
energy is weak,

382
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:14,292
I can slice them in two,

383
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:14,959
even with a blunt blade.

384
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:18,292
Are you listening, Itadori?

385
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,292
Huh?

386
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,751
You were talking to me?

387
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,667
-(Yuji yelling)

388
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,667
-(thudding)

389
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:23,918
[Announcer] Home run!

390
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,792
-(thudding)

391
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,792
-(Yuji groaning)

392
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,292
Should you really be revealing

393
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,918
something like

394
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,918
that to the enemy?

395
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,334
It's no problem to reveal

396
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,334
a technique like that

397
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:34,334
to an opponent.

398
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,542
In fact, it can even

399
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,542
work to your advantage--

400
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:38,334
I want to focus on the curse,

401
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:41,375
but it feels like I should

402
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:41,375
be listening to him.

403
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,876
There is merit to it.

404
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,125
Revealing one's hand

405
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,125
is a gambling tactic

406
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,000
that increases the

407
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,000
effectiveness

408
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,000
of one's technique.

409
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,334
I'll show you.

410
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:52,292
(puddle splashing)

411
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:57,042
(creature murmuring)

412
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,709
(explosion blasting)

413
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,417
(blood sploshing)

414
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,167
(creature murmuring)

415
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,834
(blood sploshing)

416
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:13,667
(blood dripping)

417
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,918
(blood splashing)

418
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,834
All of that force came from me.

419
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,751
Oh man.

420
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,000
Not only is the blade he

421
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,000
used completely wrapped,

422
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:23,876
but he used the back of it

423
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,542
to slice right

424
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,542
through that thing.

425
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:29,918
Behind you, Itadori.

426
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,209
Huh?

427
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,125
-(creature growling)

428
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,125
-(thudding)

429
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,500
(Yuji groaning)

430
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:37,876
I don't like you turning

431
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:37,876
your back on your opponent.

432
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,751
You're the one who keeps

433
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,751
distracting me here!

434
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,876
(creature growling)

435
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,876
(energy billowing)

436
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,167
[Satoru] Your cursed energy

437
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,167
comes up a little slow, huh?

438
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:02,042
So, what's that mean?

439
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,417
Your cursed energy can't keep up

440
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,584
with your explosive power.

441
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,083
You're still not good at

442
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,083
collecting your cursed energy,

443
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,792
so it lags behind.

444
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:14,292
But in effect, that creates

445
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:14,292
an irregular energy flow.

446
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,417
The moment after

447
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,417
your fist impacts,

448
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,876
your cursed energy slams in,

449
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,918
so you're creating two

450
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,918
impacts with every stroke.

451
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,042
(Yuji groaning)

452
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,500
(thudding)

453
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:32,709
(blood sploshing)

454
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,751
Divergent fist.

455
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:42,834
So sick!

456
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:46,125
It's not a skill

457
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:46,125
many sorcerers have.

458
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,834
This weapon will serve you well.

459
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:50,626
Hm.

460
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:54,250
[Kento Voiceover] Is his

461
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:54,250
raw strength superhuman?

462
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:57,125
His initial blow has very

463
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:57,125
little cursed energy to it,

464
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:01,292
but it reaches 120% of an

465
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:01,292
average sorcerer's power.

466
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,042
Then the real blow of

467
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,042
cursed energy flows in.

468
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,459
It must be unimaginably

469
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,459
unpleasant for

470
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,083
those struck by it.

471
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,918
He has room to grow too.

472
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,250
If he can learn to imbue

473
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,250
100% of his cursed energy

474
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:17,000
into 100% of his martial arts,

475
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,792
now I see why Gojo

476
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,792
brought him to me.

477
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:22,292
Mm?

478
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,250
Oh, pardon me, I'll end you now.

479
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:28,792
(intense ambient music)

480
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:29,334
Itadori, wait.

481
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,167
Don't finish it off yet.

482
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:34,417
Have a look at this.

483
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,500
It's a picture I

484
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,500
took of my opponent.

485
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:41,584
But I thought curses didn't

486
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:41,584
show up in photographs?

487
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,459
Please listen to me calmly.

488
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,417
These creatures that

489
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,417
we've been fighting--

490
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:51,959
They're human.

491
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:55,334
Well, I guess I ought to

492
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:55,334
call them former humans.

493
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,959
They're similar to the

494
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,959
three from the theater.

495
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,292
The structure of their bodies

496
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,125
was forcibly altered

497
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,125
by a curse technique.

498
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,918
If that was all, I would

499
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,918
have noticed from the start.

500
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,209
The two we just fought were

501
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,209
more than just altered.

502
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,042
They were full of cursed

503
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,042
energy like cursed spirits

504
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,042
are.

505
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,626
You'll have to ask the culprit

506
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,334
to explain his curse

507
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,334
technique to you.

508
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:14,709
Though there is evidence

509
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,000
their brain stems have

510
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,000
been tampered with,

511
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:20,751
most likely to create

512
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:20,751
confusion

513
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:20,751
and impaired consciousness.

514
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,375
If they can tamper

515
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,375
with the brain,

516
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,584
it might be possible for

517
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,584
them to modify someone

518
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,542
to be able to use cursed energy.

519
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:27,459
The relationship

520
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:27,459
between the brain

521
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:30,292
and cursed energy is

522
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:30,292
still a black box to us.

523
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:33,167
Oh wait, is Itadori listening?

524
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,250
Yeah, I'm here.

525
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,959
I think it's important

526
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,959
you understand this much.

527
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,542
These guys died from the shock

528
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,584
of what happened

529
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,584
to their bodies,

530
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,042
so you didn't kill them.

531
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,417
Don't get the wrong

532
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,417
idea about that.

533
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,542
Thanks.

534
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:53,584
That's easy to say.

535
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,876
The weight of those two deaths

536
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,876
still feels pretty heavy.

537
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,959
Whatever this thing

538
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,959
is we're after,

539
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,751
it disgusts me to the core.

540
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,375
[Kento Voiceover] This boy

541
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,375
can get sincerely angry

542
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,876
on behalf of others.

543
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,417
Most likely, those

544
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,417
residuals were a bluff

545
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,042
left purposely to lure us in.

546
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,083
Our foe is quite skilled.

547
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,417
It looks like this will take

548
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,417
more than moderate effort,

549
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,959
so let's go all out.

550
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,626
(Yuji chuckling)

551
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,751
Yeah.

552
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,417
There are cursed spirits

553
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,000
known as special grade

554
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,000
potential apparitions.

555
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,918
Cursed spirits are a collection

556
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,209
of the cursed energy

557
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,209
emitted by humans.

558
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:37,792
Whether it exists or not,

559
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:40,417
a shared image of

560
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:40,417
fear makes it easy

561
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,292
for a powerful

562
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,292
curse to manifest.

563
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,000
So, what's an example of

564
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,000
a shared image of fear?

565
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,125
You mean like monsters

566
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,125
and scary ghost stories?

567
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:52,459
Yes.

568
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:56,250
Like Toilet-Bound Hanako, the

569
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:56,250
Nine-Tailed Fox, and so on.

570
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:57,459
Jujutsu Sorcerers label them

571
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,626
special grade

572
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,626
potential apparitions

573
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,125
and keep watch for them.

574
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:04,417
And the fact that

575
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:04,417
they often categorize

576
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,167
powerful unidentified curses

577
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,167
as potential apparitions,

578
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,834
it makes it feel like

579
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,834
that's

580
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,834
all they're focused on.

581
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,125
But people constantly

582
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,125
fear other things too,

583
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,125
not just those old fairytales.

584
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:19,125
Like earthquakes?

585
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:20,834
(Mahito chuckling)

586
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:23,542
I love how stress free

587
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:23,542
it can be talking to you.

588
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:27,125
Well, I don't really...

589
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:30,334
(creatures growling)

590
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:33,209
Huh?

591
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:40,334
People, the ocean, the

592
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:40,334
forests, the earth,

593
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,334
they fear all of them.

594
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,125
Because the cursed energy

595
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,125
directed towards those

596
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,209
is far too vast,

597
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,542
they gained wisdom

598
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,542
before they took shape

599
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,876
and they've remained

600
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,876
in hiding up until now.

601
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,375
I'm proud to call all

602
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,375
of them my friends.

603
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:01,083
Tell me, Mahito,

604
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,083
what kind of a curse are you?

605
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:06,626
Human.

606
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:11,334
I'm a curse that was born

607
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:11,334
from the hatred and fear

608
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,167
that people hold deep

609
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,167
inside toward others.

610
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,292
(creatures growling)

611
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,209
I've organized the reports

612
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,209
concerning recent residuals,

613
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:24,375
unnatural deaths,

614
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:24,375
and disappearances.

615
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:28,751
This should narrow down the

616
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:28,751
culprits hideout to some

617
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:28,751
extent.

618
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,584
Oh yeah, are we storming in?

619
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,375
No. As I said, it's

620
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,375
only to some extent.

621
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:35,417
While I continue

622
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:35,417
investigating this matter,

623
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,626
I'd like you to handle

624
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,626
a different task.

625
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:40,751
This is the boy who

626
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:40,751
was at the theater,

627
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:41,375
Junpei Yoshino.

628
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,584
We've just determined

629
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,334
that he goes to the same high

630
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,334
school as the three victims.

631
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,918
Based on his actions

632
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,375
and the way he carries himself

633
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,375
in the surveillance footage,

634
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,334
I believe it's unlikely

635
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,334
that he is a curse user.

636
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,751
However, if he's related

637
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,751
to the victims in some way,

638
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,292
that changes things.

639
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,792
Curse user?

640
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,918
Our term for an evil

641
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,918
Jujutsu Sorcerer.

642
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,375
I've entrusted the

643
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,375
process to Iguchi here

644
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:09,751
and I'd like the two of you

645
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:09,751
to

646
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:09,751
investigate Junpei together.

647
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,792
Sure.

648
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,083
Come to think of it,

649
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,626
you're the only assistant

650
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,626
we have as far as I know.

651
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:17,250
Well, I am the only

652
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:17,250
one of the assistants

653
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,083
who knows that

654
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,083
you're still alive.

655
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:19,751
So, here I am.

656
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,876
All right, that makes sense.

657
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:23,959
Let's go!

658
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,334
(footsteps pattering)

659
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,792
You don't just know the

660
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,792
location to some extent, do

661
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,792
you?

662
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:35,000
You know it exactly.

663
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,959
Of course. If the culprit

664
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,959
had wanted to,

665
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,250
he could have left the scene

666
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,459
without leaving behind

667
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,459
any residuals at all.

668
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,751
It would seem we're being

669
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,751
lured in once again.

670
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,417
Weighing the risk

671
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,417
of storming in alone

672
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,167
versus taking Itadori along,

673
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,792
I simply made the safest choice.

674
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,209
He is after all still a child.

675
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:55,834
-(Iguchi groaning)

676
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:55,834
-Oh!

677
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:57,209
And hey, teacher?

678
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:58,876
Itadori!

679
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,500
Forgot to tell ya,

680
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:01,584
you be careful.

681
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,500
Itadori, I'm not a teacher

682
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,500
so please don't call me that.

683
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:09,500
[Yuji] So, Kento dude!

684
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,125
[Kento] I will slap you.

685
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:15,292
(suspenseful ambient music)

686
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,334
[Iguchi] There he is.

687
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:18,792
[Yuji] Huh, where's his uniform?

688
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:19,500
It looks like he hasn't been

689
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:21,334
attending school for some time.

690
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,375
(stoplight beeping)

691
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:27,959
We'll get out and

692
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:27,959
walk from here.

693
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,125
Let's go.

694
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,709
-(people chattering)

695
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,709
-(suspenseful music)

696
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,834
(creature murmuring)

697
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:49,584
(Closing Theme Music)

698
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,000
-(whimsical music)

699
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,000
-Juju Stroll.

00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,125
Hey, Nanami.

701
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:21,417
Let's go out.

702
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,167
No, thank you.

703
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,167
No, seriously,

704
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,125
I have something to

705
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,125
talk to you about.

00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:26,751
[Kento] Oh, that is awful.

707
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:29,125
I didn't say anything yet.

708
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,250
Hm.

709
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:32,542

710
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,334
Hm?

711
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:44,375
(intense ambient music)

712
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,500
Mm.
