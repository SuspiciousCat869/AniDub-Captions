1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,500
(footsteps approaching)

2
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:11,542
(wood crashes)

3
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:14,042
That was a close one!

4
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:14,042
Are you all right?

5
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,125
Salmon.

6
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:17,083
Here it comes!

7
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:19,792
Stop it!

8
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:20,959
(bells ringing)

9
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:23,959
Convergence! Piercing Blood!

10
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:28,167
[Megumi] Did he wound it?

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,083
So he was holding back

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,083
when he fought me?

13
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,083
[Noritoshi] Hurry! Those

14
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,083
wounds'll heal quickly!

15
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,584
(footsteps departing)

16
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,083
(Inumaki gasps)

17
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:40,209
[Noritoshi] Inumaki

18
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:40,209
will stop it.

19
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,834
We'll attack, and then

20
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,834
we'll get away from it.

21
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,209
Then we'll repeat that as we

22
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,209
try to get outside this veil,

23
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:46,876
and rejoin the principal

24
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:46,876
and the others.

25
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:48,626
(wall crashes in)

26
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:49,918
[Noritoshi] But

27
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:49,918
there's no telling

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,083
when this current

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,083
balance will fall apart!

30
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,667
(dark music)

31
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:55,918
[Noritoshi] His cursed speech

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,292
doesn't seem to

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,292
be very effective,

34
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,626
and we're not getting a chance

35
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,626
to contact the teachers.

36
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:03,209
If it figures out how to

37
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:03,209
deal with his cursed speech,

38
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,626
we're finished.

39
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,626
(wood crashes)

40
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:07,626
(footsteps approaching)

41
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:08,751
Hurry!

42
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:10,167
(Megumi grunts)

43
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,209
[Noritoshi] We still don't know

44
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:13,250
what this cursed spirit's after!

45
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,083
It's possible the

46
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,083
principal and the sorcerers

47
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:18,918
stationed at Jujutsu Tech

48
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:18,918
haven't taken any action yet.

49
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,250
I'd like to join up with Todo.

50
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:24,542
Or at the very least, Miwa, but-

51
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,042
(door opens)

52
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,626
(intense music)

53
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:34,167
(wood crashes)

54
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:36,667
(Nue caws)

55
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,792
Inumaki will stop it

56
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,792
for you! Attack it now!

57
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,459
Stop!

58
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:45,292
-(blood splatters)

59
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:45,292
-(Noritoshi gasps)

60
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:48,542
(Inumaki gags)

61
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,125
[Noritoshi] He's the one

62
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,125
hitting his limit first?

63
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,042
(Noritoshi gasps)

64
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,042
(Noritoshi yells)

65
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,000
(Megumi grunts)

66
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:04,042
How're you doing,

67
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:04,042
Kamo? Still alive?

68
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,667
(dark music)

69
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,542
[Megumi] Inumaki wasn't

70
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,542
even using powerful words,

71
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:13,000
but it still

72
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:13,000
destroyed his throat!

73
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,876
This thing's just

74
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,876
that much stronger!

75
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:19,667
(dark music)

76
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,876
(Megumi gasps)

77
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,000
Mustard leaf.

78
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,250
Don't, Inumaki!

79
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:31,375
It's way too strong!

80
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,876
(footsteps approaching)

81
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,000
Blast away!

82
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,626
(wood crashes)

83
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,250
(Inumaki gags)

84
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,417
(dark music)

85
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,209
[Hanami] You can't hope to

86
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,209
cut me with that dull blade.

87
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:06,667
(Maki grunts)

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,918
(Megumi grunts)

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,042
(wood snaps)

90
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,083
(dark music)

91
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,042
[Megumi] Its eye

92
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,042
trees are more fragile

93
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,167
than the rest of it!

94
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:22,375
[Hanami] Now, that

95
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:22,375
sword isn't so bad.

96
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,709
(fast music)

97
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,167
I have something even better.

98
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,834
Though I have to say, using

99
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,834
this one feels disgusting.

100
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:38,834
(rock music)

101
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,292
[Kiyotaka] "Cursed tools" are

102
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,292
weapons imbued with curses.

103
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,167
Based on their force

104
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,167
and their effects,

105
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,792
they're divided into

106
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,792
grades one through four,

107
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:50,834
just like sorcerers.

108
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:52,959
The higher a cursed

109
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:52,959
tool's grade,

110
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,167
the greater the advantage

111
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,167
it provides its user

112
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,709
in jujutsu combat.

113
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,751
[Maki] Megumi, you'd

114
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,751
better not lose that!

115
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,751
[Megumi] Don't worry, I won't.

116
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,167
[Maki] It's probably worth

117
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,167
five billion if you sold

118
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,167
it.

119
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,459
[Megumi] Huh?

120
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,959
[Maki] Special-grade

121
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,959
cursed tool: Playful Cloud!

122
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,751
(Hanami flies)

123
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:18,125
(rock music)

124
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,500
[Hanami] Indeed, that

125
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,500
is a good weapon.

126
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:29,334
-(footsteps approaching)

127
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:29,334
-(Megumi claps)

128
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:31,292
[Megumi] Demon Dog.

129
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,292
With the exception of

130
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,292
my expanded technique,

131
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,375
Bottomless Well,

132
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,292
if any of my ten shikigami

133
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,292
are completely destroyed,

134
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,667
I can never manifest them again!

135
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:44,334
(rock music)

136
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,667
[Megumi] However,

137
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:48,500
all of the power and techniques

138
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:51,542
of each of the

139
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:51,542
destroyed shikigami,

140
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,834
are passed on to the others!

141
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,584
(rock music)

142
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:01,626
[Megumi] Totality!

143
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:06,250
(Demon Dog roars)

144
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:08,167
(rock music)

145
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,125
[Hanami] It learns fast.

146
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,626
It's trying to take off

147
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,626
my wounded arm first.

148
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,667
The sorcerer boy

149
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,667
is in the forest.

150
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,918
(water splashing)

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,918
(Maki grunts)

152
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,375
(sword clangs)

153
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:20,500
(Hanami grunts)

154
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,500
[Hanami] The boy's sword!

155
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:26,167
(Megumi grunts)

156
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,542
Maki!

157
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:28,918
(Maki grunts)

158
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,667
(water splashing)

159
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,876
(Maki and Megumi grunt)

160
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,083
(Hanami gags)

161
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:39,375
Don't ever let me use that

162
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:39,375
three-piece staff again!

163
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,209
It's too hard!

164
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,751
Ah, you get used to- (gasp)

165
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,918
-Megumi!

166
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,918
-(Megumi gags)

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
(curse laughs)

168
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:47,959
(Maki gasps)

169
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,083
(Maki grunts)

170
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:49,918
[Megumi] Maki!

171
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,918
Damn it! All because

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,918
I screwed up!

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,292
(Maki grunts)

174
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,751
[Hanami] My strike was

175
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,751
aimed for your heart.

176
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,375
What a wonderful reaction.

177
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:04,292
Jujutsu sorcerers are so

178
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:04,292
extraordinarily compassionate.

179
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:08,125
As a result, an opening

180
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:08,125
is always created

181
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,959
when their ally is injured.

182
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:12,709
(water splashing)

183
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,125
-(Megumi groans)

184
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,125
-(Maki gasps)

185
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:15,584
[Maki] Was it destroyed?

186
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,459
No, Megumi released

187
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,459
the technique!

188
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,334
[Hanami] You shouldn't use

189
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,334
cursed techniques anymore.

190
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:26,250
The bud embedded in you

191
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:26,250
now, loves cursed energy.

192
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,250
So the more you use techniques,

193
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:30,459
the deeper its roots will

194
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:30,459
extend into your body.

195
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,125
What good's the warning?

196
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,042
If you're just gonna

197
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,042
kill us anyway?

198
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,584
[Hanami] Apparently, it works

199
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,584
faster when I explain it.

200
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,500
(Maki grunts)

201
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:43,584
[Hanami] You move well.

202
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,792
(Maki grunts)

203
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,125
(Hanami punches)

204
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,959
(Maki chokes)

205
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,834
[Hanami] But, you're missing

206
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,834
the edge you had earlier.

207
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,626
(dark music)

208
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,167
[Megumi] I have to wring

209
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,167
out that cursed energy!

210
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,083
Even if it rips my stomach open!

211
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,375
I'm not like everyone else.

212
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,125
I choose who I protect!

213
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,667
I shoulder the least

214
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,667
responsibility!

215
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,083
Therefore,

216
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:21,792
I am simply not allowed

217
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,959
to fall before anyone else!

218
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:27,500
(Megumi gasps)

219
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:30,167
(Megumi yells)

220
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,459
[Maki] Megumi, stop!

221
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,876
[Megumi] Huh?

222
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:37,500
We did it! Our job here is done!

223
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,584
It's time to tag out.

224
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,709
(water splashes)

225
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,584
Huh?

226
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,000
(fast music)

227
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,334
Alright, friend. You good to go?

228
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah!

229
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:07,792
(opening theme music)

230
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:13,918
(singing in Japanese)

231
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:31,834
(music fades out)

232
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,667
(Momo groans)

233
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:40,584
(heavy breathing)

234
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:41,667
So heavy!

235
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,626
I can't believe these two

236
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,626
got beaten this badly!

237
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,375
Come on, Todo.

238
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:49,500
We need you.

239
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,542
Your strength is the one

240
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,542
thing

241
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,542
you've got going for you.

242
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,500
(water running)

243
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:00,709
Forget it, Itadori!

244
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,542
You may think you can

245
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,542
handle that thing, but-

246
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:06,000
(Megumi gags)

247
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:06,626
Panda.

248
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:07,709
I'm right here.

249
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,834
Take these two and get

250
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,834
them out of the veil.

251
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:15,459
According to the

252
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:15,459
report from Nishimiya,

253
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,792
this is an anti-Gojo veil.

254
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:20,709
So the rest of us can come

255
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:20,709
and go without any issues.

256
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,834
-Wait! Not even you can't-

257
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,834
-[Yuji] Fushiguro.

258
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:24,918
Huh?

259
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:28,751
It's okay.

260
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,292
It's okay.

261
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,250
(Megumi gasps)

262
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:35,375
Looks like you've realized it.

263
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,375
Those who are growing wings

264
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,375
are forever untouchable

265
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,375
by the rest of us.

266
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:43,500
And that's exactly where

267
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:43,500
Itadori is standing now.

268
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:44,417
(Megumi hisses)

269
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,584
You die again and

270
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,584
I'll kill you myself!

271
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,792
Come on now, let's go.

272
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,375
Pandash!

273
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,792
Well alright then! I

274
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,792
guess I'd better not die.

275
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,375
I'm not going to lift

276
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,375
a finger to help you,

277
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,292
you know that, right, Itadori?

278
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:03,876
Not until you land

279
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:03,876
a Black Flash.

280
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:06,667
If you can't land a Black Flash,

281
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,792
then I'll just watch you die.

282
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,751
No matter what happens

283
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,751
to you. Got that?

284
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,292
Yes!

285
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,751
[Hanami] Ah, Sukuna's vessel.

286
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:16,751
And

287
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:19,417
who is that man?

288
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,751
He has a certain presence,

289
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:24,250
but the amount of cursed

290
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:24,250
energy he possesses

291
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,792
is most definitely

292
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,792
less than mine.

293
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,709
However, he has that

294
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,709
mysterious brazenness.

295
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:31,876
He must have quite

296
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:31,876
the technique,

297
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,000
since I can't move

298
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,000
freely before him.

299
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,542
So, what is this "Black Flash,"

300
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:41,167
and how will they attack?

301
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:44,876
You can talk?

302
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,792
That's interesting.

303
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,584
In that case, there's

304
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,584
something I want to ask you.

305
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,042
Are you connected with

306
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:58,000
a humanoid cursed spirit

307
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:58,000
with a patchwork face?

308
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:02,375
[Hanami] And if I say that I am?

309
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:04,584
(Yuji roars)

310
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,083
(water splashes)

311
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,459
[Hanami] He didn't carelessly

312
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,459
close the distance!

313
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,083
I commend him for that.

314
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,667
(Yuji grunts)

315
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:13,959
[Hanami] He's fast!

316
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,959
And he has more explosive

317
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,959
power than that girl,

318
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,959
earlier.

319
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:18,792
However, its intensity is poor.

320
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,834
[Yuji] I have a wide open shot!

321
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:25,334
It's letting its guard

322
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:25,334
down because I held back!

323
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:25,751
I can land it now!

324
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:27,876
Black Flash!

325
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,292
(rock music)

326
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,334
(Todo gasps)

327
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,500
(Yuji yells)

328
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:33,959
[Yuji] Damn it!

329
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:37,375
(water splashes)

330
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,792
(Yuji gasps)

331
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,000
[Todo] My friend.

332
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:44,959
(Todo slaps)

333
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:47,792
Anger is a trigger

334
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:47,792
for sorcerers,

335
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:50,000
and it can work

336
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:50,000
for you both ways.

337
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,792
A sorcerer can be

338
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,792
taken down in a fight

339
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:55,667
simply because he

340
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:55,667
accidentally enraged his foe.

341
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,500
And the opposite is also true.

342
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:01,626
Sometimes they lose

343
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:01,626
because their own anger

344
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,000
disrupts their cursed energy

345
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,876
to the point they can't

346
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,876
exercise their abilities.

347
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:06,918
Your friend has gotten hurt.

348
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,167
And what's even worse than that,

349
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,125
they've rained on your

350
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,125
honeymoon with me,

351
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:11,834
your new best friend.

352
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:14,209
So take it from me.

353
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:17,667
I can absolutely understand

354
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:17,667
why you're boiling with rage.

355
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,667
But all that rage

356
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,667
is too much for you!

357
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:21,834
So, put it away for now.

358
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:24,000
(water running)

359
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,751
(Todo slaps)

360
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,876
[Hanami] Are they

361
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,876
fighting each other?

362
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,751
So how do you feel?

363
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,751
You clear-headed now?

364
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:38,083
Yeah, no stray thoughts left!

365
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:42,250
Thank you for that,

366
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:42,250
my new best friend!

367
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,667
(upbeat music)

368
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:46,667
[Todo] Black Flash.

369
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:48,542
It's a distortion of space,

370
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,667
born from the impact

371
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,667
of cursed energy

372
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:53,334
delivered within a

373
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:53,334
trillionth

374
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:53,334
of a second of a blow.

375
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,042
It delivers two point five times

376
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,083
the force of a normal strike.

377
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:04,167
There are no sorcerers who can

378
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:04,167
consistently use Black Flash.

379
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,375
However,

380
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,000
between those who have

381
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,000
experienced Black Flash

382
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,876
and those who have not,

383
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,709
their distance from the

384
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,709
core of cursed energy

385
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,417
is like the distance

386
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,417
of Heaven from Earth!

387
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,125
(Yuji exhales)

388
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,959
[Hanami] What tremendous

389
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,959
concentration!

390
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,918
[Todo] The instant cursed

391
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,918
energy makes impact

392
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,918
within that trillionth of

393
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,918
a second of a blow,

394
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,459
space is distorted,

395
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,959
and cursed energy flashes black!

396
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,125
[Yuji] Black Flash!

397
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:44,042
(upbeat music)

398
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,334
(Todo chuckles)

399
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,000
[Todo] He's done it.

400
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,417
(music fades out)

401
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,918
(dark music)

402
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:13,334
He's done it.

403
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,792
Black Flash? So I did that?

404
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,000
What is this?

405
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,125
This is my cursed energy

406
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,125
I'm sensing, isn't it?

407
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,500
[Todo] Now you understand

408
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,500
the taste of cursed energy.

409
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:31,125
Huh?

410
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,459
(dark music)

411
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,083
Up until now,

412
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:37,876
you've just been

413
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:37,876
taking an ingredient

414
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:40,042
that you've never tasted before,

415
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,292
and throwing it into

416
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,292
a pot and boiling it,

417
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,042
without understanding why.

418
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:48,542
But now, after

419
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:48,542
experiencing Black Flash,

420
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:49,959
you understand the taste

421
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:49,959
of your ingredient,

422
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,584
your cursed energy.

423
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:55,500
You stand on a completely

424
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:55,500
different level as a chef

425
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:58,292
than you did just

426
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:58,292
three seconds ago.

427
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,918
So congratulations, brother.

428
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,042
Now you can become truly strong!

429
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,167
[Hanami] I had been told

430
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,167
that Sukuna's vessel

431
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,083
was immature as a sorcerer.

432
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,375
But he and this mysterious man,

433
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,626
something about them is

434
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,626
different from the other

435
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,626
masses.

436
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,584
It can heal?

437
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,083
A cursed spirit is made

438
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,083
up of cursed energy.

439
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,834
Therefore, unlike us,

440
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,042
they don't need advanced

441
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,042
reversed cursed techniques

442
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,709
to heal their bodies.

443
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,000
An injury like that

444
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,000
would mean very little

445
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,000
to a special-grade.

446
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,334
But there's no doubt

447
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,125
that it shaves away

448
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,125
their cursed energy,

449
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,209
and if you crush their head,

450
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,209
it's game set and match.

451
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,167
Now!

452
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,500
What do you say you

453
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,500
and I get cooking?

454
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,918
[Hanami] It would seem

455
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,876
that perhaps

456
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,083
I should take you two

457
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,083
somewhat seriously.

458
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,584
-(Todo grunts)

459
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,584
-(Yuji gasps)

460
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,167
(upbeat music)

461
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,375
(Yuji gasps)

462
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,209
(Todo grunts)

463
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,876
(Yuji exhales)

464
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,876
(Todo grunts)

465
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,334
(Yuji grunts)

466
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:15,584
Ungh! That's a

467
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:15,584
wide-ranging attack!

468
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,876
Don't falter!

469
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,083
Wide range attacks have

470
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,083
less speed and force.

471
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:21,792
(Yuji gasps)

472
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:22,250
(Todo grunts)

473
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,792
(upbeat music)

474
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:27,709
(Todo grunts)

475
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:29,083
[Hanami] That hit hard!

476
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:32,167
Their blows aren't as bad as

477
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:32,167
that flashy black one before.

478
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,459
But each one possesses

479
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,459
enough force that,

480
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:38,167
if they continue steadily,

481
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:38,167
they'll damage me!

482
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,167
Todo! Let's coordinate

483
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,167
our timing better!

484
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,918
Yeah!

485
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,459
[Both] Huh?

486
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:45,584
[Yuji] Our footing!

487
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,918
[Todo] I messed up!

488
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,292
I thought it was passing

489
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,292
cursed

490
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,292
energy through real objects

491
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,125
in order to manipulate

492
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,125
that much mass!

493
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,626
But it's all the embodiment.

494
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,792
The manifestation of

495
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,792
its cursed energy!

496
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,375
That's a special-grade for you!

497
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,375
[Hanami] Learn how

498
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,375
great the land is!

499
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,250
[Todo] Attacking while

500
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,250
we fall? That's brutal!

501
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,500
However!

502
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,584
[Both] Brother!

503
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:11,334
(both yell)

504
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,125
[Hanami] They dodged that?

505
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,667
But, what is this?

506
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,334
This strange feeling?

507
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:20,167
(water running)

508
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:25,584
[Mahito] You know, Hanami,

509
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:28,000
you should really

510
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:28,000
be more honest.

511
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,751
[Hanami] I don't believe

512
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,751
I'm faking anything.

513
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,375
[Mahito] I don't mean

514
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,375
to call you a liar.

515
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:37,250
I know why you're fighting.

516
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,125
But it's the process.

517
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,167
You should enjoy the

518
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,167
battles, the present,

519
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,751
much more than you do.

520
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,334
[Hanami] Do you

521
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,334
enjoy them, Mahito?

522
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,751
Well, yeah.

523
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:51,876
Although,

524
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,334
it was only recently

525
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,334
that the joy and pleasure

526
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:58,918
I feel in battle became

527
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:58,918
my main motivation.

528
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,542
Before I knew it,

529
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:03,167
I began tricking,

530
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:03,167
deceiving, and murdering.

531
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,417
And then suddenly

532
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,417
I felt fulfilled.

533
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:09,083
I think just as humans

534
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:09,083
eat, sleep and screw,

535
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,876
these things are a

536
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,876
curse's instincts.

537
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:16,167
As cursed spirits, we may have

538
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:16,167
gained the power of reason.

539
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,042
But that still doesn't

540
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,042
justify

541
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,042
going against our instincts.

542
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,709
For everyone, the soul is a

543
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,709
blend of instinct and reason.

544
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,042
(chair creaks)

545
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,375
So as a result,

546
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,334
no one can say anything

547
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,334
about an individual's ratio.

548
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:36,292
But your soul is a little

549
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:36,292
constrained, isn't it?

550
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:39,459
You, Hanami,

551
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,709
in actuality,

552
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:45,626
you're much

553
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:45,626
stronger, aren't you?

554
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:49,417
(Yuji groans)

555
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Todo!

556
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,584
I'm just fine!

557
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,250
(Todo grunts)

558
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,751
(fast music)

559
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:01,292
(Hanami lands)

560
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,918
(Yuji grunts)

561
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,125
[Yuji] It just expended

562
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,125
a ton of cursed energy!

563
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,167
(Yuji grunts)

564
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,167
[Todo] So now's our chance-

565
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,459
(Todo grunts)

566
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,459
To strike!

567
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,542
You monster!

568
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:18,417
(Todo lands)

569
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,459
(bells chime)

570
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,584
(both grunt)

571
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,250
[Hanami] Mahito!

572
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,334
Right now,

573
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:30,334
I'm enjoying a fight!

574
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,876
I'm enjoying a fight, Mahito!

575
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,083
Are you good to go, brother?

576
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,375
(Yuji grunts)

577
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:41,334
-Yeah, you bet!

578
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:41,334
-That's excellent! Me too!

579
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,626
(rock music)

580
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,626
Then it's time to

581
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,626
unleash my technique!

582
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,500
(closing theme music)

583
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:59,792
(singing in Japanese)

584
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,042
(music fades out)

585
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:17,209
(upbeat music)

586
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,918
[Juzo and Mahito] Juju Stroll!

587
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,751
Coat rack!

588
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,918
Gonna make a great

589
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,918
new coat rack,

590
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,292
and it's gonna be so nice!

591
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,292
Huh?

592
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,751
-Hey!

593
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,751
-Huh?

594
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:29,459
What would Gojo end up

595
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:29,459
looking like? If you do him?

596
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,667
Definitely a standing rack.

597
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:35,959
I'd use his hip girdle,

598
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:37,959
with the sacral

599
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:37,959
bone and the coccyx,

600
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:40,375
as the base for the stand.

601
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,375
Then, I'd rework his femurs

602
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,918
and use them to stabilize it.

603
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,751
I'd use his spine's lumbar

604
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,751
and thoracic vertebrae

605
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,709
all up to the third

606
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,709
cervical vertebrae.

607
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:52,292
And to give it height, hey,

608
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,542
ancient camphor

609
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,542
wood would be good!

610
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:57,500
I'd use that to make

611
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:57,500
replicas of the vertebrae,

612
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,417
and then alternate

613
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,417
them with the bones

614
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,626
to accentuate the height.

615
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:02,959
(upbeat music)

616
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,584
[Juzo] Then I'd extend

617
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,584
the spinous process

618
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,459
and complete the

619
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,459
transverse process,

620
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:10,792
based on the overall balance,

621
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:10,792
to create the hangers.

622
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:13,250
(upbeat music)

623
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:16,417
I'd do that by grafting

624
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:16,417
on more ancient camphor.

625
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,751
Depending on the coloring,

626
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,667
it might be nice to cover

627
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,667
the skull with a tanned hide.

628
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,918
Nice, right? So very nice!

629
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:29,042
Yeah, this one could be

630
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:29,042
my best coat rack ever!

631
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:30,959
What junk!

632
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,542
(rock music)

633
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,876
(music fades out)
