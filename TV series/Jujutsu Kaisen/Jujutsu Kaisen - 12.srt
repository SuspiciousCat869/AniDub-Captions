1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,125
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:11,709
I mean it.

3
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:13,042
I'm going.

4
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,375
No, you're not.

5
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,167
Because, as I've

6
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,167
already explained,

7
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:20,042
if a veil has been cast,

8
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,417
then there is a

9
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,417
strong likelihood

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,584
that he's still alive,

11
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,709
and he's there at

12
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,709
Satozakura High School.

13
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,375
I'll be back soon.

14
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:33,876
I'm ordering you to wait

15
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:33,876
there for me, Itadori.

16
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:39,542
It was probably pointless

17
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:39,542
to even ask him that.

18
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:44,834
As you heard, I need to go, so

19
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:44,834
I'll leave this to you, Ino.

20
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:45,959
What?

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,125
Why, is that a problem?

22
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:50,959
Well, um, it's just, um,

23
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,083
there's a lot of 'em,

24
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:57,000
and I think they're all humans.

25
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,000
I was thinking of

26
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,000
recommending you for promotion

27
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,751
to grade one sorcerer.

28
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,250
(Ino grunts)

29
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:10,167
All right, let's get

30
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:10,167
this done, baby! Ha ha!

31
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,250
(suspenseful music continues)

32
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,125
[Itadori] Please

33
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,125
step aside Ijichi.

34
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:19,250
Don't forget that our

35
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:19,250
job is to help others.

36
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:21,626
And though you're a student,

37
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,584
that includes even you, Itadori.

38
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,834
I'm not about to make

39
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,834
any more mistakes.

40
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,334
You mustn't go there, Itadori.

41
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,042
I'm sorry, Ijichi.

42
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:42,959
(suspenseful music continues)

43
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:49,584
What are you doing?

44
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:49,584
Stop, Junpei!

45
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:52,292
(lightning crashes)

46
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,167
Jujutsu sorcerer, back off.

47
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:03,417
(Opening Theme Music)

48
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:20,167
(man singing in Japanese)

49
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:30,334
(suspenseful music)

50
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:36,584
(Junpei panting)

51
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:37,584
(Itadori grunts)

52
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,459
[Junpei] Moon Dregs!

53
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:46,792
[Itadori] A jellyfish shikigami?

54
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:49,667
Blunt attacks won't even touch

55
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:49,667
him when he's inside that!

56
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,834
I'll say it one more time.

57
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:55,584
Stay out of this,

58
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:55,584
jujutsu sorcerer.

59
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,125
It's none of your business.

60
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,250
You don't tell me

61
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,250
what my business is!

62
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,167
What's the point, really,

63
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,167
of saving indiscriminately?

64
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,626
(Junpei grunts)

65
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,792
Don't overestimate

66
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,626
the value of a life!

67
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,459
(tentacles whipping)

68
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,250
(Itadori groans)

69
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:17,375
People always pretend their

70
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:17,375
emotions are everything,

71
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,209
but the heart is just the

72
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,209
metabolism of the soul.

73
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,667
It's all a delusion.

74
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,918
Don't restrict me with rules

75
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,918
that are based on a delusion.

76
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,876
What gives anyone the right

77
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,834
to stop someone

78
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,834
from taking a life?

79
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,667
Nothing does.

80
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,292
Now, just go sleep over there.

81
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,334
There's something I

82
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,334
have to go back and do.

83
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,000
(Junpei groans)

84
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,125
Your cursed technique is poison.

85
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,918
You produce poison

86
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,918
from cursed energy,

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,375
and then your

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,375
shikigami secretes it.

89
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,000
Soon you will learn

90
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,667
how to control their

91
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,667
size and their strength,

92
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,042
and that of the poison.

93
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:59,292
A normal jujutsu sorcerer

94
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:59,292
would

95
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:59,292
need some time to grasp it,

96
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,709
but I'll teach you the sensation

97
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,751
so you'll be able

98
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,751
to fight right away.

99
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,375
Junpei, you have talent.

100
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,375
[Itadori] Who were you

101
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,375
trying to convince here?

102
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,459
(Itadori grunts)

103
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:24,417
(blows thudding)

104
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:29,876
(Itadori grunts)

105
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,709
(Itadori yells)

106
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,083
(Junpei groans)

107
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:39,209
[Junpei] Why, why doesn't Moon

108
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:39,209
Dregs' poison work on him?

109
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:43,417
-(shikigami thudding)

110
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:43,417
-(Junpei groaning)

111
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,584
Why are you getting

112
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,584
in my way? Why?

113
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,542
Why?

114
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:52,751
(blood splattering)

115
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,876
Why?

116
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:57,584
(Junpei grunting)

117
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,918
He's in the air,

118
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,918
so he can't dodge,

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,417
and now I have a chance to

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,417
crush him just before he

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,417
lands.

122
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,417
(Itadori grunting)

123
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:13,417
(Itadori yells)

124
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,417
(Junpei groans)

125
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,459
Junpei, I really

126
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,459
can't understand

127
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,459
a single thing you're saying.

128
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,500
String together

129
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,500
whatever logic you want.

130
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:30,876
With shikigami, strike

131
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:30,876
the sorcerer directly.

132
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,709
But all you're doing is

133
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,417
trying to convince yourself

134
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,959
you're on the

135
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,959
right side of this.

136
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:45,417
-(punch booming)

137
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:45,417
-(glass shattering)

138
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,125
Even though I don't know

139
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,125
why you're doing this,

140
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,751
I'll assume you have

141
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,751
a good reason for it.

142
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,584
But whatever it is,

143
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,959
(melancholy music)

144
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,709
is it really worth throwing

145
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,709
away the life that you have?

146
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,375
(Junpei sobbing)

147
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,500
The human heart is

148
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,500
just a delusion?

149
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:05,667
Could you really say

150
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:05,667
that in front of her?

151
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,292
[Junpei] People

152
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,292
don't have hearts.

153
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,500
-You're still just trying-

154
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,500
-They don't!

155
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,834
Otherwise...

156
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,000
Otherwise...

157
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,542
And that could only mean

158
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:23,667
that people cursed me and

159
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:23,667
my mom with those hearts.

160
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:27,667
That would just be too much.

161
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,167
Then I, I wouldn't even know

162
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,918
what is right and

163
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,918
what's wrong anymore.

164
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,626
(tentacles whipping)

165
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,876
(flesh squelching)

166
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,542
(melancholy music)

167
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:46,834
(Itadori groans)

168
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:48,918
Why didn't you dodge it?

169
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,542
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:55,417
I said a lot of arrogant stuff

171
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,918
without really

172
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,918
understanding anything.

173
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:07,876
So, tell me what happened

174
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:07,876
to you, and I swear to you,

175
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,584
if you do, then I won't

176
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,584
curse you anymore.

177
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,209
Please.

178
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,000
(melancholy music continues)

179
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,125
No way.

180
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,250
Your mom.

181
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,834
Junpei, join Jujutsu Tech.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,918
You'd like it.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,542
There are lots of

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,542
crazy strong teachers,

185
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:38,042
and good, reliable

186
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:38,042
friends there.

187
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:41,584
If we all work together,

188
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:41,584
I guarantee you,

189
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:45,584
we can find whoever it

190
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:45,584
was that cursed your mom.

191
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,209
Then you can make them

192
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,209
pay for what they did.

193
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:49,626
Let's fight together!

194
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,250
Huh?

195
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,375
(Mahito chuckles)

196
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,459
Who are you?

197
00:08:58,959 --> 00:08:59,626
Who the hell's this?

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,959
Is it a person?

199
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:04,709
It's nice to meet you.

200
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:09,167
[Itadori] No, this feels like...

201
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,792
Vessel of Sukuna.

202
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,792
Mahito, no! Don't do it!

203
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:19,125
-(impact thudding)

204
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:19,125
-(Itadori groaning)

205
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,209
What am I, an idiot?

206
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,417
A human-shaped cursed spirit

207
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,417
with a patchwork face?

208
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,918
This is exactly what Nanami

209
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,918
told me would happen!

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,209
Junpei, get out!

211
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,626
I don't care what your

212
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,626
relationship is with him.

213
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,083
Right now, just get your

214
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,083
ass outta here. Run!

215
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,500
Itadori, calm down.

216
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:39,959
Mahito's not a bad person.

217
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,417
Huh?

218
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,626
(mysterious voices singing)

219
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:46,792
Bad person.

220
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,667
(brooding music)

221
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:56,042
You know, Junpei, you

222
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:56,042
are a pretty smart kid.

223
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,667
But sometimes, thinking

224
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,667
too much can lead

225
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:03,209
to even more foolish

226
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:03,209
decisions than impulsiveness.

227
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,334
You're a classic case of that.

228
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:10,334
I'd even say that you can

229
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:10,334
actually be almost as foolish

230
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,709
as those people you

231
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,709
call fools yourself.

232
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,125
And that's why you'll die.

233
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:19,751
Idle Transfiguration.

234
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:24,626
(Junpei groaning)

235
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,375
(dramatic music)

236
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:30,709
Now,

237
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:33,834
time for round two.

238
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:34,876
(Junpei growls)

239
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,209
Junpei.

240
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,500
-(punch thwacking)

241
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,500
-(Itadori groans)

242
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:39,876
Junpei!

243
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,042
Get ahold of yourself!

244
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,500
I can heal you!

245
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:49,751
(punches thudding)

246
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:50,876
Sukuna.

247
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:52,792
Sukuna!

248
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:56,500
What now?

249
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:57,500
(Mahito giggles)

250
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:58,500
I'll do anything.

251
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:00,751
I'll let you do whatever

252
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:00,751
you wanna do to me,

253
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,626
and all agree to any twisted

254
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,626
thing you come up with

255
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,000
if you heal Junpei,

256
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,834
like you did when you

257
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,834
restored my heart.

258
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,792
I refuse to. (laughs)

259
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,792
Oh.

260
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:15,459
[Itadori] Damn you!

261
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,709
(Sukuna laughs)

262
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:22,751
Excellent. He's completely

263
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:22,751
forgotten about that pact.

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,626
How very amusing.

265
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:27,792
You're offering your pride,

266
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:29,459
your future, and

267
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:29,459
your everything,

268
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:34,083
all just to grovel and beg

269
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:34,083
me for my help. (laughs)

270
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,083
By yourself, you

271
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,083
can't save anyone.

272
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:40,250
[Mahito] Is Sukuna

273
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:40,250
refusing the kid's pact?

274
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,918
The shape of one's

275
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,918
soul isn't something

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,918
that reverse-cursed techniques

277
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,918
could deal with, so,

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,250
maybe healing others

279
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,250
is beyond him?

280
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,417
How pitiful.

281
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,918
You couldn't be any more

282
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,918
pathetic, you sorry little

283
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,918
punk.

284
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,792
(Sukuna laughs)

285
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:57,125
[Mahito] Although,

286
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:57,125
what I'm really after

287
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:58,083
is what comes next,

288
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:02,834
so I guess this will

289
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:02,834
do just fine. (laughs)

290
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,834
(dramatic music continues)

291
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,876
(Sukuna laughs)

292
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,959
[Itadori] Oh, that's right.

293
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:25,834
At the end of the day, both

294
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:25,834
of these two are curses.

295
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,709
[Junpei] Yuuji.

296
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,334
Help

297
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:45,417
me.

298
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,918
(body thudding)

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,709
(dramatic music continues)

300
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:05,709
(Mahito laughs)

301
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,751
Oh, dead already?

302
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,834
I was kind of rough when I

303
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,834
changed his shape, I'll

304
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,834
admit.

305
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,042
That's how it goes.

306
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,959
(punch booming)

307
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,000
That was an unusual

308
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,000
blow. Interesting.

309
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,584
But sorry to say,

310
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,584
that won't work,

311
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,375
so long as I maintain

312
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,375
the shape of my...

313
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:35,500
Oh!

314
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,334
What's going on?

315
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,459
He struck the shape of my

316
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,459
soul, as well as my body?

317
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, that's right.

318
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,834
Yuuji Itadori is a vessel.

319
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,834
His body constantly

320
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,834
houses another soul

321
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:56,083
in addition to his own.

322
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,751
So, naturally...

323
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:03,584
You are actually aware of

324
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:03,584
the outline of your soul?

325
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,042
[Itadori] The next words

326
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,042
that spilled from my lips

327
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,876
came from so deep within my gut

328
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,417
that it nearly made everything

329
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,918
I've ever said feel like a lie.

330
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,709
I will kill you!

331
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,167
(upbeat music)

332
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:48,209
Don't you mean you'll

333
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:48,209
exorcize me, jujutsu sorcerer?

334
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,918
(Mahito slurps)

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,959
Yuuji Itadori isn't

336
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,959
concerned with his own life.

337
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,292
But Getou forbade

338
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,292
me from forcing him

339
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,042
into an external pact

340
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,042
using a hostages.

341
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:04,083
So, if he has a foe he hates

342
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:04,083
so much, he longs to kill

343
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:04,083
them,

344
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,417
but he still can't, he'll

345
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,417
probably turn to Sukuna.

346
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,125
If Junpei pay isn't enough

347
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,083
then I'll have to

348
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,083
transform every student,

349
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,125
one by one, before

350
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,125
his very eyes.

351
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:16,751
That would push Itadori,

352
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,584
while he's all full of

353
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,584
hatred and self-interest,

354
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,959
to negotiate and forge

355
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,959
a pact with Sukuna.

356
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:24,500
If that also

357
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:24,500
improves the chances

358
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:29,292
of Sukuna joining our side,

359
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:29,292
then all the better.

360
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:29,292
(slurps)

361
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,125
(dramatic music)

362
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,125
Though, all of that presumes

363
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,959
that I really am

364
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,959
stronger than him.

365
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:37,876
So, why did he have to be

366
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:40,959
my natural enemy?

367
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,000
(Itadori growls)

368
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:47,626
(Itadori yells)

369
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:58,959
(Mahito giggles)

370
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,167
[Itadori] He keeps

371
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,167
changing his damn shape!

372
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,918
I'd better stop using combos

373
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,334
and start using throwing

374
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,334
techniques instead.

375
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,834
[Mahito] Now that I know

376
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,834
his attacks work on me,

377
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:10,334
changing my shape and giving him

378
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:12,500
a bigger target is a bad idea.

379
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,584
[Both] In that case.

380
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,918
[Itadori] Even if it takes

381
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,918
100

382
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,918
times, or even 1,000 times,

383
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,125
I'm just going to

384
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,125
keep on pounding him

385
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,918
until I pound them into a pulp!

386
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,584
[Mahito] I'll use a shape

387
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,584
more refined toward murder,

388
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,709
with more inspiration

389
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,709
for murder,

390
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,000
and manifest it!

391
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:40,834
-(dramatic music)

392
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:40,834
-(Mahito roars)

393
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,667
(explosion booming)

394
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:55,250
(Mahito laughs)

395
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:58,042
(Itadori groans)

396
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,167
There's no way your limbs can

397
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,167
keep on stretching forever.

398
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,876
(flesh squelching)

399
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,209
(Itadori groans)

400
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,209
(dramatic music continues)

401
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:14,876
(Itadori roars)

402
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:25,709
[Mahito] You know, most

403
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:25,709
people would've just let go.

404
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,459
Spreading my shape

405
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,459
too much causes it

406
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,584
to lose strength

407
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,584
and maneuverability.

408
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,792
(Itadori yells)

409
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:34,500
(punch booming)

410
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:39,125
(Mahito giggles)

411
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:44,792
-(Itadori grunts)

412
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:44,792
-(punches booming)

413
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:47,751
(flesh squelching)

414
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:51,667
(brooding music)

415
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,918
(flesh squelching)

416
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,792
Ah, you can never

417
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,792
beat me, you know,

418
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,918
so swap out already.

419
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,083
(Itadori groans)

420
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,167
With Sukuna.

421
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,959
Idle Transfiguration.

422
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,876
You dare to actually

423
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,876
touch my soul?

424
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,167
Since both of us heartily

425
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,167
ridiculed that brat before,

426
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,500
I'll allow it this once.

427
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:26,209
There won't be a second time.

428
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,334
Don't forget your place.

429
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:33,250
Foolish puppet.

430
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:42,250
I'm not swapping out.

431
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,834
I already told you.

432
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:50,375
For what you did, I will

433
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:50,375
kill you now. (roars)

434
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,250
(headbutt booming)

435
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:55,459
(headbutts thudding)

436
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:02,000
(blood splattering)

437
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:07,167
(kick booming)

438
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:16,209
(Itadori yells)

439
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:24,876
Huh?

440
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,209
(blade clanking)

441
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,334
Ha.

442
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,292
Uh?

443
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,918
Nanami?

444
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,500
(Nanami sighs)

445
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:45,292
I'll lecture you later.

446
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:45,292
Just tell me the situation.

447
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:50,459
Two died. I failed to save them.

448
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,751
Why is he always

449
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,751
thinking of others first?

450
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,209
I want to hear about

451
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,209
your physical condition.

452
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:02,083
I'm fine, thanks. Though,

453
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:02,083
I am kinda full of holes.

454
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,751
That's not fine.

455
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,584
Also, in the school gym,

456
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:09,542
the students are

457
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:09,542
alive, but unconscious.

458
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:14,459
My, my, so you're alive and

459
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:14,459
well, Mr. Seven-to-Three.

460
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:17,792
Good to see both of us survived.

461
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:22,459
Shall we share a little hug

462
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:22,459
in celebration of our

463
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:22,459
reunion?

464
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,500
(suspenseful music)

465
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,292
[Nanami] Itadori, why

466
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,292
is his nose bleeding?

467
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,334
Uh, I smashed his face in?

468
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:34,334
But when?

469
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,626
At the start of the fight.

470
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:37,375
And did his hands touch you?

471
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,792
Mm-hmm.

472
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:42,417
[Nanami] My attacks aren't

473
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:42,417
going to work on him.

474
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,417
Huh?

475
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,792
Wait, what? But why not?

476
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,167
I'll explain it later,

477
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,167
when I'm lecturing you.

478
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,959
It's either because, one,

479
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,500
his technique doesn't

480
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,500
work on Itadori,

481
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,209
or two, there's some reason

482
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,209
he won't kill Itadori.

483
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,459
Either way, it's good for us.

484
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,125
However, I'll try to keep

485
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,125
him from moving around.

486
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:04,834
Then, once we both

487
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:04,834
got an opening,

488
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,542
we'll shower him with blows.

489
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,292
We'll exorcize this

490
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,292
one here and now.

491
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,417
Yeah!

Oh, look.

498
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,417
Huh?

499
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:09,125
Ah!

500
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:14,250
-Huh?
