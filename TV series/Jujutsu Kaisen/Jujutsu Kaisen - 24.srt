1
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:06,751
(blood sloshing)

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,792
(blood sizzles)

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,250
Oh, that blood,

4
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,250
don't touch that.

5
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:12,792
You think, I don't know that?

6
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:14,250
(blood whooshes)

7
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:14,250
(Kugisaki gasps)

8
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:20,125
Now run away with

9
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:20,125
your backs to me.

10
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:21,209
(ground rumbling)

11
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:24,417
-(Itadori grunting)

12
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:24,417
-(streams of blood crashing)

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,042
Come on Kugisaki, is that

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,042
the fastest you can run?

15
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,417
Oh, shut up!

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,751
(streams of blood sloshing)

17
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:32,584
-(Kugisaki grunts)

18
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:32,584
-(Kugisaki thuds)

19
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,626
-(Itadori grunts)

20
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,626
-(stream of blood crashing)

21
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:36,667
I've got your back.

22
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:38,083
Oh, great.

23
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:41,000
(ground thuds)

24
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,459
Huh?

25
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,459
(ground thundering)

26
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,792
(Kugisaki groans)

27
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,626
What amazing speed,

28
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,918
and while carrying someone too.

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,083
(streams of blood gushing)

30
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:58,792
They're getting away.

31
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:00,500
Well, no matter.

32
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:04,667
(Itadori grunts)

33
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:07,918
(Itadori whooshes)

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,918
(Itadori and Kugisaki thud)

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,876
(Itadori and Kugisaki grunt)

36
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,083
Okay, we're out of his range.

37
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:18,334
[Kugisaki] Well done.

38
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:19,250
I'll make sure you get a medal.

39
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:21,417
[Itadori] Yeah, yeah.

40
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,292
[Kugisaki] I'm

41
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,292
kidding, thank you.

42
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,334
(Itadori gasps)

43
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,667
(Itadori grunts)

44
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,292
-(blood gushing)

45
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,292
-(Kechizu gurgling)

46
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,667
(blood swooshing)

47
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,500
I guess it took a shortcut

48
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,500
and got here ahead of us.

49
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:38,542
-Itadori!

50
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:38,542
-(blood smashes)

51
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,334
(Kugisaki groans)

52
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:42,667
[Itadori] Kugisaki!

53
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,042
You don't need to worry

54
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,042
about that too much.

55
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,334
My younger brother's blood

56
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:48,125
doesn't have the

57
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:48,125
same quality as mine

58
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,500
and even mine probably

59
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,500
won't kill you outright,

60
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:55,667
unless you manage to get your

61
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:55,667
entire body bathed in it.

62
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:58,959
Though, I can assure you

63
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:58,959
it will hurt like hell.

64
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,125
Now we've reached the time

65
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:02,959
where our technique

66
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:02,959
actually begins.

67
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:05,334
Rot Technique! Decay!

68
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,500
(flesh squelching)

69
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:13,918
[Kugisaki] Huh?

70
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:24,125
-(Opening theme music)

71
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:24,125
-(singing in Japanese)

72
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,584
My blood, like

73
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,584
that of my brothers

74
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,417
is absorbed by the victims,

75
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,459
through their wounds

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,459
and membranes.

77
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,167
And then once any of us

78
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,167
brothers activate the

79
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,167
technique

80
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,292
it quickly begins

81
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,292
to rot you away

82
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,167
from the point of incursion.

83
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,375
I'd give that young

84
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,375
man about 15 minutes.

85
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,250
10 minutes, max,

86
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,250
for you, young lady.

87
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:10,000
By morning, nothing

88
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:10,000
but bones will remain.

89
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,626
If it's a technique,

90
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,500
we just need to make

91
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,500
them release it.

92
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:16,626
So, then it is toxic.

93
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,292
The end result is

94
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,292
essentially that of a

95
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,292
poison,

96
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,876
but, I assure you our technique

97
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,667
is purely one of decomposition.

98
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,334
Now that I finished

99
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,334
revealing our technique

100
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:29,209
they'll actually end

101
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:29,209
up dying even faster.

102
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,125
So, what will you do now?

103
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:37,500
Elder brother, these sorcerers

104
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:37,500
didn't amount to much.

105
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:39,000
[Narrator] During the Meiji era,

106
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,500
there was a girl

107
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,500
with a unique trait

108
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:43,500
that allowed her to bear

109
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:43,500
a cursed spirit's child.

110
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,667
She conceived a child

111
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,667
without knowing how

112
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,500
and the criticism she endured

113
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,334
from her parents and

114
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,334
relatives was extreme.

115
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:52,042
She fled with her baby's corpse,

116
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,417
ending up at a temple run by

117
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,417
a certain jujutsu sorcerer.

118
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
That's where her luck ran out.

119
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,417
(blood splats)

120
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,167
Noritoshi Kamo.

121
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,876
In jujutsu sorcery's legacy,

122
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,667
he's remembered as the

123
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,667
most vile of sorcerers.

124
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,083
A disgrace to the

125
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,083
three major clans.

126
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,167
He was captivated

127
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,167
by the possibility

128
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,709
of a child born of a

129
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,709
human and a cursed spirit.

130
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,167
Nine times he impregnated her.

131
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,334
Nine times he aborted her.

132
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,918
All records of how he did it

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,500
and what happened to her

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,500
afterward, were destroyed.

135
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,500
The Cursed Wombs Death

136
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,500
Paintings, one through three,

137
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:26,334
became cursed objects

138
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:26,334
powerful enough

139
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,709
to be classified

140
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,709
as special-grade.

141
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,334
Perhaps the origin of that power

142
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,918
was the mother's

143
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,918
resentment, or perhaps...

144
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,584
[Eso] I have no

145
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,584
memories of a mother.

146
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,751
Humans, sorcerers.

147
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:41,792
It's not that I hold any

148
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:41,792
special grudge against them.

149
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,542
For 150 years, we've

150
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,542
remained sealed away

151
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:49,292
with nothing but each

152
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:49,292
other's existence to rely

153
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:49,292
on.

154
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,751
We'll side with

155
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,751
the cursed spirits.

156
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:52,626
Are you sure about that?

157
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,584
They seemed shady to

158
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,584
me, elder brother.

159
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,459
The future those

160
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,459
cursed spirits painted

161
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,918
is more convenient for us.

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,751
That's all there is to it.

163
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:03,292
You can forget about owing them

164
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,542
for our current manifestation.

165
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:07,375
And now listen up brothers.

166
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,500
Eso, you live for Kechizu.

167
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,000
Kechizu, you live for me.

168
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,542
And I'll live for you, Eso.

169
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,500
We three are one.

170
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:20,042
I live for my brothers.

171
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,125
If it is what my brothers desire

172
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,334
I will gladly give my life

173
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,334
to grant that wish for them.

174
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,792
If the suffering is too great

175
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:32,792
would you like me to end you

176
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:32,792

Let's play a game of chicken.

191
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:57,042
You don't like pain

192

very much, do you?

193
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,459
Then you'd better start

the curse back on the user.

It is a game of chicken.

[Kugisaki] Straw Doll

204

Technique, Resonance.

205
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,626
It's a technique

206
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,626
that deals damage

207
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,584
to the target's main body

208
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,584
by driving cursed energy

209
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,500
through an effigy and a

210
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,500
lost portion of the target.

211
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,209
The technique's range is

212
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,209
broad and the effect varies

213
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,167
with the difference in strength

214
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,792
between us and the value

215
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,792
of the lost portion.

216
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,667
As far as Straw Doll

217
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,667
Technique is concerned,

218
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:36,209
blood isn't very valuable.

219
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:39,918
But, Resonance uses it

220
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:39,918
as the link to its target

221
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,542
and the blood from both of

222
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,542
them that's inside me now

223
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:47,459
is strongly linking us and

224
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:47,459
they're Rot Technique

225
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:47,459
together.

226
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,083
It's a nice surprise

227
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,709
that it worked on the

228
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,709
younger brother, too.

229
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,042
If I'm going to die here anyway

230
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,417
then I'll just keep on

231
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,417
hammering Resonance into them.

232
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,584
Yes, that pain is quite intense,

233
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:01,667
but no matter how many

234
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:01,667
times she does it,

235
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:03,542
it won't end our lives.

236
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:07,500
So, as long as we hold out,

237
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:07,500
you'll be the ones to die.

238
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:10,709
Not to mention,

while Decay is active

240
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:13,500

00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:13,500
keep you from moving.

to all forms of poison.

essentially that of a poison

259
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,375
but I assure you, our technique

260
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:45,918
is purely one of decomposition.

have enough strength left

00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,751
[Eso] I'm sorry, elder brother.

351
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,209
(Itadori gasps)

352
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:02,667
Even though I was

353
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:02,667
with him, I... (gasps)

354
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,292
Why isn't this thing vanishing?

355
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:06,918
Is it still alive?

356
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,959
(gasps) No!

357
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,709
It's not a cursed spirit,

358
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,709
it has a physical body!

359
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,751
-(horn blares)

360
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,751
-(Kugisaki gasps)

361
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,709
Watch your ass!

362
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:18,709
Christ.

363
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,918
(passenger yelps)

364
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,751
(driver gasps) Sawamura?

365
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,751
Speed up.

366
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,834
Hit the brakes and you're dead.

367
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:30,375
Both you and him, you got that?

368
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:36,125
(tires squealing)

369
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:38,959
-(passenger whimpering)

370
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:38,959
-(blood squelches)

371
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,375
(passenger screams)

372
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,876
Listen, you, don't follow me.

373
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,500
Once I'm healed,

374
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:48,167
I'll make sure to kill these

375
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:48,167
two, especially that woman.

376
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,834
I'm sorry, Kechizu.

377
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:52,000
I wasn't able to mourn you

378
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,792
but I promise you, I

379
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,792
will get revenge for...

380
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,334
What the hell?

381
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,334
What is she doing?

382
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:58,834
Kugisaki!

383
00:12:58,918 --> 00:12:59,959
(Straw Doll swishes)

384
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,334
(nail clangs)

385
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,334
(blue light swooshes)

386
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:05,500
Yeah, don't rush me, okay?

387
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,125
Straw Doll Technique!

388
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,626
Resonance!

389
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,042
-(blue light swooshes)

390
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,042
-(weapon clangs)

391
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,042
(blood sloshes)

392
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,459
(Eso gasps)

393
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,375
[Narrator] Once sorcerers

394
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,375
land a Black Flash,

395
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:24,834
they temporarily enter a state

396
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:27,167
that athletes commonly

397
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:27,167
call the zone.

398
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,959
(Itadori thuds)

399
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,918
That hurts. (yells)

400
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,959
So it wasn't a technique to

401
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,959
turn the curse of the user.

402
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,042
(blue light sizzles)

403
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,125
Sorry.

404
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:44,834
(blue light swooshes)

405
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,834
(Itadori thuds)

406
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:50,667
(energy thundering)

407
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:53,209
(somber music)

408
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,292
(smoke hisses)

409
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,500
That hurt.

410
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,584
(game clicking)

411
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,626
All right, Geto, pay up.

412
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:09,918
What's the matter, Choso?

413
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,417
Come on.

414
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,709
(object cracks)

415
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,876
Whoa, hey, what'd

416
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,876
you do that for?

417
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,250
Both of my bothers just died.

418
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:20,459
You can sense that from here?

419
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:21,417
[Choso] What's going on?

420
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,042
It'd be one thing if he

421
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,042
was fully manifested,

422
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,959
but I can't believe both

423
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,959
my brothers were killed

424
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,209
by a single finger

425
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,209
of a cursed spirit.

426
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:29,417
Just a minute.

427
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,709
[Mahito] Crap, there

428
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,709
aren't any spares.

429
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,584
Why did you have

430
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,584
to break that one?

431
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,000
[Geto] I just got the report.

432
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,083
Eso and Kechizu were killed

433
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,125
by first-years

434
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,125
from Jujutsu High.

435
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,459
Yuji Itadori and his group.

436
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,250
(Mahito laughs)

437
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:53,334
(blinkers clicking)

438
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,959
[Voice Mail] The person you

439
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,959
have dialed is not responding.

440
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,626
If you feel you have reached

441
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,626
this number in error-

442
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,751
-Why don't they answer?

443
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,751
-(car revving)

444
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,626
Where did those brats go?

445
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:07,500
[Itadori] Kugisaki, you okay?

446
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,125
Oh, I'm okay.

447
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,834
I might have some

448
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,834
scarring, though.

449
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:12,751
I wonder if those two old dudes

450
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,292
in the truck are all right?

451
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,751
And the poisons...

452
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,959
Wow, I wonder if we head home

453
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,959
now if Shoko will be awake

454
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,000
and if she'll still be sober?

455
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,334
It's creeping me out that

456
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,334
you're being so quiet.

457
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,959
[Itadori] I was wondering,

458
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,959
was this your first time

459
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,125
killing instead of exorcizing?

460
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,500
Mm-hmm. What about you?

461
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, I did have to

462
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:34,000
do it one other time.

463
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,042
No, I guess it's

464
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,042
wrong to call it one.

465
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,250
There were three.

466
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,500
Then I think you're doing

467
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,500
worse here than I am

468
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:41,751
from the sound of it.

469
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,292
What just happened

470
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,292
meant nothing to me.

471
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,876
Just another day for a sorcerer.

472
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,500
And, I'm no Fushiguro here,

473
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:54,125
but ultimately there are only

474
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:54,125
so many people we can save.

475
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:57,000
Like, if I think of my life

476
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:57,000
as a bus ride, you know,

477
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,542
I don't want to get my

478
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,542
heart swayed by someone

479
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,375
who shouldn't have had a

480
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,375
seat in the first place.

481
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:04,417
Too mean?

482
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,000
But, then sometimes

483
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,000
there are people like you

484
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,542
who bring their own seat

485
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,542
and just sit right down.

486
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:15,209
If it helps, we didn't have

487
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:15,209
room back there to worry about

488
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:18,000
whether they were cursed

489
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:18,000
spirits or curse users.

490
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,542
Even if they were human,

491
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,542
we don't have a technique

492
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:23,209
to keep anyone that strong

493
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:23,209
restrained long-term.

494
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,834
You know that, right?

495
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:28,834
Yeah, but, he was crying

496
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:28,834
watching his brother die.

497
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,083
[Kugisaki] I see.

498
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,375
[Itadori] Don't get me wrong.

499
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,209
I'm happy you and I were

500
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,209
spared and we're still

501
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,209
alive.

502
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,083
It's a big relief.

503
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,042
But, the fact remains

504
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,042
tears were shed

505
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,459
over the lives I ended tonight.

506
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,375
That's all.

507
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,083
[Kugisaki] I see.

508
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:52,876
In that case, you and

509
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:52,876
I are accomplices.

510
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,250
[Both] (gasp) Fushiguro?

511
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:01,209
(moans) Oh, you're back.

512
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:02,751
Glad you're safe.

513
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,751
[Both] Yay, I was scared!

514
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:08,250
I thought you were dead

515
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:08,250
for sure, thank god!

516
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,751
Could you lower

517
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,751
your voices please?

518
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,417
My head hurts.

519
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,250
Don't go to sleep

520
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,250
holding Sukuna's finger.

521
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,959
That thing's dangerous.

522
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:18,959
And how would you

523
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:18,959
know about the finger?

524
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:21,209
[Kugisaki] You have the

525
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:21,209
energy to ask about that?

526
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,500
Nope, let's go ahead

527
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,500
and contact Nitta.

528
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,709
We need to seal this

529
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,709
from cursed spirits.

530
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,250
They're coming for it.

531
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,334
Oh wait, should I eat it?

532
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,918
[Kugisaki] It's not

533
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,918
some midnight snack!

534
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,792
We don't have a clear idea

535
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,834
of how many fingers

536
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,834
you can handle.

537
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:36,459
So, don't eat it.

538
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:40,083
But I will hand it over to you

539
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:40,083
since you have the most energy.

540
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:44,125
I'll say it once more

541
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:44,125
though, do not eat this.

542
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,709
(mouth gulps)

543
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:50,876
Huh?

544
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,626
(grunts) He thinks I have

545
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,626
the intelligence of a dog!

546
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:55,918
-I said don't eat it!

547
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:55,918
-He said don't eat it!

548
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,083
Huh? What?

549
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,292
I'm not the one

550
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,292
who ate it, he is!

551
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,626
Sukuna didn't even warn

552
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,626
me this time either.

553
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:03,459
[Gojo] The Sukuna within you

554
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,667
will try to regain his power

555
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,334
and that will lead

556
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,334
us to the fingers.

557
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,959
Has Gojo just been

558
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,959
winging it this whole time?

559
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,459
[Fushiguro] You

560
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,459
just realized that?

561
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,959
There you are, you

562
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,959
three little jerks!

563
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:16,834
What have you been

564
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:16,834
doing all this time?

565
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:17,834
[Itadori] Oh, it's Nitta.

566
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,292
[Kugisaki] And it sounds

567
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,292
like she's lost it.

568
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,334
[Nitta] I called! What's

569
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,334
the big idea, huh?

570
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,459
-All right, let's go.

571
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,459
-(Nitta yelling)

572
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,209
[Nitta] Keep things from

573
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,209
going sideways and you three-

574
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,709
-[Kugisaki] I'm hungry.

575
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,709
-(Nitta yelling)

576
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,042
I wonder if there's a

577
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,042
Splendid Sushi around here.

578
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,500
[Itadori] Splendid

579
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,500
Sushi's bullet train

580
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:31,626
was awesome, wasn't it?

581
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:32,709
[Kugisaki] Shut up.

582
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,125
Turns out it wasn't

583
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,167
just a cursed spirit

584
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,167
with a finger.

585
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,500
When we analyzed the

586
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,500
corpses, what a surprise.

587
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,876
It was the manifestation

588
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,876
of the other goods

589
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,959
and each of them took

590
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,959
out one special-grade.

591
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,542
And this year's first-years

592
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,542
are the cream of the crop.

593
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:51,375
I guess it's my amazing

594
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:51,375
skill as an instructor.

595
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:54,000
[Utahime] I don't want

596
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:54,000
any long chats with you

597
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:54,792
on my day off.

598
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,250
You're calling

599
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,250
about arrangements

600
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,000
for the drinking party, right?

601
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,542
[Gojo] Well, find

602
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,542
any candidates?

603
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:00,876
No, none.

604
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,209
Everyone's busy,

605
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,209
including myself.

606
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,876
What now? Should I try

607
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,876
inviting the students?

608
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,709
Sure, I'm a lightweight,

609
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,709
so I don't mind

610
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,542
if the party's alcohol-free.

611
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:10,542
You can do it.

612
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:11,751
Keep asking around.

613
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:17,042
(Gojo sighs)

614
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,709
You never know what

615
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,709
might be listening

616
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,167
around Utahime, after all.

617
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,709
I don't want to think about

618
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,375
one of the students

619
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,375
being the traitor.

620
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,125
This is such a pain.

621
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,834
Well, leave the rest

622
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,834
of you, Mei Mei.

623
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,375
(mellow music)

624
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,626
(Mei Mei laughing)

625
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:42,042
[Fushiguro] Don't

626
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:42,042
talk about them

627
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,125
resonating with Itadori.

628
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:45,125
[Kugisaki] Are you

629
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:45,125
certain about that?

630
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:46,250
I think so.

631
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:48,375
The case is over, though.

632
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:52,751
The only ones likely to

633
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:52,751
notice would be us and Nitta.

634
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:58,083
Itadori and Sukuna's

635
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:58,083
manifestation

636
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,167
was only the trigger.

637
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,584
The curse of Yasohachi

638
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,584
Bridge could've started

639
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,584
killing at any moment.

640
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,918
Besides, when he swallowed

641
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,918
that first finger

642
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,250
it was to save me.

643
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:11,459
But, there's no way he'd be

644
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:11,459
satisfied with just that.

645
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,334
So, don't tell him.

646
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:14,959
I won't say anything.

647
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:16,375
Girls know how to be discreet.

648
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,334
This is all your fault.

649
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,500
You took me in.

650
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:25,083
And now the severed parts of

651
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:25,083
my soul have all awakened.

652
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,167
(laughs) In order to save

653
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,167
lots of people, was it?

654
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,250
You little punk.

655
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,292
Other people are gonna

656
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,292
die because you live.

657
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,375
[Itadori] Hey, don't

658
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,375
say that to Fushiguro.

659
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,250
How are you going to feel

660
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,250
when someone you save

661
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,250
goes on to kill

662
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,250
someone else later?

663
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,459
[Itadori] Don't you dare say it.

664
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:47,292
(Zen'in grunting)

665
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,459
(Panda grunts)

666
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,250
(Maki gasps)

667
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,834
(punch thuds)

668
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:55,459
(Panda laughs)

669
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:58,000
[Toge] Mustard leaf.

670
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,292
Your reactions don't

671
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,292
seem very sharp today.

672
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,626
What's the deal?

673
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,083
Shut up.

674
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,626
All that time off

675
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,626
cost me my edge.

676
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,292
Yeah, obviously.

677
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,459
So, did you hear

678
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,459
about the first-years?

679
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, I heard they took

680
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:13,000
out three special-grades.

681
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:13,459
Is that true?

682
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:14,459
[Toge] Salmon.

683
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:20,250
Well, in that case, we

684
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:20,250
don't want to fall behind.

685
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:21,584
So, let's get to it.

686
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,334
[Toge] Roe.

687
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:26,125
Yeah! (gasps)

688
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:28,375
(Maki grunts)

689
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:30,626
[Panda] Hey, you hit

690
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:30,626
me for real that time!

691
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:31,500
[Maki] It wouldn't

692
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:31,500
be good training

693
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:32,500
if I wasn't serious, would it?

694
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,709
[Toge] Kelp.

695
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,459
Even among sorcerers,

696
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,459
the rank of special-grade

697
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:39,876
is a position beyond

698
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:39,876
the normal scope.

699
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,667
It's my conviction, that

700
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,667
it's the first-grades

701
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:45,709
who should lead the other

702
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:45,709
sorcerers of the jujutsu

703
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:45,709
world,

704
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,709
given all the confidential

705
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,709
information and the danger.

706
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,375
That, along with the pay

707
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,375
that they have to accept

708
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,417
is nothing like what those

709
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,042
semi-first-grade and

710
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,042
below must deal with.

711
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,667
So, with that in mind, what

712
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,667
are your recommendations?

713
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:59,500
Maki Zen'in, Panda.

714
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,334
Megumi Fushiguro

715
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,334
and Nobara Kugisaki

716
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:06,500
and then, my brother

717
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:06,500
Yuji Itadori.

718
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:10,042
So by my name, Aoi Todou...

719
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,334
[Mei Mei] And by

720
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,334
mine, Mei Mei...

721
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:13,375
[Aoi Todou and Mei Mei] We

722
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:13,375
hereby recommend these five

723
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:16,167
for promotion to first-grade.

724
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,542
(Itadori moaning)

725
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:25,209
[Itadori] I just think

726
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:25,209
you're

727
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:25,209
buying way too much stuff.

728
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,083
[Kugisaki] Half of that

729
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,083
is yours, isn't it?

730
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,083
Huh? No.

731
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,459
Only one is mine.

732
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,459
-(Itadori grunts)

733
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,459
-(paper bag rustling)

734
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,083
(Itadori sighs)

735
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:34,209
Huh?

736
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:37,375
You drop even one of those

737
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:37,375
bags and I'll kill you.

738
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:38,417
Oh, right.

739
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,751
(punch thuds)

740
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,584
(Itadori grunts)

741
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,542
I just told you that if you

742
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,542
drop even one you're dead!

743
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:52,083
I'm sorry, it was an accident!

744
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,709
-(Kugisaki growls)

745
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,709
-You just have too many bags!

746
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,375
If any of my stuff gets damaged,

747
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,918
-you're going to pay for it!

748
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,918
-(phone buzzing)

749
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,959
Fushiguro.

750
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,626
-(Itadori and Kugisaki

751
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,626
yelling)

752
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,626
-Yes.

753
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:00,792
Yeah.

754
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:02,334
All right, see ya.

755
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:05,959
What?

756
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,542
Gojo says to come

757
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,542
in, it's urgent.

758
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:09,500
[Itadori] Huh?

759
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:10,792
[Kugisaki] Yeah? What for?

760
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:12,250
An assignment.

761
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:14,125
He said it was top secret.

762
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:15,500
[Kugisaki] Huh? But

763
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:15,500
we just finished

764
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:17,250
doing a big mission for him.

765
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:18,959
Sounds good to me.

766
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:22,584
If Gojo's telling us it's

767
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:22,584
top secret, it must be big.

768
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,459
He says that a lot.

769
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,459
Only every time.

770
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,751
Yeah, but so what?

771
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:33,584
Let's go.

772
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,167
(rock music)
