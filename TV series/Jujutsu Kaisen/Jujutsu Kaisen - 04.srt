1
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:07,042
Definitely a curse womb.

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:10,209
Our window verified that

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:10,209
about three hours ago.

4
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:13,584
Once 90% were evacuated,

5
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,125
the decision was made

6
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,125
to seal off the center.

7
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:19,417
All citizens within

8
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:19,417
a 500 meter radius

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,125
have been evacuated as well.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
I have a question.

11
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:25,083
What is this window?

12
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:27,584
It's an in-house term

13
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:31,042
for unique members of Jujutsu

14
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:31,042
Tech who can see curses

15
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,209
but they aren't sorcerers.

16
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,792
[Yuuji] Oh, okay.

17
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:35,959
Let's continue.

18
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:38,751
Detainee block two.

19
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:41,792
At present, five

20
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:41,792
detainees are still inside

21
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,292
along with the curse womb.

22
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:47,792
If the curse womb is the

23
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:47,792
type that metamorphose,

24
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:51,083
we predict it will become a

25
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:51,083
special grade curse spirit.

26
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,417
[Both Voiceover] Special grade?

27
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,167
Hey, so I still don't

28
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,167
really understand

29
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,959
what this special grade means.

30
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:02,083
All right, allow me to

31
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:02,083
explain it idiot level.

32
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:06,459
First there's grade four, a

33
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:06,459
wooden bat is enough for them.

34
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,125
Grade three, if you have a

35
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,125
handgun, you can rest easy.

36
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,292
Grade two, close

37
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,292
call with a shotgun.

38
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,792
Grade one, even a tank

39
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,792
may be insufficient.

40
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:17,083
Then special grade, well,

41
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:17,083
you might be on even footing

42
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:20,292
if you carpet bomb it

43
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:20,292
with cluster bombs.

44
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,375
That is bad.

45
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,292
Normally, a sorcerer on

46
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,292
par with the cursed spirit

47
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,500
would handle this.

48
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:29,209
And in this case, that

49
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:29,209
would have been Gojou.

50
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:30,042
That figures.

51
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,459
So, where is Gojou then?

52
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,459
[Megumi] Away on business.

53
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:37,334
Guy like him has

54
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:37,334
better things to do

55
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:40,334
than loaf around the

56
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:40,334
school in the first place.

57
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,209
Don't expect any souvenirs.

58
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:45,167
Unfortunately, we're often

59
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:45,167
short handed in this business.

60
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,500
You'll often have to

61
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,500
undertake missions

62
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,042
beyond your expertise.

63
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,042
However, this current

64
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,042
case is an urgent one

65
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,459
and most of abnormal.

66
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,667
So no matter what, don't fight.

67
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,167
And if you should

68
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,167
encounter a special grade,

69
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,500
you run or you die.

70
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:03,334
(Nobara and Yuuji gasp)

71
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:07,250
Please do not

72
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:07,250
disregard your fears.

73
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:10,167
And don't forget that your

74
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:10,167
entire mission here today

75
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,667
is strictly the

76
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,667
verification

77
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,667
and rescue of survivors.

78
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,542
Excuse me, sir, tell

79
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,542
me, where's my son?

80
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:16,751
[Security] Stay back, ma'am,

81
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:16,751
you can't come in here.

82
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:17,751
Move back, please.

83
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:18,751
Where's Tadashi?

84
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,459
I need to know if my son

85
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,459
Tadashi is all right.

86
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,209
[Security] Please calm down

87
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,209
ma'am, you must stay back.

88
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,083
-Please let me through.

89
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,083
-Its too dangerous.

90
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:28,167
She's a guardian

91
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:28,167
here for a visit.

92
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,918
Please leave, madam.

93
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's possible that someone may

94
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
have released poisonous gas

95
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,083
in the compound.

96
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,167
I'm afraid we can't share any

97
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,167
more details at this time.

98
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:43,209
Oh, no (crying)

99
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:47,709
Why is this happening (crying)

100
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,918
Fushiguro, Kugisaki,

101
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,918
we'll save them.

102
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,417
Of course.

103
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,209
(Megumi grunting)

104
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:59,042
(Opening Theme Music)

105
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:18,417
(singing in Japanese)

106
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,626
(footsteps clicking)

107
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:31,709
Be careful.

108
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:35,292
I'll put up my veil,

109
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,667
emerge from darkness

110
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,667
blacker still

111
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:40,459
purify that which is impure.

112
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:44,000
(veil bubbling)

113
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:45,334
Huh?

114
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,500
Day's turning into night.

115
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:50,334
That's part of the veil.

116
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,375
Since there's a

117
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,375
residential area nearby,

118
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,918
we use it to conceal us

119
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,918
from those on the outside.

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,167
Awesome.

121
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,250

122
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:02,834

(Dog howling)

125
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:08,042
He'll let us know if

126
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:08,042
the curse gets close.

127
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:09,584
Good boy, buddy.

128
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,959
What a good boy.

129
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,709
You know, we're all

130
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,709
counting on you.

131
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:17,083
(door creaking)

132
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:18,209
Let's go

(footsteps clicking)

134
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:22,834
Hold up.

135

(gasping) what the hell is this?

136
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:29,959
What's going on here?

137
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:34,209
I thought this was only a two

138
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:34,209
story dorm building, isn't it?

139
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,584
Well, maybe it's a

140
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,584
condo, chill out.

141
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,000
[Megumi Voiceover] No, it's not.

142
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,751
It's the deployment

143
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,751
of an innate domain

144
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:44,250
due to cursed energy, I've

145
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:44,250
never seen one this big

146
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:44,250
before.

147
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,667
The door.

148
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,083
Hey, it's gone.

149
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,250
Impossible.

150
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:53,083
No way, we just came through

151
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:53,083
that door a second ago.

152
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,876
[Both] What do we

153
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,876
do, what do we do,

154
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,751
-its a major problem.

155
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,751
-[Megumi] We'll be fine.

156
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,375
The dog remembers the

157
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,375
scent of the entrance.

158
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,375
[Both] Oh, good.

159
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,459
-Good dog, good dog boy

160
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,459
-Good boy, good boy.

161
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:04,417
-Whose a good boy, huh,

162
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:04,417
-Now you can have all the

163
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,918
-Oh that's right,

164
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,918
-beef jerky you want.

-Stop playing around.

You rock Fushiguro,

168
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,959
you're such a pro.

169
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:13,375
Thanks to you, we can rescue

170
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:13,375
some people and save ourselves.

171
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,918
Let's keep moving.

172
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:22,417
(eerie music)

173
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:50,334
Horrible.

174
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:54,042
Looks like three victims, right?

175
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,334
[Mother]

176
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,334
Where's Tadashi,

177
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:03,292
I need to know if my son,

178
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:03,292
Tadashi, is all right.

179
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,959
Let's take this

180
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,959
body back with us,

181
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:09,167
this is that woman's son.

182
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,209
But.

183
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,000
His face isn't too mangled.

184
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,459
How will she accept his death,

185
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,083
if we can't show her

186
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,083
a body to prove it?

187
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,000
(clothes shuffling)

188
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,459
We still have to find

189
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,459
and verify two more,

190
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,375
leave that body behind.

191
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,459
That makes no sense,

192
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,667
the way we got inside

193
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,667
isn't even there anymore,

194
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:29,167
we won't be able to

195
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:29,167
come back for it later.

196
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,375
I didn't say we'd come back,

197
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,375
I said, leave it behind.

198
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,667
I'm not about to risk

199
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,667
my own life for someone

200
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:37,292
I had no intention of

201
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:37,292
saving in the first place,

202
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,459
so forget it.

203

You had no intention

204
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,542
of saving him?

205
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,042
Are you kidding?

206
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,834
It's a juvy detention center

207
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:46,334
and as a Jujutsu sorcerer,

208
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,584
I had access to

209
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,584
information about this guy.

210
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,042
Tadashi here, hit and killed

211
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,209
a little girl on her

212
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,209
way home from school

213
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,959
while driving without a license.

214
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:58,500
And that was his second offense.

215
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:02,542
I know you're keen on this

216
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:02,542
idea of saving lots of people

217
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,375
and guiding them

218
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,375
to proper deaths,

219
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,876
but think how are

220
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,876
you going to feel

221
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,918
when someone you save goes on

222
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,918
to kill someone else later.

223
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,584
So why'd you bother

224
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,584
saving me then?

225
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:18,542
You both need to cut it

out (groans in frustration)

227

with the two of you?

229

Are you guys both idiots?

230
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,751
This is hardly the time

231

Hey Sukuna, if I die here

352
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:04,500
Ow, Ow, Ow.

353
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,334
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

354
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:07,751
Why am I doing this?

355
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:11,083
If only I hadn't picked

356
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:11,083
up that finger back then.

357
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,542
If only I hadn't eaten it.

358

If only, if only.

359
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,334
Stop it, don't think.

360
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,876
No, no, I wanna run, I

361
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,876
wanna run, I wanna run.

362
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:26,959
I don't wanna die.

363
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:33,042
If I died here, if

364
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:33,042
I actually died,

365
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,042
would that be a proper death?

366
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:39,542
(light zapping)

367
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:40,667
Don't think.

368
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,417
[Grandpa] So, try

369
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,417
to help others.

(ground booming)

371
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:51,709
Have I, have I gotten so weak?

372
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,250
You, I know your face now.

373
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:00,334
I swear, I'm going to curse you.

We're out here now, let's go.

377
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,918
You know, I really hate frogs.

378
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,584
Well, that's too damn bad.

379
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:32,542
I was so proud, I thought

380
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:32,542
I was really strong.

381
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,459
At least strong enough

382
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,459
that I could choose

383
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,334
when and how I die, but I'm not.

384
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:42,125
I'm weak.

385
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,042
I'm way too weak.

386
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't wanna die

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
but I am gonna die.

388
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:54,125
No way, not like this.

389
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,250
No (sobbing)

390

[Yuuji Voiceover]

392
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,626
A proper death,

393
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,000
yeah, right, don't be naive.

[Man] Jujutsu sorceress

395
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,834

[Yuuji Voiceover] Still,

397
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,626
I wanna be able to say my

death was a proper one.

become a source of curses.

402
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,417
[Yuuji Voiceover] So,

403
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,417
all the hate, the fear,

404
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:29,959
the regret, let it all out

Damn, nothing.

(dog howling)

411
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,000
[Yuuji Voiceover] The howl.

(dog howling)

413
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,709
[Yuuji Voiceover] That must

414
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,709
be the signal from Kushiguro.

(face whooshing)

416

[Sukuna] Incredible,

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,417
what a pain this brat is.

(upbeat music)

419
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,959
Incredible, what a

pain this brat is.

421
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:30,709
It's obvious he's just

422
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:30,709
screwing around with me.

423
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,083
Hold on a minute,

424
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,083
I'm thinking here.

425
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,584
What I need, is some

426
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,584
way to make him regret

427
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,542
doing all of this.

428
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,584
[Sukuna Voiceover] Nah,

429
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,584
if I went after him,

430
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:46,375
the punk would just

431
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:46,375
switch right back.

432
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,250
So the thing that would

433
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,250
cause him the most trouble,

434
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:52,250
is probably this.

435
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,667
I'll just put things

436
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,667
back the way they were.

437
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,459
All right, let's

Idiot.

Oh, shit I healed

443
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,751

(curse gasping in shock)

What, you don't

446
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,417
like to take walks?

447
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,626
Well, that's true.

448
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,459
Cursed spirits are

449
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,459
usually supposed to stay

450
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:27,626
where they're born.

451
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,792
Fine, fine, in that case,

452
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:32,709
you will die here.

(groaning in effort)

458
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,459
Yeah good, that's the way,

459
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,459
just try a little harder.

(air whooshing)

462
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:59,500
Even a cursed spirit is

463
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:59,500
bound to miss his arm.

464
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,417

(water splashing)

467
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,500
[Megumi] You need to

468
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,500
expand the evacuation area

469
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:19,167
to 10 kilometers.

470
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,667
[Kitoyaka] What about you?

471
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,667
I'll stay, I'm going

472
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,667
to wait for Itadori.

473
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:26,042
Understood, all right,

474
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,334
let me get Kugisaki

to the hospital.

476
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,667
Then I'll come back here of you.

477
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:34,959
No, you wouldn't be of that

478
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:34,959
much use in this situation.

479
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,959
To really help, you could

480
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,959
have them send us a sorcerer

481
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:40,334
whose grade one or higher.

482
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,125
If one was around.

483
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,334
I'll do my best, later.

484

[Megumi Voiceover] Even

485

if this goes south,

486

if the worst case happens.

487
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,500
I don't want him to die?

488
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:02,375
Gojou, can you save him?

489
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,834
It will be my

490
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,834
responsibility to end him.

491
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:12,542
Hey, did you know about this?

492
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:14,375
Surprisingly, you and I both

493
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:17,375
are apparently classified

494
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:17,375
as special grade.

495
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:20,167
Good job, you and me, man.

497
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:34,125
All right, special grade.

498
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,834
You just keep trying.

Pleased with yourself?

501
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:44,250
You want praise now?

502
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,375
But healing with cursed

503
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,375
energy,

504
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,375
isn't all that difficult.

505
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:52,042
It's a lot easier for cursing

506
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:52,042
spirits than it is for humans.

507
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:56,209
Neither you nor this

punk whose body I'm in,

509
00:19:56,292 --> 00:20:00,209
truly understand what

510
00:19:56,292 --> 00:20:00,209
curses really are.

511
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:02,375
This is a good opportunity.

512
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:08,209
So I will use it to show you

513
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:08,209
exactly what real Jujutsu is.

(curse splattering)

518
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:32,167
I was only planning to

519
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:32,167
slice you into three

520
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,209
but I guess you were

521
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,209
weaker than I thought.

522
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:39,459
Oh yeah and then there's this.

523
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,375
I will be taking this.

524
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:47,876
(fire whooshing)

525
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,125
It's over you punk.

526
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:57,834
What are you waiting for,

527
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,417
if you're gonna switch

528
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,417
then do it already.

529
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:07,209
Oh, oh, something wrong brat?

530
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,792
(laughing)

531
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,209
Well, well.

532
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,417
(Closing Theme Music)

533
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,918
(Nobara, Megumi and Yuuji)

534
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,918
Juju Stroll

535
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,083
Yes, yes I understand.

536
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,125
Yes, indeed, thank

537
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,125
you very much.

538
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,250
Yes.

539
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,751
What's the matter?

540
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,334
You bow even when you're

541
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,334
talking on the phone?

542
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:04,000
(laughing) Well,

543
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:04,000
when I'm on a call

544
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,584
I get so wrapped up in

545
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,584
talking to that person

546
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,459
that it feels like

547
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,459
they're really there.

548
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:11,250
Oh, I get that, I've

549
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:11,250
even hurt my neck before,

550
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:12,792
dealing with those

551
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:12,792
damn ingrown hairs

552
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,459
while I was depilating,

553
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,459
what's worse,

554
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,626
I've damaged my pores.

555
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:17,792
That's not even

556
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:17,792
remotely the same.

557
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,751
You always sound pissed off

558
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,751
when you're on the phone,

559
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:21,959
Fushiguro.

560
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,959
That's because of Gojou, it's

561
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,959
not because of the phone.

562
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:28,584
Itadori, when you're on

563
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:28,584
the phone, you walk around.

564
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,000
Speaking of phones,

565
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,000
I bet you can't stay on a call

566
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,876
while holding your

567
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,876
phone like this.

568
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,792
(bell ringing)

569
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:39,292
(bell ringing)

570
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,834
(Nobara gasping)

571
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:45,876
-(Nobara screaming)

572
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:45,876
-(phone shattering)

573
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,709
(upbeat music)
