1
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,209
[Aoi Toudou] The hands will

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,209
never surpass the eyes.

3
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,959
Unless you cultivate the eyes

4
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,959
to discern good from bad,

5
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,751
you cannot hope to

6
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,751
improve the hands

7
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:16,000
that create works of art.

8
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:22,751
It's a phrase that's

9
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:22,751
often used among creators,

10
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,209
but it applies to

11
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,209
all kinds of fields.

12
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:26,751
Those with good

13
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:26,751
eyes will improve

14
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,209
far more rapidly

15
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,209
than those without!

16
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:29,959
(energetic music)

17
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:33,042
(grunting)

18
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:46,083
When I throw my right

19
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:46,083
horizontal punch...

20
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,626
he immediately sends

21
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,626
a left vertical jab!

22
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,292
Itadori wasn't moving

23
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,292
like this before!

24
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,417
He's improving...

25
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,250
by devouring me!

26
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,292
(grunting)

27
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,417
What a beautiful way

28
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,417
to knock me down!

29
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,083
[Yuuji Itadori] His

30
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,083
face is wide open!

31
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:05,209
I can hit it!

32
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:08,083
Even with Divergent Fist!

33
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,250
(gasps)

34
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,250
Somehow he stopped my

35
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,250
fist with his forehead

36
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:16,042
before it could

37
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:16,042
reach full speed!

38
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:20,918
That's not exactly what I

39
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:20,918
want you to devour right now.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,834
Your Divergent Fist is

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,834
created by your cursed energy

42
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,167
lagging slightly behind your

43
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,167
superhuman physical prowess,

44
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,125
when normally there'd

45
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,125
be no lag at all.

46
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,500
It's a tricky move.

47
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:34,500
Your average sorcerer

48
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:34,500
wouldn't know what happened,

49
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:36,709
and they'd be left disoriented.

50
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:38,125
It has lots of force, too.

51
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:40,959
Enough for opponents on

52
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:40,959
that level, at least.

53
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:41,834
(gasps)

54
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:45,209
But it won't work

55
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:45,209
against special-grades.

56
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:47,000
What will you do, best friend?

57
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:53,042
I'll use my full strength and

58
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:53,042
imbue it with cursed energy.

59
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,667
Good!

60
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:57,834
If that's so, why is your

61
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:57,834
cursed energy lagging?

62
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:58,667
I know why!

63
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,083
It's because you're

64
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,083
channeling it!

65
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,667
Huh?

66
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:08,250
Wait, I thought we were

67
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:08,250
talking

68
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:08,250
about channeling it faster.

69
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:10,000
When we channel cursed energy,

70
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,918
it is a technique

71
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,918
that most sorcerers

72
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,709
are conscious of doing.

73
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:15,167
My stomach's full of rage,

74
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,751
or, the blood is

75
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,751
boiling in my gut.

76
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,334
The theory is that cursed energy

77
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:22,083
extracted from such negative

78
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:22,083
emotions starts in the navel

79
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,751
and is channeled

80
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,751
throughout the body.

81
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,500
They say it flows from

82
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,500
the navel to the chest,

83
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:30,792
then to the shoulders,

84
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:30,792
arms, and finally the fists.

85
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,542
But this view of the

86
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,542
body as individual parts

87
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:36,334
is what delays cursed energy.

88
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,709
The idea of channeling

89
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,709
cursed energy isn't wrong,

90
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,292
but that's only the first step.

91
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,709
You can't let yourself remain

92
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,709
too trapped by that concept.

93
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,709
The better the sorcerer,

94
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,709
the harder it is

95
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,792
to read the flow of

96
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,792
their cursed energy.

97
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,918
Yours is hard to read

98
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,918
for a different reason.

99
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,334
Would you say sorcerers

100
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,334
think using their guts?

101
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,292
Do we express anger

102
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,292
with our heads?

103
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,042
Now listen to me, Itadori.

104
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,042
(gasps)

105
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,584
(eagle screeches)

106
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,250
(moving orchestral music)

107
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:15,417
We exist in this world

108
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:15,417
with our entire mind,

109
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,792
body, and soul as one whole.

110
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:20,417
It's such a given that no

111
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:20,417
one even thinks about it.

112
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,626
Thank you, Toudou.

113
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,250
I think now...

114
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,417
I understand.

115
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:35,876
Good.

116
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,375
Then no more words are needed.

117
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,876
I won't hold back!

118
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:49,209
I'll guide you with

119
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:49,209
my full strength!

120
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,250
Don't die on me, Itadori!

121
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:53,459
Rise up to greater heights!

122
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,792
(Opening theme music)

123
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:04,417
(singing in Japanese)

124
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:28,250
(birds whistling)

125
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,125
Hey, you!

126
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:33,667
Your old fart Principal told

127
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:33,667
you to kill Itadori, didn't

128
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:33,667
he?

129
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:34,918
(gasps)

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,375
This girl has good intuition!

131
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,500
No, Panda who figured that out.

132
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,417
Huh? What are you saying?

133
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,709
You don't need to try

134
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,709
and hide it from me.

135
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,959
I'm out to kill someone, too.

136
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:47,959
To be specific,

137
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:50,417
that watered-down version

138
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:50,417
of Maki named Mai.

139
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,918
Huh?

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,584
Oh don't "huh" me.

141
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,542
Even Pepper usually has a

142
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,542
wittier comeback than that

143
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,542
one.

144
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,584
Why isn't this making her mad?

145
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,500
Instead, I'm the one

146
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,500
getting pissed off!

147
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:05,375
Oh right, you guys

148
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:05,375
have your own version

149
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,751
of Pepper don't you?

150
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:07,918
Yeah, I forgot.

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,417
Maybe I should scrap him and

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,417
dump the parts somewhere!

153
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,542
(eerie music)

154
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:14,542
[Panda] Scary.

155
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,584
Huh?

156
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,000
(Panda grunts)

157
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,042
Panda, no!

158
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:26,250
It's a cursed corpse,

159
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:26,250
so it won't die.

160
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,542
But it won't be able

161
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,542
to move for a while.

162
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:32,626
Now, who was it you

163
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:32,626
were going to scrap?

164
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,000
Hold on, Mechamaru.

165
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,209
I'll teach this first-year

166
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,209
she's not quite as cute

167
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,792
as she thinks she is.

168
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,626
I'll show her how

169
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,626
Mai has suffered,

170
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,167
and teach her what it means

171
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,334
for a woman to live

172
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,334
as a jujutsu sorcerer.

173
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:49,417
Just kidding!

174
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:51,959
(Panda grunts)

175
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,209
(grunting)

176
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:55,959
What are you trying to do?

177
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,417
Focus on support and

178
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,417
staying out of sight!

179
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,542
Let's just try to

180
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,542
get along, all right?

181
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:02,459
Since you and I are so similar.

182
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,876
You idiot puppet!

183
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,792
(mysterious music)

184
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:14,792
You don't know anything!

185
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:20,500
Oh good grief, what happened

186
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:20,500
to us hunting cursed spirits?

187
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:23,250
Sword option.

188
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:26,167
(metal clanging)

189
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,292
Boost on.

190
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,292
(blasting)

191
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,042
(gasps)

192
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,083
Ultra Spin!

193
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:39,918
(blasts)

194
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,500
(tree creaking)

195
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,459
Can't you hold still?

196
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:50,500
I need to finish this quickly.

197
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:54,083
I'd rather leave him

198
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:54,083
be and go help Nobara,

199
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,417
but he fires at range.

200
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
We didn't have information

201
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
on him, Nishimiya, or Miwa.

202
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:02,083
You're very strong.

203
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,334
What grade are you?

204
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,876
This is my estimate of

205
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,876
everyone's standing.

206
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,334
It's a little more

207
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,334
than Nobara can handle.

208
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,500
I don't think my rating

209
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,500
against cursed spirits

210
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,500
is important right

211
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,500
now, but I'll tell you.

212
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,626
Semi-first-grade.

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,918
[Panda] Yikes!

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,250
[Mechamaru] Ultra Cannon!

215
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,751
[Panda] His area

216
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,751
of attack is huge!

217
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,709
(blasts)

218
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,083
(dramatic music)

219
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,334
(exhales)

220
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:36,584
Heat emission!

221
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,375
It's a technique with a big

222
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,375
buildup and a long cool-down.

223
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:40,918
[Mechamaru] This

224
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:40,918
output is pointless

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,918
unless I hit its core dead-on.

226
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:46,083
[Masamichi Yaga] Cursed corpses.

227
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,459
That's the generic name

228
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,459
for inanimate objects

229
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,167
that house curses and can

230
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,167
operate independently.

231
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:55,709
Man-made cursed corpses

232
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:55,709
always have a core,

233
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,375
which serves as their heart.

234
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,959
I, Yaga Masamichi,

235
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,959
am the leading expert

236
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:07,375
on puppeteering

237
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:07,375
cursed techniques,

238
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,751
and Panda is my

239
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,751
ultimate masterpiece.

240
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,834
He's a cursed corpse

241
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,834
born with emotions.

242
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,584
(intense music)

243
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,918
A cursed corpse mutation.

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,959
Panda...

245
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,125
is not a panda!

246
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:31,417
(thumping)

247
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:35,959
(shouts)

248
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,334
(grunting)

249
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,751
[Mechamaru] I can't

250
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,751
follow his movements!

251
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,167
(grunting)

252
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,834
(dramatic music)

253
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:58,667
You know what?

254
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,542
I would have heard rumors

255
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:01,709
if there was someone

256
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:01,709
out there like me.

257
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,000
So the fact that I haven't

258
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,834
means that you're

259
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,834
not a cursed corpse.

260
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:07,667
You're a sorcerer who's

261
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:07,667
remote-controlling this thing

262
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:10,542
while your real

263
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:10,542
body is elsewhere.

264
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:14,167
So why get offended at being

265
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:14,167
treated like a cursed corpse?

266
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,584
Don't wanna be like me?

267
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:18,042
I feel wounded!

268
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,959
That is so hurtful!

269
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,542
Judging by your high

270
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,542
cursed energy output,

271
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:27,584
your main body probably

272
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:27,584
isn't too far away.

273
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,667
It's right outside

274
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,667
the arena, huh?

275
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:32,209
Guess there's no point in

276
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:32,209
hunting you down, then.

277
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,667
You'd just be free to

278
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,667
act in the meantime.

279
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,667
So I guess I'll

280
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,667
just bust you up.

281
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:39,584
You won't be doing

282
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:39,584
either of those.

283
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,000
Heavenly Pact.

284
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,250
Have you heard of it?

285
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,042
It's not the kind of pact

286
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,042
one would normally

287
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,042
forge with oneself.

288
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,209
This fateful pact

289
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,209
was forced on me

290
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,375
the second I entered this world.

291
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,000
I was born without a right arm

292
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,042
and with nothing at

293
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,042
all below my knees,

294
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,209
and I have no sensation

295
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,209
from the waist down.

296
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,000
My skin is so fragile that

297
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,000
even moonlight burns it.

298
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,375
It feels like needles

299
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,375
are constantly stabbing

300
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,209
into every pore of my body.

301
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,000
But in exchange

302
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,000
I've been granted

303
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,626
immense cursed energy production

304
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,834
and the ability to

305
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,834
use cursed techniques

306
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:11,876
over vast distances.

307
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,042
I didn't ask for

308
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,042
any of this power.

309
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,417
In fact, if I could trade

310
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,417
my cursed techniques

311
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,626
to have a normal body,

312
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,626
I'd gladly do so.

313
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:23,500
And so, when I see a

314
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:23,500
cursed corpse like you

315
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:25,292
walking around in broad daylight

316
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,626
without a care in the world...

317
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:29,083
instead of me...

318
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,042
I cannot stand it!!

319
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,918
(whirring)

320
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,667
Ultimate Mechamaru!

321
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,834
Mode: Albatross!

322
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,250
[Panda] That's an incredible

323
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,250
amount of cursed energy!

324
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,542
And given his position...

325
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,250
Nobara's in his line of fire!

326
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:47,834
I have to block it!

327
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,667
[Mechamaru] Ultimate Cannon!

328
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:54,083

00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,792
(fire crackling)

330
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:06,667
Is it dead?

331
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:12,375
No. The very concept of

332
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:12,375
death doesn't apply to you.

333
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,667
[Panda] You revealed your

334
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,667
technique while complaining

335
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,918
about your misfortune, earlier.

336
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,918
Quite the sorcerer thing to do.

337
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,834
It's still alive?

338
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:27,542
After taking a hit

339
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:27,542
from Ultimate Cannon?

340
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,792
(stomp)

341
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,918
[Panda] I'm kind

342
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,918
of pissed off now.

343
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:37,042
(Mechamaru's voice quavers)

344
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,334
What form is that?

345
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,375
[Masamichi Yaga] Panda...

346
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,000
is not a panda!

347
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,918
(energetic music)

348
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:53,167
(energetic music)

349
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:58,834
(wooden blocks clacking)

350
00:12:58,918 --> 00:12:59,834
Panda...

351
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:04,125
You should know you

352
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:04,125
have an older brother

353
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:05,125
and sister.

354
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,334
No I don't.

355
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,959
Yes, but they're inside of you.

356
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:13,667
It's hard to explain.

357
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,000
Inside of me?

358
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes.

359
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,167
You'll get it someday.

360
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,000
And in the meantime,

361
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,000
those two...

362
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,250
will always be there

363
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,250
to lend you strength.

364
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,250
[Mechamaru] Sword

365
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,250
Option: Ultra Shield!

366
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,042
(metal shattering)

367
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,375
(grunting)

368
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:39,375
[Panda] Normally a cursed corpse

369
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,209
has a single core for its heart,

370
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,626
but there are three

371
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,626
cores inside me,

372
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,918
and by switching out which

373
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,918
one is the main core,

374
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,459
I can convert my body.

375
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,209
There's the Panda core,

376
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,209
focused on balance,

377
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,834
my older brother, Gorilla Core,

378
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,042
focused on power for

379
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,042
short, decisive battles.

380
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,250
and my bashful older sister.

381
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:01,876
His first attack got

382
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:01,876
my older sister's core,

383
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,417
and that last one

384
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,417
exhausted the Panda core!

385
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,792
Now the only choice

386
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,792
I'm left with is...

387
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,459
to beat him with Gorilla Mode!

388
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,209
(boom)

389
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,876
(dramatic music)

390
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,042
[Mechamaru] He doesn't pack

391
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,042
as much power as Toudou.

392
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,876
But that palm strike just now...

393
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,709
went all the way

394
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,709
to my internals.

395
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:28,250
Even if I block it,

396
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:28,250
I'll still incur damage.

397
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,083
You get it now?

398
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,417
This is Gorilla

399
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,417
Mode's special move!

400
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,125
(beats chest)

401
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,792
The unstoppable Drumming Beat!

402
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,918
[Mechamaru] If I take

403
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,918
that Drumming Beat

404
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,751
to my head or chest,

405
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:41,876
I won't be able to

406
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:41,876
move Mechamaru anymore.

407
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:45,876
My right arm's Sword Option

408
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:45,876
is no longer functioning.

409
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,083
I can't fire Ultimate

410
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,083
Cannon anymore, either.

411
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:52,918
[Panda] Gorilla Mode pounds

412
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:52,918
through cursed energy

413
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,626
like a gorilla, but

414
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,626
I need to hurry.

415
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:56,626
I crushed his right arm,

416
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,500
so he can't fire off his

417
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,500
ultimate attack anymore.

418
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,125
And with no swords in

419
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,125
his left or his mouth,

420
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,083
he only has ranged blasts left.

421
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,292
Even so, he won't

422
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,292
fire them randomly.

423
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,959
Mechamaru believes he's

424
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,959
already failed to finish me

425
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,626
with those blasts twice,

426
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,626
when the truth is,

427
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,751
he actually put two of

428
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,751
my cores close to death.

429
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,959
His next move is to blast my

430
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,959
core with point-blank

431
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,959
precision

432
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,667
or try to finish

433
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,667
me with a slash.

434
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:22,709
However...

435
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:28,334
(energetic music)

436
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,042
at close range, I

437
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,042
have the advantage!

438
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,375
(energetic rock music)

439
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,918
(grunting)

440
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:00,000
(intense music)

441
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,167
(grunting)

442
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,042
A tile?

443
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,250
Did he pick it off

444
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,250
the roof just now?

445
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,792
(grunts)

446
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:06,042
First a distraction,

447
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:06,042
then jet acceleration!

448
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,250
He's experienced at this!

449
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,459
[Mechamaru] This

450
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,459
time, I won't miss!

451
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:14,083
His cursed energy is

452
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:14,083
densest at his core!

453
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,542
Right here!

454
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,792
(groans)

455
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,709
You did well for a mere puppet.

456
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,459
(grunts)

457
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:31,542
(gasps)

458
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:33,459
[Panda] Don't treat me

459
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:33,459
like other cursed corpses.

460
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,626
I know how to bluff

461
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,626
the position of my core

462
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:38,083
with cursed energy manipulation.

463
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,459
I've already concealed the

464
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,459
number of cores I have.

465
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,709
(grunts)

466
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,667
(tiles shattering)

467
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:55,292
You lost because you

468
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:55,292
underestimated puppets.

469
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,167
I haven't had a

470
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,167
single thing in common

471
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,042
with anyone around me from

472
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,042
the moment I was born.

473
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:04,042
I thought maybe you and I

474
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:04,042
could relate to each other

475
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,083
because of that.

476
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:10,834
But I'm not jealous of

477
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:10,834
humans, and I never have been.

478
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:11,500
You're not?

479
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:14,209
I mean, humans are creepy.

480
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:15,250
(gasps)

481
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:17,667
(soft piano music)

482
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,334
They'll risk their

483
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,334
lives and fight hard

484
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,667
to reach their goals,

485
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,667
then suddenly turn around

486
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,667
and be laid-back or wishy-washy.

487
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:24,918
I don't get them.

488
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:28,667
Still, I do love those

489
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:28,667
aspects that I don't have,

490
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:29,667
creepy as they are.

491
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,125
You have your own

492
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,125
hardships too, Mechamaru.

493
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:37,751
But just having more hardships

494
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:37,751
doesn't make you right.

495
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,709
It's not like we're

496
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,709
enemies in the first place.

497
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,876
I mean, why'd you

498
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,876
become a sorcerer?

499
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:47,000
Was it just the only thing

500
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:47,000
you thought you could do?

501
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,584
Not that it makes

502
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,584
any difference.

503
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,334
But if you want to do

504
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,334
something

505
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,334
else with your life...

506
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:54,083
I'd help you.

507
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,542
(sighs)

508
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:01,083
Mechamaru, don't waste

509
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:01,083
your powerful moves.

510
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:04,959
The foe in front of you

511
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:04,959
may not be the only one.

512
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,500
Mechamaru, someone who

513
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,500
can't instantly state

514
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:11,167
his type of woman can never be

515
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,500
a full-fledged jujutsu sorcerer.

516
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:18,167
Mechamaru, instead of chocolate

517
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:18,167
I got you some of these!

518
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,250
I heard the double A Evoltas

519
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,250
are one of your favorites.

520
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,000
[Mechamaru] I'm not

521
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,000
built like that.

522
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,334
(gasps)

523
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:27,709
-Liars!

524
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:27,709
-(laughing)

525
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,751
One day...

526
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:32,167
(sloshing)

527
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:41,834
(soft piano music)

528
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,542
I'll be together with everyone.

529
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,375
[Panda] Hm? Did

530
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,375
you say something?

531
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,584
I wonder if you'll

532
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,584
still say you'll help me

533
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,292
after you see what I look like.

534
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,250
Huh?

535
00:19:58,334 --> 00:19:59,250
(laughing)

536
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,584
You think someone

537
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,584
who looks like me

538
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,751
is gonna fuss over

539
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,751
what you look like?

540
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:04,751
I'm a panda!

541
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,918
Later.

542
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,876
Let me pay you a

543
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,876
visit next time.

544
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:17,459
Shut up damn puppet.

545
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:24,292
Oh, I forgot...

546
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,292
Huh?

547
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,792
[Panda] Lend me your phone.

548
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,167
(birds whistling)

549
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,459
(swords clanging)

550
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,792
(grunting)

551
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,167
[Miwa Kasumi] No way!

552
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,792
This woman...

553
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,459
is incredibly strong!

554
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:50,083
(closing theme music)

555
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,709
(singing in Japanese)

556
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,500
-(quirky music)

557
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,500
-[Mechamaru] Juju Stroll.

558
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,292
Mechamaru, I need you

559
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,292
to let Noritoshi know

560
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,500
Utahime's calling him.

561
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:27,667
Mechamaru?

562
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:30,959
Please, take this

563
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:30,959
book to Toudou, okay?

564
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,209
Mechamaru!

565
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:34,584
Perfect timing.

566
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,959
Please, could you deliver

567
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,959
this box to Toudou and Kamo?

568
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:41,375
What the hell?

569
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,334
What do I look like,

570
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,334
your messenger boy?

571
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:44,417
(gasps)

572
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,751
(curious music)

573
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,751
Don't try to talk

574
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,751
to me right now.

575
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,292
Takada's live-streaming

576
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,292
and I intend to watch it!

577
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,209
Ibaragi?

578
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,792
You mean Ibaraki.

579
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,250
So how is it that

580
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,250
you don't know that?

581
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:03,751
[Both] Uh, because they're

582
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:03,751
too much trouble, obviously.

583
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:13,751
[Miwa] To be honest, I'm

584
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:13,751
still scared of both of

585
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:13,751
them.

586
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,417
[All] But if I admit that,

587
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,417
I might not be able to

588
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,417
ask him favors anymore.

589
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,792
-Mechamaru?

590
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,792
-Hm?

591
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:23,459
(exciting music)

592
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,792
We're all counting on you!

593
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:27,500
Yeah!

594
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:28,500
(gasps)

595
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:30,584
[All] Gotta run! Time

596
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:30,584
for our missions!

597
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,584
Wait!

598
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,584
Why?

599
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,459
(gentle guitar music)

600
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,500
Oh well.

601
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,375
It's good that they

602
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,375
can rely on me...

603
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,000
I guess.

604
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,834
(intense music)

605
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:51,667
(singing in Japanese)
