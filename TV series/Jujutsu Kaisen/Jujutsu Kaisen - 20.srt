1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:06,459
-(Todo yelling)

2
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:06,459
-(punches thudding)

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,918
[Todo] When I

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,918
was in third grade

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,876
I beat up a cocky

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,876
high school kid.

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,584
(kid groaning)

8
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,667
Even if he was older,

9
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,667
cocky is still cocky.

10
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,626
The kid was mockin' me!

11
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,459
(bird calling)

12
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,542
(hand scraping)

13
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:33,584
And when I feel mocked, well,

14
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,876
that's as good as a

15
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,876
starting bell in the ring!

16
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:38,959
It wasn't even that fun.

17
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:41,375
I found out that

18
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:41,375
trouncing a boring guy

19
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:42,751
was naturally boring too.

20
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,751
-(Todo sighing)

21
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,751
-(intense rock music)

22
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:46,584
[Yuki] Nice fight, boy!

23
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,584
[Todo] Huh?

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,584
So, when it comes to women,

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,918
what's your type?

26
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,292
What the?

27
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,500
Who are you?

28
00:00:58,584 --> 00:00:59,626
(Yuki chuckling)

29
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:00,792
One look at her and I knew.

30
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:03,584
My boring world was about

31
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:03,584
to be flipped upside-down.

32
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:10,209
(opening theme music)

33
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,959
(singer singing in Japanese)

34
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:39,292
(air whistling)

35
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,709
The time to unleash my

36
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,709
technique has finally come!

37
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:50,709
Huh?

38
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:52,918
Didn't you use it before?

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,709
Look, in our current situation,

40
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,417
I don't have time to

41
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,417
explain my technique to you!

42
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,709
There's really only one piece

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,709
of advice I can give you.

44
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:01,876
Don't stop!

45
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,292
And believe in me!

46
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,292
Okay!

47
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,876
But that's two.

48
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,459
(pensive rock music)

49
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:10,876
[Todo] Let's examine the

50
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:10,876
cards our opponent's holding.

51
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,292
One is roots that

52
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,292
emerge from the ground.

53
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,876
That one probably

54
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,876
gains power and speed

55
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,918
the more it limits

56
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,918
quantity and range.

57
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,542
Then there's Wooden Ball.

58
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:24,751
Each ball can attack once or

59
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:24,751
twice and then it's expended.

60
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,876
They can remain airborne

61
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,751
and we have to watch out

62
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,751
for delayed activation.

63
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,292
Then there's Cursed Bud,

64
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,292
that's

65
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,292
probably what got Fushiguro.

66
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,792
I guess you're out if even

67
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,792
if one of those hits you,

68
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:36,959
though I wanna

69
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:36,959
believe that means

70
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,292
it can't fire too many of them.

71
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,584
As for Flower Field, it

72
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,584
looks like that relaxes you,

73
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,959
but its earlier wounds

74
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,959
are throwing it off now,

75
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:47,125
so no need to worry about that.

76
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,876
Then there's that

77
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,876
unleashed left arm

78
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,167
and the possibility

79
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,167
it's just a bluff.

80
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,292
However, it doesn't

81
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,292
matter what a technique is

82
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,667
if you don't let

83
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,667
them activate it!

84
00:03:56,751 --> 00:04:00,584
So even accounting for

85
00:03:56,751 --> 00:04:00,584
unexpected situations,

86
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:01,125
(air whooshing)

87
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,959
my 530,000 IQ mental CPU

88

89
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:08,709
(neurons crackling)

90
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:13,542
produces only one

91
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:13,542
inescapable conclusion:

92
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,375
victory!

93
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:20,000
-♪ Oh ♪

94
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:20,000
-♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪

95
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:20,959
Because I'm not alone, brother!

96
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,626
Because you're here!

97
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,709
-♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪

98
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,709
-(footsteps thundering)

99
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,626
And you're with me!

100
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,334
(root whipping)

101
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,334
Huh?

102
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:31,792
(Hanami scoffing)

103
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:35,542
(Todo yelling)

104
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,167
Todo!

105

(Yuji panting)

106

-(blows thudding)

112
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:47,792
(air whooshing)

113
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,125
[Hanami] That's one down.

114
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,667
(Todo clapping)

115
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,459
(blood splatting)

116
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,834
(Hanami gurgling)

117
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:00,918
(Yuji sputtering)

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,542
(air whooshing)

119
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,042
Whoa, Todo?

120
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,375
[Hanami] I see.

121
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,751
It's simple, and yet therefore

122
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:10,667
it's a troubling

123
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:10,667
technique you have.

124
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

125
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,834
It's simply swapping my

126
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,834
position

127
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,834
for that of my opponent's.

128
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:17,834
The Boogie Woogie!

129
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:18,792
(Yuji gasping)

130
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:21,417
-Todo-

131
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:21,417
-Shh!

132
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,542
I will end this

133
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,542
before it can adapt.

134
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:24,584
(Todo chuckling)

135
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,667

(footsteps thundering)

137
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:29,000
By the way, (clapping)

138
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,417
clapping my hands (clapping)

139
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,042
is necessary to activate it!

(Todo clapping)

[Hanami] Huh?

(Todo clapping)

(Hanami hissing)

156
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:48,209
Their builds are too different!

157
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,834
There's a big change

158
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,834
every time they swap!

159
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,918
(Todo clapping)

160
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,500

-(blows thudding)

162
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,959
Is he swapping with me

163
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,834
or is he swapping

164
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,834
with Sukuna's vessel?

165
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,209
Every time he claps,

166
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:02,500
that split-second decision

167
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:02,500
makes my thoughts falter!

168
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,584

Oh no!

I can't, I can't!

They're using that again!

196
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,626
Using Black Flash consecutively

197
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,626
isn't anything amazing.

198
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,626

Although I find it

201
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,083
is difficult, for me,

202
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:55,292
to do it more than twice in a

203
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:55,292
row or on the following day.

204
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,542
It doesn't matter if

205
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,542
the first one is landed

206
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,792
by skill or by a fluke, once

207
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,792
sorcerers land a Black Flash,

208
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:03,334
they temporarily enter a state

209
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:06,167
that athletes commonly

210
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:06,167
call the zone.

211
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,125
The manipulation

212
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,125
of cursed energy

213
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,876
that they normally

214
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,876
control consciously

215
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,959
then becomes as

216
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,959
natural as breathing,

217
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,542
and then there's a

218
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,542
sense of omnipotence

219
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,500
that makes it seem

220
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,500
as if everything else

221
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:17,125
revolves around them.

222
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,000
I guess that's how I'd put it.

223
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,959
You wanna know

224
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,959
what my record is?

(Nanami sighing)

226
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,542

227

[Todo] Brother, I keep

233
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,042
having a premonition about

234
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,042
you!

246

[Hanami] Don't get cocky!

251
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,542
watch out for now

Just 'cause I clap my hands

00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:22,751
doesn't always mean I'm

259
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:22,751
activating my technique!

260
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:26,209
It's simple, but it's

261
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:26,209
easy to fall for.

262

same premonition

264

was full of lies!

You remember Fushiguro's

injuries from those buds?

340
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,083
Of course I do!

In just a matter of seconds,

342
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,542
those same Cursed Buds

343
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:03,542
are gonna be slamming

right into me!

345
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:07,209
Then think, Fushiguro's

346
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:07,209
Buds had grown larger

347
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,250
by the time he was

348
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,250
rescued, right?

00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:12,959
(Todo gasping)

350
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,751
You're assuming they grew

351
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,751
by absorbing his blood

352
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,250
and that is possible, of course,

353
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:22,209
but you're facing a

354
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:22,209
cursed spirit here.

355
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:25,042
So what's the most

356
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:25,042
likely answer?

357
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,626
(clock ticking)

358
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:31,042
(snapping) Cursed energy!

[Hanami] He dispelled

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,542
his cursed energy!

366
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:43,125
And right before impact.

367
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:44,751
He must have figured it out.

368
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,918
The harder they defend

369
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,918
with cursed energy,

370
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,751
the stronger those Buds become!

371
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,834

00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,834
thank her then, yeah?

383
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,250
Hey, special-grade

384
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,250
cursed spirit!

385
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:11,834
By now I'm sure you've realized

386
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:13,876
that I didn't tell

387
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:13,876
you everything before,

388
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,792
and now there's one more thing

389
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,792
you should be thinking about:

390
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,250
what counts as a target

391
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,250
for Boogie Woogie!

392
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,792
What things can I swap in

393
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,792
the range of my technique?

394
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:29,834
Only other creatures?

395
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:30,709
Mais non!

396
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,292
My technique works

397
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,292
on cursed corpses

398
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,459
and inanimate objects too!

399
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,667
So the answer is:

400
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:40,250
anything possessing cursed

401
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:40,250

405
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,918
We're back at that spot again.

406
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,042
Which means this is

407
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,042
where it lies waiting!

Maki's special-grade tool

414
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,459

Whoa, did I just swap

420
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,417
places with a fish?

Even a blow from a

special-grade cursed tool

435
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:40,459
imbued with my cursed

436
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:40,459
energy didn't take it down?

437
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:41,542
Huh?

[Hanami] Plants don't

442
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,417
generate cursed energy,

443
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,417
so I use my left arm to

444
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,417
steal the life from plants

445
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,709
and convert that life

446
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,709
into cursed energy,

(flower squelching)

448

returned to me,

450
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:11,334
and instead it all goes

451
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:11,334
to this flower offering.

452
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,292
I was hoping I wouldn't

453
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,292
have to use this.

Stay back, Brother!

458
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:28,709
Its cursed energy

459
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:28,709
output is strong!

460
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,584
[Hanami] Yes, but it

461
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,584
will still be easy

462
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,918
for you to avoid

463
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,918
with your technique.

464
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,042
So what shall I do?

465
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,209

(explosion booming)

Ah, I see!

475
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,417
I wondered why he sounded

476
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,417
so good without the amp.

477
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,459
It's because this old

478
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,459
man himself is the amp!

479
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,834
His technique amplifies

480
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,834
the tune he plays

481
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,876
and launches it

482
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,876
as cursed energy.

483
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,459
But he's a predictable

484
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,459
mid-range fighter,

485
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:30,167
it's obvious he doesn't want

486
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:30,167
me getting close to him.

487
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,000
(air whooshing)

488
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:33,834
Let's make a wallet!

489
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:36,459
A wallet full of

490
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:36,459
that old man smell!

491
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,459
(tense music)

492
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,542

493
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:43,626
(footsteps thudding)

494
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,834
Roger that.

495
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,792
Keep going, Nishimiya,

496
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,792
and head to Shouko.

497
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:49,667
(footsteps thudding)

498
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,417
It's okay, Mei has eyes on Miwa.

499
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,000
(air whooshing)

500
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,209
Good thing the veil didn't

501
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,209
cut off my reception,

502
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,125
but I guess that's because

503
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,125
of who the veil was aimed at.

504
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,083
But I'm afraid we have a spy.

505
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,626
Someone's working with

506
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,626
a curse or a curse user.

507
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:09,876
[Utahime] Looks like he

508
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:09,876
was right about that.

509
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,709
-Huh?

510
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,709
-(sword whooshing)

511
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:12,709
Huh?

512
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,542
I thought I cut you

513
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,542
for sure with that one.

514
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:20,584
[Utahime] A human?

515
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:23,334
A curse user?

516
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,667
(Haruta sighing)

517
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,292
Always the same old problem.

518
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,083
(energy warbling)

519
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,042
This is nice, isn't it?

520
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,626
Juzou Kumiya made it for me.

521
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,500
I think you met him him earlier.

522
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,876
Your right hand

523
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,876
isn't very strong,

524
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,876
so let the sword's

525
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,876
hand hold yours.

526
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,918
(Haruta chuckling)

527
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,876
(Utahime grunting)

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,709
[Haruta] Hm, so what'll

529
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,709
you give me, lady?

530
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,459
[Nobara] I'll bet all the

531
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,459
girls hate you, don't they?

532
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:55,459
[Haruta] Hm?

533
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:56,918
Here you meet someone new

534
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,709
and all you do is

535
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,709
talk about yourself!

536
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:00,792
I'm gonna charge you.

537
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,918
What makes you think you're

538
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,918
a good enough listener

539
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,626
to charge anyone

540
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,626
money for doing it?

541
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:05,709
(Nobara growling)

542
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,834
Give it a rest!

543
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:09,250
[Nobara] You always do this!

544
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:09,250
You pick the worst times

545
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:09,667
-to start these arguments!

546
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:09,667
-Hm?

547
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,125
Ah! (laughing)

548
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,250
Wow, who knew I was so popular?

549
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,542
Look at all these

550
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,542
girls, so awesome!

551
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:19,083
Weren't you listening

552
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:19,083
to me just a minute ago?

553
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,500
No sweat, I'll cover you.

554
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,709
Careful not to get

555
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,709
caught in the crossfire.

556
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,000
Be careful where you aim!

557
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,417
-(both gasping)

558
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,417
-(air whooshing)

559
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,125
(veil trickling)

560
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,000
The veil's been lifted!

561
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,417
No way!

562
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,959
It hasn't even been

563
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,959
30 minutes yet!

564
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:39,959
Time to run!

565
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,292
(footsteps thudding)

566
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,959
What was his deal?

567
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:45,000
So weird.

568
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,959
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

569
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,751
If it isn't my slick new coat

570
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,751
rack floating right up there!

571
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,626
(tense pensive music)

572
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:02,125
So where should I start?

573
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,000
[Yuji] Huh?

574
00:18:08,876 --> 00:18:11,542
(Hanami grunting)

575
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:14,542
[Hanami] Looks like

576
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:14,542
this is as far as we go.

577
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,626
Huh?

578
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,751
Gojo, is that you?

579
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:26,792
(energy whooshing)

580
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:29,626
Yuji's on a much higher

581
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:29,626
level than he was before.

582
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:33,167
Ah, I see!

583
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,459
Aoi!

584
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,000
Of course he'd be a

585
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,000
great match for Yuji.

586
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,375
Looks like they're

587
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,375
fighting the special-grade,

588
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,709
but I shouldn't have to

589
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,709
worry about them now.

590
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,209
Which means my

591
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,209
priority should be

592
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,209
(air whooshing)

593
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:49,209
-Hey, you there!

594
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:49,209
-Hm?

595
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,209
(Juzou laughing)

596
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:53,042
Coat rack, coat rack, coat rack!

597
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,209
Don't kill him!

598
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:57,459
(Juzou yelping)

599
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:59,375
(Juzou grunting)

600
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:02,042
(stones crashing)

601
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,667
(Juzou groaning)

602
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:08,000
We have a lot of questions

603
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:08,000
we need to ask this guy.

604
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,042
Don't let him die on us.

605
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,876
Go on, treat him.

606
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,667
(Yoshinobu growling)

607
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:17,250
(Gojo gasping)

608
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:19,667
The guy who was with

609
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:19,667
Utahime has disappeared.

610
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:22,584
Guess he must've found

611
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:22,584
some means of escape.

612
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,667
(air whooshing)

613
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:27,042
So that just leaves that one.

614
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,626
One adept at running, too.

615
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,292
It's some distance from Yuji.

616
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,334
Oh, well.

617
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:37,334
Guess I can play a little rough.

618
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:41,042
Technique Amplification: Blue.

619
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,042
Technique Reversal: Red.

620
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,292
[Hanami] I'm withdrawing.

621
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,709
I'm not arrogant enough to

622
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,709
think I can face Satoru Gojo.

623
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:52,751
What the hell?

624
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,709
What were you all trying

625
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,709
to do here anyway?

626
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,792
Wait, hold it, Brother!

627
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:00,626
Why are you stopping me, Todo?

628
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:03,751
Don't take another step forward,

629
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:07,500
(energy ringing)

630
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,709
or you'll get caught in it.

631
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,792
(energetic music)

632
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:14,876
[Gojo] Hollow

633
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:18,459
(energy booming)

634
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:19,500
Purple!

635
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:22,751
(energy booming)

636
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:33,500
(Hanami yelping)

637
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,083
(Yuji grunting)

638
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,292
(Todo chuckling)

639
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,918
He's just as

640
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,918
nonstandard as ever.

641
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,834
(Yuji moaning in awe)

642
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,167
And now we can't tell

643
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,167
if the special-grade

644
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,167
was exorcized or not.

645
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,792
(Juzou wailing)

646
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:57,834
It hurts!

647
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,167
-It hurts!

648
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,167
-Quiet!

649
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,834
Yay!

650
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:03,209
That should settle everything!

651
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,167
Or maybe it won't.

652
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,792
(tense music)

653
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:11,751
(footsteps thudding)

654
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:18,584
I wonder if Hanami's safe.

655
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,751
Mission accomplished either way.

656
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:29,209
(closing theme music)

657
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,834
(singer singing in Japanese)

658
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,542
[All] Juju Stroll

659
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,500
[Toge] Salmon.

660
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:00,083
-(dog barking)

661
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:00,083
-(cat meowing)

662
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,918
Am I a dog?

663
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,959
No, maybe I like cats.

664
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,083
Although, maybe

665
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,083
if it's a big dog!

666
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:09,667
All dog.

667
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:11,000
I think a dog person?

668
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,042
What, really?

669
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,083
No, cats are better!

670
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:14,083
[Toge] Salmon.

671
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,876
The answer is obviously pandas!

672
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,751
What, you want me

673
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,751
to kill you all?

674
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,918
(Panda roaring)

675
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,959
Everybody hates me, don't they?

676
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:25,959
I knew it, you all hate me!

677
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,083
Well, there were

678
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,083
only two choices.

679
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,459
Ah, leave it.

680
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:35,459
(energetic metal music)
