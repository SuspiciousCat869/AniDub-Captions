1
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:07,626
(wall explodes)

2
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:08,751
(running footsteps)

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,959
(walls exploding)

4
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:15,042
(running footsteps)

5
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,167
(energy whirring)

6
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:22,584
(Megumi grunts)

7
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,709
(building exploding)

8
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,959
(cautious music)

9
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:34,459
(energy flying)

10
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:37,959
(Megumi grunts)

11
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:38,959
(energy whirring)

12
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:42,292
(shikigami slobbering)

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,209
[Megumi] There's a bit of

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,209
blood on the arrowhead.

15
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:51,709
Somehow Kamo's technique allows

16
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:51,709
his arrows to defy physics.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,167
[Noritoshi] You can call more

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,167
than one type of shikigami

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,792
at a time, right?

20
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:00,000
Can't say I appreciate you

21
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:00,000
holding out on me like that.

22
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,000
(intense music)

23
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,292
My Demon Dog's

24
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,292
busy with its task.

25
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,125
What about you? Aren't

26
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,125
you on your last arrow?

27
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,584
Who'll save you if you

28
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,584
pass out from blood loss?

29
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,667
Blood Manipulation.

30
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,626
A technique

31
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,626
manipulating one's blood

32
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,667
and objects imbued

33
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,667
with that blood.

34
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:19,918
That's fitting for one

35
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:19,918
of the three major clans

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,626
and their love of bloodlines.

37
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,834
There's nothing to worry about.

38
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,834
These are special arrows

39
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,834
I've prepared ahead of time.

40
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:29,959
Ten Shadows Technique.

41
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,083
One of the Zen'in clan's

42
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,083
hereditary techniques.

43
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:35,083
It creates ten

44
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:35,083
types of shikigami

45
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:37,209
using shadows as its medium.

46
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,959
If only Maki or Mai

47
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,959
had inherited it!

48
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,667
(arrow flying)

49
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,667
(ceiling exploding)

50
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:46,334
(Megumi grunts)

51
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:47,751
(Noritoshi punches)

52
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,417
(Megumi grunts)

53
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:54,167
[Megumi] How can he

54
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:54,167
have that much power?

55
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:58,125
That was a nice reaction.

56
00:01:58,209 --> 00:01:59,834
But best stay alert!

57
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,250
(Noritoshi grunts)

58
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,334
(Megumi grunts)

59
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,918
[Megumi] Was I too slow to

60
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,918
defend with cursed energy?

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,250
With this much speed and power,

62
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:14,209
it's like he's a

63
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:14,209
different person now!

64
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,542
The manipulation of blood

65
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,167
isn't limited to just

66
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,167
its shape and motion.

67
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,083
Body temperature,

68
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,083
pulse, red blood cells,

69
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,125
and all the other

70
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,125
components of blood

71
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,209
are all mine to freely control!

72
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:30,667
Flowing Red Scale!

73
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,542
So now you're doping?

74
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:34,667
You're very astute.

75
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:37,876
Though there's no need to

76
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:37,876
use such a layman's term.

77
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,667
(opening theme music)

78
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:48,125
(singing in Japanese)

79
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,500
(music fades out)

80
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,709
(bird crowing)

81
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,459
♪ My sword ♪

82
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,876
♪ Has been taken away ♪

83
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,209

84
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,626
[Miwa] Mai's older sister

85
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,626
took it and ran off somewhere.

86
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:28,584
That woman was fast, too.

87
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,500
And I'm not much of an

88
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,500
asset without my sword,

89
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,125
so obviously she

90
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,125
made the right call.

91
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,667
I wonder if tapioca's

92
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,667
as good as they say.

93
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:40,167
-(phone vibrating)

94
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:40,167
-[Miwa] Hm?

95
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,334
(phone vibrating)

96
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:43,500
It's Mechamaru.

97
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,334
Hi! Useless Miwa here!

98
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,417
[Toge] Sleep.

99
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,250
(Miwa sighs)

100
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:55,375
(Miwa falls)

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,417
(dog panting)

102
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,375
(Miwa snoring)

103
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,500
(dog whining)

104
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:10,500
[Toge] Return.

105
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:12,876
(dog dissipates)

106
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,876
(collar zipping)

107
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,334
(Toge gasps)

108
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,417
(suspenseful music)

109
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,751
[Utahime] Ugh, she fell asleep.

110
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,667
-I'm heading out for a bit.

111
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,667
-Huh?

112
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,542
I can't leave her

113
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,542
lying in the woods

114
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,000
with cursed spirits

115
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,000
wandering around, right?

116
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:40,042
(off key music)

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,751
[Noritoshi] What's this?

118
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,751
[Yoshinobu] The

119
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,751
semi-first-grade cursed

120
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,751
spirit

121
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,918
that'll be released in the area.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,292
I thought you were

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,292
using a second-grade.

124
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,584
I decided that a second-grade

125
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,584
wouldn't be enough.

126
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:54,667
Hm?

127
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:57,459
The two schools are not

128
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:57,459
unified in this, you know.

129
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,083
Here's the scent,

130
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,417
and the flute that was

131
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,417
used in its training.

132
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,709
Wait for the right

133
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,709
situation, and use it well,

134
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,542
to kill Itadori.

135
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:11,125
It might get hunted down

136
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:11,125
before we can use it, though.

137
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,083
[Yoshinobu] Don't worry.

138
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,292
It's been trained to

139
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,292
keep quiet and lay low

140
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,000
until the flute is blown.

141
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,334
(off key music)

142
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,459
I know Kamo.

143
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,626
He probably placed

144
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,626
the scent on Itadori

145
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:26,334
the moment they made contact

146
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:26,334
and the feed cut out.

147
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,959
It's easy enough for him to do

148
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,876
if he mixes his blood with it.

149
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,584
If the boy's fighting Todo,

150
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,584
he won't come out unscathed.

151
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,334
So, if Itadori's attacked

152
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,334
by a semi-first-grade

153
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:41,834
the moment after the fight,

154
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:45,500
he'll surely die!

155
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:46,626
You're right, Iori.

156
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:51,042
I'm worried about Miwa. You

157
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:51,042
should go to her quickly.

158
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:55,459
(suspenseful music)

159
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:00,876
[Toge] Kelp.

160
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,584
(footsteps approaching)

161
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:14,000
(spirit slobbering)

162
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,000
(Toge gasps)

163
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,834
(spirit stabbed)

164
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,500
(spirit rolls)

165
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:26,667
(footsteps approaching)

166
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,667
(Toge steps back)

167
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:33,542
(footsteps approaching)

168
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,834
(indistinct chanting)

169
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:38,459
Yellow fin. Tuna.

170
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,584
Prawn roe.

171
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,542
(suspenseful music)

172
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,417
Well then.

173
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,709
Looks like it's time

174
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,709
for us to go to work.

175
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,834
Let's make us a

176
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,834
custom coat rack!

177
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,083
Gojo's about a hundred and

178
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,083
ninety centimeters tall,

179
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,334
isn't he?

180
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,500
I'd say that's the

181
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,500
perfect size coat rack!

182
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,959
(transition music)

183
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,209
(rising music)

184
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,500
(Noritoshi cries)

185
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:14,417
Why is it everyone always

186
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:14,417
treats my mom so awful?

187
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,459
[Clan Woman] Because

188
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,459
she's a slutty concubine.

189
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,375
But then why is

190
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,375
everyone so good to me?

191
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,667
Why did the clan

192
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,667
take me in as heir?

193
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:26,584
[Clan Woman] Because

194
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:26,584
your father's proper wife

195
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:30,459
didn't produce a son who

196
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:30,459
inherited the technique.

197
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:34,542
[Noritoshi] Then, as the

198
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:34,542
next head of the Kamo clan-

199
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:38,417
(cautious music)

200
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,709
(Noritoshi and Megumi grunting)

201
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,542
(suspenseful music)

202
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,417
(Megumi grunts)

203
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,792
[Noritoshi] Shikigami users

204
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:11,709
who can fight this well in

205
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:11,709
close combat are precious.

206
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:12,918
You've improved.

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,334
I'm glad to see it.

208
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:15,959
Why do you keep acting as if

209
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,292
there's some sort of

210
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,292
fellowship between us?

211
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,292
I'm sympathizing.

212
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,292
Before too long

213
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,626
you'll be supporting one

214
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,626
of the major clans.

215
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:30,792
So you should know I intend

216
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:30,792
to kill Yuji Itadori.

217
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,751
On Principal Gakuganji's orders?

218
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:38,667
Oh, no. I made this

219
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:38,667
decision for myself.

220
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:41,584
I'm aware what's at stake.

221
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:41,584
I didn't need to be ordered.

222
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,667
I believe it was

223
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,667
the correct call.

224
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:50,000
As the heir to the Kamo clan,

225
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:50,000
I must behave appropriately.

226
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,250
For my mother's sake!

227
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:56,167
You should be able to

228
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:56,167
understand that, too.

229
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,459
After all, you and

230
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,459
I are the same.

231
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:00,459
The hell we are.

232
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,834
All of a sudden, this

233
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,834
guy's not making any sense.

234
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:05,542
We are the same.

235
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:08,334
No, we're not.

236
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,709
You can save those

237
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,709
discussions for Maki.

238
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,959
'Cause as for me

239
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:15,334
I've no connection with

240
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:15,334
the Zen'in clan now.

241
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,417
And besides,

242
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,167
I don't believe I'm

243
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,167
necessarily in the right

244
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,167
here.

245
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:21,751
No, hang on.

246
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,667
That's wrong.

247
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,584
What I was really

248
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,584
trying to say is

249
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,918
that I don't care if

250
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,918
I'm right or wrong.

251
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,751
I just have faith in my

252
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,751
own sense of morality.

253
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,876
I save people according

254
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,876
to my conscience.

255
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,375
And if you reject that,

256
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,209
well then.

257
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,792
(hopeful music)

258
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:47,751
Then we'll curse

259
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:48,918
each other.

260
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:50,834
(wall crashes in)

261
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,250
(shikigami croaks)

262
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:52,792
[Noritoshi] A shikigami?

263
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:56,375
He still had more?

264
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,876
(shikigami dissipates)

265
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,876
[Noritoshi] He used the

266
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,876
shikigami as a decoy

267
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,334
before releasing it!

268
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,375
[Megumi] This one really burns

269
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,375
through the cursed energy,

270
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:06,834
so I can only use it by itself.

271
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:08,792
I've only managed

272
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:08,792
to tame it recently.

273
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,125
Max Elephant.

274
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:18,292
(elephant trumpets)

275
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,792
(elephant whines)

276
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:24,042
[Noritoshi] It's a big

277
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:24,042
target! I'll strike

278
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:24,042
first!

279
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,417
(water shoots)

280
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,042
[Noritoshi] Water?

281
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,834
(building crashes outwards)

282
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:33,792
[Noritoshi] It blew me away

283
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:33,792
with mass and pressure!

284
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,792
Open spaces are bad!

285
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,792
That one's next!

286
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,792
(energy charging)

287
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:41,667
Nue!

288
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,417
(bird cawing)

289
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:51,125
(Noritoshi groaning)

290
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,751
[Noritoshi's Mother] If

291
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,751
I stay here, Noritoshi,

292
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,417
I'll just be in your way.

293
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,459
[Noritoshi] I-

294
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,751
Blood Manipulation!

295
00:11:58,834 --> 00:11:59,751
(bird cawing)

296
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:00,834
(packet exploding)

297
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,375
Crimson Binding!

298
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,292
I can't afford to lose!

299
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,125
I refuse to lose!

300
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,751
(loud explosion)

301
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,834
[Megumi] Huh?

302
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,167
[Both] What is that?

303
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,959
Inumaki!

304
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,292
(footsteps approaching)

305
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,292
Run away!

306
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,792
(bells ringing)

307
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,083
(Megumi and Noritoshi gasp)

308
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,751
(loud explosion)

309
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,792
(charms burning)

310
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,876
Huh?

311
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,292
Hm?

312
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,792
Huh?

313
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,167
Is the game over?

314
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,626
They all burned red!

315
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,125
[Mei] That's odd.

316
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:45,209
My crows didn't see anything.

317
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,959
I'd love to say that

318
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,500
the students of

319
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,500
great teacher Gojo

320
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:52,334
exorcized them all

321
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:52,334
but I doubt it.

322
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:54,000
Remember they also burn red

323
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,709
for unregistered cursed energy.

324
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,334
So what are you thinking?

325
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:01,000
Are you suspecting

326
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:01,000
it's an outsider?

327
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,167
If that's the case,

328
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,167
it means Tengen's

329
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,167
barrier isn't working.

330
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,125
Whether it's because of

331
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,125
some outsider or not,

332
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,959
something unexpected

333
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,959
is happening here.

334
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,500
[Yoshinobu] They had to

335
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,500
have been fairly skilled

336
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,459
to have exorcized that.

337
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:16,709
But who was it?

338
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:19,918
I'm going to go see Tengen.

339
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:22,751
Satoru and Principal Gakuganji,

340
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,000
please protect the students.

341
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,042
Mei, it's best you

342
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,042
stay here and pinpoint

343
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,000
all the students' locations.

344
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,876
Stay in constant contact

345
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,876
with the other two.

346
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,417
Fully understood.

347
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,918
I look forward to

348
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,918
the bonus money.

349
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,209
(Satoru claps)

350
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:38,834
On your feet, Gramps!

351
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,751
You and I are taking a walk.

352
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,876
You just finished your

353
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,876
lunch, good to go?

354
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,375
(electronic music)

355
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,667
[Utahime] Let's hurry.

356
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:49,918
(running footsteps)

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
(Megumi gasps)

358
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,918
(doors explode)

359
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:07,876
-(muffled explosion)

360
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:07,876
-Huh?

361
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,584
They're really going

362
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,584
at it over there.

363
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:12,667
But you know,

364
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,250
those cursed spirits don't

365
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,250
leave anything behind

366
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:15,250
when they die,

367
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,834
and that's a problem.

368
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:18,417
(Juzo grunts)

369
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,000
How am I supposed to make

370
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,000
anything from those things?

371
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:21,959
(Juzo yells)

372
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,918
(hammer clangs)

373
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,792
Was that good enough?

374
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:28,918
Ah, I forgot about that.

375
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,959
Emerge from darkness

376
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,959
blacker still.

377
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,751
Purify that which is impure.

378
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,500
(energy builds)

379
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:42,500
Oh yeah, this is good.

380
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:47,834
Go time's almost here.

381
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:47,834
Coat rack's comin' soon!

382
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:52,125
(footsteps approaching)

383
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,751
(energy builds)

384
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,626
(footsteps approaching)

385
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,626
(energy builds)

386
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,125
(Miwa snores)

387
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:07,125
(electronic music)

388
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,250
A veil?

389
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:11,334
Why now?

390
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,626
(footsteps approaching)

391
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:14,792
[Utahime] Gojo!

392
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:17,876
You should go ahead of us,

393
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:17,876
before the veil comes down!

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,542
No, no way.

395
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,500
[Utahime] Huh?

396
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:23,667
[Satoru] That veil's

397
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:23,667
practically complete.

398
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:27,125
They chose to focus on cursed

399
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:27,125
techniques over visual effect.

400
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,209
Damn, they're good.

401
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:32,000
(footsteps approaching)

402
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:35,792
[Satoru] Well.

403
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:38,584
Now that it's down, I

404
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:38,584
just need to break it.

405
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,334
(energy sparks)

406
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,167
-(energy explodes)

407
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,167
-(Satoru recoils)

408
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,584
[Satoru] Huh, what

409
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,584
is this odd feeling?

410
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:49,667
Hey!

411
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,125
Why is the veil

412
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,125
keeping you outside,

413
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,959
while it's allowing me to enter?

414
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,083
I get it.

415
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,167
Utahime, Gramps, you go ahead.

416
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,542
This barrier here

417
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:11,083
is designed to allow all

418
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:11,083
others to go in and out

419
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:11,083
freely,

420
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,042
in exchange for just one thing.

421
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,500
Denying that to Gojo.

422
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,542
(Utahime gasps)

423
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:20,834
[Utahime] True, that

424
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:20,834
would explain everything.

425
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,209
But, if they're able

426
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,209
to use a barrier

427
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,542
to keep a specific

428
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,542
individual out-

429
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:28,584
They must have quite

430
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:28,584
the skilled curse user.

431
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,083
Uh-huh, all this confirms

432
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,083
their intel on us is good.

433
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,042
Go!

434
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,083
Get moving.

435
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,334
I don't know what

436
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,334
their end goal is here,

437
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,918
but if any of us

438
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,918
dies, then we lose.

439
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,292
(Utamine gasps)

440
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:48,876
(Utamine gasps)

441
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,125
[Utahime] What a

442
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,125
strong curse presence!

443
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:54,042
Don't tell me there's a

444
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:54,042
special-grade curse here!

445
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,042
-[Juzo] Hey, hey, hey!

446
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,042
-(Utahime gasps)

447
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,167
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

448
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,542
Why isn't Satoru Gojo here?

449
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,417
[Yoshinobu] Curse user.

450
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,584
He's not the source

451
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,584
of this presence,

452
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,542
but he's still quite capable.

453
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:11,250
It looks like that

454
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:11,250
degenerate monk

455
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:14,417
managed to trick me somehow!

456
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,876
Utahime, go on ahead.

457
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,876
Protect the students

458
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,876
at all costs.

459
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,125
Avoid fighting unless

460
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,125
it can't be helped.

461
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,209
What're you trying to do?

462
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,083
The least you could do

463
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,083
is let me kill the woman!

464
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:28,417
I can't make anything

465
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,083
from your old hollow

466
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,083
bones and wrinkled skin!

467
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,417
(case rattles)

468
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,125
[Yoshinobu] Why don't

469
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,125
you kill me then?

470
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:37,250
(guitar plays)

471
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:40,250
And find out for yourself

472
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:40,250
if they're hollow!

473
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:44,292
Why don't you go have a nap

474
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:44,292
and some nice warm milk?

475
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,542
You old fart.

476
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,083
A cursed spirit at Jujutsu Tech?

477
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:59,792
Just who produced this veil?

478
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,667
Probably the curse user

479
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,667
who's working with it.

480
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:04,918
(Toge nods)

481
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,250
Hm? Do you know

482
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,250
something about this?

483
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,959
These're unregistered

484
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,959
special-grade cursed spirits.

485
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:13,584
And it looks like they're

486
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:13,584
working with a human, too.

487
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:15,584
Yes.

488
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,459
I think it's the

489
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,459
special-grade

490
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,459
that attacked Gojo

491
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:18,542
a while ago.

492
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,959
Its appearance

493
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,959
matches the report.

494
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,167
Even from that guy's

495
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,167
drawing, I recognize it.

496
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,125
[Toge] Tuna with mayo.

497
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:28,292
[Megumi] You're right.

498
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,250
Let's call Gojo

499
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,250
and let him know.

500
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,334
What? Hold on!

501
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,167
Do you actually

502
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,167
understand what he means

503
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,834
when he says that stuff?

504
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,417
That's not important right now.

505
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,167
Our enemy might use a domain.

506
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,042
I'm thinking we should

507
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,042
retreat and join Gojo and

508
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,042
the-

509
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,250
(Noritoshi gasps)

510
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,375
(phone breaks)

511
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:49,584
Don't move!

512
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,500
(curse grumbles)

513
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:54,751
(packet explodes)

514
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:55,334
Blood Manipulation!

515
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,667
Slicing Exorcism!

516
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,167
No damage?

517
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:05,250
(bird caws)

518
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:08,167
(energy explodes)

519
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,876
(Megumi grunts)

520
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,167
(Megumi grunts)

521
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,292
[Megumi] Damn!

522
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,292
It's really tough!

523
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,250
[Noritoshi] A sword?

524
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,959
Where's he been hiding

525
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,959
that thing all this time?

526
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:26,083
(indistinct chanting)

527
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,250
[Hanami] Stop it,

528
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,250
foolish children.

529
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,209
(Megumi gasps)

530
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:32,834
[Megumi] What is this?

531
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,375
I can't tell what it's

532
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,375
saying by the sound,

533
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:37,584
but I somehow

534
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:37,584
understand its meaning!

535
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,417
That's just creepy.

536
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,542
[Hanami] I merely wish to

537
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,542
protect this planet, that's

538
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,542
all.

539
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:46,500
[Noritoshi] It's a curse

540
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:46,500
spouting nonsense! Don't

541
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:46,500
listen!

542
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,125
This is on a whole

543
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,125
different level

544
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:50,125
than lower-grade cursed spirits.

545
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:53,918
[Hanami] The forests,

546
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:53,918
the oceans, and the sky

547
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,125
all weep so vehemently that

548
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,125
I can no longer stand it.

549
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:00,667
It's impossible to coexist

550
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:00,667
with humans any longer.

551
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,584
The earth knows

552
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,584
there are some humans

553
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,751
who are kind to the planet.

554
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:08,042
But how much does that

555
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:08,042
insignificant amount

556
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,042
of affection help?

557
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,375
[Megumi] It's established

558
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,375
its own language!

559
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,876
[Hanami] All they

560
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,876
desire is time.

561
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,167
[Megumi] Get

562
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,167
Inumaki out of here!

563
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:25,417
[Hanami] This planet can

564
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:25,417
shine blue once more,

565
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,959
given a bit of time.

566
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:34,042
(ground explodes)

567
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,667
[Hanami] Time without humans!

568
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,667
Please die and become sages!

569
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,459
(closing theme music)

570
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:59,709
(singing in Japanese)

571
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,584
[Mahito, Jougo, and

572
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,584
Hanami] Juju Stroll!

573
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,417
(upbeat music)

574
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:23,334
Hey!

575
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,083
Jougo!

576
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,918
You burned up Hanami's

577
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,918
flower bed again, huh?

578
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,918
Now Hanami's crying!

579
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,709
(Hanami cries)

580
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:33,792
Hmph.

581
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,250
Hanami?

582
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,751
Jougo sucks.

583
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,584
Let's strangle him.

584
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,584
My boyfriend's teacher

585
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,584
who I told you about?

586
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,751
Well,

587
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:46,876
he'll handle it.

588
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,918
[Hanami] No, that's

589
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,918
going too far.

590
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,375
(piano music)

591
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,834
(wind blowing)

592
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:04,417
(piano music)

593
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,417
(Hanami sighs)

594
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,918
(Hanami cries)

595
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,125
(Hanami screams)

596
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:18,417
[Hanami] This is a

597
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:18,417
slash-and-burn farm!

598
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,751
The soil!

599
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,459
It didn't have enough

600
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,459
nutrients even before this!

601
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:26,459
(upbeat music)

602
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,417
(Hanami gasps)

603
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,250
(upbeat music)

604
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,542
[Jougo] Hmph.

605
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:43,000
(Hanami whimpers)

606
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,834
(music fades out)

607
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:47,500
(rock music)

608
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:55,709
(rock music fades out)
