1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,459
(pain shriek)

2
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,209
[Mahito] Ahh!

3
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:24,125
There you are!

4
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:26,209
-(laughs)

5
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:26,209
-Hm?

6
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:29,417
Jougo!

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,959
(laughs)

8
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:34,792
(unhappy grumble)

9
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,042
I see you have most

10
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,042
of your body back.

11
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,792
Yeah, this is a good

12
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,792
place to rejuvenate.

13
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:42,125
Humans don't come

14
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:42,125
anywhere near it.

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,292
[Mahito] Not having a

16
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,292
body really sucks, huh?

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,083
It makes self-preservation

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,083
so difficult.

19
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,417
Mahito.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,459
You should know, you're

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,459
awfully worn down yourself.

22
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:54,667
Oh, you can tell?

23
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:58,626
It turns out Sukuna and his

24
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:58,626
vessel are my natural enemies.

25
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:01,209
I started this whole game

26
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:03,500
because I happened

27
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:03,500
to acquire a new toy.

28
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:08,918
It was great at first but

29
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:08,918
then it didn't work out.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,626
Should've used a hostage.

31
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,792
Then I could've forced him

32
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,792
into a pact, am I right?

33
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:15,626
Hand your body over to Sukuna,

34
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,000
if you don't want to

35
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,000
see this dude killed!

36
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,918
(aggravated growl)

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,250
You failed, because pacts

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,250
are only ever placed

39
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:24,209
by oneself on oneself.

40
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,459
It's not easy to forge

41
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,459
pacts with others,

42
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:29,459
because of intervention

43
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:29,459
from others.

44
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:32,500
[Mahito] Maybe I

45
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:32,500
should have just given

46
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:33,292
that thing a lethal wound,

47
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,918
instead of transfiguring it.

48
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,500
Then Sukuna might have

49
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,500
been able to heal it

50
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:40,459
with his reverse

51
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:40,459
cursed technique.

52
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,667
Don't forget your place.

53
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:44,751
Foolish puppet.

54
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,459
No, not with that personality.

55
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,751
I think he would have

56
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,751
refused either way.

57
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:53,834
Jougo?

58
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:55,500
Touching Sukuna made me realize

59
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:58,751
that we should probably proceed

60
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:58,751
with Getou's plan, for now.

61
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,125
Sukuna is that valuable.

62
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,125
(suspicious grumble)

63
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,000
You mean gather all the fingers

64
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,918
and offer them to Sukuna, huh?

65
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:14,584
Even if that means we all get

66
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:14,584
wiped out in the process, eh?

67
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:16,500
Very well then.

68
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,751
I sure don't intend to

69
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,751
be the one left laughing

70
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,751
like a lunatic in the

71
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,751
wasteland a century from now.

72
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,334
As long as curses exist as

73
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,334
people that's all that

74
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,334
matters.

75
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:28,167
Oh!

76
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,000
You understand exactly!

77
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,876
Good, then first we

78
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,876
need to go retrieve

79
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,083
the six fingers

80
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,083
from Jujutsu Tech.

81
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:36,000
Do we have to?

82
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:36,876
I thought the sorcerers

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,209
were only keeping

84
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,209
Yuuji Itadori around

85
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,542
so that he can swallow

86
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,542
Sukuna's fingers.

87
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,167
If we leave him alone

88
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,167
he'll still eat them.

89
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,000
The higher-ups at Jujutsu Tech

90
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,125
are still trying to calculate

91
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,042
Yuuji Itadori's

92
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,042
strength as a vessel.

93
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,959
They want to see just how

94
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,959
many fingers he can take.

95
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,584
They want to gather

96
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,584
all the fingers

97
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,417
and then have him consume them.

98
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,375
With just one exception.

99
00:02:58,459 --> 00:02:59,375
"Exception"

100
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,125
I want him to eat them all, now!

101
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,125
But we can't just wait around.

102
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,417
Worst case, there's the

103
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,417
chance they could decide

104
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,042
to eliminate Yuuji Itadori.

105
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,918
So into the tiger's

106
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,918
den we go, huh?

107
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,417
Then just how do you

108
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,417
think we oughta proceed?

109
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,542
Already started.

110
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:19,918
My first move was

111
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:19,918
allowing Jujutsu Tech

112
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,375
to retrieve the fingers we had.

113
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,626
(opening theme music)

114
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,250
"Jujutsu Kaisen"

115
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,876
"Episode 14:

116
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,167

118
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,375
Nanami!

119
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:05,709
Come on, would you say

120
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:05,709
something interesting!

121
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,042
(light exasperated grunt)

122
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,042
Okay!

123
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,834
I've got it! Yeah!

124
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,375
We'll record us playing

125
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,375
catch with a stale rice

126
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,375
ball!

127
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,709
While discussing

128
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,709
economic policies!

129
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,083
Then we'll post a

130
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,083
video and go trolling!

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,334
You can enjoy that on your own.

132
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:23,167
What kind of idea is that?

133
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,334
A drinking game then!

134
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:27,167
Name all the things you

135
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:27,167
like about Satoru Gojou!

136
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,459
See who names the most!

137
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:29,709
My turn.

138
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:30,751
Everything!

139
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,375
You just keep on

140
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,375
thinking that way.

141
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,542
It's totally idiotic,

142
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:39,542
but Itadori needs that

143
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:39,542
kind of idiocy right now.

144
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,334
You'll be sent out on

145
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,334
more difficult missions.

146
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:45,709
To be honest though,

147
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,542
that wasn't the kind

148
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,542
of difficult I meant.

149
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:50,709
Nanami?

150
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,292
Does Yuuji know about that

151
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,292
finger in Junpei Yoshino's--

152
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,918
I haven't told him.

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,918
Knowing Yuuji, he'd just feel

154
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,918
unnecessarily responsible.

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,209
I'm glad I left you

156
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,209
in charge of him.

157
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,292
So, where is it now?

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,375
I submitted it to the

159
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,375
higher-ups, of course.

160
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,709
If I gave it to you,

161
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,709
you would've already

162
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,709
fed it to Itadori.

163
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:10,709
Ouch.

164
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:11,834
But...

165
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,209
Are you really sure that

166
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,209
it's safe to bring him back?

167
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,209
If they find out he's alive

168
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,209
at the exchange event,

169
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:20,417
won't the higher-ups

170
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:20,417
just target him again?

171
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,459
Even if they do Yuuji

172
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,459
will be fine now.

173
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:25,584
You know that better

174
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:25,584
than anyone, don't you?

175
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,417
(sigh)

176
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,792
Hey! Gojou!

177
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:31,959
(laugh)

178
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,792
Oh, Nanami's here too!

179
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:34,918
Well come on guys!

180
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,792
Let's hurry up, I

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,792
wanna go see everyone!

182
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,417
I can't wait!

183
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,250
Can't wait!

184
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:40,667
It's so exciting!

185
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:41,375
I'm so pumped!

186
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:44,417
Yuuji? What are you thinking?

187
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,584
After all this time,

188
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,500
you can just show up

189
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,500
like nothing happened?

190
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:49,042
(shock gasp) I can't?

191
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,792
Even among sorcerers it's rare

192
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,000
to essentially come

193
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,000
back from the dead

194
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,250
after being gone for

195
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,250
like two whole months.

196
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,375
So we have to make

197
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,375
it a surprise!

198
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,000
A surprise, how?

199
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,459
[Gojou] You just

200
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,459
leave all that to me!

201
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,459
Huh?

202
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,459
[Gojou] The first-years will be

203
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,000
crying and laughing from

204
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,000
happiness and shock.

205
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:09,876
I'm so happy!

206
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:09,876
I'm so happy!

207
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,000
[Gojou] The second-years

208
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,000
and Kyoto students

209
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,000
will cry with them,

210
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,667
and someone will

211
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,667
choke up and vomit!

212
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:15,709
(vomiting)

213
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:20,042
And in the end, it'll

214
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:20,042
even solve global warming!

215
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,083
[Voiceover] Cool!

216
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:23,959
So cool!

217
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,834
So, what's my job

218
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,834
in this, tell me!

219
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:26,751
What do I have to do here?

220
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,292
You don't have to

221
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,292
do anything, Yuuji.

222
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,167
You just do exactly as I

223
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,167
say and go with the flow!

224
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,250
Hey I can do that!

225
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:34,209
I can go with the flow!

226
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,292
[Nanami] It'll be enough

227
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,292
of a surprise for them

228
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,292
just to see he's alive.

229
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,167
Hey!

230
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,083
Why are you guys

231
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,083
all empty-handed?

232
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,250
[All] Hm?

233
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,584
Where do you think you're

234
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,584
going with all that luggage?

235
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:46,626
Wait a sec.

236
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,709
Aren't we all traveling today?

237
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:52,083
For the exchange event with

238
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:52,083
our sister school in Kyoto?

239
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,500
Yes it's an exchange event

240
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:54,667
with our sister school in Kyoto.

241
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:56,542
Here in Tokyo.

242
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,584
No freaking way!

243
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:03,334
That explains why she hasn't

244
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:03,334
been making any sense lately.

245
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:03,626
No doubt.

246
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,500
Salmon.

247
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,584
The previous year's

248
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,584
winner always hosts it.

249
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,834
So why'd you have

250
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,834
to go and win it?

251
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:11,500
It wasn't us! We weren't

252
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:11,500
even in it last year!

253
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:14,459
They just put in Yuuta so

254
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:14,459
the numbers would match up!

255
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,876
Yeah 'cause that was

256
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,876
before Rika got freed.

257
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,876
Apparently, it was

258
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,876
an overwhelming win,

259
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,125
but I didn't get to see it

260
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,125
since it was held in Kyoto.

261
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,250
I'll never forgive

262
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,250
you Yuuta Okkotsu!

263
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:27,542
Even though in fact,

264
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:27,542
I've never met you!

265
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:28,918
Misdirected rage.

-Salmon.

267
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,250
-Hm?

268
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:35,375
Hey.

269
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:36,584

270
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,542

272
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:41,459
all together, huh?

273
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:46,083
You actually came to greet us?

274
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,292

impressed either!

considered extreme bullying.

Inumaki is a cursed-speech user.

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,876
power and compulsion of words.

459
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,876
He limits his vocabulary

460
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,876
to keep others safe.

461
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,417
So if he told someone

462
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,417
to go die they'd do it?

It always varies, depending

466
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,167
on the opponent's strengths.

467
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,542
Using powerful words can

468
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,542
produce massive feedback.

469

affect him as well.

471
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,751
Limiting his vocabulary

472
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,751
is a way for Toge

473
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,250
to protect himself and others.

474
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:57,918
Ahh...

475
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,876
So, how is it you can speak?

476
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,500
Are you a new breed of panda?

477
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,083
Stop being so nosy about

478
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,083
everyone else's techniques!

479
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,083
It's fine.

480
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:09,209
Toge's ability's no big secret.

481
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,709
More importantly, Yuuji...

482
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:11,250

497
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,626
That was disgusting.

498
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,083
So, what's our new plan?

499
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,083
Our group battle plan

500
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,083
is what we expected,

501
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,125
but we have another member now.

502
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:51,918
Should we change strategies?

503
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We don't have much time.

505
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:56,083
Well I think that'll

506
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:56,083
depend on Yuuji.

507
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,751
What are your specialties?

508
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,459
Punch, kick--

509
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:03,042
We're already pretty

510
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:03,042
well set for all of that.

511
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,042
Huh?

512
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:05,834
I don't know what

513
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:05,834
he's been doing,

514
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:09,125
since he's been dead

515
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:09,125
for a while now.

516
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,918
But I can say this much,

517
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,083
if we all fought him

518
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,083
without cursed energy

519
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,667
Itadori'd still beat us.

520
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:17,667
[Both] Oh?

521
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,500
Megumi's saying that, even

522
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,500
after fighting Toudou?

523
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:24,125
That makes it pretty convincing.

524
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:25,876

00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,876
Sukuna's vessel is

528
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,876
not an actual person.

529
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,167
So the act will go unquestioned.

530
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,125
Without a doubt the entire event

531
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,167
will be seen as an accident.

532
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,083
So there's no need for you

533
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,083
to hold back or hesitate.

534
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,334
I don't want to!

535
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,125
You're telling us to kill him.

536
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:53,125
But he's only here because

537
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:53,125
he didn't die the last time.

538
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,667
I've been told that

539
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,667
Itadori's previous death

540
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,334
was by suicide.

541
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:58,334
Kamo?

542
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,417
When ending a hostile sorcerer,

543
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,292
what is the one thing you

544
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,292
must be cautious about?

545
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,000
Sir.

546
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,209
So that they don't

547
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,209
come back as a curse

548
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,167
you must kill them

549
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,167
with cursed energy.

550
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,334
Yes, correct.

551
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:12,834
As long as one of you

552
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:12,834
delivers the finishing blow

553
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,000
using cursed energy

554
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,000
all will be well.

555
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,584
For now, Yuuji Itadori

556
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,042
seems to have full

557
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,042
control over his body.

558
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,542
So unless Sukuna comes out,

559
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:22,542
the boy is just

560
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:22,542
another first-year.

561
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:25,542
Which means that

562
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:25,542
killing him will be--

563
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,542
This sucks!

564
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:27,792
Do what you want.

565
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:28,918
Hold on, Toudou.

566
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,334
The principal

567
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,334
hasn't finished yet.

568
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,709
Takada will be making

569
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,709
a live appearance

570
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:37,000
on a TV show today at eleven.

571
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,542
And I am not gonna miss that.

572
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:40,751
You can record it.

573
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,167
Come back.

574
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,834
I'm gonna watch it in real

575
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,834
time and I'm gonna record it!

576
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:47,459
What kinda fool

577
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:47,459
d'you think I am?

578
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:50,375
That's what you're

579
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:50,375
worried about?

580
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,626
You all listen up!

581
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:53,959
And you too, old man!

582
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,876
I've been putting up

583
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,876
with all of your failures

584
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,417
and your lousy taste in

585
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,417
women for long enough!

586
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,959
So you can plot and scheme

587
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,959
all you want on your own.

588
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:05,209
But now, if you try to

589
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:05,209
order me around again,

590
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,375
I will kill you!

591
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,125
So what do we do now?

592
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,375
How are we gonna carry

593
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,375
out the game plan

594
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,792
with Toudou acting like that?

595
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:19,834
Now the principal's

596
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:19,834
gone off too.

597
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:21,959
Personally, I really don't

598
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:21,959
want to be killed by that

599
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:21,959
guy.

600
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,083
Does it even matter?

601
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,000
Toudou's just going

602
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,000
to charge head-first

603
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,834
into the Tokyo team anyway.

604
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:30,459
So I figure while

605
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:30,459
he goes berserk

606
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,667
the rest of us can

607
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,667
just keep our efforts

608
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,167
focused on the game.

609
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,083
Don't forget we have direct

610
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,083
orders to kill Yuuji

611
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,083
Itadori.

612
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,125
We're seriously doing this?

613
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:43,459
Honestly, I doubt Toudou

614
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:43,459
will actually kill him.

615
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,334
But he is capable of it.

616
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,918
Then we'll need

617
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,918
to assign someone

618
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,250
to keep an eye on Toudou,

619
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,042
and deliver the final

620
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,042
blow to Yuuji Itadori.

621
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,250
I don't like this.

622
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:57,292
Because of the cursed spirits

623
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:57,292
we'll all be in two-man cells.

624
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,417
So that works for us.

625
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,417
No.

626
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,626
Allowing a half-wit

627
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,626
like Yuuji Itadori

628
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:07,834
to exist as a sorcerer at

629
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:07,834
this

630
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:07,834
school is a serious problem.

631
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:10,209
One that goes beyond this event.

632
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:12,876
As Kamo clan elder I decree,

633
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,334
it must end.

634
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,751
We will all attack

635
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,751
Itadori together.

636
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,083
Hold on.

637
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,334
What if Toge Inumaki is there

638
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,334
with Itadori when we attack?

639
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,709
Having all of us in one

640
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,709
place is a risky move

641
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,834
with that cursed speech user.

642
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:32,334
Worst case, he could

643
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:32,334
wipe us all out at once.

644
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,500
She has a point.

645
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:35,792
No.

646
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:38,292
If you know he's coming, he's

647
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:38,292
not that difficult to handle.

648
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,834
Let me take care of

649
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,834
Maki and while I'm at it

650
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,834
that brown-haired

651
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,834
first year as well.

652
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:45,125
What's on your mind?

653
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,167
You're starting to

654
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,167
sound like Toudou.

655
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,876
(growl)

656
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:50,375
Well then?

657
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,751
What did you want?

658
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:53,751
Huh?

659
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,375
Are you upset now?

660
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:57,709
No I'm not upset at all.

661
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,000
'Course not.

662
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,500
'Cause I haven't

663
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,500
done anything wrong.

664
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:01,334
(irritated growl)

665
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,959
But I'm afraid we have a spy.

666
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,250
Someone's working with a curse

667
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:08,542
-or a curse user here.

668
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:08,542
-(gasp)

669
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:09,876
Impossible!

670
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,083
A curse user's one thing,

671
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,083
but working with curses?

672
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,334
And yet a lot of

673
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,334
them on that level

674
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:16,500
have been popping up lately.

675
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:17,709
They understand human speech,

676
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,918
and they've formed a faction

677
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,918
that's operating with

678
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,918
purpose.

679
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,250
They might think

680
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,250
they're just working

681
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,209
with a curse user, but...

682
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:27,125
You need to investigate

683
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:27,125
everyone at Kyoto.

684
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,584
For all you know I could

685
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,584
be the traitor so why me?

686
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,584
Ohh no way!

687
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,959
You're too weak.

688
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,626
You don't have

689
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,626
the guts for that.

690
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,584
Ooh! Hysterics are a turnoff

691
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,584
for men, you know.

692
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:42,584
[Utahime] That's enough!

693
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,125
I'm the senior in charge here!

694
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:49,292
[Megumi] Itadori.

695
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,334
Hmm?

696
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:52,751
You okay?

697
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:56,375
Yeah, but I've got a big

698
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:56,375
job, from what I hear.

699
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:59,542
I mean about what happened.

700
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:01,417
Ha, no, nothing happened!

701
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:05,584
'Kay, yeah.

702
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:08,709
Something did happen.

703
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:09,751
But it's true that I'm okay.

704
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:15,083
In fact, because of it I

705
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:15,083
really don't want to lose.

706
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,584
Alright then.

707
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:18,834
Huh?

708
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,375
Because I don't

709
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,375
wanna lose either.

710
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:23,250
Why're you two

711
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:23,250
talking about losing?

712
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,792
After you already

713
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,792
got rolled once!

714
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,459
Whoa! Let's go!

715
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,626
Let's kick their asses!

716
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,334
Let's do it for Maki!

717
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,167
Don't say stuff like that.

718
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,292
Pollack roe.

719
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,375
Yeah! Let's do it for Maki!

720
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,292
[Maki] I said, don't

721
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,292
say stuff like that!

722
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:40,584
In that case...

723
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,584
Let's win!

724
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,334
(grunt)

725
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,000
Who said you could go first?

726
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,250
(ending theme music)

"Sushi Eishuu"

729
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,209
Hi!

730
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,542
Today we're at the

731
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,542
famous sushi restaurant

732
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,334
known as Sushi Eishuu!

733
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,375
You should dress like

734
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,375
that and be on TV.

735
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:33,209
You know you'd be mad

736
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:33,209
at me if I did that.

737
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,918
[Sushi Chef] Welcome

738
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,918
to Sushi Eishuu.

739
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:49,375
So what would you like, Takada?

740
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,375
What's your favorite?

741
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,709
I really love goatfish!

742
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:53,375
And room-temperature sake!

743
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,334
They go great together!

744
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,792
Uhh, just how old are you?

745
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,834
Huh?

746
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,250
How long have you been

747
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,250
making sushi, boss?

748
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:07,584
Since I was 20 years old.

749
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:11,751
Which I guess probably

750
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:11,751
means about 300 years?

751
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,584
Are you drunk?

752
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:16,500
[Sushi Chef] Here.

753
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:16,500
Enjoy your goatfish.

754
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:18,626
Mmm!

755
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:19,626
Ohhh, mmm!

756
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:21,459
That is so good!

757
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,959
Can I have yours, too?

758
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:25,459
No, of course you can't.

759
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,167
[Takada] Oh, I'm sorry!

760
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,417
[Man In Blue Suit] Honestly,

761
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,417
what are you thinking?

762
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,417
Well, it just

763
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,417
looked

764
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,792
-She' probably is drunk.

765
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,792
-so delicious!

766
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,959
That's my girl Takada.

767
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,417
Did you know OPP actually

768
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,417
stands for something?

769
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,459
Yeah?

770
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,542
Like what?
