00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.860
Huh?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.080
[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.260
[KOGUMA]
They said in the weather report,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.730
that due to radiant cooling,
or a cold air mass,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.400
or something like that, this
morning would be as cold

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.480
as a midwinter day.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.280
[KOGUMA] It didn't sink in
till I got on my Cub.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.290
But when I started riding,
I realized how much more

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.660
I can feel the seasons
changing when I'm on a bike.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.090
[KOGUMA] And riding through
that freezing air...

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.460
It felt like I was
swimming in ice.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.020
[KOGUMA whimpers]

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.460
[REIKO]
Ah... It's so warm...

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.510
[sighs] We have to deal
with this weather.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.760
You're right.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.930
This cold's becoming too much.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.770
I don't like it, but we
might not have a choice.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.440
We always have an option.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.060
I choose "no."

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.400
I get it, but I'm not sure if
anything else would work.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.690
I don't care.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.070
They're super dorky,
and I won't buy one.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.780
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.040
It's starting to get
too cold to eat outside.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.170
Ah...

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.550
[REIKO]
Nice!

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.880
Your meal tin works
for cooking rice, huh?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.600
[SHII]
Excuse me.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.310
I'd like to eat with you,
if you don't mind.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480
Sure.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.070
Ah...!

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.200
[REIKO chuckles]

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.130
Here.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.630
This should warm you up.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.170
Oh, thank you.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.470
[SHII]
And one for you, Reiko.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.510
Thanks so much.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.010
[SHII]
Hmm.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.940
[SHII]
Tè al latte.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.230
It's a kind of milk tea
they make in Italy,

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.780
and just to help with the cold,
I added a tiny hint of grappa.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.280
What's grappa?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.160
[SHII] It's a brandy they make
from leftover wine pomace.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.660
Ah...

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.250
Stand up for a second.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.790
[SHII]
Huh?

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.130
- [REIKO] Hmm.
- [SHII] Ah!

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.090
- [REIKO] Hmm...
- [SHII] Uh, Reiko?

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.380
Oh my gosh!

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.260
That's perfect. You'll fit.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.930
What?

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.470
If we fold Shii up, we can
keep her in my storage box,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.480
and then we can basically
have hot coffee and tea

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.390
on demand no matter
where we go!

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.810
- Ah!
- [sighs]

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.020
But seriously,
is this coat enough

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.610
to get you through winter?

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.780
Huh?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.530
[REIKO]
Even when you're on the Moulton?

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.120
Oh. It keeps the cold out
well enough, I suppose.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.530
[REIKO]
Hmm...

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.080
Although...

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.870
If your jacket's not enough,
you could always add a layer.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.210
If I could afford another layer.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.250
That jacket is all she's got.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.090
How troublesome.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.920
Ah. If you could visit the shop,

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.430
I think we might have
just the thing!

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.180
[SHII]
I'm home!

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.100
Hey! Welcome back!

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.100
Hi!

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.980
Just a moment, please. Mm!

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.360
Could I interest
you girls in a cup of

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.440
our Mandheling high roast?

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.190
Uh... Yes, please.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.110
I'll have one, too.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.120
[SHII]
Sorry to keep you.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.040
I was looking for this.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.670
[KOGUMA]
Mm...

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.260
[sniffs]
It smells kinda weird.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.840
[REIKO]
Lemme see!

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.640
This sweater is made
of unscoured wool!

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.930
Awesome.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.180
I've never seen
the stuff in person!

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.720
"Unscoured?"

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.640
[SHII'S FATHER]
Fresh off the sheep.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.810
With as little
processing as possible.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.230
There's still lanolin on it
when they spin it into yarn.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.280
Outdoorsmen in the Rockies and
the Northern Territories

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.400
of Canada don't
trust anything else.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.530
All the hunters line their
jackets with unscoured wool

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.280
to stop the cold.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.330
Burt Munro was wearing it
when he set speed records

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.160
on the world's fastest Indian!

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.040
Most riding suits
are synthetic fabric,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.040
but Burt raced across
the Utah salt flats

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.960
in New Zealand sheep's wool.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.800
It's hard to imagine
wearing that on a bike.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.590
But instead of wearing
the cardigan, what if you

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.130
converted it into a liner
for your motorcycle jacket?

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.880
And there would probably
be enough left over to make

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.800
a pair of stockings for you!

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.140
That could be cool.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.180
Please, Papa? Can we?

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.730
Come to think of it,
you've hardly worn that

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.350
since I bought it for you.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.020
I'd be happy to see it go
to someone who would

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.900
get some use out of it.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.770
Reiko?

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.490

What do you think?

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.040
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.970
It is very warm.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.220
[door bell jingles]

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.350
[SHII'S FATHER, SHII]
Hmm?

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.680
[REIKO]
Mm?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.150
Okay. We'll take it.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.940
I should warn you that
you'll need to add some oil

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.520
whenever you wash it.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.570
That means you have to soak it
in hot water with a little bit

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.150
of lanolin mixed in. It's pretty
high-maintenance material.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.070
If it's high-maintenance,
I know I can trust it.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.950
[SHII'S FATHER] Hmm.
Well, as a present for Shii,

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.580
it was a bit of a bust.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.910
I'm glad to know it'll be of
some good to somebody.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.040
Thank you very much, sir.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.460
Are you ready
to get started on it?

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.920
[SHII] Huh? I suggested it
because I'd assumed

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.880
you'd be able to
sew it yourself!

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.340
After all, you repair
your motorbike.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.340
I can't.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.970
[SHII]
Ah! Papa?

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.300
Not my thing!

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.060
Sewing on buttons is about
as much as I'm good for.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.980
Don't bother asking Mom.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.390
[KOGUMA]

Is there any chance
you have a helmet?

I think we still have
the helmet Shii used to wear

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.800
back in middle school,
if that would work.

And a pair of stockings!

I think it might be
the only way to keep us

from freezing to death.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.970
Heh. That's a little
melodramatic. Can I take a look

at the material

Is this unscoured wool?!

That's right.

so I went with a button-down.

And these are soft rubber
buttons like they use

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.060

so it should be

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.780
One more thing.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.530
Here. For your thermos.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.740
[gasps]

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.580
[TEACHER 2A]
Do you think it'll be useful?

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.790
Yes!

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.410
Feel free to ask for
anything else you need.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.170
If it's made of wool,
I can take care of it.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.130
[REIKO, SHII chuckle]

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.920
[GIRLS]
Thank you very much!

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.730
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.350
Heh.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.680
How are your stockings?

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.940
[REIKO]
Hmm. They feel pretty nice.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.310
[SHII]
Hmm.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.980
And is the liner working well?

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.860
Better than I imagined.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.030
I don't think I'll have to worry
about the cold for a while.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.450
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.160
[chuckles]

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.170
[ANNOUNCER 2A]
And now, the weather.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.800
The Kofu Local Meteorological
Office has reported

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.840
the first snow of the
season has arrived on

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.390
the slopes of Mount Fuji.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.720
The Meteorological
Agency's AMeDAS system

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.480
anticipates more precipitation.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.830
[KOGUMA whimpers]

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.250
The liner isn't enough
on its own anymore.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.120
[REIKO]
It's the worst feeling, right?

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.090
Once it gets colder than
your gear can handle,

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.250
it's like you're
not even wearing it.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.260
You know what we have
to do, don't you?

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.840
I am not doing it!

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.340
It would totally wreck
my Hunter's aesthetic.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.800
I get that, but what other
choice do we have?

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.640
- Good morning, you two!
- I'd rather freeze!

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720
Ugh!

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.850
[SHII]
Mm.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.530
Are the two of you
heading out somewhere?

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.360
Just some shopping. Bye.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.950
[REIKO]
Stop acting like we've decided!

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.410
Please come by the café after!

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.000
We'll have hot coffee
waiting for you!

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.670
[whines]

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.150
Honestly, if we don't install
them, we're gonna―

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.350
[REIKO]
No way!

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.020
If I can't get through
the winter without one,

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.990
I'd rather leave my bike
locked up till Spring.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.780
It's not like I'm
excited about it, either.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.570
I can barely afford it.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.120
Even used ones are expensive.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.580
[KOGUMA, REIKO whimpering]

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.120
Ah! That's nice.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.620
[sighs]

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.210
There it is.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.050
[KOGUMA]
A windshield.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.520
You want it?

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.440
[KOGUMA groans]

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.480
[PATRON 9A]
Beg your pardon.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.280
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.620
[CASHIER 9A]
Thank you very much!

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.450
- [KOGUMA] Excuse me.
- Huh?

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.080
[KOGUMA] I was looking for
a Super Cub windshield.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.410
Do you have any more?

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.630
Aw, too bad. He just bought
the last one we had.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.460
Is there anything in stock
that's compatible with

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.170
a Hunter Cub?

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.760
[CASHIER 9A]
Hmm...

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.970
Doesn't look like there's
any in our inventory.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.970
Well, that's good.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.100
If you did, I might've done
something silly, like buy one.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.430
Yeah, me, too.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.350
To think I almost talked
myself into buying one.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.610
Hang on. One of our
sister locations has some.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.770
I can put in
an order if you like.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.730
We'd get them in
two or three days.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.490
[BOTH gulp]

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.820
[BOTH]
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm!

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.500
[SHII]
Thanks for your patience.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.880
It's cappuccinos today.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920
Nice.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.720
I can smell a little
hint of brandy.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.510
That's Uchida Grappa,
made here in Yamanashi!

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.800
I bet a little more would
make it even better!

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:54.810
[SHII]
Not a chance.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.430
[REIKO groans]

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.020
[SHII] If either of you need
a refill, just let me know.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.770
We will, thanks.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.490
So, a windshield...
What do you think?

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.530
No way. They're too dorky.

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:10.990
I read they're
the most effective way

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.320
to handle the cold.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.660
Okay. So are you gonna get one?

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.950
If I did, I would be pretty
broke for the rest of the month.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.500
[SHII]
Um.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.290
Isn't there some way you could
test one if you're not sure

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.840
you're ready to buy?

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.090
I got to try an espresso
machine at the school festival.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.010
That's what convinced me
to get one.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.010
[gasps]

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.220
[KOGUMA]
So we just say,

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.220
"Hey, can I ride off
on one of your bikes?"

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.430
I can't imagine any dealer
would let us do that

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.890
just to try out a windshield.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.480
[REIKO]
I can!

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:43.940
Let's go!

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.810
Huh? As in, now?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.400
Trust me. It'll work out.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.570
Thanks for the drink!

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.610
[gulping]

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.910
- [KOGUMA] Bye.
- Ah!

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.660
Aw...

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.960
[REIKO]
See you later, Shii.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.250
[SHII]
You'll come by again, right?

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.840
If this cold lasts, definitely.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.930
[SHII]
I hope we get snow soon.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.610
'Scuse me, mister!

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.480
[MANAGER 3A]
Well, this sounds urgent.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.110
It is! Can we borrow a Cub?

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.490
Huh?

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.740
[MANAGER 3A]
My company bikes are all on

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.410
the road at the moment.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.410
I hate to disappoint you but...
this is all I've got right now.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.380
[REIKO]
The frame is bent.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.420
Was it in an accident?

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.170
[MANAGER 3A] It had a close
encounter with a truck.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.130
And the oil filter cap
went flying off somewhere

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.300
after it got hit.
So naturally, the oil leaks.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.640
But I kept running it
without making the repair.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.350
Now the cylinder and
the head are in a state.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:03.940
[REIKO]
Does it not run?

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.350
It'll survive a quick trip
out and back,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.940
if you don't mind the burning
oil and the knocking.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.230
Slower than
a stock fifty, though.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.110
It'll be okay.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.100
[REIKO, KOGUMA]
Thank you very much!

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.230
[KOGUMA]
So?

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.240
[REIKO]
Yeah, I'm convinced.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.370
Even though they're super dorky?

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.160
Getting too hung up
on looks is dorkier.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.910
Can you buy one
and still afford food?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.250
I should have enough rice
and meals-in-a-bag to get by

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.750
until my scholarship pays out.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.130
[REIKO]
Cool.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.960
The windshield was really nice,

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.920
but it was the only
part worth saving.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.760
That Cub was a nightmare.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.800
He said he was gonna scrap it.
You should pick it up.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.680
No, thank you.
Not even for free.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.730
[BOTH chuckle]

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.230
Gosh, they really
love their Cubs.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.020
I'm jealous.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.010
Heh.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.850
[BOTH]
Mm.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.690
[BOTH]
Mm-hmm.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.410
Awesome.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.710
Awesome! It's great! I love it!

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.040
[REIKO]
Yahoo!

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.380
[laughs]

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.460
[gasps]

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.300
[KOGUMA] That day,
we rode and rode non-stop.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.520
[KOGUMA] We kept riding
even as the sun went down.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.480
We were so excited
we could hardly feel

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.600
the temperature dropping.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.820
It finally felt like we'd
done enough to prepare

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.360
for the winter.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.200
And we'd had a lot
of people help us out.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.830
I realized that working
on my Cub made it easier

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.950
to talk to people.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.500
Thank you so much for coming!

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.170
[KOGUMA] Before long, autumn
will give way to winter.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.010
That's fine.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.510
The cold won't slow us down now.
No matter how chilly it gets.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:30.140
We'll still be on the road
riding our Cubs in comfort.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:31.730
In the end...

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.060
...getting our bikes winterized
didn't leave us feeling boxed in

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.320
like we thought. In fact,
it opened up a whole new world

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.860
of potential and
promise for us.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.490
