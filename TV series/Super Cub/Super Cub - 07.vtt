WEBVTT

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.820
[KOGUMA] It's been almost
half a year now since life

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.110
with my Cub first began.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.070
After the school trip,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.910
I went back to my normal
day-to-day routine.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.040
And that one, small adventure―

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.830
the day I spent riding
through the mountains

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.120
to meet the bus in Kamakura―

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.500
has started to feel more
like a dream than a memory.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.810
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.560
How's the Hunter Cub?
Do you like it?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.980
[sighs]
I just barely hit a thousand.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.400
It's not broken in yet.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.650
Ah.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.610
But anyway... Jeez, it's cold.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.910
[KOGUMA] People should
pay a fine for pointing out

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.490
that it's cold.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.040
[REIKO] Well, what are
we supposed to do?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.460
It's freezing!

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.790
Next time you say it,
I pull your license.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.920
I have no money, Officer.
I just bought a bike.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.430
[REIKO]
Hmm?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.550
Fine. I'll take this
and call it settled.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.560
[REIKO]
Where'd that come from?

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.430
[KOGUMA]
The season is changing.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.100
The wind is growing chillier.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.610
But within the halls
of our school,

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.230
the atmosphere is buzzing
with this strange energy.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.570
Ah. Hey, good morning.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.070
[SHII]
Good morning!

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.280
What's in there?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.160
[SHII] Some scraps
from the Home Ec room.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.620
They told me to take
anything we could use.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.040
[KOGUMA]
That simmering excitement,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.540
and the wind
growing ever colder...

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.630
[KOGUMA]
Autumn has arrived.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.440
This might be nice.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.150
Where can we use it?

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.020
Uh... Huh?

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.400
Good morning, Reiko!

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.780
Morning.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.110
[SHII]
Did you stop by?

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.650
I did.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.320
You took off early, though!

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.410
[SHII]
Well...

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.660
There's a lot
to do for the festival!

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.200
[KOGUMA]
"Stop by?"

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.500
Yeah, her family
runs a bake shop.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.920
[KOGUMA]
Ah.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.470
The festival, huh?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.970
[REIKO] Our class is
doing a little restaurant.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.050
What kind?

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.850
An Italian café.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.310
[KOGUMA]
So they'll have coffee?

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.810
Espresso.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.140
Daiichi has already
had their festival.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.850
Apparently, they offered
to lend us everything

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.940
we need for next to nothing.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.280
The espresso machine and the
flatware and all that stuff.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.030
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.240
Would this be good?

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.740
- I think it's perfect!
- [RIEKO sighs]

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.080
I hate to admit it, but I think
these gloves are done.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.250
[KOGUMA] If you need to replace
them, you should do it soon.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.710
It's going to get a lot colder.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.340
Some streets around
here will freeze over

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.380
and become impassable.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.430
We should figure something out
before that happens.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:41.030
[school bell chimes]

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.740
[GIRL 7A sighs]
All done!

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.280
[GIRL 7B]
Got any plans?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.120
[GIRL 2A]
Excuse me. Everyone?

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.200
We're with the culture
festival executive committee!

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.080
Thank you. We're running
an espresso bar

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.880
and we're putting up
the room decorations today.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.960
We could use as many
extra hands as we can get.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.300
If anyone's free right now,
we'd really appreciate

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.510
if you would stay and help!

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.800
[BOY 7A]
Hm, what do you think?

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.140
[BOY 7B]
I think it sounds like fun.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.930
- [GIRL 7C] Ooh, yeah!
- [BOY 7C] Yeah, I'm down!

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.890
[REIKO]
Wanna stay?

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.770
Thanks so much! We should have
all the materials ready to go.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.940
[REIKO]
Hmm?

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.360
We need to take care of this.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.570
Oh, yeah.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.780 line:20%
"café"

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.780
mean "coffee"?

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.160
[SHII] For mainly
espresso drinks, but yes.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.870
I bet it'll be great!

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.910
Where are we going?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.250
[REIKO]
The secondhand shops in Kofu.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.210
While we're there, I should look
into how to winterize my Cub.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.660
[REIKO gasps]
Come check this out.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.450
Ah! Hey, it'll just be a second!

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.290
[KOGUMA]
That's not why we're here.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.880
[REIKO]
Hmm...

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.440
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.190
It's a fact. Non-slip work
gloves are a winner every time.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.280
Are they seriously that good?

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.240
[REIKO]
Mm-hmm. Seriously!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.070
Even among what we refer
to as developed nations,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.370
lots of transport pilots
and even fighter pilots

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.830
are still flying in
plain old work gloves.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.830
I mean, if you can trust them
to keep you in control

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.870
through high-G maneuvers,
they're clearly the best―

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.330
Right.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.170
[REIKO] Hey, stop trying to
tune me out! I'm for real!

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.800
[KOGUMA]
I wasn't.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.630
Quit teasing me.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.800
Come on, Koguma...

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.480
[REIKO]
You ready to go?

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.350
[SHII]
Aw...

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.770
[BOY 2A]
Oh, crap. Really?

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.520
The teacher can't
give us a ride?

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.860
She said she had something
else on her schedule.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.610
Weren't you supposed
to ask her ahead of time

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.030
if she could do it for us?

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.700
Huh? I thought
that was your job.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.910
Nobody told me!

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.540
Right now, we need
to worry about getting

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.660
that stuff over here. Or we
can't get ready for tomorrow!

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.380
Sounds like they hit a snag.
That's not cool.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.040
Well, let's get going.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.960
Right.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.680
Could somebody's parents
drive out to Daiichi?

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.050
The train?
Or, wait, some motorbikes!

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.390
Do you have any idea how much
espresso machines cost?

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.730
Think, dude! You wanna
load a bunch of fragile

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.390
and expensive stuff
on a bike?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.400
[BOY 2A] Well, we've gotta
come up with something, right?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.980
[GIRL 2G] Yeah, that's the idea,
so could we move on?

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.990
A-Ah... Hey, no need to argue!

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.900
Stay calm, okay?

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.120
Reiko. You have that rig?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.700
[sighs] It still needs
a damper replaced.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.790
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.750
[GROUP]
Hmm?

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.050
[KOGUMA]
Maybe we can help you out.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.260
Um. Thank you,
but why "maybe"?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.140
Does this list have everything
you were going to pick up?

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.720
[SHII]
Ah. Yes.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.810
I'll have to make a trip
to the staff room.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.060
I need to borrow something.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.190
Try the gym, they've actually
got a really nice one.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.190
[SHII]
Mm...

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.370
[KOGUMA] A job like this
is nothing for our Cubs.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:53.340
[KOGUMA panting]

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.610
That didn't take long.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.870
And you managed
to get a trailer.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.290
The tire pressure is fine,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.000
and the axle bearings
check out, too.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.750
The handle mount seems
to be in good shape.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.250
Everything looks okay here.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.550
I never expected to
actually use that thing.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.510
Hey, you can't say that about
a bona fide masterpiece

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.800
of engineering!
It stays so steady

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.180
that even an amateur rider
could make noodle deliveries

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.140
using this rig without
breaking any bowls

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.390
or spilling one drop of broth!

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.060
Good thing we have it.
Well, shall we go?

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.290
[REIKO]
Hmm...

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.000
So, hey. What if, instead of
having the world's most awesome

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.170
Hunter Cub haul
the big dorky trailer,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.130
we hitched it up
to yours instead?

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.510
[KOGUMA] My little 52 CC engine
would struggle with it.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.680
We need something with
more torque, like your 110.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.310
I know...

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.540
[chuckles]

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.710
Okay.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.510
Not bad at all.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.770
[KOGUMA]
Reiko?

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.220
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.660
I'd say everything
is ready to go.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.740
[BOTH]
Mm!

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.700
[SHII]
E-Excuse me...

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.290
[SHII]
Ah...

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.790
Is that stuff here?

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.420
In the box.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.760
[SHII]
Ah...

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.510
Huh?

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.840
These are percolators.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.760
You should learn to use
them before you go home.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.100
We wanted to give you
a backup option―

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.060
an early American-style
Old West saloon.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.100
There's a Winchester rifle
and cowboy clothes

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.770
in the Drama Club room.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.320
A Republic of Texas flag,
and a pair of those cool

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.490
swinging saloon
doors, of course.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.570
They also have pork and
beans and premade apple pie

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.200
at Super Ono.
Call it a cowboy café.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.330
No matter what it is
you plan to do,

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.710
it's always important to have
a backup plan ready.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.670
[SHII]
Ah...

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.000
Mm.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.220
Okay. We'll be back.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.020
[REIKO]
Bye!

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.910
[REIKO chuckles]

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.460
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.790
[KOGUMA]
Wait right here.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.210
[REIKO]
Gotcha.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.750
Okay, thank you for coming.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.800
[knocking]

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.380
[KOGUMA]
Excuse me.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.970
Hey!

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.640
Long time no see!

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.400
Looks like you're doing well.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.150
I'm here to pick up stuff
for the culture festival.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.610
What? We were told to expect
your teacher to show up

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.280
in her car.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.030
[grunts]

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.300
Ah. I think I get it.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.550
We have everything ready to go.
I'll bring it out--one sec.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.930
'Kay.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.850
That's the last of it.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.940
Ya know, I gotta say,
it seems like these Cubs

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.900
can come in pretty handy.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.650
Maybe I should ask my Grandpa
if he'll give me his old one.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.370
It's better to buy
a new one if you can.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.950
[REIKO] Turns out they're
not actually indestructible.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.990
And I have proof.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.950
Old Cubs can be tons of trouble.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.920
[TEACHER 4A] Hmm. Yeah, but
trouble in a fun way, right?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.210
[REIKO giggles]

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.460
[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.470
[REIKO]
Thanks a lot.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.720
Thank you very much
for your help.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.980
Careful out there!

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.220
[STUDENTS screaming]

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.010
[ACTOR 7A]
'Tis Umahachi whom you face!

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.220
In grieving for
Omasa, Sukesada―

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.980
[SHII]
Ah. Welcome!

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.440
Table for two, please!

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.940
[STUDENTS]
Welcome!

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.030
[BOY 2A]
Welcome. Right this way, please.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.110
[SHII]
Hmm.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.030
[BOY 7D]
Thanks for your patience.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.290
[GIRL 2G] One espresso and
a lettuce-and-ham panini.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.790
Order up!

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.660
[BOY 2B]
Coming!

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.410
Thank you. Excellent work.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.790
[BOY 2B]
Of course!

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.510
[giggles]

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.140
The teacher said they would
reimburse us for whatever gas

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.760
we used on the way.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.560
Oh, cool. How generous of them.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.390
'Cause gas is all you
need to keep a vehicle

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.270
on the road, obviously.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.690
It might be 100 yen, round trip.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.650
Maybe I can get
a coffee out of it.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.150
I'll try telling her
my change rolled under

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.860
the vending machine.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.910
Where to next?

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.870
Uh... I wanna stretch my legs.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:00.950
[SHII]
W-Wait!

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.740
- One moment, please!
- [KOGUMA] Hmm?

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.960
Forgive me. I haven't had
a chance to say thanks.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.380
So please, take these
as tokens of gratitude.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.180
A coffee.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.770
[BOTH laugh]

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.310
[SHII]
Hmm?

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.810
[slurps]

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.360
Ah...

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.860
The whole class is very
grateful to you, honestly.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.900
But everyone's
busy with the café.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.450
This is payment enough.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.280
Also, your motorbikes
are amazing!

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.790
I have thought that quite often.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.000
Our bikes are amazing
'cause they're Cubs!

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.620
[SHII]
Uh...

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:58.800
I'd like to try one, myself.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.140
Although, that would
be a bad idea.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.350
I can barely stay on my bicycle.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.810
It would be better not to try it
if you don't feel confident.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.270
[SHII]
Huh?

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.440
If you're nervous when
you get on a Cub,

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.060
it'll feel that and
get nervous, too,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.530
and probably fling
you off its seat.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.030
They can tell.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.990
They're made so that you
have to want to ride them.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.950
'Cause otherwise,
they won't let you.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.450
[SHII]
Mm...

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.870
We'll bring these mugs
to the classroom later.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.410
You can head back to
the counter, Shii―

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.170
I'm sure they need your help.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.790
[SHII]
Uh, right.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.170
And really, thank you
both so much.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.380
Ah!

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.690
[KOGUMA slurps]

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.650
That was sweet.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.440
[REIKO slurps]

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.610
[KOGUMA] I'll take these.
Look into some winter gloves.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.030
Real ones.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.660
Roger that!

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.700
- [BOY 2A] Two cappuccinos here!
- I'll take one.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.920
- Got it!
- Order up! One tall macchiato!

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.250
[KOGUMA] Suddenly, I was in the
middle of the culture festival.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.550
This prim and delicate
girl has always been

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.840
hard at work in the background.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.970
But now, for some reason,
Shii stands out to me.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.520
If I had to describe
her as a color,

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.810
I would have called her
a washed-out shade of blue.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.150
But now, I've seen her
from a bit closer.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.820
And I think I was wrong.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.370
Her color is light,
but warm and vibrant.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:46.660
[SHII giggles]

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.780
[KOGUMA]
Like a summer sky.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.670
[KOGUMA] Episode 8:
"Shii's Place."
