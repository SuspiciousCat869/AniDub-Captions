[KOGUMA]
December.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.810
The solstice has passed, and our
school is finally on break

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.730
for winter vacation.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.780
[KOGUMA] My Cub came
with leg shields built into

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.160
the factory body, and with the
addition of the windshield

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.410
and the handlebar
covers I bought,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.410
any problems I might have
had riding in the cold

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.410
are basically resolved now.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.710
And after the usual complaints
about how dorky-looking

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.210
they were, Reiko gave in
and installed a pair

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.130
of leg shields, too.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.180
The cold is no longer an issue.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.850
We're as free on our Cubs
now as we were before.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.520
Free to go whenever,
and wherever we like.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.930
Huh?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.940
[panting]

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.990
Hi there, Koguma!

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.280
Going shopping?

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.000
I am. I'm picking up
coffee beans in Nirasaki.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.540
Be careful.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.250
Right!

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.550
[KOGUMA] Shii has been carrying
on with her mission to convert

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.430
the dining area of
her family's shop

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.800
to an Italian-style café.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.810
Getting a job with
the post office,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.730
and scouring the town for
anything that could be

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.640
used at the shop.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.840
[KOGUMA whimpers]

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.730
[KOGUMA]
So chilly...

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.820
[KOGUMA] For the first time
since I bought my Cub...

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.910
...I woke up and
looked out my window...

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.160
...at a world
gleaming in silver.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.770
[KOGUMA]
I can't ride in this.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.010
[phone buzzing]

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.510
[buzzing continues]

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.350
Hey, Reiko.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.640
[REIKO]
Get over here right now!

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
- No way.
- [REIKO] Seriously, come on!

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.070
I've got something
you really need to see!

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.530
[receive clicks]

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.650
[KOGUMA]
Hmm...

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.950
- [phone buzzes]
- Hmm? Hmm...

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.660
Ah!

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.710
[receiver ringing]

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.300
- [REIKO] Hey, what's up?
- I'm on my way.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.740
[whimpering]

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.150
[REIKO]
Hmm?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.820
Glad you could make it.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.200
Are those...?

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
[REIKO] Yep. Tire chains
for a Super Cub.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.130
Those will be helpful.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.960
Where did you get them?

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.050
The newspaper distributor
in Sagamihara

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.130
is going out of business.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.800
I figured it would have been
a great place to find

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.220
cheap Cub parts in good shape,
but I arrived too late.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.890
All the big stuff like chassis
were picked over. Kinda sad.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.400
I guess no one thought these
were worth paying for.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.150
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.230
[REIKO]
I wasn't sure, either.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.610
But they actually
came in handy

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.650
way earlier than I expected.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.150
Ready to put yours on?

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.910
[gasps]
Yes, please!

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.610
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.650
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.330
[BOTH chuckle]

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.300
Where are we going?

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.960
[REIKO]
A bit further uphill.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.180
I found this
really awesome spot.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.720
Sounds good.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.240
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.490
[REIKO chuckles]

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.880
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.960
[REIKO giggles]

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.180
[gasps]

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.960
[REIKO]
Here we go!

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.300
[REIKO]
Yahoo...!

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.690
Ah― Ah!

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.690
Ah... Ah-Ah...!

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.200
[KOGUMA gasps]

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.580
[panting]

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.920
Heh!

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.010
[REIKO]
Woo-hoo!

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.650
[REIKO giggles]

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.190
[KOGUMA chuckles]

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.530
[gasps]

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:47.250
[laughs]

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.710
[REIKO gasps]

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.040
Ah!

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.800
[REIKO panting]

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.880
[giggles]

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.010
[KOGUMA grunts]

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.230
[BOTH panting]

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.360
[giggling]

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.980
[chuckling]

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.490
[REIKO]
Hmm!

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.700
Ah!

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.760
[KOGUMA]
Here.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.170
[REIKO]
Ah?

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.010
So this whole thing's
mine, isn't it?

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.010
For the chains?

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.720
No, silly, you get half.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.230
[REIKO chuckles]

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.440
Nice, the tin even
kept it kinda warm.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.450
[gulping]

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.030
[REIKO]
Mm.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.290
[KOGUMA]
Here.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.000
Thank you.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.500
[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.880
[REIKO]
Mm.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.850
[KOGUMA chuckling]

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.150
Here I go!

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.690
Whoo!

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.020
[KOGUMA giggles]

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.730
Ah― Ah!

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.580
[panting]

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.920
[REIKO chuckling]

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.840
[sighs]

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.130
[grunts]

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.380
That all you got?

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.760
[grunts]

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.130
[REIKO]
You can do better!

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.890
[KOGUMA grunting]

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.760
Ya think so?

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.970
[giggling]

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.730
[engine revvs]

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.230
Ah! Hey! Using your
Cub's against the rules!

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.530
We never talked about
the rules, did we?

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.190
Okay, fine, you win!

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.570
I give up!

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.780
[KOGUMA giggles]

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.030
[REIKO]
I said I give up, already!

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.790
[REIKO]
Heh!

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.540
Ah!
[chuckles]

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.170
This is great!

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.960
So are you enjoying yourself?

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.050
Yeah! This is fun.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.640
Man, winter is
the best, isn't it?

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.640
Yeah.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.480
Winter is great when you
spend it with your Cub.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.830
[REIKO]
You ready?

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.700
Yeah.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.220
[SHII]
Ah! Reiko and Koguma!

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.850
Ah! Ahem.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.020
Right this way, then,
if you please.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.770
Oh, I do!

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.270
[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.520
Hold on.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.530
[REIKO]
Hmm? Yeah, what's up?

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.740
Something's definitely
different from last time.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.330
[KOGUMA]
The tablecloth and chairs!

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.370
The Italian Tricolore?

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.000
Oh, my. Has Little Italy
started a colony?

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.380
[SHII]
Mm. Si.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.800
Aww, why couldn't
you have invited me along?

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.050
You wouldn't wanna
go on a bicycle.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.600
[SHII] I doubt it's
a problem for my Moulton.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.220
I would like to
get up there sometime.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.890
I can come with you when you do.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.430
Ah!

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.480
If you come with me to Mount
Kaikoma, I can give you a ride

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.650
straight up to the top and back!

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.270
My passenger seat
is exactly the right size.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.650
- Passenger seat?
- [REIKO giggles]

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.400
- [SHII] Ah?
- [KOGUMA] Hmm?

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.700
[REIKO]
You would fit.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.490
Ah?!

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.780
[whines]

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.160
[REIKO] Oh my gosh, Shii,
I was just kidding.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.910
[SHII] I might believe you if
you weren't smiling like that.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
[chuckles]

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.040
I bet we could get her
to fit into my front basket.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.340
[SHII]
Ah! Not you, too, Koguma!

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.880
[REIKO, KOGUMA giggle]

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.160
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.100
Huh?

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.360
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.710
Hey there! So good to see you!

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.790
[SHII'S FATHER]
It's cold out there.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.460
Now then. How's some
Guatemalan French Roast sound?

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.090
[KOGUMA] I'll take
whatever you recommend.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.720
[engine puttering]

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.390
[REIKO]
Hiya.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.060
Thanks for waiting!

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.980
They say all the forest
roads are impassable

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.320
with the ice under the snow.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.450
I bet the deer and
wild boar are the only ones

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.160
using them right now.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.450
Maybe not even them.
It's that unsafe.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.200
We don't get too much
accumulation here.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.620
Lots of wind, though.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.160
For sure.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.540
But that's fine, it just means
you gotta go get some of these.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.500
And a good pair of these.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.260
Right. Now that we've got our
windshields and leg shields,

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.260
we can go riding in the cold
for hours without a problem.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.470
And my full face-shield was
a pretty nice upgrade, too.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.600
With the right combination
of accessories and gear,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.140
we can get around
just fine on our Cubs

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.480
no matter how cold it gets.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.980
Thank you for your patience.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.450
Your drinks.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.240
Thank you so much, sir.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.990
Thank you so much.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.240
Where did Shii run off to?

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.960
Sorry about that. You made
the trip and she's not around.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.500
She's working on her project.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.630
Right, the Italian
expansion plan.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.420
Guess she went off to search
for supplies in town.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.130
I passed her turning
onto the cat trail.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.510
What's that, now?

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.760
From the prefectural road
to the Shichiriiwa Line.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.430
Ahh. That little
bitty dirt road.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.140
On a bike, that's the fastest
way to the station.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.900
[REIKO] So where are Italy's
borders going to end up?

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.280
It seems like the two of you
have had a big influence on her

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.280
since the festival.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.030
[REIKO chuckles]

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.240
[SHII'S FATHER] I think she
wants to be more like you.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.910
Wait, really?

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.540
[SHII'S FATHER]
Yeah! She's out on her bike

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.700
a whole lot more
than she used to be,

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.420
and she's not just
running errands, either.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.840
[SHII'S FATHER]
In a way, it feels like

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.920
she's trying to
catch up to you two.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.840
I might have been thinking
more about myself than her

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.300
when I ordered her a Moulton,

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.760
but she finally
started bonding with it.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.680
Honestly, I'm a little touched.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.400
[REIKO]
I'm stopping at Komeri. You in?

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.570
[KOGUMA]
Not today.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.230
[REIKO]
Okay.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.240
[KOGUMA]
It'll be cold tomorrow, too.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.660
[REIKO] The temperature's
just gonna keep dropping.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.250
We might not notice
as much with all the gear

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.250
we'll be piling on, though.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.960
[KOGUMA] The two of us
are learning something.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.630
[KOGUMA] The real reason that
riders say the winter is both

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.380
a fierce enemy,
and an endurance test.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.470
[KOGUMA] The thing is,
it's not how cold it gets.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.850
It's how long the cold lasts.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.600
[KOGUMA]
After a few more months,

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.150
spring will awaken the cherry
blossoms on the slopes

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.980
of the Southern Alps.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.450
[KOGUMA] But for now, that's
still well past the horizon.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.820
Too far out to be seen
from the seat of a Cub.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.370
No matter how hard you squint,

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.950
winter stretches
beyond your view.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.880
[phone buzzes]

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.340
[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.130
[buzzing continues]

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.010
Hey, Shii.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.970
[KOGUMA]
Mm?

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.690
[SHII]
Puh... Please...

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.150
Huh?

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.860
[KOGUMA grunts]

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.860
[SHII]
Help me...

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.570
[gasps]

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.950
[SHII whimpering]

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.950
I'm cold... Please help...

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.590
