the old-style engine, too,

from before the new
noise and emission laws.

electronics worth messing with.

All steel.

I've done some work
on it since I got it.

than you would think.

and the suspension are Takegawa.

titanium job that I think

over in Tondabayashi.

[CLERK 2A]
Have a good day!

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:32.500
[KOGUMA]
I never stop for groceries

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.834
on the way home from school.

00:21:34.917 --> 00:21:39.166
In fact, up till now, I've never
really stopped anywhere.

00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:45.000
[KOGUMA] But today, I turned
where I'd normally go straight,

00:21:45.083 --> 00:21:47.375
and what I saw was brand new.

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:52.750
[KOGUMA]
Unknown places...

00:21:52.834 --> 00:21:55.917
Streets I'd never seen...

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.291
And even now...

00:21:58.375 --> 00:22:00.500
...there's more to discover.

00:22:21.625 --> 00:22:22.667
[KOGUMA]
Oh, right.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.417
My chain lock.

00:22:26.667 --> 00:22:29.500
[KOGUMA]
Hmm. Tomorrow will be fine.

00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:40.959
[KOGUMA]
Now that I have my Super Cub,

00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:43.458
I can always look
forward to tomorrow.

00:22:43.542 --> 00:22:45.458
Even the after-school errands.

00:22:47.125 --> 00:22:48.208
[KOGUMA]
Mm.

00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:21.709
