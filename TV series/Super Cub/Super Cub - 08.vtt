00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.310
[KOGUMA] It's been several
days since the festival.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.900
The heated passion that had
filled the atmosphere at school

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.150
has dissipated.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.030
The mood has cooled now.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.860
[KOGUMA]
Like the air.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.320
- [wind howls]
- [KOGUMA] Ah...

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.240
[grunts]

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.040
[KOGUMA] The sting of
the wind is growing sharper.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.670
We should get our Cubs ready.
Winter is coming.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.880
Yeah, it is.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.760
And I know that won't be cheap.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.800
I need to save money.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.970
[KOGUMA]
Me, too.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.390
[KOGUMA]
What are you drinking?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.440
[REIKO]
Hmm?

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.310
[gulps]
Just some coffee.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.200
[KOGUMA]
Mm...

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.080
I'm guessing I might have gotten
a little bit out of practice.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.880
I always heard the flavor
depends on who

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630
brewed the coffee.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.050
[REIKO]
Mm? So what's yours?

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.720
Barley tea.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.640
[REIKO gulping]

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.350
It tastes similar, but worse.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.020
I'm trying to go without vending
machine coffee for a while.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.650
[REIKO]
Same.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.020
[KOGUMA]
Mm?

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.860
[SHII] Hey. I asked
around about you two.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.240
You really do eat your lunch
by the bike racks.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.870
Yep. Sure do.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.280
What's up?

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.660
Nothing. I just wanted
to let you know we got

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.620
an espresso machine
for the café space.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.500
And, um, if you two
should come by sometime,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.460
I would love to treat you.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.420
Papa said he wanted to
thank you for helping with

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.510
the culture festival.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.430
[REIKO giggles]

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.180
Would today work out okay?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.350
Ah!

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.600
Yes, wonderful!

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.910
[SHII]
I'm sorry to keep you.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.420
[REIKO] Whoa, are you
riding an Alex Moulton?

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.880
Truss frame,
rubber cone suspension.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.300
That's not a Japanese model,
it's an AM series.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.680
Every piece of it's
made in England.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.810
I'm sure that's why Papa
insisted on this one,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.690
though it is very nice.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.280
Huh?

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.320
[REIKO] Want me to give you
a tow back to your place?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.610
Uh...

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.950
It's an option, though
I have seen people flying

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.660
into ditches doing that.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.790
Um. Thanks, but I'll be okay.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.580
Just follow me there, please!

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.000
[REIKO chuckles]

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.430
[SHII panting]

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.570
[SHII]
Here we are.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.150
Allow me to welcome
you to my shop.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.450
We call it "Beurre" which is
the French word for butter.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.250
If you're looking for a loaf of
German-style bread in the area,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.960
this is where you wanna go.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.210
So a bakery with
a French name...

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.630
...making German bread.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.960
And she ran an Italian
coffee bar at the festival.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.550
Call it global cuisine.
Maybe random.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.340
Thank you for your patience.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.890
Come on in.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.680
[SHII]
I'm home!

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.320
[KOGUMA sniffs]

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.660
Huh?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.210
What's the theme?
There's so much going on.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.590
Well, the building is like
what you'd find in the Alps.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.970
And there's a British
sandwich stand

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.140
and an American diner inside.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.010
Like I said. You could call it
"global" or just "random."

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.600
[KOGUMA]
Is this it?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.850
[SHII]
Yes. I had to buy it used.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.480
It still took most
of my savings,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.770
but I loved that
one we borrowed.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.900
I just couldn't resist.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.360
Hey there, Reiko.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.280
Welcome.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.070
How's things?

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.280
And the other girl is Koguma?

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.580
[SHII]
Yeah.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.380
I can't tell you
what a pleasure it is.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.050
I heard from my daughter
how much you helped out

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.090
with the festival. I was hoping
I'd get to meet you myself.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.100
She told us you wanted to thank
us with some free coffee.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.310
[SHII'S FATHER]
That's right.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.980
I'm proud of my coffee
and it'd be my honor

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.020
to share it with you two.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.360
I just wish my daughter
was as proud of it as I am.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.280
[SHII] I will be responsible
for Reiko and Koguma's drinks,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360
thank you very much.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.860
We won't be needing any
American-style coffee.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.740
One of each, please.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.950
That way we can try them both
and decide for ourselves

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.660
what we want.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.040
Isn't that thoughtful of you?

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.210
[SHII]
Thank you for waiting.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.430
[SHII'S FATHER] I brewed you
our Hawaiian Kona medium roast.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.180
Thank you very much, sir.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.730
[SHII] And Reiko, you get
our Kalosi Toraja dark roast.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.980
Thank you.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.100
[door creaks]

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.730
Huh?

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.110
Enjoy, you two.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.070
Welcome to Beurre!

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.280
[SHII'S FATHER]
Right. Duty calls.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.120
[KOGUMA]
Ah.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.120
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.090
[REIKO]
Mm.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.840
[slurps]

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.760
Ah, it's way different
from what I make at home.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.150
It's bitter.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.150
But... tasty.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.750
Good cafés have always been an
important part of bike culture.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.500
They even named a kind
of motorbike after 'em.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.050
When it's cold out, you can pull
in for a cup of coffee or tea

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.760
to warm you up and
give you some caffeine

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.640
for the rest of the trip.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.180
Wow.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.360
[SHII]
Hm..

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.320
[SHII]
Thank you very much!

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.410
This spot is kinda remote.
Is business going well?

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.210
The whole reason I left my job
in Tokyo was so I could stop

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.500
thinking about business.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.340
I wanted to bake my
favorite bread,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.090
sell a loaf to the
vacationers here and there,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.090
and make just enough to get by.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.390
But it's been a while and I'm
still working, so joke's on me.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.140
[SHII] Like I'm always saying,
you can retire anytime.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.180
I'm happy to take over.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.140
We'll stop baking
your nasty rye bread,

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.060
and I'll focus on paninis
and bruschetta!

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.940
I keep trying to tell you,
the Italians don't know

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.650
the first thing about
baking bread or eating it.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.490
The Italians realize that life's
too short to waste it

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.740
trying to talk themselves into
liking pumpernickel, Papa!

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.240
Hmph. Would you
care for a refill?

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.660
Yes, please!

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.000
Me, too.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.630
[REIKO]
Thanks for having us.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.250
The coffee was delicious.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.840
Glad to hear it.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.760
Please come anytime!

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.720
[REIKO]
Mm. I'll be back.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.560
[SHII]
Hmm? Is something wrong?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.390
Not at all, and thank you.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.440
[REIKO]
See you later, Shii.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.650
Bye, you two!
Stop by again soon!

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.500
[school bell chimes]

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.600
By the way, we still need
to get ready for the winter.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.140
[REIKO] And I still say
you'll have a hard time

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.810
finding something better
than my work gloves.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.580
Huh?

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.210
[BOTH whimper]

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.090
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.730
[KOGUMA]
Mm.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.030
[REIKO]
Heh...

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.080
[sighs]

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.250
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
You do remember
why we came here?

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.500
[chuckles sheepishly]

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.670
[REIKO] When I take
an interest in something,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.920
I start obsessing over getting
the best version of it―

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.550
I can't help it!

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.300
I see a really nice replica gun
out of the corner of my eye,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.890
and suddenly it's like
I can hear it calling to me.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.350
"Take me home, Reiko! I don't
belong in this display case!"

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.560
Really. I see.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.770
Huh?

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.150
[KOGUMA]
Hmm...

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.280
Ah. A Trangia mess tin.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.870
Like a mini meal kit.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.000
You can use that to cook your
rice, or to boil, steam, grill,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.500
or deep fry stuff.
It's like a portable kitchen.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.880
[KOGUMA]
Mm...

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.210
[KOGUMA groans]

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.260
Hey, what's wrong?
You look so torn.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.390
[KOGUMA groans]

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.350
[CLERK 8A]
Thank you very much!

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.520
Wow, Koguma.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.360
You do remember why
we came here, don't you?

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.740
I came because I needed
a new bento box.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.570
I decided just now.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.700
[sighs]

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.030
What next?

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.910
Should we check and see
if Up Garage has anything?

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.620
[REIKO] Mm... It feels like
we were just there, though.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.130
[KOGUMA gasps]

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.720
Give me your phone.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.880
[REIKO]
Mm?

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.390
Here you go.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.100
So. What's up?

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.770
[KOGUMA]
Handlebar covers.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.770
Huh?

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.850
That's it. That'll be perfect.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.480
I read that people who ride
their bikes in the cold for work

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.820
all say handlebar covers
are the best choice.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.780
I know you prefer you work
gloves, so why not keep them

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.410
and buy some of these instead?

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.910
For real? Those things
are so dorky!

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.290
Do you really want
your Cub to look like

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.410
an old man's motorbike?

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.120
I refuse to embarrass my Hunter
Cub by using those things.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.040
I still want some.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.670
Look here.
They're in my price range.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.920
[REIKO]
Hmm...

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:55.900
Huh.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.170
Okay.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.460
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.890
Heh.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.530
Uh.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.000
[KOGUMA chuckles]

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.590
[sighs]

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.600
[REIKO]
Hmm...

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.270
[chuckles]

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.320
[KOGUMA giggles]

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.760
Welcome to Beurre!

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.090
[gasps]
Reiko and Koguma!

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.970
It's good to see you again!

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.270
Ah. Welcome back.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.520
Hiya.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.230
[REIKO] The handlebar covers
do work well with my gloves.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.110
And I never would have thought
they would be so effective.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.450
They actually work kinda
like tiny little windscreens

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.990
for your hands.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:14.160
And they keep the wind from
coming up your coat sleeves.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.000
It's not just your hands--they
keep your upper body warm.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.210
So it's really more about the
wind than the cold, I guess.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.420
Well, for the moment.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.210
Still, we're through
the first phase, right?

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.840
So, here's to that.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.430
Excuse me! One more, please!

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.470
Hey, Shii?

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.470
Ah? Oh. Sorry.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.850
Listen. You two may not want
to stay here much longer.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.270
Huh?

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.230
We tend to get very crowded
around this time of day.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.730
I sincerely apologize.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.110
Is that so?

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.320
[REIKO]
Hmm?

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.610
[SHII'S FATHER]
Just a second.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.280
I don't wanna keep you, but I
was hoping you guys could sample

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.080
my landbrot before you go.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.330
Wasn't landbrot the rye bread
German soldiers had to

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.580
choke down during World War I?

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.080
The old German rations
had kommissbrot.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.790
My version is much tastier.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.960
Count me in!

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.040
But it's almost our
busiest time of day!

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.670
Uh. That shouldn't
be a problem.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.090
Please don't, Papa...

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.260
[REIKO grunts]

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.010
Hmm?

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.600
We can leave.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.140
Wait a minute.
No need to be in a rush, right?

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.810
We'd love to try
your bread, sir!

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.270
That's more like it.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.770
Papa!

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.940
Darn it, Reiko!

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.740
We'll take off
if it gets too crowded.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.740
Though maybe... the afternoon
rush was never really

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.870
the issue to begin with.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.200
I'm telling the truth!

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.950
[car approaching]

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.250
[gasps]

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.890
[SHII whines]

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.440
[SHII'S MOTHER]
I'm home!

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.020
[gasps]

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.610
[SHII'S FATHER]
Hey, dear!

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.440 line:20%
"hi"

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.440
to Shii's classmates?

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.440
[SHII'S MOTHER]
Who?

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.650
[SHII whimpers]

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.160
[SHII'S MOTHER gasps]
Oh, hi there, Reiko!

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.530
Hello!

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:21.330
She's here, and she
brought a friend--Koguma.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.830
Huh? Oh, wow!

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.370
Ah! Wah―

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.910
[SHII'S MOTHER] So you're
the one who helped so much

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.210
with the culture festival!

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.710
Yeah...

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.130
Lovely to meet you, Koguma.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.800
I'm Shii's mother.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.930
Hi, Ma'am.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:41.890
[SHII'S MOTHER squeals]
I'm so glad you came!

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.430
[sighs]

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.070
[SHII'S MOTHER]
Please, allow me.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.820
And Koguma?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.650
Thanks, I'm fine.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.320
Wonderful. There's plenty more.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.200
[KOGUMA]
Great, thank you.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:09.250
[chukcles] So her dad's
obsessed with Germany,

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.630
and her mom's
super into America.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.460
Which would make that
floor transition kind of

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.470
like the Atlantic.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.850
Didn't you also mention that the
sandwich counter was British?

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.060
I guess they needed to find
something between the two

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.140
that they could agree on.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.850
[KOGUMA]
Hmm...

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.610
[REIKO] And then...
there's Little Italy.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.150
It would be fun to come back
here just to watch how

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.070
her counter grows. Right?

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.330
Oh, yeah, and with her
British-built Alex Moulton,

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.040
she'll go far.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.470
Ah?

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.270
In that outfit,
you seem a lot different.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.770
[SHII]
Mm... Do I?

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.780
Please come by again!

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.070
[KOGUMA]
Mm.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.360
[SHII]
You, too, Reiko!

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.610
[REIKO]
I'll be here tomorrow. See ya!

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.070
[SHII]
Mm!

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.600
[KOGUMA]
We can feel autumn fading.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.650
[KOGUMA] The handlebar
covers work perfectly.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.780
But it'll be much colder soon,
and we still need to make more

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.320
basic preparations for that.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.040
[KOGUMA] I can't justify
going to the café very often.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.790
Getting coffee there costs
as much as a tank of gas,

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.120
and I can make at least
a passable cup at home.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.930
[KOGUMA] But... that doesn't
mean I can't go at all.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.470
[KOGUMA] So if I find myself
wanting to indulge a little

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.770
now and then...

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.730
...or if I'm riding in the cold,
and I really need

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.060
something to warm me up.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.610
There's nothing wrong
with stopping by

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.190
for an occasional drink.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.860
Is there?

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.300
[KOGUMA] Episode 9:
"In Ice."
