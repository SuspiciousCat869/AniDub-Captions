00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.166
[KOGUMA]
Soon enough, summer arrived.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.291
The first summer riding my Cub.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.291
[KOGUMA]
Reiko had said...

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:24.875
...that she was hoping
to do something big

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:26.625
over the school break.

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:29.625
[KOGUMA]
And there's also something

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:31.709
that I've been
planning on doing.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.375
Something I've been wanting
to do since I started riding.

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:39.375
Since I found my Cub.

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:49.166
[TEACHER 3B]
Ah, yes!

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.291
If I recall, I gave you the
front basket off my Cub.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:55.250
Well, then.
Any interest in this job?

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.917
Transporting documents?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.750
It's fairly straightforward.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:04.500
We have a joint training program
with Kofu Daiichi High

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:06.125
during summer vacation.

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:09.583
You would be carrying documents
between their school and ours.

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:13.083
Typically you'd make two round
trips, morning and evening,

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.500
and each trip would
pay 2,000 yen.

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:17.208
Of course, you would
also be responsible for gas

00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:19.208
and any other expenses.

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:21.125
Sound good?

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:25.041
[KOGUMA] Hmm. I'd like to
sleep on it if that's okay.

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:22.125
[REIKO]
You're gonna be a courier?

00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:23.500
Courier?

00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:26.083
[REIKO] A fancy word for people
who deliver documents,

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.000
and you're talking
old-school courier work--

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:31.333
getting sensitive information
to important people.

00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:33.959
Though now, the guy who
drops off your online shopping

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:35.583
is called a courier, too.

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:37.458
[KOGUMA]
Huh...

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:40.291
[REIKO] Anyway, think you're
gonna take the job?

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:42.250
Yeah. I'll give it a shot.

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:43.625
[REIKO giggles]

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.250
I see. So you were just
checking out your new route.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.667
I went as far as Kofu Station.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.041
The trip's just under
an hour and a half.

00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:55.417
And you bought lunch on the way!

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.542
It's cool if you
wanna treat yourself,

00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:00.000
but shouldn't you wait
till you get paid?

00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.417
[TEACHER 3B] Great!
You'll start tomorrow morning.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.500
Before I forget, you
will officially be working

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:09.291
on the school's behalf.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:10.875
We'll need you
to remain in uniform

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.250
while you're making your rounds.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:15.250
I'm not sure wearing
my uniform's a good idea.

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:17.583
If I'm on the main roads,
and I'm riding fast enough

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:19.750
to keep pace...

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:22.542
...and I shift in my seat
and my skirt gets caught...

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:23.834
--Or the wind--
--Ah.

00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:26.041
I'd failed to
even consider that.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.375
So... let's figure
something out.

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:32.959
If I could, I'd like to
wear my gym clothes.

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:37.959
[REIKO]
So when do you start work?

00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:41.041
[KOGUMA] Tomorrow.
Right after the exam block.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:42.375
[REIKO]
Good luck.

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:44.792
I'm gonna spend
the summer on my bike, too.

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.625
Where are you going?

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:54.083
[REIKO]
Somewhere close, yet far away.

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:56.875
Be safe, okay?

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:58.208
[REIKO]
I know.

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.166
[KOGUMA]
Ah.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.333
I'm at 620 already?

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.750
Um. I've gone over
100 kilometers.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.875
Could I please have
my oil changed?

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:39.959
I wasn't expecting
to see you back this soon.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.750
Good thing I remembered.

00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:49.792
I'll be using it for
a job starting tomorrow.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:51.166
For a job?

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.291
I need to make money
so I can take care of my Cub.

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:56.709
[SHINO]
Hmm...

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:03.208
Ideally you'd change your
oil after 100, again at 500,

00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.083
and once more when you
get to 1,000 kilometers.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:09.166
If you watch me, you should be
able to do the third oil change

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.291
by yourself.

00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:13.291
So, where can I
get oil like that?

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:17.333
You can pick some up at
any of the stores around town.

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:20.542
Is that the kind
of oil I should buy?

00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:22.625
[SHINO]
It's the one I'd recommend.

00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:28.709
[SHINO groans]

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:30.625
[sighs]

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:31.959
500 yen.

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:34.500
Really? It's only 500?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.291
You get a small discount
on your first service.

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:44.333
[KOGUMA]
Huh?

00:07:41.834 --> 00:07:43.959
[KOGUMA groaning]

00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:24.667
[TEACHER 3B]
All right. Here's your delivery.

00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:28.917
Okay. When do I need
to be back here?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.750
[TEACHER 3B] Any time
before noon will be fine.

00:08:31.834 --> 00:08:34.250
And when you go to deliver our
papers, remember you need

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:37.041
to pick up theirs before
you head back here.

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:38.667
[KOGUMA]
Mm...

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:20.542
[KOGUMA]
Hmm!

00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:31.917
Head that way, straight through
the quad and it's right there.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.709
[KOGUMA]
Thank you very much.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.333
[KOGUMA]
Huh...

00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:44.417

00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:04.250
I'm glad to see you made it.

00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:08.709
Here's the papers from
Mukawa High School.

00:10:08.792 --> 00:10:11.875
Got it. Thank you.

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:14.000
Sure. All right.

--[TEACHER 4A] Hold on.

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:17.041
I just need a second

Oh. Right.

00:10:19.417 --> 00:10:22.542
[TEACHER 4A]
Ugh. That's a lot of writing.

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:33.917
[BOY 4A]
Good. Keep after it!

00:10:35.917 --> 00:10:39.000
[GIRL 4B]
You got this! Nice, great shot!

00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:42.458
There. All done.

[TEACHER 4A] Here.
I can make you some tea

00:10:47.834 --> 00:10:49.667
if you'd like to
rest for a while.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.792
Thanks, but I'm trying
to get back to my school

00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:53.333
as soon as possible.

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:55.375
You're in a rush, huh?

00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:57.542
Well, safe travels, then.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:10:59.417
[KOGUMA]
Yes. Thank you.

00:11:01.792 --> 00:11:03.000
[TEACHER 4A]
Hmm.

00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:12.375
[TEACHER 4A]
Hey! Wait a second!

00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:14.667
I almost let you take off
without our papers!

00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:17.458
Ah...

00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:21.208
Really sorry about that.
It totally slipped my mind.

00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:22.750
[KOGUMA]
I forgot about it, too.

00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:24.917
I should have checked
before I walked out.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.208
Pardon me.
I'll see you next time.

00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:45.000
You'll have two trips a day
after summer vacation begins

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:48.667
in earnest, but today
you just have one.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.709
All done.

00:11:51.583 --> 00:11:54.500
Here you go. Good job today.

00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:56.709

You've been riding her gently.
Maybe a bit too gently.

[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:45.583
I'm riding too gently?

Great. Looks good.

00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:41.333
And we don't have anything
to send back today.

00:15:41.417 --> 00:15:43.000
Oh. Okay.

00:15:43.083 --> 00:15:44.333
I'll take the bag, then.

pretty soon.

00:19:56.375 --> 00:19:57.542
Ah.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.000
[KOGUMA grunts]

00:20:06.542 --> 00:20:07.875
[gasps]

00:20:14.083 --> 00:20:15.458
[gasps]

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.959
A month and a half
of excellent work.

00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:10.583
You were a great help.

00:21:12.667 --> 00:21:15.333
Thank you, sir.
It means so much.

00:21:23.834 --> 00:21:25.625
I've saved a good amount.

00:21:25.709 --> 00:21:27.959
[phone buzzing]

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:34.542
Hi, Reiko.

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:36.250
[REIKO]
Hey, I just got home.

00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:38.375
Can you get over,
like, right now?

00:21:39.792 --> 00:21:41.583
[KOGUMA]
Mm...

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:44.333
Okay. But how do I get there?

00:21:51.917 --> 00:21:55.083
[KOGUMA]
My first summer riding my Cub.

00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:57.625
The first job I ever had...

00:21:57.709 --> 00:22:00.458
The staff room
at another school...

00:22:00.542 --> 00:22:02.709
The rain...

00:22:02.792 --> 00:22:05.875
Going back and forth
between these two towns...

00:22:05.959 --> 00:22:08.083
My world has grown.

00:22:08.166 --> 00:22:11.250
There are still
so many places to see.

00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:13.458
But there are roads
connecting them,

00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:16.542
and I can follow
the roads anywhere.

00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:20.458
Now, I wanna keep going further.

00:22:41.083 --> 00:22:42.500
It's been a while.

00:22:44.417 --> 00:22:45.959
Good to see you.

00:22:46.041 --> 00:22:47.709
Well, come in.

00:24:21.166 --> 00:24:23.583
