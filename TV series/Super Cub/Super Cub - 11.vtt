00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
[phone buzzing]

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:23.458
[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.625
[buzzing continues]

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:30.083
Hey, Shii.

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:33.959
[KOGUMA]
Mm?

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:37.792
[SHII]
Puh... Please...

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:38.834
Huh?

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.875
[KOGUMA grunts]

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:43.875
[SHII]
Help me...

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.041
[gasps]

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:51.125
[SHII whimpering]

00:00:51.208 --> 00:00:53.125
Shii, what's wrong?!

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:55.750
[SHII]
I crashed my bike...

00:00:55.834 --> 00:01:00.291
Off the cat trail...
and I'm in the river...

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.417
The water's so cold...

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.834
I can't get out...

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:06.291
[gasps]

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.291
You're going to be fine.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:16.834
My Super Cub and I
are coming to save you.

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:18.458
[sighs]

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:40.750
[KOGUMA grunts]

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:56.041
Ah!
[grunts]

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.834
[grunting]

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:03.375
[KOGUMA panting]

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.083
Huh?

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:25.083
[KOGUMA grunting]

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.417
[KOGUMA groans]

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.875
[SHII whimpers]

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.667
You're here, Koguma...

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.375
I'm here, Shii.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.000
[KOGUMA groaning]

00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:00.208
[KOGUMA]
Are you all right?

00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:01.625
Wake up!

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:04.250
[grunts]

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:05.250
[SHII groans]

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:08.500
I'm so glad that you found me...

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.959
You really came to the rescue.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:13.875
[SHII]
I'm cold...

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.166
[KOGUMA]
Mm.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.375
Ah.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.709
I won't be able to climb back
up there if I'm carrying you.

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:24.917
I'll help you, but you'll
have to pull yourself.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.375
[SHII grunts]

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:39.792
[KOGUMA, SHII
grunting, groaning]

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:48.125
I'm... sorry to
weigh you down...

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:50.041
You weigh less than my Cub.

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:51.542
I think.

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:54.083
[SHII]
Okay. Is there help coming...?

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:56.875
The police, or an ambulance?

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.625
[KOGUMA]
I didn't called them.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.000
[KOGUMA]
I live close.

00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:04.583
We can get you a hot bath
and some dry clothes.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.625
Then I'll take you home.

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.083
[SHII whines]

00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:18.875
[SHII whimpers]

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.959
[receiver ringing]

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:23.375
[REIKO]
What's up?

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:27.875
[gasps]
Is she okay?!

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:28.917
If she's hurt--

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.542
[KOGUMA]
She's fine.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:39.709
[KOGUMA] Yeah, exactly.
If you could, thanks.

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:41.750
Ah?

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:44.166
There's no need to call
for fire and rescue,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.583
but I did call someone
with the same paint job.

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:48.250
[SHII groans]

00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:58.625
[KOGUMA]
Hmm...

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:59.917
Hmm.

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.208
[SHII]
Hmm...?

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:06.917
[KOGUMA groans]

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.208
[SHII]
Ah?

00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:10.792
Ah!

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.709
Hold on... You're not...?

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:23.000
You're not, right?

00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:24.583
Koguma?

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:26.667
If it can hold a full route's
worth of newspapers,

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.583
it can carry you. Let's go.

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:36.875
Please... stop...!

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:26.917
Just one second.

00:07:29.792 --> 00:07:31.125
[SHII]
Ah?

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:44.750
Get undressed.

00:07:44.834 --> 00:07:46.250
[SHII groans]

00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:52.000
[SHII]
Oh. Sorry.

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.792
No, you're fine.

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:06.208
[SHII sighs]

00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:08.250
[KOGUMA]
I'm going to wash your clothes.

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:11.083
That shampoo and
body soap is all I've got.

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:16.625
R-Right, thank you, Koguma...

00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:18.875
[KOGUMA]
You can thank my Cub.

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:20.458
[SHII]
Mm...

00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:50.709
So, her phone made it through.

00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:54.125
But then...

00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:09.917
[SHII'S FATHER] I think she
wants to be more like you.

00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:13.166
Wait. Really?

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.750
[SHII'S FATHER]
Yeah!

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:17.125
She's out on her bike a whole
lot more than she used to be.

00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:19.959
She's not just
running errands, either.

00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:23.709
In a way, it feels like she's
trying to catch up to you two.

00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:27.834
I might have been thinking
more about myself than her

00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:30.166
when I ordered
her a Moulton,

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.291
but she finally started
bonding with it.

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:36.166
Honestly, I'm a little touched.

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.709
[KOGUMA sighs]

00:09:59.959 --> 00:10:00.875
[SHII]
Koguma...?

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:01.959
[KOGUMA]
Mm?

00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:06.041
Uh. Sorry.

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:07.250
Is the bath free?

00:10:07.333 --> 00:10:09.166
Ah! Reiko?

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.166
[REIKO]
Don't mind if I do!

00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:14.750
Um.

00:10:14.834 --> 00:10:15.750
Ah--!

00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:17.500
Wah!

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:18.875
You don't need to do that!

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:21.125
Don't worry about these!

00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:23.166
[KOGUMA] You're not putting
them back on wet, right?

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.166
[SHII]
Ah!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.583
[whines]

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.542
It's okay. I'll hang them up.

00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:38.417
[SHII whines]

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.625
It's always dry in this room
during the winter.

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:43.709
Your clothes should
all be fine by morning.

00:10:43.792 --> 00:10:45.083
[SHII]
'Kay!

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:53.041
There.

00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:57.000
[SHII]
Mm...

00:10:57.083 --> 00:10:59.208
Um. I would really like
to help you with dinner--

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:01.208
[KOGUMA]
I'm about done.

00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:03.750
[SHII]
Aw...

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:05.291
[groans]

00:11:08.917 --> 00:11:09.834
[SHII]
Mm...

00:11:09.917 --> 00:11:12.375
All right. Please enjoy.

00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:14.709
Ah! That smells so good.

00:11:14.792 --> 00:11:16.500
Oh my gosh,
where are your clothes?!

00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:18.083
[REIKO]
Whoa, curry udon?!

00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:20.083
You know that stains like crazy!

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:21.083
Glad I'm--

00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:22.125
[grunts]

00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:24.375
Wear the coveralls.

00:11:24.458 --> 00:11:26.166
Getting stained
is what they're made for.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.625
Aw!

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:28.625
[SHII chuckles nervously]

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:29.792
[KOGUMA]
Let's eat.

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:35.041
[SHII]
Ah...

00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:37.083
Thank you for the food.

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:53.458
[SHII]
Mm. Yum.

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:05.667
[REIKO]
Hmm...

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.667
Ah! You've got
hard-boiled eggs!

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.875
[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:14.250
[chuckles]

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:19.417
Ask first.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.750
Oh, relax.

00:12:20.834 --> 00:12:23.750
After all, Shii's body
needs protein to heal!

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:26.500
[REIKO]
Your topping, miss.

00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:29.000
I appreciate your hospitality.

00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:30.709
Think nothing of it, my friend!

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.166
You don't need more protein.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.709
I do.

00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:35.834
You know I've done at least
an egg's worth of work tonight.

00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:37.125
Ah!

00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:40.250
[SHII chuckles]

00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:47.875
Here's yours.

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:56.417
[REIKO giggles]

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.000
[chuckles]

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.542
Please allow me to handle
the washing up, at least.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.667
Shii?

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.875
[SHII]
Yes?

00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.250
Need something?

00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:02.500
Your Moulton's in...
pretty bad shape.

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:30.625
[SHII sniffling]

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.125
[SHII sobbing softly]

00:15:01.542 --> 00:15:03.750
I can't stand it...

00:15:03.834 --> 00:15:06.667
I can't deal with winter...

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.792
There's no reason
it should get this cold...

00:15:12.041 --> 00:15:13.750
[whimpers]

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:17.667
[SHII]
Please help, Koguma...

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.834
Can you just... make it
spring again for me?

00:15:21.917 --> 00:15:26.083
I need you and your
Super Cub to rescue me again...

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:27.750
Okay...?

00:15:27.834 --> 00:15:32.000
Just take the cold and
the dark away somewhere...

00:15:32.083 --> 00:15:34.583
Anywhere!

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:38.208
Please bring
spring back for me...

00:15:38.291 --> 00:15:40.417
[sobs]

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.667
That's all I ask for!

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.583
I'm begging you...

00:15:45.667 --> 00:15:47.291
[sobbing]

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:48.875
Please...

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:53.500
[sobbing continues]

00:15:53.583 --> 00:15:54.500
Sorry...

00:15:54.583 --> 00:15:56.125
[SHII sobbing]

00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:59.917
[KOGUMA] My Cub can
do a lot, but not that.

00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:16.208
Thank you both so much.

00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:20.291
Sincerely. I don't know
how we'll ever repay you.

00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:22.917
I-It's fine.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.917
[SHII'S FATHER]
Take this!

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.750
For the next year,
coffee's on us.

00:16:25.834 --> 00:16:28.375
It's for the both of you,
whenever you like.

00:16:28.458 --> 00:16:31.125
[KOGUMA]
Ah. Thank you very much.

00:16:31.208 --> 00:16:34.083
[REIKO] So, like, all we can
drink, free, for a year?

00:16:34.166 --> 00:16:35.083
Yup!

00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:36.083
[REIKO]
Really?!

00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:38.125
Darling. The sandwiches, too.

00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:40.375
Ah, right you are.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.041
Could I see that, please?

00:16:44.834 --> 00:16:46.834
Okay. You're covered
on sandwiches

00:16:46.917 --> 00:16:48.542
and baked goods as well.

00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:50.875
Ah!

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:52.709
--[giggles]
--Ah?

00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:54.750
[REIKO]
Can we start using it right now?

00:16:54.834 --> 00:16:57.041
--[SHII'S FATHER] Of course!
--[REIKO] Heck yes!

00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:59.125
Now, what do I want...?

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:07.041
[KOGUMA] The air over Hokuto is
still heavy with winter's chill.

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:09.125
And the mountain winds
of the Southern Alps

00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:11.375
pierce through the town.

00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:12.792
Much like the weather,

00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:15.542
we quickly settled back
into our old patterns.

00:17:16.917 --> 00:17:18.792
[SHII]
Good morning, you two!

00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:21.583
[KOGUMA, REIKO]
Good morning.

00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:25.542
[KOGUMA]
At Shii's house,

00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:29.875
there was an old bike nobody
had ridden for some time.

00:17:29.959 --> 00:17:32.917
Compared to her small-wheeled
Moulton road racer,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.542
this old city cycle,
with its full-sized wheels,

00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:38.542
is a poor fit for her.

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:44.000
[KOGUMA] We travel the
same old roads on our Cubs,

00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:47.542
and Shii on her granny bike.

00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:51.500
We ride to school each day.
And then we just ride home.

00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:56.125
[KOGUMA]
Our Cubs are fully equipped

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.291
to handle the winter cold.

00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:01.625
The harsh weather can't
disrupt our daily routine.

00:18:01.709 --> 00:18:04.834
Even the snow, when it comes.

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:08.583
We've solved all our issues,
and bought everything we needed.

00:18:10.583 --> 00:18:13.959
[KOGUMA] Whatever had stood
in our way is gone now.

00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:18.000
[KOGUMA] Shii has
suspended her plan to turn

00:18:18.083 --> 00:18:22.417
her family's dining area
into an Italian-style café.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.917
I asked her when she
planned to start up again,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.875
and she just said, "In a while."

00:18:26.959 --> 00:18:28.625
Thank you so much for coming by!

00:18:28.709 --> 00:18:30.875
[KOGUMA]
With an ambivalent smile.

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:47.875
[RADIO 2A] News from the
Kagoshima Weather Observatory.

00:18:47.959 --> 00:18:50.041
Their cherry blossoms
are in bloom.

00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:53.083
The yoshino cherries blossomed
four days later than last year,

00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:55.041
but still nine days earlier--

00:19:16.709 --> 00:19:19.583
[REIKO] I'm so glad
to be done with finals.

00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:22.083
Tomorrow's the
first day of vacation.

00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:24.875
Do you have plans
for the break, Koguma?

00:19:24.959 --> 00:19:27.333
--Not really.
--[SHII] Ah.

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:28.750
Do you, Reiko?

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:32.083
Nah. Y'know, except
for riding my Cub.

00:19:32.166 --> 00:19:33.083
[SHII giggles]

00:19:33.166 --> 00:19:34.083
[CUSTOMER 11A]
Excuse me.

00:19:34.166 --> 00:19:36.458
Ah! Coming!

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:39.458
Please stay as long as you like.

00:19:39.542 --> 00:19:41.375
Welcome to Beurre!

00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:50.792
[REIKO]
Thanks again!

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:56.291
--[SHII] Um...
--[KOGUMA, REIKO] Mm?

00:19:56.375 --> 00:19:58.750
Please visit us
again soon, okay?

00:20:00.208 --> 00:20:02.250
--We will.
--Oh, for sure!

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.917
[SHII]
Hmm!

00:20:07.583 --> 00:20:10.458
I'd love... if spring
got here early.

00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:14.792
When spring arrives,
these cherry blossoms

00:20:14.875 --> 00:20:16.917
all around us will bloom.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.959
I heard on the news that they
were blooming in Kagoshima.

00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:23.333
Ah.

00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:32.542
[REIKO chuckles]
You wanna go see 'em?

00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:33.792
[SHII]
Huh?

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:38.417
I bet so. Right, Shii?

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.583
Uh...

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:50.000
I'm not certain...
if it's realistic...

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.500
[SHII whimpers]

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.625
[KOGUMA]
...but maybe we could.

00:21:03.709 --> 00:21:04.750
Ah.

00:21:04.834 --> 00:21:06.208
Huh?

00:21:09.792 --> 00:21:12.041
Possibly. I guess.

00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:15.000
Ah!

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.375
Koguma! If you do go...

00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:24.083
...I'd really like
to go there with you!

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.000
[gasps]

00:21:31.542 --> 00:21:34.917
[KOGUMA] I'd been told that
she'd wanted to be like us.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.125
That she was trying
to catch up to us.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.875
But... I was trying to catch up
to her from the start.

00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:49.041
[KOGUMA] I don't know
if she would remember it.

00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:52.625
That day... when she
passed me on the hill.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.000
And it's more than that.

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:00.959
It's the way she's
always looking forward.

00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:02.875
Running toward the future.

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:08.500
And that's why I've
been chasing after her.

00:22:16.959 --> 00:22:20.250
[KOGUMA] She was the girl
who led me to my Cub.

00:22:20.333 --> 00:22:22.792
And my Cub led me back to her.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.208
[KOGUMA]
My life before had nothing.

00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:28.625
But now...

00:22:30.375 --> 00:22:32.417
[KOGUMA]
Looking back at the past months,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.125
winter tried to kill
the three of us.

00:22:36.875 --> 00:22:42.291
Which meant our best bet
was to escape it together.

00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:45.208
Escape into spring on our Cubs.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.166
