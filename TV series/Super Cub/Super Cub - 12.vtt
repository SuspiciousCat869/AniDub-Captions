WEBVTT

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.890
[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.820
[KOGUMA] In a distant place, the
cherry blossoms are blooming.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.700
And we've all made up
our minds to go see them.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.620
Before long, more will bloom,
including the ones here.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.590
Maybe even while
we're traveling.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.010
But that's exactly why
we need to leave now.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.130
We want to see the first
glimpse of spring in winter.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.380
And our window is closing.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.560
We hatched this plan
less than two days ago,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.940
and we're already done
preparing for the trip.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.650
We packed as light as we could
and loaded up my Cub.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.360
We can stop at net cafés
and business hotels to sleep.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.330
[KOGUMA]
Be back soon.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.210
[KOGUMA]
We haven't decided on the route.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.010
We just know we're
going as far as we can,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.630
to where the cherry
blossoms are blooming.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.480
Hey, you two.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.900
[KOGUMA] And we know
we'll be setting out today.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.980
[KOGUMA]
To go and seize spring.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.210
[KOGUMA slurps]

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.460
[SHII'S FATHER]
Girls.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.460
I'd like you to
take this with you.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.840
I made komisbrot,
military-style rye bread.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.260
Ah!

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.930
[SHII'S FATHER] It'll keep
better than normal bread.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.260
[REIKO]
Awesome! Thank you so much!

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.260
[SHII'S FATHER]
Not at all.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.810
[SHII]
Mama?

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.310
I'll have Koguma to keep me
safe, so I promise I'll be okay.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.100
And I'm gonna have
Shii protecting me,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.020
so I'll be just fine.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.690
I know I can
count on my Super Cub.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.650
[SHII] Mm! So whatever happens,
we'll be great,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.410
because we have the Super Cub!

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.950
[REIKO] My Hunter Cub
is better. But still!

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.160
[KOGUMA sighs]

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.490
[REIKO]
Okay!

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.870
I think it's about that time.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.380
Ah?

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.010
Have a good trip.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.930
Be safe, okay?

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.560
Promise.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.400
[SHII]
See you soon!

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.000
[REIKO] If we turn right
and follow the Fuji River

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.210
south from Nirasaki,
we'll get to Shizuoka

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.840
in about three hours.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.380
We could keep following the
coast and see cherry blossoms

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.260
in bloom before the day's out.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.630
But we won't.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.800
[REIKO] That's right!
It would defeat the purpose!

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.720
Exactly. We're gonna chase
spring as far as we can.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.220
Right!

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.110
Ah...!

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.610
Are we stopping already?

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.240
But it feels like it's barely
been an hour since we left.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.450
When you're making
a long trip on a bike,

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.870
it's important to keep a careful
eye out for any issues

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.870
that appear in the first hour.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.290
That's when all
the major problems show up.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.160
"The devil's 60."

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.210
[KOGUMA] That's why we needed
to stop after our first hour

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.840
on the road,
and do a quick inspection.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.340
And if everything
checks out here,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.210
we should be good for the trip.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.800
Then, it'll be smooth
sailing the whole way,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.140
whether it's a dozen
hours or a hundred.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.350
Though... It's mostly
just biker superstition.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.930
Oh, is that right?

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.310
Anyway... This is
the first time I've traveled

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.020
the Koshu Highway to its end.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.030
Time to start the next leg,
and we have a choice.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.660
Which way now?

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.330
[KOGUMA] I say we continue
along this route to Shiojiri.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.660
Hop on National Route 19,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.040
keep going through the mountains
in Kiso all the way down

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.670
to the Chuo Main Line,
and follow the tracks to Nagoya.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.880
We need to get at least that
far by sundown, don't we?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.510
Right. If we stick
to the train route,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.430
we can deal with
any issues that arise.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.140
That's one way we could go.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.180
Or we could ride through the
salt spray of the Sea of Japan.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.020
Which would be dangerous.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.770
Plus, you know that the ocean
spray won't be good for

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.020
the pressed steel
frames of our Cubs.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.320
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.860
[SHII groans] Well, if it were
up to me, I'd side with Koguma.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.660
Fine, then. Okay.
Let's hit the road!

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.530
Huh? Really?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040
[REIKO]
It's fine.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.630
I can take the sea route
anytime I want.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.710
[SHII]
Hmm!

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.880
[SHII]
Ah...!

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.600
Ah?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.250
Ah!

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.000
The Nakasendo was one of
five routes established in

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.090
the Edo Period, so it
has a ton of rest stops.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.380
Really?

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.510
And a lot of the old
teahouses are still open.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.020
You should take a look,
for some inspiration.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.140
Ah!

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.640
I get it. That's why
we came this way.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.810
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.240
[SHII groans]

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.580
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.920
We need to eat!

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.300
[REIKO groans]

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.220
So what sounds good?
We have options.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.480
We shouldn't waste money.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.820
[REIKO] Ugh! You wanna
cook rice out here?

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.400
[SHII]
Um...

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.280
If you wouldn't mind,
I'll happily take care of lunch.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.670
[REIKO chuckles]

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.720
[SHII]
Thank you for waiting.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.300
[REIKO]
Ooh!

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.720
I topped it with cream cheese,
and I'm sure you'll both enjoy

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.810
the way the flavor pairs up with
the Kiso smoked salmon I bought.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.320
This is wonderful!

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.900
Yum! It's like I'm on
the Eastern Front!

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.570
Now all we need is some peas and
bacon from the goulash cannon.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.410
Glad you like it.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.970
Ah! There's Lake Biwa!

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.570
[KOGUMA]
Hmm!

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.950
Whoa, dinner's done already?

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.040
Nice! Let's eat!

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.500
[KOGUMA]
You're dripping everywhere.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.290
Go finish toweling off
and get dressed.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.670
Gah! I'm telling you, curry is
meant to be eaten in the nude!

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.730
In the summer, I've heard
they hold a huge gathering

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.900
of Cub owners here in this park.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.190
Gathering?

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.940
More than 400
different Cubs show up.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.990
There are lots of vintage
ones and rare models, too.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.280
[SHII]
Wow.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.200
[REIKO] Ever since
I started riding my Cub,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.320
I always wanted to attend.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.790
I'd like to go, too.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.450
[KOGUMA]
Mm-hmm.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.580
[KOGUMA] I hope summer doesn't
come late this year.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.700
Ah!

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.550
[SHII] So, the Sea of Japan
doesn't seem to have

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.090
any salt spray.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.430
[REIKO]
That's too bad.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.180
[KOGUMA]
That's good.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.560
If Reiko saw
a huge wave roll in,

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.350
she might try and sell her
Hunter Cub on the spot.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.810
Then she'd use the money
to buy a surfboard.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.860
Um. I'm gonna say that's exactly
the kind of thing you would do.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.530
That's ridiculous. How would
I get back home if I did?

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.530
And compared to my Cub...

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.620
[KOGUMA] What do you think
I could get for it, though?

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.630
[SHII]
Huh?!

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.300
[REIKO laughs]

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.500
Ah! The Tottori Sand Dunes!

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.230
[REIKO, SHII chuckling]

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.230
[KOGUMA gulps]

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.740
[chuckling continues]

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.790
[REIKO]
Whoo! This is a feast!

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.210
[SHII]
Just a moment, please!

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.660
Aw!

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.960
[SHII]
Now say "crabs"!

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.050
- [REIKO giggles]
- [SHII laughs]

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.990
We finally reached
the far end of Honshu.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.530
Amazing!

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.410
It's true--you can go
anywhere in Japan on a Cub.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.790
Not just Japan.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.250
[ship horn blares]

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.580
You can go across the ocean.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.830
It looks like more
have bloomed,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.460
in Miyazaki and
Kumamoto this time.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.630
But we've already
decided where we're going.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.470
As far as we can get.
Where the mainland ends.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.550
- [REIKO] Hmm!
- That's right!

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.160
Ah...!

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.460
Huh?

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.010
Well, we're here.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.770
Pretty.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.980
We did it.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.940
We caught spring.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.660
[SHII]
Ah...

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.910
When I said we should come
see the cherry blossoms,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.880
I was so sure you would
say it wasn't possible.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.500
Well, I almost did.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.050
But then...

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:16.220
[SHII] I need you and your Super
Cub to rescue me again, okay...?

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.180
Just take the cold and
the dark away somewhere...

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.060
Anywhere!

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.110
Please bring back
spring for me...

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.190
[sobs]

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.490
That's all I'll ask for...

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.320
I'm begging you...

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.410
[sobbing]

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.700
Sorry...

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.990
[sobbing continues]

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.080
[KOGUMA] My Cub can
do a lot, but not that.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.630
But it was possible we could.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.420
So I thought,
why not at least try?

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.510
[SHII] It's nice having
someone to ride with.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:02.730
I always rode my bike
by myself, so this was fun!

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.560
[BOTH chuckle]

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.200
Let's take spring home with us.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.530
We can share it with our town.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.000
[KOGUMA]
By the time we returned,

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.750
the barren winter scenes we'd
left were nowhere to be found.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.420
The cherry blossoms
have bloomed,

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.180
the sun shimmers on
the water's surface,

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.010
and the hills glow
emerald green.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.220
Spring has finally come.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.390
Or rather,
we've brought it home.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.610
It's definitely spring, now.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.530
[BOTH]
Hmm?

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.040
[phone buzzing]

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.040
[KOGUMA]
Hmm?

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.170
[buzzing continues]

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.760
Hi, Shii.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.420
Huh?

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.100
[KOGUMA]
Hmm!

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.270
Did you buy this Little Cub?

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.890
Oh, well. I was planning
to ask the two of you

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.140
before I picked anything out.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.520
But we went to
check out their inventory,

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.480
and I couldn't resist!

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:38.320
[REIKO] Ooh! Look at Shii,
dropping stacks on her new bike!

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.660
It was on clearance,
and I managed to talk them down

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.030
a bit more.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.620
So at that price, I had
enough to cover half of it.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.870
Papa agreed to lend me
the rest, as long as I could

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.120
pay him back by graduation.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.420
You can get back to work on
your Italian café project now!

00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:00.180
[SHII] Mm! If I have a Cub, I
can go shopping anywhere I want!

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.930
Motorbikes are a
lot of fun in the spring.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.640
That's why so many
are out there.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.180
Be careful on the road.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.190
Then there's summer,
and don't expect the breeze

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.230
to keep you cool
when you're riding.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.610
You'll pass out from heat
exhaustion before you can blink.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.940
And then back
to autumn and winter.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.490
It's long and cold and...

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.410
[SHII whimpering]

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.450
[BOTH laugh]

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.790
[ALL laughing]

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.470
[KOGUMA]
I have no parents.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:44.970
No money.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.640
No hobbies.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.600
No close friends.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.440
No real goals.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.440
But things have changed
a bit because I am more

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.610
than nothing, now.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.320
Is that...
because I found my Cub?

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.070
No...

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.320
A Cub can't do anything
for you on its own.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.660
You have to wanna do
something for yourself, first.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.870
[KOGUMA]
Something like...

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.750
...turning an unfamiliar corner,
when you've always

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.880
gone straight before.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.420
It can be as small as that.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.630
And when you decide,
the Cub will help you.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.680
[KOGUMA] There's nothing
magical about it.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.720
But when there's
a tough obstacle,

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.730
or when someone's counting on
you to take care of something,

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.060
it will always be at your side.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.360
That's what our bikes
mean to us.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.780
[KOGUMA]
I'll keep riding forever.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.200
Me...

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.280
...and my Super Cub.
