[KOGUMA]
A few days ago,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.083
my empty life turned into
a life with my Cub.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.750
And little by little,
I'm starting to get used

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:15.333
to that change.

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:33.166
[KOGUMA] Riding it is
beginning to feel natural.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.000
I don't have to think
about everything I do

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:37.000
like when I first got it.

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:45.792
[KOGUMA] But that's not
the only thing that's changed.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.500
There's something else.

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:49.834
Good morning.

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:52.333
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.000
[KOGUMA] And that other
thing might take a lot longer

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:03.750

Ah. Huh?

Well, ready to go?

Uh...

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:12.959
[REIKO] I've been thinking
I might go touring

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:14.583
over summer vacation.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:16.583
There's lots of
cool bike stuff to do.

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:18.709
I could go watch
the Suzuka Eight Hours.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:20.291
What else...?

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:21.375
Mm?

How's that going?

[KOGUMA grunts]

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:43.959
So the Eight Hours...

00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:45.542
Then what?

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:50.333
[REIKO] Mm? And then... well,
I haven't gotten that far yet.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:53.625
Although, one thing I know for
sure is that I wanna go big.

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:55.208
Like a really long trip?

00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:58.458
[REIKO] Yeah. And I can pack
as much as I need in here.

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:00.083
Going on trips is one of
the funnest things

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.834
about owning a Cub!

00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:03.709
That would be useful.

then unscrew the bolt.

basket on my own bike.

It could use a new home now.
Would you want it?

00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:55.083
Yes, you did.

[REIKO] If you ever need
some part for your bike,

00:10:19.166 --> 00:10:21.417
just manifest your desire
into the universe.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.417
A lot of times, it'll pretty
much fall into your lap

out of nowhere.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.041
Usually, five minutes after
you find one brand new

00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:31.542
and order it at full
price, but still! Later.

[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:45.041
One great thing about having
a Cub with a black storage box,

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:47.917
it lets you mostly
fly under the radar.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.166
Like, people might see there's
a girl riding her motorcycle

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.500
around town, but then, even if
they run into you the next day,

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:57.375
they're not gonna be like, "Oh,
yeah, the bike girl!" Y'know?

00:13:57.458 --> 00:14:00.250
Do you think I could look
at your helmet for a sec?

00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:02.500
After you're done
eating, I mean.

00:14:14.083 --> 00:14:15.542
Wanna try it on?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.166
So?

00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:29.125
[KOGUMA]
Hmm...

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:36.375
[KOGUMA]
Are those helmets expensive?

00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:39.417
They can get pricy,
but they're way too important

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.625
to cheap out on. Right?

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:45.834
Although I think both of ours
might cost the same.

00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:47.709
What's wrong with yours?

00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:01.959
[KOGUMA] I need to find
a way to block the wind.

00:15:02.041 --> 00:15:04.959
A face shield?
You can buy those.

00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:06.250
What store?

00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:08.208
[REIKO] Hmm... The closest
place I can think of

00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:10.125
would be out in Kofu.

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:11.250
[KOGUMA]
Kofu?

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:12.834
--Heh!
--[KOGUMA] Huh?

00:15:12.917 --> 00:15:15.500
It's not too far. Let's go!

Oh?

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.625

Awesome! Gimme a sec, okay?
I wanna take a look around.

00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:30.125

Hmm... That's a lot, though.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.959
Hmm... Cool, so...
What'd we need?

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:43.709
Right, you wanted
a face shield for your helmet!

00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:45.875
Like I would forget about that.

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.250
[KOGUMA groans]

00:15:53.333 --> 00:15:55.166
They're all so expensive.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.542
Can I look?

00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:01.709
[REIKO sighs] Well,
that was basically no help.

00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:04.792
[gasps] Hold on!
I just wanna check this out!

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.875
I don't need
anything that fancy.

00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:12.000
Maybe something more like...

00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:15.125
[gasps]

00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:23.000
--Sorry...
--[WORKER 3A] Hmm?

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.583
What do you call those
things over your eyes?

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:26.583
[WORKER 3A]
Oh.

00:16:26.667 --> 00:16:28.166
Safety goggles.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.375
And would they be okay
to wear on a motorbike?

00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:33.333
[WORKER 3A]
Sure, you wouldn't be the first.

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:35.792
They're tough and
they don't cost very much.

00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:37.792
[KOGUMA]
Where could I get some?

00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:40.166
They should have 'em at
any old hardware store,

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.000
like maybe the Komeri
on Koshu Highway?

00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:45.333
[KOGUMA]
Right. Thank you very much.

00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:51.500
So, then?

00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:54.875
Sorry, but I found what I need.

00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:11.458
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:37.375
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:18:09.458 --> 00:18:10.709
Heh.

00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:39.208
[engine puttering]

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.792
[KOGUMA giggles]

00:19:09.667 --> 00:19:11.250
[KOGUMA]
I had a dream.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.959
[KOGUMA] And in the dream,
I was riding my Cub.

00:19:17.375 --> 00:19:21.208
[KOGUMA chuckles]

00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:36.834
[KOGUMA]
Good morning.

00:19:36.917 --> 00:19:38.291
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:49.166
[KOGUMA]
Ah?

00:19:51.333 --> 00:19:55.083
When I started riding, I wore a
half helmet I'd gotten for free.

00:19:55.166 --> 00:19:57.709
It wasn't till later
that I tried on a full-face.

00:19:57.792 --> 00:20:01.166
It's super weird
at first, right?

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.500
[KOGUMA]
Hmm...

00:20:03.375 --> 00:20:04.583
[chuckles]

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:08.041
[BOTH giggle]

00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:29.000
I think... I wanna
ride around a bit.

00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:31.333
Yeah, I get that. Me, too.

00:20:32.542 --> 00:20:33.750
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:20:37.959 --> 00:20:39.041
[REIKO]
Hold on!

00:20:39.125 --> 00:20:40.250
Huh?

00:20:41.417 --> 00:20:43.500
[REIKO]
Here.

00:20:43.583 --> 00:20:46.208
That's my cell number.

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:47.917
Call me if anything comes up.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.375
Huh?

00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:51.458
[REIKO]
Be safe.

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:53.083
Bye!

00:20:59.834 --> 00:21:02.000
[KOGUMA]
The day I got my license,

00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:05.083
it didn't feel like anything
major had changed.

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:10.709
But this scrap of paper with
a number scribbled on it...

00:21:10.792 --> 00:21:13.333
That really felt like
it meant something.

00:21:15.417 --> 00:21:18.125
[KOGUMA] I'm not sure
I can say we're friends.

00:21:18.208 --> 00:21:20.208
But we're Cub riders.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.333
[KOGUMA] And in a way, that may
be a relationship that runs

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.250
deeper than friendship.

00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:36.417
[KOGUMA] When she left,
she told me to be safe.

00:21:38.041 --> 00:21:40.333
[KOGUMA] From a friend, that
could mean the same thing as

00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:41.875
"See you later."

00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:45.792
But from a fellow Cub rider,
it's actually an instruction.

00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:49.542
I know she was saying
exactly what she meant.

00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:52.333
I put Reiko's number
into my phone already,

00:21:52.417 --> 00:21:55.291
so there's no reason to
keep the note she handed me.

00:21:55.375 --> 00:21:58.458
I might throw it out
with all my grocery receipts.

00:21:58.542 --> 00:22:01.291
But I'll never
forget what she said to me.

00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:06.417
[KOGUMA]
I have no parents.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.667
No money.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.041
No hobbies or friends.

00:22:11.125 --> 00:22:13.583
No goals for my future.

00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:20.667
[KOGUMA]
But now...

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.417
...I'm not the girl
with nothing anymore.

00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:27.417
[KOGUMA]
Now, I have a Cub.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.375
[KOGUMA]
And since we're together,

00:22:37.458 --> 00:22:39.792
we can go anywhere we want.

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:23.291
