00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.350
[REIKO]
Ever since I was little,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.980
I've felt like there are
walls around me.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.230
On all sides.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400
Keeping me penned in.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.240
Holding me back from
doing everything I want.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.240
[REIKO]
Invisible but very high.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.210
[REIKO] I wanted to
climb over those walls.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.210
[REIKO] That's why I
moved out on my own.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.140
[REIKO]
And then...

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.850
...from there...

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.570
There.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.070
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.150
- [engine revvs]
- Ah.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.120
Been a while.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.500
Good to see you.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.090
Well, come in.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.930
[REIKO]
Go ahead.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.250
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.960
[REIKO] Make yourself at home.
I'll get some tea going.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.260
I'll just have water.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.010
[REIKO]
Heh. Sure.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.180
[REIKO]
Here.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.100
[KOGUMA]
Ah? Thanks so much.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.940
[REIKO gulping]

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.480
Ah!

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.610
Okay. What's for dinner?

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.400
What do I even have around here?

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.950
I just got in today, and I
didn't bring any groceries in.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.950
[KOGUMA]
I brought some.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.410
[REIKO]
Ah?

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.620
[KOGUMA] Would it be okay
if I used your kitchen?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.870
[REIKO]
What are you gonna make for us?

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.290
Okonomiyaki...
if that's all right with you.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.960
[REIKO]
Mm...!

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.670
That is way more
than all right with me!

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.260
[KOGUMA]
All done. Let's eat.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.600
[REIKO]
Mm! Thank you for the food!

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.890
[KOGUMA]
Thank you for the food.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.640
[REIKO]
Mm!

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.520
That's so good!

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.860
You're all done with work?
How was the job?

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.410
[KOGUMA]
Mm. I think I did well.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.490
You, too?

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.450
[REIKO]
Huh?

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.120
Your summer break...
Where did you go?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.160
I told you that, remember?

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.170
Somewhere close, yet far away.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.780
[REIKO]
Keep going. Keep going.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.860
Little more.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.530
Stop!

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.990
[WORKER 5A]
Right, load up!

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.280
[WORKERS]
Yes, sir!

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.990
[WORKER 5B]
Make way!

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.660
[REIKO grunts]

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.950
[sighs]

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.540
[REIKO]
8, 9, 10, 11,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.380
12, 13, 14...

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.800
Seems like we've been
getting more every day.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.760
[REIKO]
Hey, Chief. The count is right.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.090
Great. Thank you.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.970
Sure thing. I'll go ahead
and check the trails.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.890
You've still got plenty of time,
so there's no need to rush.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.270
Safety first.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.230
Yes, sir. Safety first.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.700
All right, let's go!

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.400
[REIKO gasps]

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.240
[crash]

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.410
[REIKO panting]

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.620
[REIKO]
Damn it!

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.800
[REIKO groans]

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.180
[REIKO] The summer of my
second year in high school.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.310
I wanted to ride my Cub
somewhere amazing.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.730
All the way up Mount Fuji.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.450
[REIKO]
Everything's good.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.080
Nothing to report on the trail.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.240
Good. Excellent work.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.080
All clear! Let's move!

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.620
[WORKERS]
Yes, sir!

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.430
What made you feel
the need to do this?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.560
[REIKO] I first got this idea in
my head after reading a book

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.770
by a wandering biker.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.190
[sighs]

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.490
[RIDER 5A] Yeah. Apparently,
back in the day,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.950
climbing Mount Fuji on
motorbikes was a common thing.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.950
So do people not do it anymore?

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.290
It's harder with the
environmental regs now.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.410
And the rules for the trail
have gotten stricter.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.830
Sorry. But you're out of luck.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.340
[REIKO sighs]

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.380
"Rocky and steeply inclined,
this should only be attempted

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.050
on a high-performance
off-road bike."

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.100
[REIKO]
Guess that's not happening.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.060
Ah.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.400
It's a CT 110 Hunter Cub.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.030
Instead of having to
customize existing Cub parts,

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.280
I could just swap in the ones
they use on this thing, right?

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.090
Awesome.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.050
[REIKO] But even if I have a
bike that can tackle the trail,

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.350
I still can't take it climbing
unless I get permission.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.180
[CHIEF 5A]
If you accept the position,

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.680
we'll need you to
stay in an apartment at

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.060
the foot of the mountain.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.360
[REIKO]
That's fine.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.520
Any climbing experience?

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.150
[REIKO]
No, sir.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.280
Is that a requirement?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.110
Not really.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.160
Now, as to why
you want the job...

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.040
[REIKO] Yes, sir.
It's exactly what I wrote down.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.620
All I want is to climb up
Mount Fuji on my bike.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.680
We'll start loading this
sucker up at 4 AM tomorrow.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.590
Once it's good to go,
I'll be putting you to work

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.140
on trail check duty.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.100
What is that, exactly?

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.390
[CHIEF 5A] You're gonna be
ridin' out ahead to make sure

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.270
the weather and road conditions
are okay for the Caterpillar.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.980
- You and your bike.
- [REIKO] Ah?

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.740
You'll be free to head back to
base after you reach Station 6.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.700
Of course, you're also free
to go further up the trail

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.700
if you feel the need.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.490
[gasps]

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.910
Right. Thank you very much!

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.760
[CHIEF 5A] What made you feel
the need to do this?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.690
[REIKO]
There's something I wanna know.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.860
[REIKO]
Do I have the strength

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.320
to overcome this obstacle?

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.830

Damn it!

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.930
[REIKO] Trail's clear.
Nothing to report.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.640
Good work.

Thank you very much, sir.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.690
Sip that slowly.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.820
You're gonna puke
if you try to chug it.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.440

[REIKO]
Damn it all...

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.820
[CHIEF 5A] You've been trying to
stand up against the mountain.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.410
Try leaning against it.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.910
What?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.950
I should.... lean on it?

is dusted with snow.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.380
I always thought it was
a beautiful mountain.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.140
I wanted to see it up close.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.600
And if I could see it
from the top,

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.100
I'm sure it would
be even prettier.

I'd forgotten how to smile.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.410
[REIKO] I was climbing
Mount Fuji on my Cub.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.030
I was doing exactly
what I'd wanted to.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.790
So why did it feel like some
unseen enemy was constantly

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.160
sabotaging me,
trying to make me suffer?

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.210
Trail check time.
See you in a while.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.960
Drive safely.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.290
[REIKO] Nothing wrong
with the suspension.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.960
Frame buckling slightly,
but it's not an issue.

You've been trying to stand up

Now try leaning against it.

[REIKO] He said to lean
against the mountain,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.110
but he wasn't
telling me to rest.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.990
I have to stay on top of it
and wrestle to keep it under me!

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.290
The mountain fights back!

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.160
[REIKO]
I can do it! Don't stop!

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.910
What's wrong with me?
I should stop!

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.500
Keep going!
You can make it higher!

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.960
Damn it!
I can't give up now!

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.290
I can come back
next year, right?

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.880
Quit thinking. Just climb!

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.420
Climb!

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.840
[KOGUMA]
A Super Cub.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.840
Used.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.220
[BOY 2B]
Man, that's all?

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.680
Isn't a Cub is more of
a scooter than a motorcycle?

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.770
Did you say you ride
a Super Cub?

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.180
I love sitting
on my Cub like this.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.060
Even standing perfectly still,
it feels like I can go

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.690
wherever I want,
no matter how far away it is.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.190
Well, I haven't gotten
to go very far at all, yet.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.910
But you could if you wanted to.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.280
'Cause you've got a Cub!

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.330
Somewhere close, yet far away.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.950
Be safe, okay?

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.960
[REIKO]
I know.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.210
[REIKO]
I don't have enough oxygen.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.920
Or hydration.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.340
But...

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.300
Back then, I told her...
that she could go anywhere!

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.390
And if I meant that,
then I can't let this stop me!

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.820
[REIKO]
Tch!

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.400
[groans]

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.450
Damn it...!

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.700
[grunts]

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.660
[groaning]

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.040
[REIKO groans]

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.550
[REIKO panting]

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.570
[REIKO]
Yes, sir. Trail is all clear.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.530
Do you think there's any
chance you could give me a ride

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.990
back to base on the Caterpillar?

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:13.470
[CHIEF 5A]
Here.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.550
Thanks a lot for the help, sir.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.560
[CHIEF 5A] You didn't make it
all the way to the summit?

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.910
[REIKO]
Still. I think I did okay.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.450
[KOGUMA]
You had quite the summer.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.210
It's totally insane, right?
I thought the same thing!

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.840
Even as I was doing it,
I didn't really know why.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.380
Riding a motorbike
up Mount Fuji.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.720
Just silly.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.220
[REIKO]
Mm.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.190
[REIKO laughs]
For real?!

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.570
I can't believe you've been
riding the Cursed Cub all along!

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.190
[KOGUMA]
You know about it?

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.110
I've heard
a buncha stories, yeah.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.570
There were
three fatalities, right?

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.320
[REIKO laughs]
Hardly.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.620
It's just the soba shop
guy who died.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.160
And that was excessive drinking,
not a bike wreck.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.210
The bookstore owner who
got it after that ended up

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.800
drowning in debt. Skipped town
and left the bike here.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.920
Then this priest had it,
but he had no reason to keep it

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.130
once he lost his license.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.590
Feel any better?

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.220
[KOGUMA giggles]

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.350
Yeah. Except, I never knew its
old owners were so sketchy.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:49.690
[BOTH laugh]

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:50.860
[sighs]

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.360
[KOGUMA]
I should probably get going.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.440
Stay the night!

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.530
[KOGUMA]
Huh?

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.650
There aren't any
streetlights out here.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.780
The roads'll be pitch black.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.620
- Catch!
- Ah!

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.710
[giggles]

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.680
[REIKO] Honestly, it probably
was a bad idea.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.270
Yeah. It was.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.940
Especially falling off.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.070
I would have taken my Cub
the entire way up to the summit.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.820
[REIKO giggles]

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.410
Your Cub definitely
isn't up to that ride.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.580
It's true. Cubs just
can't handle Mount Fuji.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.540
There's no way.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.290
It is silly, but I don't
believe it's impossible.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:56.760
[REIKO]
Mm.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.380
It's been done, actually.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.180
August 1963.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.760
There was a guy from Yamanashi
Prefecture whose hobbies

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.930
were motorbikes and
mountain-climbing.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.730
He took his Super Cub all the
way up the Fujinomiya Trail

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.310
to the top.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.310
Later that year, the curator of
the Ueno Zoo got together

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.820
a team of riders, and they made
it up Mount Fuji on Hunter Cubs

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.400
and Monkeys.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.200
[REIKO]
And next... will be me.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.800
Here.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.380
Thanks so much.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.390
We still have
one whole week left.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.850
What'll you do?

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.390
[REIKO]
Fix my bike.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.100
Did you have something in mind?

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:51.730
[KOGUMA]
Getting my license.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.940
Oh, really?

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.940
You want a full license?

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.440
[KOGUMA] There are
a few things I can't do with

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.110
the class type I've got.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.360
Sure, makes sense.
That's why you took the job.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.610
[KOGUMA]
Yeah.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.830
I'm getting it―
My full motorcycle license.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.370
Sounds good!

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.250
You'll wanna hurry up and
make a reservation, though.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.210
What?

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.840
What reservation?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.210
[REIKO]
At driving school, obviously.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.880
And of course,
we gotta mod your engine.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.840
What's the point of getting
your license and then sticking

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.180
with your 50 CC?

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.390
I don't have a lot
of money to spend.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.640
You can bore out
your block fairly cheap.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.020
What does "bore out" mean?

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.810
It's simple. See, these
engine blocks are cast iron,

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.320
and the finish is pretty rough.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.440
So what you do is, you bore out
the combustion chamber

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:41.610
and cylinder head.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.950
That leaves you with
a wider cylinder

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.700
with perfectly smooth walls.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.570
Then you put in a bigger piston
to match, which means―

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.830
[KOGUMA]
Reiko?

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.080
[REIKO]
Hmm?

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.750
I'm sorry,
but I'm completely lost.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.330
[REIKO]
Yeah, fair.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.920
I should give you an overview of
the basics first, shouldn't I?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.010
Okay, so the way they make
these engines is more about―

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.170
[KOGUMA] Episode 6:
"My Cub."
