WEBVTT

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.430
[KOGUMA]
I got my full motorcycle license

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.020
over summer break.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.520
And traded my white license
plate for a yellow one.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.320
[KOGUMA] I took my Cub
to Mister Shino's shop

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.780
to get the engine
block modified.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.740
And doing that officially bumped
it up to a type-two motorbike.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.790
[KOGUMA]
It went from 49 CC to 52.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.040
A 5% increase in displacement.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.290
Now that I have my full license,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.840
instead of topping out at 30
kilometers per hour everywhere,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.760
I can go the speed limit.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.340
[KOGUMA] My bike is
a little bit faster now,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.060
but mostly, it rides
about the same.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.690
[KOGUMA]
Still, for some reason,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.230
I feel a little bit
more liberated.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.020
Even now...

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.860
...my Cub is so fascinating.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.120
[TEACHER 1A]
Well, everybody.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.170
At long last, our class trip to
Kamakura will begin tomorrow!

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.380
Your guidebook has a full list
of travel do's and don'ts.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.920
Be sure to read it through
before we leave.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.590
And I'm sure none of you
need to be reminded of this,

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.470
but even though
you'll be off campus,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.930
you're still going
to be in school.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.260
Your conduct needs
to reflect this.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.850
We expect you
to follow the rules

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.140
and observe proper
etiquette during the trip.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.100
- [KOGUMA] Hmm.
- [STUDENTS murmuring]

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.270
[TEACHER 1A]
Everyone, settle down!

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.070
[REIKO]
Check it out!

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.740
They call National Route 134
the "Shonan Bullet Road"!

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.950
It's close to the inn
where we'll be staying.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.370
Wanna see it during
our free time?

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.210
[KOGUMA] Staring at a road
doesn't sound exciting.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.250
Okay, fine, that's fair.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.960
How about something you've
been looking forward to

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.460
on the trip, then?

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.720
[KOGUMA] There's kozabuta ham,
Misaki fish dishes,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.180
the desserts in Kamakura.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.800
[REIKO]
All food?

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.470
I've been trying to
set aside a little bit

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.810
of my scholarship
money every month.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.100
This seems like the right time
to give myself a reward.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.480
[REIKO] Mm. Well I guess
I can see it on my own.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.280
[REIKO]
Hmm...

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.680
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.730
[KOGUMA panting softly]

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.900
[beep]

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.530
[KOGUMA]
Seriously...?

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.780
[KOGUMA]
Yes. I have a fever.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.290
[KOGUMA]
It is.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.120
I'm going to have to stay home.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.250
I will.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.540
I hope you have a safe trip.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.840
[sighs]

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.560
[beep]

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.020
Come on, really?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.660
[KOGUMA groans]

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.840
[sighs]

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.650
[KOGUMA]
Hmm!

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.130
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.760
It's a uniform.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.850
Perfect.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.270
[KOGUMA] I could take the Koshu
Highway to National Route 137,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.030
then take that to Lake Sagami
and head south on Route 412.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.570
Don't wanna go uphill too much.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.200
This map won't
help with that though.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.850
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.360
[KOGUMA]
Hmm!

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.160
Be back soon.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.770
Let's go!

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.630
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.800
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.680
Yeah, no, that seems
like a terrible idea.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.100
You really think
it's that dangerous?

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.890
[REIKO] If I say
"yes," will you listen?

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.810
[KOGUMA]
Mm...

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.360
I'll remember for next time.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.270
[REIKO chuckles]
Sounds like you're starting to

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.740
turn into a biker.
Well, not that you should do it.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.490
But if you do, I'll help
you plead your case

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.200
with the teachers
when you get here.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.780
Be careful, okay?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.660
Stay away if
something seems off,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.790
and if you don't think you can
make it safely, turn back.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.790
[KOGUMA]
Right. Thanks a lot, Reiko.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.550
[KOGUMA] Just under 90 minutes
to get this far.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.850
[KOGUMA] If I follow
the road south from here,

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.470
it'll take me around
Mount Hakone

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.440
and onto National Route 1.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.810
I'll turn left towards Kanagawa,
then to Kamakura

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.610
by way of Shonan.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.480
Then I go left at the
Hagiwarakita intersection,

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.280
and merge onto
National Route 246.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.490
It's a roundabout way
to get there,

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.370
but it'll save me some
mountain-climbing.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.790
[sighs]

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.200
Hmm?

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.420
[KOGUMA]
5 PM, huh?

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.590
[KOGUMA]
Hmm.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.510
[REIKO]
For real?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.810
Wow, you're making good time
if you're in Gotemba.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.850
[KOGUMA] Maybe too good.
I might beat the bus to the inn.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.770
[REIKO]
Hmm... If you get there first,

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.110
you'll just have to wait
around by yourself.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.570
Why not take a detour
to fill some time?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.690
[KOGUMA]
Yeah, good idea.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.240
Thank you.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.070
[gasps]

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.740
[KOGUMA]
Huh?

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.430
[panting]

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.100
I'm gonna let you go
just this once, mountain.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.510
[chuckles]

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.320
So this is National Route 134.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.700
I reached the
Shonan Bullet Road.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.340
[gulping]

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.750
Ah.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.300
[KOGUMA]
I should go.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.300
No way.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.970
Is something wrong?

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.310
[BOY 6A]
Whoa. What is she doing here?

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.680
Didn't she call in sick?

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.480
[REIKO chuckles]

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.280
I'm glad to see
you made it okay!

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.700
Hey.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.000
[TEACHER 6A]
Honestly.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.800
What would you have done
if there'd been an accident?

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.380
But it would hardly make sense
to send her home at this point.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.590
Needless to say, you will not
be riding your motorcycle

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.220
during this trip. Are we clear?

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.230
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry for the trouble.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.560
Thank you for understanding.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.600
[TEACHER 6A] Her safety
is what's most important.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.860
[TEACHER 2A] And I think
she made a sincere apology.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.480
[TEACHER 6A]
I agree.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.200
[sighs]
I'm beat.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.080
Thank you.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.790
[REIKO giggles]

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.250
So?

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.340
[KOGUMA]
Mm...

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.680
[slurps]

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.680
A bath would be nice.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.300
Heck yeah!

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.020
[KOGUMA sighs]

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.480
Right. So?

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.940
Well. I rode up Mount Fuji.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.440
[REIKO]
Hmm. Did you now? Cool.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.610
I had to drop down to
first gear by Station 4,

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.160
but I managed to make it all
the way to Station 5 like that.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.620
There's not a single hill
anywhere in Japan that you can't

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.750
climb on a Cub in first gear.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.170
They say you can ride the
baddest off-road monster bike

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.880
up the toughest
trail you can find,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.210
and at the end there'll be an
old guy loading wild veggies

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.130
onto his Cub, like he was just
picking up his groceries.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.930
And in hilly places like
Onomichi and Nagasaki,

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.720
there are Cubs carrying
packages every day

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.970
to houses that cars can't reach.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.180
[KOGUMA] I guess Cubs
are just that amazing.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.850
Yeah, obviously.
Cubs are the best!

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.230
Oh, I forgot. I also took a trip
down National Route 134.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.110
Hold on, you got to ride
the Shonan Bullet Road?

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.700
No fair! I haven't
even done that yet!

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.110
[KOGUMA]
Well, whose fault is that?

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.700
[REIKO] Yeah, but it's your
fault that you did it

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.990
- without me! Traitor.
- [KOGUMA giggling]

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.580
Gosh. You guys,
isn't this exciting?

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.500
It looks so good!

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.470
[KOGUMA]
Mm!

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.260
[chuckles]

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.980
Hey, you asleep?

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.570
I'm trying.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.030
[REIKO]
About our free time tomorrow...

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.790
We should go and buy
some caramecco candies.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.700
[SHII]
Mm. I wanna see the squirrels.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.410
[GIRL 2A]
Oh, me, too!

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.960
Here's me.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.300
[KOGUMA]
Mm.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.510
Ha, ha!

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.260
Why'd you bring that?

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.850
You can never be
too prepared, you know?

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.820
[REIKO chuckles]

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.280
[REIKO]
Hmm.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.190
I feel like the mountains
are perfect for us!

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.250
My Cub is totaled.
The Engine's shot.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.130
Suspension's wrecked.
Electrical, too.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.550
And the frame got too messed up
to hold it all together.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.390
[KOGUMA]
So...

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.760
What will you do?

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.810
[REIKO] Mm. I'm thinking
I should go 'n buy myself

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.310
a new one.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.860
I know this shop owner with
a few CTs in his inventory.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.190
CTs were the ones they
called Hunter Cubs, right?

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.320
They're made to go
up mountain paths?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.030
That's right! They've been out
of production since 2012,

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.540
and the distributors have sold
through all their inventory now.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.870
They're still in demand
overseas today.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.620
They sell them as Farm Bikes.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.880
They do well out there 'cause
they can handle rough trails

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.420
and they're easy to fix.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.920
Wait. Isn't there
a newer model out?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.470
Those electronically controlled
Cubs are basically toys

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.670
next to the old CT.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.890
It's over. It had an awesome
run, but the Cub isn't the king

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.430
of all farm bikes anymore.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.100
Then I guess I really need
to take care of my Cub.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.690
Well, obviously.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.400
It'll pay for itself.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.320
Even in 10 years,
you won't have any trouble

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.870
finding parts for it. It could
stay on the road forever!

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.870
Do you think so?

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.590
Once you have it, will you
let me ride your Hunter Cub?

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.180
Once it's broken in I will.
And in the meantime,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.800
I'm gonna be riding
the heck out of it.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.850
[KOGUMA] Maybe Reiko's right,
and the same Cubs we ride today

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.940
will still be on the road,
unchanged. For 50 years.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.980
Or even a hundred.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.980
I won't change, either.
I don't want to.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.780
[giggles]

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.780
I'll keep riding as long
as I can... with my Super Cub.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.340
