1
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,541
- Stoner: ABOUT 10,000 YEARS AGO
ON OUR MOTHER PLANET EARTH,

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,875
A MAJORITY OF THE PLANET'S
SURFACE WAS COVERED

3
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,791
IN SALT-FILLED WATER
CALLED OCEAN.

4
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,083
ONE OF THE SPORTS THAT TOOK
PLACE ON THAT PLANET

5
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,458
WAS AN ACTIVITY
CALLED "SURFING."

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,416
THEY SAY IT WAS A SPORT
THAT RESEMBLED LIFTING,

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,250
A PASTIME THAT WE WHO CURRENTLY
LIVE ON THIS PROMISED LAND

8
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,000
LIKE TO DO.

9
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,000
THOSE THAT PERFORMED
THIS SURFING

10
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,666
WERE WIDELY KNOWN AS SURFERS.

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,000
THEY RODE THE WAVES IN THE
OCEAN, COMMUNICATED WITH NATURE,

12
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,375
AND FELT THE EXISTENCE
OF THAT PLANET, THAT WORLD,

13
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,625
WITH THEIR ENTIRE BODIES.

14
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,583
YES, IT WAS VERY
MUCH LIKE HOW WE,

15
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,625
PEOPLE BORN ON THIS PLANET

16
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,000
WITH A SKY FILLED WITH TRAPARS,

17
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,000
THROUGH WAVE RIDING KNOWN
AS LIFTING,

18
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,625
FEEL WITH OUR ENTIRE BEINGS

19
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,291
THE EXISTENCE OF THE SCUB CORALS

20
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:17,083
AND OF THE VERY SOURCE
OF THE PLANET ITSELF.

21
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,041
- Renton:
THIS IS NIRVASH.

22
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,041
CURRENTLY WE ARE FLYING
THE SKIES OVER GREMIKOWA.

23
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:32,750
- Talho: ANY SIGNS OF LIFE?
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING MOVING?

24
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,041
- I SEE NOTHING.

25
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,041
IT'S NOTHING BUT RUINS.

26
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,500
- UNDERSTOOD.  COME ON BACK.

27
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,541
- ROGER THAT.

28
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,625
EUREKA, TALHO'S TELLING US
TO GO BACK.

29
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,541
- ( sobbing )
- EUREKA.

30
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:54,208
EUREKA.  EUREKA!

31
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,958
LET'S GO BACK TO
THE GEKKO, OKAY?

32
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,083
- BUT WHAT IF THERE'S STILL
SOMEONE INJURED BUT ALIVE?

33
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:06,083
- WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS.
LET'S GO BACK.

34
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,791
- RENTON.
- EUREKA.

35
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,791
WE HAVE TO GIVE UP.

36
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,583
WE GOT HERE TOO--
TOO LATE.  THAT'S ALL.

37
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,583
- I'M SORRY, RENTON.

38
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,375
- CONFIRMING THE ARRIVAL
OF THE NIRVASH

39
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,208
AND THE CLOSING
OF THE MAIN HATCH.

40
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,791
- FOR NOW, HAVE THEM TAKE IT
EASY AND GET SOME REST.

41
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:36,375
AFTER ALL, THEY JUST CAME BACK
FROM SEEING A GRUESOME PLACE.

42
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,083
DON'T BE SO DEPRESSED.
- HUH?

43
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,875
- SEE, IT WASN'T THAT
WE ARRIVED HERE TOO LATE.

44
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,583
THEY JUST ARRIVED HERE
TOO EARLY.

45
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,208
WOZ AND HAP ARE DOING
THE CALCULATIONS

46
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,833
IN THE CENTRAL COMPUTING ROOM.

47
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,833
MOST LIKELY, THE AREA OF DAMAGE
HAS GOTTEN BIGGER THIS TIME.

48
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,833
IN OTHER WORDS,
THEY'RE GETTING MORE ACCURATE.

49
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,833
THIS ISN'T COINCIDENCE.

50
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:01,083
YOU COULD SAY THIS IS PROOF
THAT IT'S SOMETHING ARTIFICIAL.

51
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,833
IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

52
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,833
AS A FULL-TIME MEMBER OF THIS
SHIP, I'LL MAKE ONE REQUEST.

53
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,083
LET YOUR CREW
GET SOME REST.

54
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,625
EVERYONE'S EXHAUSTED.

55
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,875
- ALL RIGHT,
BUT NOT ALL AT ONCE.

56
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,125
STAY IN PATROL MODE

57
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,791
AND GIVE HALF THE SHIP A BREAK.
- ROGER THAT.

58
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:28,375
- THE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT'S
FIREWALL HAS BEEN FORTIFIED,

59
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,416
AND THEY'VE SET DECOYS,

60
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,041
WHICH EXPLAINS THE FAKE
INFORMATION HAP FOUND

61
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,833
ON MASTER NORB.

62
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,875
IS THE MILITARY'S INFO
MESSED UP, TOO?

63
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,875
NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
COME ON, AT THE LEAST HE--

64
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,875
- Holland: YOU SHOULD GET
SOME REST, TOO.

65
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,875
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN
ANY SLEEP SINCE TRESOR.

66
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,500
- IDIOT, I'M BETTER OFF
THAN YOU ARE.

67
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,875
YOU'RE STILL INJURED.

68
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,875
- I HAVEN'T DONE MUCH
BUT LAY AROUND LATELY.

69
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,458
YOU SHOULD TAKE
CARE OF YOURSELF, TALHO.

70
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,375
- HEY, HOLLAND.
- HMM?

71
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,375
WHAT?

72
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,375
- NOTHING.  NEVER MIND.

73
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,375
- REALLY, I'M COMPLETELY
ASTOUNDED.

74
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,916
THE DATA WE DOWNLOADED
IMPLIES THAT

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,375
THE AIRBORNE FORM OF NIRVASH WAS
PLANNED FROM THE BEGINNING.

76
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,041
- DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT?

77
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,458
RENTON, WHAT'S YOUR
IMPRESSION AS A PILOT?

78
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,000
- WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WOULD TAKE A LOT MORE TIME

79
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,708
THAN IT DID FOR ME
TO GET USED TO IT,

80
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,833
IT FEELS STRANGE THAT IT WAS
SO MUCH EASIER THAN

81
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,708
I HAD IMAGINED IT WOULD BE.
- THAT'S MY POINT.

82
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,708
THIS IS THE RESULTING SHAPE
THAT YOU TWO WISHED FOR.

83
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,208
WAIT, WHERE'D SHE GO?

84
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,041
- OH.  EUREKA WENT BACK
TO HER ROOM TO REST.

85
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,500
I THINK WHAT HAPPENED DOWN
IN GREMIKOWA WAS A SHOCK TO HER.

86
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,750
BESIDES, SHE'S--

87
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:51,125
WELL, I THINK WE JUST NEED
TO LEAVE HER ALONE

88
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,458
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

89
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,750
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE EUREKA'S PARTNER.

90
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,750
WHY AREN'T YOU AT HER SIDE?

91
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,750
- WELL, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

92
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,750
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

93
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,625
HERE.  THIS WILL DO IT.

94
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,750
- STRAWBERRY CANDY?
- RIGHT.

95
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,166
IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO
BE THIS.

96
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,833
YOU JUST NEED A REASON
TO START TALKING.

97
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,916
- WHY WON'T YOU GIVE IT TO ME?

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,750
- HAVING THIS IS A NO-GO
FOR YOU, KID.

99
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,750
( grunts ) THIS IS
A SMALL PIECE OF MEMORY

100
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,458
THAT THE LITTLE CUB
AND I SHARE TOGETHER.

101
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,291
- BUT EUREKA AND I DON'T
HAVE ANY LITTLE ITEMS LIKE THAT.

102
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,458
- THESE THINGS REQUIRE MEMORIES
ATTACHED TO THEM.

103
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,125
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
FOR YOU TWO.

104
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,791
GO FIND A MEMORY THAT
YOU TWO CAN SHARE.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,125
- Talho: SO NOSTALGIC.

106
00:05:56,208 --> 00:06:00,125
BOTH OF US ARE SO YOUNG HERE,
IT'S DISGUSTING.

107
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,625
WE TALKED TOGETHER
ABOUT ANYTHING

108
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,583
AND EVERYTHING BACK THEN.

109
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,791
THIS WAS WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT
I'D NEVER BEEN ON A BOARD BEFORE

110
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,083
AND HE IMMEDIATELY
HAD TO.

111
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,500
THAT'S HOW HE ALWAYS IS.

112
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,375
HOLLAND ALWAYS GIVES
ME ALL SORTS OF THINGS,

113
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,500
BUT HE ALWAYS KEEPS QUIET
ABOUT THE TRUTH

114
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,666
AND WHAT HE HAS PRESSING
ON HIS MIND,

115
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,500
THINGS THAT HE NEEDS
TO GET DONE,

116
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,500
WHAT HE REALLY WANTS,

117
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,500
HOW HE REALLY FEELS.

118
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,000
ALWAYS ACTING SO TOUGH.

119
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,541
UNFAIR.

120
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,541
YOU'RE SO UNFAIR, HOLLAND.

121
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,541
- Stoner: THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO CONFIRM WITH YOU.

122
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:06,333
OUR OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN
TO DO RESEARCH ON CORALIANS

123
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,208
AND TO GET IN CONTACT
WITH THEM,

124
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,000
TO PREVENT THE GOVERNMENT
FROM HIDING THEIR EXISTENCE

125
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,333
AND TO STOP THE MILITARY
FROM SECRETLY ERADICATING THEM.

126
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,333
- BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN
A BATTLE TO THE DEATH

127
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,000
BETWEEN THE CORALIAN RACE

128
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,000
AND THE HUMANS WHO MOVED
ONTO THIS PLANET AFTER THEM.

129
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,750
- Matthieu:
SO HOW ABOUT IT, LEADER?

130
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,541
IF WHAT YOU SAID WAS TRUE,
AND EUREKA WAS SOMEONE

131
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,041
THAT THIS PLANET
THAT THE SCUB CORALS CREATED,

132
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,541
DO YOU REALLY THINK WE STILL
KEEP DOING WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

133
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,041
FOR ALL THIS TIME?

134
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,041
IT'S NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT
AND MILITARY NOW.

135
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,041
DON'T WE GO UP AGAINST
MONSTERS, TOO,

136
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,041
LIKE THE ONES THAT SHOWED UP
NEAR GREMIKOWA?

137
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,708
AND UNDER CONDITIONS LIKE THAT
CAN WE REALLY AIM

138
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,416
FOR COEXISTENCE BETWEEN HUMAN
BEINGS AND THE CORALIANS?

139
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,541
- SORRY. I NEED SOME TIME.

140
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,041
TO THINK IT OVER.

141
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,541
I KNOW THAT AS A RESULT
OF EVERYTHING,

142
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,041
OUR OBJECTIVES ARE
STARTING TO CHANGE.

143
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,791
I ALSO KNOW THAT AT THIS POINT
WE CAN'T GO BACK

144
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,375
TO BEING THE PEOPLE
WE USED TO BE.

145
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:10,541
ALL THE MORE REASON I NEED
MORE TIME.  PLEASE.

146
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,625
Man: SHONAN EAST.  SOUTHERLY
WINDS, WIND FORCE ONE.

147
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:21,083
TRANSPARENCE LIGHT PARTICLES,
18, LATER 16.

148
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,416
- Renton:
IT'S NO GOOD.

149
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,416
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING.

150
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,416
IN FACT THE TRUTH IS

151
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,916
I DON'T HAVE ANY ITEMS AT ALL.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,166
- RENTON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HUH?

153
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,166
- WHAT'S WITH THE BIG MESS?

154
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,625
AND JUST LOOK AT YOU.
DID YOU STAY UP ALL NIGHT?

155
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,166
- MISS TALHO!
- WHAT'S WRONG?

156
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,708
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD
MEMORABILIA IS.

157
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,416
- MEMORABILIA?

158
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,916
( laughs )

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,166
- COME ON, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LAUGH ABOUT IT.

160
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,125
- IT'S FUNNY.

161
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,458
- CUT IT OUT.  I'M SERIOUS.

162
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,125
I'M SERIOUSLY THINKING
ABOUT EUREKA.

163
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,958
- YOU IDIOT.  THE ITEM YOU PICK
ISN'T WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

164
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,833
SO WHAT, YOU WERE RUMMAGING
THOUGH BOOKS IN SEARCH

165
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,541
OF SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD USE?
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

166
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,208
THE ONLY KIND OF STUFF
I'VE GOT IS LIFTING GEAR.

167
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,625
- IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN
GET HER ATTENTION

168
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,083
WITH SOMETHING FROM A BOOK.

169
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,541
IN THE END, IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER WHAT THE ITEM IS.

170
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,625
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
ARE THE MEMORIES

171
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,875
OF THE GOOD TIMES YOU'VE HAD
WITH THAT PERSON.

172
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,208
IN FACT, THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING OF ALL.

173
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,041
THE TRUTH IS, RENTON,

174
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,875
HOW YOU SPENT THE TIME THAT YOU
HAVE WITH THE PERSON YOU LOVE,

175
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,208
HOW WONDERFUL THAT
TIME TOGETHER WAS,

176
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,250
THAT'S WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
TO PEOPLE.

177
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,250
MEMORABILIA ARE NOTHING
BUT THINGS THAT JUST HAPPENED

178
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,541
TO BE LYING AROUND
AT THAT POINT IN TIME.

179
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,375
- ( sighs )

180
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,291
( screams )

181
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,583
I GET IT!

182
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,666
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

183
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,875
YOU CAN'T MAKE SPECIAL MEMORIES
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING

184
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,083
TO USE SOMETHING THAT YOU
DON'T HAVE IN COMMON

185
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,083
WITH THE OTHER PERSON.

186
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,250
MISS TALHO, WHAT IS
THAT OVER THERE?

187
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,875
- WHAT?
- LOOK DOWN THERE.

188
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,000
WHAT IS THAT SHINY STUFF?
- HMM.

189
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:10,000
OH, THAT'S TRAPAR DUST.
- TRAPAR DUST?

190
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,250
- RIGHT.  IT'S A PHENOMENON
THAT HAPPENS ONCE IN A WHILE

191
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,291
WHEN THERE'S A REALLY DENSE
TRAPAR WAVE NEARBY.

192
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,291
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
IT BEFORE, RENTON?

193
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,541
- I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD
OF IT BEFORE.

194
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:24,041
WOW, AMAZING!

195
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,541
THIS MEANS THERE'S A REALLY GOOD
TRAPAR WAVE CLOSE TO US NOW.

196
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:31,291
TRUE.  WE'RE FAIRLY CLOSE TO
A PRETTY FAMOUS SPOT.

197
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,541
HOW ABOUT IT, RENTON,
DO YOU WANT TO GO LIFTING NOW?

198
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,875
- LIFTING?
- WHY NOT?

199
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,916
- Man:
OH, MAN, THAT WAS SO CLOSE.

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,541
IT'S A GOOD THING THE
MALFUNCTION OF THE FLY-BY-WIRE

201
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,208
LINK DIDN'T HAPPEN DURING
THE BATTLE WITH THE IZUMO.

202
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,625
- Man #2: YES, REALLY.

203
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,416
OF COURSE IF WE HAD PASSED
THROUGH THIS AREA,

204
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,291
THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ANY PLACE TO STOP

205
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,583
FOR AT LEAST TWO MORE DAYS.

206
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,000
- ALL RIGHT,
SYSTEM CHECKS COMPLETE.

207
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,583
I CAN'T FIND ANY PROBLEMS
WITH THE CONTROL UNITS.

208
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,583
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS
AFRAID OF.

209
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,583
- I THINK IT'S THE CENTRAL
COMPUTING SYSTEM.

210
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,833
- THIS IS A PAIN.
- WHERE DID TALHO GO?

211
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,208
SHE'S THE ONE THAT
REPORTED THE MALFUNCTION

212
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,625
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

213
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,583
- MISS TALHO, ARE YOU SURE IT
WAS ALL RIGHT TO LIE

214
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,375
AND SAY THAT THE FLY-BY-WIRE
SYSTEM WAS BROKEN?

215
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,875
UM, SO WHAT IS IT YOU WANTED
TO SHOW ME?

216
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,583
OW!  SORRY, MISS TALHO.

217
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,583
WHAT IS THAT THING?

218
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,958
MISS TALHO?

219
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,833
WOW!  AMAZING!

220
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,583
WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S SO COOL.

221
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,625
I'VE NEVER SEEN A LONG BOARD
LIKE IT.  IS IT REALLY YOURS?

222
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,083
- YEAH, I'LL LEND IT TO YOU.
- YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

223
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,333
- BUT YOU CAN'T GO ON IT
BY YOURSELF.

224
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,625
I WANT YOU AND EUREKA TO RIDE
THIS BOARD TOGETHER.

225
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,458
USE YOUR FEELINGS FOR HER
TO REACH OUT

226
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,625
AND PUT HER GRIEVING MIND
AT EASE.

227
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,958
- I JUST HAVE NO IDEA HOW
TO EVEN BRING IT UP TO HER.

228
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,625
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIGURE THAT OUT FOR YOURSELF.

229
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:07,041
- HEY, WHAT WAS THAT FOR?
- NOW LISTEN UP, RENTON.

230
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,625
LOVING SOMEONE FROM AFAR
IS A BIG LIE.

231
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,958
IF YOU REALLY LOVE HER, THEN YOU
HAVE TO SHOW HER HOW YOU FEEL.

232
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,625
ALL RIGHT, RENTON,
GO GET HER!

233
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,458
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

234
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,666
DID YOU TELL THAT LIE
FOR ME AND EUREKA?

235
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,208
- DON'T BE SO CONCEITED.

236
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,833
SEE YOU LATER.

237
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,208
NOW I THINK I'LL JUST GO DEAL
WITH A BIG BABY OF MY OWN.

238
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,166
- WILL I BE ALL RIGHT?

239
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,166
I'VE NEVER RIDDEN ANYTHING OTHER

240
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,708
THAN SHORT BOARDS BEFORE.

241
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,583
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

242
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,666
- WHAT THE HELL DOES IT LOOK
LIKE WE'RE DOING?

243
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,500
WE'RE GOING LIFTING.
- YES, I CAN SEE THAT MUCH.

244
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,833
I'M ASKING HOW YOU GUYS CAN
BE SO AT EASE ABOUT EVERYTHING.

245
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,166
SONIA, MAYBE YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ENOUGH CALCIUM IN YOUR DIET.

246
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,291
- YOU'RE AS BAD AS THEY ARE. HOW
CAN YOU JUST SUNBATHE SO CALMLY?

247
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,916
- RELAX.  I JUST HAPPEN TO BE
SITTING HERE READING MY REPORTS

248
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,625
WHILE GETTING A LITTLE
FRESH AIR.

249
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,625
YOU SEE?

250
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,625
- WELL, WE'LL BE GOING NOW.

251
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:14,500
- HEY, WAIT!
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

252
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,708
- SO WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING TO DO FROM HERE ON?

253
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,708
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOW FOR YOU
TO CONTACT THEM MERELY

254
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,708
BY WAITING FOR THE CORALIAN
TO REAPPEAR, RIGHT?

255
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,708
AND YOU FINALLY HAVE YOUR TRUMP
CARD, EUREKA AND RENTON.

256
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,375
YET, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO GET CLOSE TO THEM

257
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,708
WITH THE ANTIBODY CORALIANS
AROUND.

258
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:34,208
FURTHERMORE, THE ANTIBODIES
AND THE DESTRUCTIVE WEAPON

259
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,458
OF THE MILITARY--
- THERE IS A WAY.

260
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,916
I'M OUT OF TIME,
BUT THERE IS A WAY.

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,458
IF RENTON AND EUREKA CAN
CONTACT MASTER NORB.

262
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,541
- THERE YOU ARE.

263
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,000
JEEZ, WHERE DID YOU
WALK OFF TO?

264
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,958
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

265
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,958
- TALHO.

266
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,958
- ( screaming )

267
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,291
- ( laughs )
- WHOA!

268
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,291
- Renton: EUREKA.

269
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,750
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY TO YOU,

270
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,291
BUT IF YOU FEEL EVEN
THE SLIGHTEST BIT AT EASE

271
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,708
BY MY BEING HERE AND IT HELPS
YOU SORT THINGS OUT,

272
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,791
THEN I THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT.

273
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,958
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CRUEL THINGS

274
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,708
ARE AWAITING US IN THE FUTURE,

275
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,750
BUT THIS IS ABOUT ALL
I CAN DO FOR YOU

276
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,750
RIGHT NOW, EUREKA.

277
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,166
SO IF YOU'RE UP TO IT,

278
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,333
WILL YOU COME OUTSIDE WITH ME?

279
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,791
- YOU DON'T THINK
I'M TOO TROUBLESOME?

280
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,208
YOU DON'T THINK THAT I'M SOME
KIND OF NUISANCE, DO YOU?

281
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:43,208
- NO, EUREKA.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

282
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,708
THERE'S NO WAY THAT I'D
EVER BE THINKING THAT.

283
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,208
LOOK, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
TRUST ME, OKAY?

284
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,375
- RENTON, I CAN TRUST YOU?

285
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,208
- OF COURSE.

286
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,208
- Woman:
I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.

287
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,208
AT THIS POINT IN TIME,

288
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,416
EUREKA'S VALUE
AS A CORALIAN IS ON THE RISE.

289
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,541
I JUST WONDER IF IT'S
BECAUSE OF THOSE THINGS

290
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,250
CALLED THE ANTIBODIES?
OR IS IT--

291
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:11,250
MY LITTLE CUB.  HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU READING SO SERIOUSLY?

292
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,250
- I REALLY WISH YOU WOULD STOP
CALLING ME THAT STUPID NAME.

293
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,250
SO HAVE YOU BEEN
SPEAKING WITH HOLLAND?

294
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,250
- OH, WELL, I THOUGHT
ABOUT TALKING TO HIM,

295
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,000
BUT THOSE TWO SEEMED TO BE
IN A GOOD MOOD,

296
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,250
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST
NOT TO INTERRUPT THEM.

297
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,708
- YOU LANDED US HERE ON PURPOSE,
DIDN'T YOU?

298
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,708
- LATELY, YOU'VE LOOKED SO DOWN

299
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,250
AND IN PAIN ALL THE TIME.

300
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,916
GO LIFTING.
IT'LL DOUBLE AS YOUR REHAB.

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,250
YOU WANT TO, RIGHT?

302
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,250
- OF COURSE I DO,
BUT WHEN I THINK

303
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,833
THAT THIS WILL BE
MY LAST LIFT.

304
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,250
- ( gasps ) YOUR WHAT?

305
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,333
- I WON'T HAVE
ANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES

306
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,291
TO LIFT AFTER THIS.

307
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,458
THIS IS MY LAST RIDE.

308
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:56,125
I WANT YOU
TO WATCH ME GET THROUGH IT.

309
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,875
OKAY, TALHO?

310
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,041
HOLLAND.

311
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,291
- HEY, STONER.
- YEAH.

312
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,125
- OUR LEADER'S LIFTING STRAIGHT
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE.

313
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,125
SHOULDN'T YOU TAKE PICTURES
OF IT?

314
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,083
- I WOULDN'T MIND TAKING
PICTURES OF IT,

315
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,416
BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT RECORDING
A MAN TOUTED AS A GENIUS

316
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,041
LOOKING LIKE THAT
- IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

317
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,291
AFTER A CRITICAL INJURY
LIKE HIS,

318
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,083
IT'S A MIRACLE
HE CAN LIFT AT ALL.

319
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,083
- ( grunting )

320
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,083
- HOLLAND, PLEASE!

321
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,375
THAT'S ENOUGH ALREADY.

322
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,083
PLEASE, STOP IT NOW.

323
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,750
PLEASE, HOLLAND.
YOU GOTTA STOP THIS!

324
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,083
- SHUT UP!
- I UNDERSTAND YOU.

325
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,791
I UNDERSTAND YOU,
SO PLEASE STOP IT, HOLLAND.

326
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:46,291
HOLLAND.  HOLLAND.

327
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,291
GET UP, HOLLAND.
SPEAK TO ME.

328
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,291
- I'M SO PATHETIC, TALHO.

329
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,291
I'M PATHETIC, AREN'T I?

330
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,750
I'M SORRY.

331
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,291
THE ONLY THING I HAD ANY TALENT
FOR WAS LIFTING.

332
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,291
- BUT YOU STILL LIKE IT,
DON'T YOU?

333
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,916
YEAH, I LOVE LIFTING,

334
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,916
AND THIS PLANET
THAT LETS ME LIFT.

335
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,791
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T FORGIVE
THE EXISTENCE OF BEINGS

336
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,250
THAT WANT TO DESTROY IT.

337
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,250
TALHO, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
FROM NOW ON,

338
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,791
I WANT TO PROTECT THIS PLANET
THAT I MET YOU ON.

339
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:26,333
AND YOU, FOR LOVING ME
DESPITE BEING SO PATHETIC.

340
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,958
- IDIOT! ( crying )

341
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:33,916
YOU'RE MAKING ALL MY MAKEUP
RUN OFF OF MY FACE.

342
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,416
- HOLLAND, WHAT?

343
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,666
- SORRY, BUT CAN I BORROW
THIS FOR A WHILE?

344
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,166
JUST FOR A WHILE.
COME ON.  OH.

345
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,875
- OH, IT'S OUR LONG BOARD.

346
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,333
I LENT IT TO RENTON
AND EUREKA.

347
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,333
- I HOPE THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A
GOOD MEMORY FOR THE TWO OF THEM.

348
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,541
- JUST LIKE IT WAS FOR US.

349
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,000
- UNTIL NOW
I'VE BEEN LIVING MY LIFE

350
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,250
BY USING ALL SORTS
OF THINGS.

351
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,625
TO SURVIVE, I'VE USED LIFTING
AND THE ENTIRE COUNTERCULTURE

352
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,541
SURROUNDING IT.

353
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,916
WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE WAS THAT
I HURTING THEM

354
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,791
EVERY TIME I USED THEM.

355
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,250
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

356
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,375
SAYING I WAS PROTECTING
SOMETHING IMPORTANT

357
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,250
I ALSO HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE,

358
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,250
LIKE EUREKA AND RENTON.

359
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,250
I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID TO YOU TWO.

360
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,250
FORGIVE ME.
- HOLLAND.

361
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,583
- BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT I CAME HERE TO SAY.

362
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,083
AS OF THIS MOMENT,
THE GEKKOSTATE IS DISBANDING.

363
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,291
- ( all gasp )

364
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,125
- WHAT'S WITH THIS
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

365
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,875
- WE KNOW WHERE MASTER NORB IS.
- WHAT?

366
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,125
- ONE OF THE ASSISTANTS

367
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,375
FROM MY INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT
DAYS FOUND HIM.

368
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,375
APPARENTLY, MASTER NORB HAS
APPEARED ALONE IN THE CAPITOL

369
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,291
SEEKING AUDIENCE
WITH THE THREE SAGES.

370
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,375
- THE CAPITOL?
- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

371
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,916
NORB WHO HAS BEEN IN COMPLETE
HIDING FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS

372
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,916
SHOWED UP IN THE ENEMY
HEADQUARTERS OF ALL PLACES,

373
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,750
WHICH MEANS HE'S RESIGNED
HIMSELF TO THE SITUATION.

374
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,291
THE THING IS WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE HIM RIGHT NOW.

375
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,708
LOSING HIM MEANS
LOSING THE POSSIBILITY

376
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,291
OF HUMANS AND CORALIANS
COEXISTING ON THIS PLANET,

377
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:20,166
LIKE WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE
IN FRONT OF OUR EYES.

378
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,333
I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE CAPITOL
TO RESCUE MASTER NORB.

379
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,333
I PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT OUT
IN ONE PIECE.

380
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,958
I'VE DECIDED TO DO THIS
FOR MY OWN PERSONAL REASONS

381
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,333
AND NOTHING ELSE.

382
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,333
I CAN'T FORCE ANY OF YOU
TO FOLLOW ME.

383
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,333
THOSE THAT WANT TO GET OFF
THIS SHIP SHOULD GET OFF

384
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,333
OR STAY IF YOU WISH.

385
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,916
NO MATTER WHICH CHOICE YOU MAKE,

386
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,250
I WILL HONOR IT
AS YOUR DECISION.

387
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,750
THAT'S THE LAST ORDER I GIVE YOU

388
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,291
AS THE LEADER OF GEKKOSTATE.

389
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,291
THAT'S ALL.  DISBAND.

390
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,291
- Ken-goh: IT'S BEEN
THREE YEARS, HASN'T IT?

391
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,041
- SINCE WHAT?

392
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,208
- SINCE YOU TOOK CONTROL
OF THE GEKKO

393
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,791
AND ESCAPED OUT OF THE MILITARY.

394
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,333
COME TO THINK OF IT, IT WAS JUST
THE THREE OF US BACK THEN.

395
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,333
RIGHT, TALHO?
- YEAH.

396
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,291
I KNOW IT'S TRUE THAT
WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME LEFT,

397
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,333
BUT WE CAN JUST START OVER
FROM SQUARE ONE.

398
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,333
- THANKS, TALHO.

399
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,458
- Woz: I THINK THAT'S
THE FIRST TIME

400
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,333
I'VE EVER HEARD
YOU SAY THAT WORD.

401
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,958
JEEZ, YOU AND I HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER

402
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,625
SINCE WE WERE THREE YEARS OLD.

403
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:29,125
I HOPE YOU SAY THAT TO ME
ONCE BEFORE I DIE.

404
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,458
- I WILL.

405
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,125
- LEADER, YOU'VE GOT
A MESSAGE FROM STONER.

406
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,791
HE'S DEVELOPING FILM RIGHT NOW,

407
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,125
SO HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES.

408
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:41,083
- OKAY, GIDGET.
- ENGINE ROOM HERE.

409
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,666
ENGINES ARE GOOD.  ALL SYSTEMS
SHOW NO MALFUNCTIONS.

410
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,333
WE CAN GO ANY TIME.
- THIS IS CATAPULT CONTROL.

411
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,333
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE 606
ON THE TURNTABLE.

412
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,583
THE 606 IS FORMALLY REQUESTING
CLEARANCE FROM THE BRIDGE

413
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,333
TO RELEASE THE CATAPULT
FOR A SCOUTING MISSION.

414
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,500
- THIS IS THE 606.

415
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,500
LEADER, YOU KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA NEED AN LFO

416
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,916
IN THE AIR FOR WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW.

417
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,333
RIGHT, MATTHIEU?
- THAT'S RIGHT, LEADER.

418
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,916
- I'M NOT SEEING ANY ENEMY
BOGIES ON THE RADAR.

419
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,416
THE CENTRAL COMPUTER IS BACK UP
AND RUNNING,

420
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,333
JUST LIKE OUR LEADER.
- YOU GUYS, GEKKOSTATE IS--

421
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,916
- Renton: WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET YOU DISBAND US.

422
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,375
WE ALL TALKED IT OUT.
LET'S FACE IT, HOLLAND.

423
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,458
ALL OF US CAN SEE THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW

424
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,750
IS NOTHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT
WE'VE BEEN TRYING ALL ALONG.

425
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,375
AND THAT IS WHAT THE GEKKOSTATE
IS ALL ABOUT.

426
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,375
- RENTON.

427
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,833
- NOW, LEADER,

428
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,375
HURRY UP WITH YOUR ORDERS.

429
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,208
EVERYONE HERE IS WAITING
FOR YOU TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO.

430
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:50,000
- ALL HANDS, THE GEKKO'S MISSION
NOW IS TO INVADE THE CAPITOL.

431
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,000
OPERATIONAL DETAILS
WILL FOLLOW,

432
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,000
BUT FOR NOW,
LET'S CHANGE COURSE.

433
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,000
HEAD FOR THE POINT WHERE WE CAN
PERFORM TRAJECTORY FLIGHT.

434
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,291
GOT THAT?
- All: ROGER!

435
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,500
- ( grunts ) HEY, COME ON,

436
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,250
WASN'T ANYBODY LISTENING
TO MY REQUEST?

437
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,375
I GUESS THIS TIME
I'LL LET IT GO.

438
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,833
CONSIDERING I'VE JUST FINISHED
CREATING THE BEST PIECE

439
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,166
OF MY LIFE.

440
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,375
THE TITLE FOR THIS ONE IS,

441
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,916
HMM, LET'S SEE.

442
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,333
HOW ABOUT...

443
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,875
SOMETHING LIKE "PACIFIC STATE"?

444
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,875
- Renton and Eureka:
TO BE CONTINUED.

445
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:30,250
- ( theme music playing )

446
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:39,833
- ♪ WHY, SO WHY... ♪
- ( singing in Japanese )

447
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,458
- ♪ WHY, SO WHY... ♪
- ( singing in Japanese )

448
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,875
- Woman: SEEKING THE KEY
FOR THE DOOR TO THE FUTURE,

449
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,708
THE ADULTS HAVE GONE
ON THE MOVE.

450
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,958
THE STORY CONTINUING ON FROM THE
PAST IS HANDED DOWN TO THE BOY.

451
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,958
NEXT EPISODE-- "INNER FLIGHT."
