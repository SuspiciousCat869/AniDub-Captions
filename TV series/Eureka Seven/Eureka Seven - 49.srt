1
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:20,583
- ( theme music playing )
- ( vocalizing )

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,791
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,791
- Woman: HONEY, YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH STATS AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

4
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,166
- Man:
SORRY, IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

5
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,041
HOW MUCH MONEY DO
YOU THINK IT COSTS

6
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,166
FOR TREATMENT OF THE
DESPERATION DISEASE?

7
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,333
- BUT--
- IT'S SO THAT WE CAN CURE

8
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:11,541
HER ILLNESS.
TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

9
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,541
- I ALWAYS KNEW.
- ( both parents gasp )

10
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,916
- I KNEW ALL ALONG,
MOMMA AND POPPA,

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,208
THAT BOTH OF YOU WORRIED
ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME.

12
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,875
BUT, THE BUS IS ABOUT
TO ARRIVE.

13
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,166
- JESSICA!

14
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,916
- ( gasps )
LOOK OVER THERE!

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,875
- Parents:
HUH?  AAH!

16
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,375
- ( explosions )

17
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,625
- ARE THOSE SHOOTING STARS?

18
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,916
DEAR GOD!

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,166
- THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME.
- ( parents gasp )

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,291
BUT WE'LL BE TOGETHER
FOREVER NOW.

21
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,541
POPPA, MOMMA...
I LOVE YOU!

22
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,625
- WHAT IS THIS?

23
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,250
WHAT-- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

24
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,791
( giggling )

25
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,750
- A FALLEN DEBRIS
TARGETED THE TOWERS?

26
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:25,750
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

27
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,583
- NO IMPOSSIBILITIES
ABOUT IT.

28
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,083
I'LL SEND YOU
THE DATA RIGHT NOW.

29
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,083
TAKE A LOOK!

30
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,958
OF 157 TOWERS
LEFT STANDING,

31
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,916
31 WERE DESTROYED BY DIRECT
IMPACT OF THE DEBRIS.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,791
- ( gasps )
- BUT THAT'S--

33
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,041
A THING LIKE THAT
CAN'T POSSIBLY HAPPEN.

34
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,291
- NO!  I THING THEY'RE RIGHT!
- ( both gasp )

35
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,208
- I COMPARED THE VALUES
WITH CALCULATIONS

36
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,375
FROM THE CENTRAL SYSTEM.
RIGHT WHEN THEY ENTERED

37
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,791
THE TRAPAR LAYER
ALL THE DEBRIS RADICALLY CHANGED

38
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,291
THEIR TRAJECTORY ANGLES.

39
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,333
IF DR. BEAR'S HYPOTHESES
ARE CORRECT,

40
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,416
THE SCUB CORALS
CAN SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE

41
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,416
THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
BY FORCE OF WILL.

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE--

43
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,833
ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL OF THIS
WAS CAUSED BY THE SCUB CORALS?

44
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,000
- I HAVE ONE MORE
BIT OF BAD NEWS.

45
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,333
- WHAT?

46
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:09,208
- A HOLE'S BEEN CREATED
IN THE TENSION MOUNTAINS.

47
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,000
- Woman: THIS IS FOOTAGE
OBTAINED BY HACKING

48
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,833
INTO THE MILITARY
OBSERVATION SATELLITE

49
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,583
"HUMMINGBIRD."
THE TENSION MOUNTAIN RANGE

50
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,375
HAS HAD A CAVE-IN
100 KILOMETERS IN DIAMETER.

51
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,875
WE FOUND A SPACE BENEATH
THE CAVE-IN

52
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,000
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ANALYZE.

53
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,166
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SPACE
HAS SOMETHING TO DO

54
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,291
WITH THE MICROWAVE WEAPONRY
THAT IS CURRENTLY

55
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,666
RAINING DOWN AS DEBRIS.

56
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,291
- THERE YOU HAVE IT.
YOU WANNA TELL ME

57
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,166
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON, HOLLAND?!

58
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,958
- DAMMIT!

59
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,541
DEWEY-- THIS IS PART
OF HIS PLAN.

60
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,041
HE TOOK OUT RENTON'S GROUP
ALONG WITH THE CENTRAL CORE

61
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,541
OF THE SCUB CORALS.
- Talho: THAT HASN'T BEEN

62
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,250
DETERMINED YET.
- ( both gasp )

63
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,875
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP HOPE.

64
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,875
EVEN WITH A SITUATION
AS BAD AS THIS,

65
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,625
WE CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY!

66
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,333
CAN'T.

67
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,833
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

68
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,625
- ALL RIGHT, CONTACT THE CREW
ABOARD THE IZUMO.

69
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,250
TELL THEM TO GET READY!

70
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,583
ON MY ORDER WE WILL ATTEMPT
TO DIVE DIRECTLY

71
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,333
INTO THE TENSION MOUNTAINS.

72
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,583
- All: ROGER THAT!

73
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,958
- WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
NOW, MOMMA?

74
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,541
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE PEOPLE?

75
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,500
- THE WORLD IS COMING
TO AN END, ISN'T IT?

76
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,083
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.

77
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,875
DON'T WORRY, IT'S ALL
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

78
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,125
- I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- HUH?

79
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,916
- I-- I SAID THAT I WOULD
PROTECT THE CONTROL CLUSTER.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,250
MY DAD!  AND MY SISTER!

81
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,583
( crying )

82
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,333
- RENTON, DON'T CRY.

83
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,041
- YEAH, PLEASE, DON'T CRY.

84
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,000
- YEAH, IF YOU CRY
EVERYONE WILL BE SAD.

85
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,500
- THANKS.
THANKS ALL OF YOU.

86
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,208
- ( sniffling )

87
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,583
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, EUREKA?

88
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,583
ARE-- ARE YOU HOLDING UP
ALL RIGHT PHYSICALLY?

89
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,375
- PHYSICALLY?

90
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,583
WELL, I--

91
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,041
- SO NOTHING'S WRONG
WITH YOU, EUREKA?

92
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,666
- MM-MM.

93
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,625
- WHAT ABOUT
THE NIRVASH?

94
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,000
IS THE NIRVASH
SAYING ANYTHING?

95
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,625
- I DON'T KNOW.

96
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,916
OH, RENTON,
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,291
I CAN'T HEAR ANY
OF THEIR VOICES ANYMORE!

98
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,625
( crying )
- EUREKA!

99
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,416
- I CAN'T HEAR THEM!
I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING!

100
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,416
NOT NIRVASH'S VOICE,
NOT ANYTHING!

101
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,833
- CALM DOWN, WE HAVE TO HOLD
OURSELVES TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.

102
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,500
- MOMMA, RENTON--

103
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,458
THE COMPAC DRIVE IS
DOING SOMETHING.

104
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,375
- ( gurgling sound )

105
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,791
- Eureka:
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

106
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,916
- ( all screaming )

107
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,625
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

108
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,875
WAIT A MINUTE!

109
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,291
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, NIRVASH?

110
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,750
HEY, NIRVASH!

111
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,750
- Dewey: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE HAVE ARRIVED

112
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,375
AT THE FINAL PHASE
OF THE BATTLE

113
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,416
FOR THE SURVIVAL
OF ALL MANKIND.

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS
MY GRATITUDE

115
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,125
FOR ALL OF YOUR
OUTSTANDING WORK

116
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,000
AND THE COURAGE
OF YOUR CONVICTIONS.

117
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,333
THANK YOU ALL.

118
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:09,166
NOW THE REAL BATTLE
IS JUST ABOUT TO BEGIN.

119
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,000
THOUGH WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE CENTRAL CORE

120
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,833
OF THE CORALIANS,
ENEMIES AGAINST MANKIND,

121
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,916
IT WAS MERELY THE DESTRUCTION
OF THEIR CONTROL HEADQUARTERS.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,041
NOW THAT THEY HAVE LOST
ALL ORDER,

123
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,375
THEY WILL BEGIN TO ATTACK
INDISCRIMINATELY

124
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,000
ACROSS THE LAND.

125
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:29,208
HOWEVER, 1246 SECONDS--

126
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,916
THAT IS THE MAXIMUM TIME
THAT THE ANTIBODY CORALIANS

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,875
CAN REMAIN ALIVE.

128
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,708
NOW THE FLAGSHIP
OF THE GINGA FLEET

129
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,666
WILL INVADE DEEP
INTO THE CORALIAN LAND

130
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,291
TO CONFRONT OUR FATE.

131
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,083
YOU ALL MUST WITHSTAND
THE 1246 SECONDS

132
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,041
THAT WILL ENSUE.
THE FATE OF ALL MANKIND

133
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,291
RESTS ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

134
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,583
THAT IS ALL.

135
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,000
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- Holland: YEAH.

136
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,166
THOUGH IT WAS A VOICE
I DIDN'T WANNA HEAR.

137
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,541
- ( chuckling )
- BUT THIS PUTS EVERYTHING

138
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,458
INTO FOCUS.  THE FLAG SHIP
IS DIVING INTO THE GAP ALONE.

139
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,875
- YEAH.
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THERE

140
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,916
THEY REALLY DON'T WANT
OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,041
- IN OTHER WORDS... NIRVASH
IS STILL UP AND RUNNING!

142
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,708
- HUH?

143
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,541
- BUT WHAT CAN WE DO
ABOUT IT?

144
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,750
- IN FRONT OF US,
DIRECTLY IN OUR PATH,

145
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,666
13,000 SHIPS OF THE UNITED
FEDERATION FORCE ARE WAITING.

146
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,000
- YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT NOW.

147
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,416
SO WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO IMPROVISE.

148
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,250
TRY TO MAKE A MIRACLE.

149
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,916
- I SEE.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,250
MIRACLE, HUH?
THAT'S A GOOD WORD.

151
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,416
AND I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK,
ASIDE FROM THAT MIRACLE.

152
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,375
- WHAT IS IT?

153
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,416
- I WANT THE GEKKO TO DIVE
INTO THE HOLE ALL BY ITSELF.

154
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,166
- ( gasps )
DAMN YOU!

155
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,125
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

156
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,541
- THERE'S NOT A CHANCE
IN A MILLION WE'LL WIN THIS.

157
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,750
- WHAT?
- UNLESS WE STAY BEHIND

158
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,083
AND ACT AS YOUR SHIELD.

159
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,625
DON'T WORRY, THE FIREPOWER
OF THE SUPER IZUMO

160
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,458
IS FIVE TIMES
THAT OF THE GEKKO.

161
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,791
IT WILL TAKE A LOT
TO BRING HER DOWN.

162
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,833
SO... DOMINIC AND ANEMONE
ARE IN YOUR HANDS.

163
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,375
- JURGENS, I--

164
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,750
- THE TWO OF THEM
ARE OUR COMRADES.

165
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,166
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING
TO CUT A PATH THROUGH DANGER

166
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,000
FOR OUR COMRADES.
- HA, YOU'RE JUST A SHOW-OFF.

167
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,791
IF YOU DIE OUT THERE,
I'LL KILL YOU.

168
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,833
- Renton: WE STOPPED.

169
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,125
BUT... WHY DID NIRVASH
STOP HERE?

170
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,333
- Eureka: HE'S CRYING.

171
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,833
HE'S... IN TEARS.

172
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,333
NIRVASH IS BEARING
EVERYONE'S PAIN.

173
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,625
AND THEIR WORDS OF PAIN
AND HE'S CRYING.

174
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,500
HE THOUGHT THAT HE'D BE ABLE
TO FULFILL THE MISSION.

175
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,625
BUT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH POWER,

176
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,333
HE MADE EVERYONE DISAPPEAR.

177
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,791
AND THAT'S WHY HE HAS
TO TAKE THEIR PLACE.

178
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,125
WHAT A KIND CHILD.
- Renton: THAT'S NOT TRUE.

179
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,375
- RENTON?
- IT'S NOT BECAUSE

180
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,583
THE NIRVASH WAS POWERLESS.
IT'S FRUSTRATING,

181
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,208
BUT IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF ALL OF US.

182
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,291
AND SO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
SAD THINGS LIKE THAT,

183
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,750
OKAY, NIRVASH?

184
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,708
- RENTON.
- MOMMA...

185
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:08,916
- WHAT IS IT?

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,291
- A MOUNTAIN IS FALLING DOWN
FROM THE SKY.

187
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,791
- ( gasps )
RENTON!

188
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,708
THE SKY!  LOOK AT IT!

189
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,666
- ( gasps )

190
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,625
WHAT IS THAT?

191
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,583
- Woman: CONFIRMED TypeZERO
AT THE EXPECTED LOCATION.

192
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,666
IT SEEMS TO HAVE SUFFERED
SOME DAMAGE,

193
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,375
BUT I BELIEVE THERE'LL BE
NO PROBLEMS

194
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,208
WITH CARRYING OUT YOUR PLAN.

195
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,791
- I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME
FOR THIS MOMENT.

196
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,083
SO, LET'S BEGIN.

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,875
- ( screaming )

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,375
- DOMINIC...
- THE COLONEL

199
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,958
IS A REAL BASTARD.

200
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,625
ANEMONE?

201
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,583
- ( alarm buzzing )

202
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,041
- EARLY WARNING ALARM
IS ACTIVATED!

203
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,125
ONE UNKNOWN SHIP
IS APPROACHING FAST

204
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,250
FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE US.

205
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,708
- THERE CAN'T BE.

206
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,500
- ANTI-AIR UNIT, DEPLOY!

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,083
- ( grunts )

208
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,250
WAIT!  ISN'T THAT... ?

209
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,750
THESE BASTARDS ARE--
- Eureka: RENTON!

210
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,125
LOOK!  THERE!

211
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,875
- HUH?

212
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,833
THAT'S... THE GEKKO!

213
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,875
- IT'S THE TB303 "DEVILFISH."

214
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,125
I SEE.
IT'S YOU, YET AGAIN!

215
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,916
HOLLAND!

216
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,541
- THE ANTIBODY CORALIANS
APPEARED AS IF THEY WERE

217
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,750
TIMING IT TO THE GINGA
PLUNGING INTO THE GROUND.

218
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,791
IT WAS A GOOD THING
WE WERE ABLE TO SEE

219
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,625
THE GEKKO OFF
IN THE CONFUSION.

220
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,833
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

221
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,708
- WELL, IT ALMOST SEEMS
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

222
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,791
I MEAN, THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE STANDING HERE ALIVE

223
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,625
LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE
THE ENTIRE ARMY

224
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,666
IS BUSY BATTLING
THE ANTIBODIES.

225
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,916
HOWEVER, IF THIS
SITUATION WAS

226
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,833
SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN PLANNED
IN ADVANCE BY SOMEONE, THEN--

227
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,416
- Man: CAPTAIN!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

228
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,708
- AN EMERGENCY CALL
FROM A CIVILIAN SHIP.

229
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,791
- IN A COMBAT SITUATION?
WHO IS IT?

230
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,000
- WAIT, THIS IS--

231
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,000
- THIS IS THE APECUMA,
A HIGH-SPEED SHIP

232
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,541
FROM THE TRESOR LABORATORIES.

233
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,750
I HAVE PRESSING INFORMATION
THAT NEEDS TO BE RELAYED

234
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,083
TO THE GEKKO.

235
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,333
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE
THE SHIP HAS GONE.

236
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,875
- I SEE.

237
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,375
SO THIS IS WHAT YOU GUYS
DECIDED?

238
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,666
- YEAH.
- Renton: BUT HOLLAND,

239
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,541
RIGHT NOW, UP ABOVE--
- DON'T WORRY.

240
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,625
WE HAVEN'T REACH
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS.

241
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,541
ARE YOU GUYS SURE ABOUT THIS?

242
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,833
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

243
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,541
I'M SURE THE FIVE
OF US CAN DO IT.

244
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,458
- YEAH, AND BESIDES,
WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE

245
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,500
NIRVASH HERE ALL ALONE.

246
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,708
- JEEZ, IT'S SO SOON.

247
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,958
YOU ALREADY
HAVE A GOOD FAMILY.

248
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,625
DID YOU HEAR THAT, TALHO?

249
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,541
COVER ME!  I'M GOING IN
ON THE 303.

250
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,333
AND I'M GONNA
TAKE OVER THEIR BRIDGE!

251
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,708
- WAIT A MINUTE, HOLLAND.
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID!

252
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,333
- TALHO, PLEASE,

253
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,583
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN STOP MY BROTHER

254
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,458
AND YOU KNOW IT.

255
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,416
- PREPARE TO LAUNCH
MAIN CANNONS.

256
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,583
- Man:
PREPARING MAIN CANNONS.

257
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,291
CORRECTING MARGIN OF ERROR
TO THREE DEGREES.

258
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,583
FIRE THEM ALL!

259
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,083
- A BARRIER?

260
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,291
- IT'S THE ARMY'S NEWEST
UNMANNED WEAPON.

261
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,583
- AS LONG AS THEY HAVE
THAT THING, RAISED ATTACKS

262
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,458
ARE PRETTY MUCH USELESS.

263
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,541
- SO IT'S JUST
AS HOLLAND SAID.

264
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,083
- GIVE UP, HOLLAND.
NOT MATTER HOW MUCH

265
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,000
YOU FIGHT BACK,
IT'S STILL TOO LATE.

266
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,250
BUT IF YOU NEED
TO HAVE A FINAL SCORE...

267
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,208
I WILL LET YOU HAVE IT!

268
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,666
- HUH!

269
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,125
- HUH!

270
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,625
YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME
THE CONTROL CLUSTER

271
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,958
WITH THE NIRVASH?

272
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,166
- SORRY, IT'S WHAT
WE ALL DECIDED.

273
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,958
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?

274
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,666
- I SAW MY SISTER, HOLLAND.

275
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,916
IN THE CONTROL CLUSTER.

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I SAW SIS, AND DAD TOO.

277
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,250
AND WHILE I WAS THERE,
I LEARNED

278
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,541
THAT AS LONG AS
THE CONTROL CLUSTER EXISTS,

279
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,500
THE SCUB CORALS
WILL NOT AWAKEN.

280
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,666
IF THE HUMANS WILL CEASE
THEIR ATTACKS,

281
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,458
THE SCUB CORALS
WON'T ATTACK EITHER.

282
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,875
WE'RE GONNA GO BACK
AND TALK TO THE SCUB CORALS

283
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,458
ONE MORE TIME.

284
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,125
WE HOPE TO GET ADVICE
ON FINDING A WAY

285
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,416
THAT EVERYONE CAN LIVE
ON THIS PLANET TOGETHER.

286
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,333
THERE IS THE CHANCE

287
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,625
THAT WE WON'T MAKE IT BACK
HERE EVER AGAIN.

288
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,416
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.

289
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,750
INSIDE THE SCUB CORALS,
HUMANS CAN ACTUALLY EXIST.

290
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,500
BESIDES, IT'S NOT LIKE
ANY OF US ARE GONNA HAVE TO GO

291
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,666
THERE ALL ALONE.

292
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,833
- FORCING KIDS INTO
DECISIONS LIKE THAT,

293
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,541
AND EUREKA CHANGING HER SHAPE
INTO SOMETHING STRANGE...

294
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:56,041
IS THIS... WHAT ADULTS
SHOULD BE DOING?

295
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,166
( yelling )
DEWEY!

296
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,791
( yelling )

297
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,625
- ( alarm blaring )

298
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,041
- MULTIPLE LEVEL TWO ALERTS!

299
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,333
DAMAGES UNKNOWN.

300
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,166
- NO ANSWER
FROM THE CENTRAL COMPUTER.

301
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,375
- BRIDGE NUMBER THREE'S BEEN
DESTROYED AND IT'S ON FIRE.

302
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,208
- WE'RE UNABLE TO SHIFT
FLIGHT SYSTEMS.

303
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,416
- THAT WASN'T JUST A RANDOM
BLITZ HE PULLED OFF.

304
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,416
WOW!  THAT'S HIS TRAINING.

305
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,750
JUST WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT

306
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,875
FROM COLONEL DEWEY'S
YOUNGER BROTHER.

307
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,875
- ( blaring continues )

308
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,041
- THE BATTLESHIP IS GETTING
FURTHER AWAY.

309
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,250
- Renton: IT'S HOLLAND.

310
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,916
HE'S HELPING US.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,458
EUREKA!

312
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,875
- LET'S BEGIN.

313
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,458
- All: RIGHT.
NOW LET'S GO.

314
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,166
NIRVASH!

315
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,125
- THERE'S A SUDDEN INCREASE

316
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,708
IN TRAPAR LEVEL RESPONSES.

317
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,625
- WHAT?
- COULD IT BE THE typeZERO?

318
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,333
- CALM DOWN, EVERYONE.

319
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,916
ALL CREW, ABANDON SHIP.

320
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,166
- ( all gasping )

321
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
COLONEL, ARE YOU GOING

322
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,458
TO ABANDON US?
- NO, I'M NOT.

323
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,333
ALL RIGHT, PLEASE
LISTEN CAREFULLY

324
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,458
TO WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY.

325
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,291
- CONFIRM THE EJECTION
OF NUMEROUS ESCAPE PODS

326
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,583
FROM THE GINGA.

327
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,958
- THE GINGA HAS COMPLETELY
CEASED ALL ATTACKS.

328
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,458
- ANY CONTACT FROM HOLLAND?

329
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:43,125
- THE JAMMING IS SO BAD
I CAN'T FIND HIS SIGNAL.

330
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,250
- HOLLAND,
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE, RIGHT?

331
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,416
- EMPTY?

332
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,666
- ( shouting )

333
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,666
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

334
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,166
YOU'RE LOOKING QUITE WELL.

335
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,666
- HMM, I'M NOT READY TO LOSE
TO A BUNCH OF KIDS JUST YET.

336
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,666
- OLD MEN SHOULD KNOW
THEIR LIMITS!

337
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,250
- YOU MEAN THIS STUPID
SWORD IS FAKE TOO?!

338
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,291
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW OR CARE

339
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,791
WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE
DOING RIGHT NOW?!

340
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,791
- I AM JUST TRYING TO
PROTECT HUMAN DIGNITY!

341
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,541
- YOU'RE DESTROYING THE EARTH.

342
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,500
HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT
HUMAN DIGNITY?!

343
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,416
( gasps )

344
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,333
WHAT THE HELL?
WHERE IS HE?

345
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,958
- ( grunts )
- ( groans )

346
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,791
- I PHRASED THAT WRONG.
- WHAT?

347
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,958
- I AM TRYING TO ATONE
FOR OUR MANY SINS.

348
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,541
BY MY ATONEMENT, WE PROTECT
THE DIGNITY OF MANKIND,

349
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,750
AS WELL AS THE SOLEMN DIGNITY
OF THIS ENTIRE PLANET.

350
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,583
WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

351
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,125
- THE MAN WHO CLIMBED
HIS WAY UP TO

352
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,541
THE HIGHEST OFFICE
IN THE ARMY...

353
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,541
ISN'T MEASURING UP AT ALL!

354
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,666
- 10,000 YEARS AGO,

355
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,625
THE PEACE OF THIS PLANET WAS
SHATTERED BY THE SCUB CORALS.

356
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,791
INDIVIDUAL BODIES WERE LOST
AND HUMAN DIGNITY WAS DESTROYED

357
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,125
PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN.

358
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,458
WHAT REASON DOES THIS PLANET
HAVE TO LIVE ON

359
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,083
AFTER RECEIVING SUCH TREATMENT?

360
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,250
- HA!  IF YOU WANT TO
HURRY UP YOUR DEATH,

361
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,666
DO IT ALL BY YOURSELF!

362
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,666
- I'M SORRY, BUT I AM SOMEONE
WHO GETS RATHER LONELY.

363
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,750
- ( rumbling )
- ( gun cocks )

364
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,125
- ( Dewey screams )

365
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,916
- CONFIRM OUR STATUS.
- MISS TALHO!

366
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,250
- WHAT?
- WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY MESSAGE

367
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,083
FROM THE IZUMO.
- THE IZUMO?

368
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,791
- THIS IS JURGENS.

369
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,708
YOU MUST STOP
ATTACKING IMMEDIATELY.

370
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,541
- Talho: WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

371
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,791
WE JUST GAINED CONTROL
OF THEIR BRIDGE.

372
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,875
- WHAT?

373
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,208
THEN WHERE'S THE COLONEL?

374
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,041
COLONEL DEWEY IS--

375
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,791
- THIS WHOLE THING'S
JUST A BIG TRAP.

376
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,375
YOU CAN'T KILL DEWEY!

377
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,375
- DAMN.  TALHO REALLY
GETS RECKLESS SOMETIMES.

378
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,291
OH, MAN.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

379
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,916
SHE'S QUITE RECKLESS.

380
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,958
YOU SEE, I HAVE A SPECIAL
KARMA IMBEDDED WITHIN ME,

381
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,458
TO PURGE THIS RECKLESSLY
DISTORTED WORLD

382
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,625
AND PROTECT ITS DIGNITY.

383
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,291
OBSERVE...

384
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,625
MY KARMA!

385
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,291
- BROTHER!
YOU COULDN'T HAVE!

386
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,458
- BY DOING THIS,
I'VE BECOME ONE WITH THE WORLD.

387
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,833
AND WITH THIS SACRED PLANET,

388
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,666
MY LIFE IS THIS PLANET'S LIFE.

389
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,833
THE TWO OF US ARE ONE
AND THE SAME.

390
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,583
IF YOU WANT TO RESIST,
THEN GO AHEAD!

391
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,416
HOWEVER, I WILL DIE TOGETHER
WITH THE DIGNITY OF THE PLANET!

392
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,750
SO CRY ALL YOU WANT!

393
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,583
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF A BRAND-NEW EARTH.

394
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,916
- BROTHER, DON'T, NO!

395
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,541
- ( gunshot )

396
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,875
- COLONEL.

397
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,500
- NO!
- ( gasps )

398
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,000
ANEMONE!
HUH?

399
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,333
ANEMONE!
WHAT THE--?

400
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,333
- ( stammering )
DOMINIC...

401
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,000
( screams )
DOMINIC!

402
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,000
- HOLLAND, DON'T DO IT!

403
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,958
YOU CAN'T KILL HIM.

404
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,875
YOU CAN'T KILL
COLONEL DEWEY!

405
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,000
( gasps )

406
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,958
- IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ME
TO REALIZE IT.

407
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,291
I WASN'T ABLE TO SAVE
MY OWN BROTHER.

408
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,958
EVERYTHING I DID WAS
DONE TOO LATE.

409
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,291
- YES, EVERYTHING WAS
TOO LATE.

410
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,458
EVERY SINGLE THING WE DID
WE DID TOO LATE.

411
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,041
OH, HOLLAND.

412
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,166
- ( whirring )

413
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,000
- ( all scream )
- WHAT HAPPENED, NIRVASH?

414
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,750
WHAT'S WRONG?

415
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,708
- AH, MOMMA!  LOOK!

416
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:55,875
- ( gasps )

417
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,875
- ( groaning )

418
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,666
AAH!
- EUREKA!

419
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,708
- Kids:
MOMMA!

420
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,041
- NO!

421
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,875
BUT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

422
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,875
I'M BEGGING YOU, NIRVASH!

423
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,250
YOU HAVE TO SAVE EVERYONE!

424
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,250
- EUREKA, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?!  COME BACK!

425
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,875
- I'M SORRY.

426
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,875
( zapping )
I CAN'T--

427
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:21,250
I CAN'T KEEP MY PROMISE.
I'M SORRY, RENTON.

428
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,583
( weakly )
BYE-BYE.

429
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,333
( groaning )

430
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,333
- EUREKA!

431
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,375
EUREKA!

432
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,208
TO BE CONTINUED.

436
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,083
COMES TO AN END.
