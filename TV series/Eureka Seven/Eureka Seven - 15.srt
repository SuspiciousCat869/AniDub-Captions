SIS, DO YOU REMEMBER

11
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,958
THE CITY OF CONTRORADO?

12
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:01,500
IT'S A CITY THAT'S HOME TO MANY
SANATORIUMS RUN BY THE MILITARY.

13
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,666
OUR FATHER, ADROC THURSTON,

14
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,375
THE MAN SAID TO HAVE SAVED
THE WORLD FROM DESTRUCTION,

15
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,750
MET OUR MOM AND FELL IN LOVE
WITH HER IN THIS CITY.

16
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:15,041
AND WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE DOING HERE? WELL...

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,666
ARE YOU READY, MR. MATTHIEU?
PLEASE DON'T DROP IT!

18
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,416
- LEAVE IT TO ME!
IT MAY NOT LOOK IT,

19
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,833
BUT MY HAND-EYE
COORDINATION IS...

20
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,250
( grunts )

21
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,875
( gasps )

22
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,458
HMM? YECH!

23
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,916
WHAT IS THIS RANK STENCH?

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,125
- MR. MATTHIEU,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,375
- WHAT AM I DOING?

26
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,875
YOU WANNA EXPLAIN
TO ME WHAT THIS THING IS?

27
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,250
- OH, COME ON! DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ONE!

28
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,583
I MEAN, EVERYONE KNOWS
THAT'S CALLED A PUNCHA NUT!

29
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,958
- OH, YEAH? WELL, DO ALL
PUNCHA NUTS SMELL LIKE THIS?

30
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,666
- NEVER MIND THAT!
JUST MAKE SURE

31
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,208
YOU CATCH IT THIS TIME, OKAY?

32
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,250
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD...

33
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,708
EVEN ONE OF THESE THINGS
CAN GET US ALL IN TROUBLE.

34
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,416
( screams )

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,833
- Man: FREEZE!

36
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,166
FACE DOWN ON THE GROUND AND
SPREAD OUT YOUR ARMS AND LEGS!

37
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,125
I SAID, FACE DOWN ON
THE GROUND AND SPREAD OUT

38
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,250
YOUR ARMS AND LEGS, YOU THIEVES!

39
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,750
- WAIT! HOLD ON A MINUTE, UNCLE!

40
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,041
I-IT'S ME, YOUR NEPHEW,
RENTON THURSTON.

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,791
- YOU'RE RENTON?
YOU'RE REALLY RENTON THURSTON?

42
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,083
- WHAT?

43
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,333
- ( birds chirping )

44
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,958
- HMM.

45
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,208
- Renton: ( voice over )
THE REASON WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE

46
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,291
HE ALL OF A SUDDEN BECAME
ALL CONSCIOUS OF HIS HEALTH

47
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,125
AFTER HIS CLOSE ENCOUNTER
WITH THE CORALIAN.

48
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,125
- I STARTED TO FEEL IT
WHEN I GOT FACE TO FACE

49
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,125
WITH THE CORALIAN.

50
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,833
NATURE IS SO AWESOME!

51
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,750
AND SINCE ALL OF US WERE BORN
FROM THAT NATURE,

52
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,916
I'VE DECIDED
I'M GONNA RESPECT IT!

53
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,041
- Renton: I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT KIND OF AGREEMENT

54
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,500
WAS REACHED BETWEEN THOSE TWO,
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS,

55
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,791
IT IGNITED A MAJOR
HEALTH-CONSCIOUSNESS FAD

56
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,583
WITHIN THE GEKKOSTATE.

57
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,958
THE FAD QUICKLY SPREAD
THROUGHOUT THE SHIP,

58
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,750
AND THE JUNK FOOD,
WHICH WE NEVER HAD

59
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,583
AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF
TO BEGIN WITH,

60
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,666
COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
FROM THE GROCERY AREA.

61
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,000
INSTEAD THERE WERE FRESH FOODS,

62
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,833
SUPPOSEDLY SHIPPED STRAIGHT
FROM WHERE THEY WERE GROWING.

63
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,041
GOD ONLY KNOWS
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY CAME FROM

64
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,000
BUT OUR EATING HABITS IMPROVED.

65
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,208
- All: HMM.

66
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,625
- AFTER ALL,
WE'RE NOT DONE UNTIL

67
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,083
WE EAT ONE OF THESE, RIGHT?

68
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,541
- Renton: WELL, FROM THAT POINT,

69
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,958
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY
NO REASON FOR THEM

70
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,875
NOT TO SHOW AN INTEREST
IN THE PUNCHA NUT,

71
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,208
WHICH IS SAID TO BE
ONE OF THE THREE

72
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,583
HEALTHIEST FOODS
TO EAT ON THE PLANET.

73
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,458
- HEY, MAMA?
- YES?

74
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,875
- MAMA, YOU WANT TO TRY
THE PUNCHA NUT TOO, RIGHT?

75
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,166
- Renton: EUREKA STILL SEEMED TO
NOT BE FEELING WELL, BUT...

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,041
- MM, I GUESS.

77
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,458
- Renton: SINCE I HADN'T BEEN
ABLE TO TALK TO HER MUCH LATELY,

78
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,333
I WANTED TO GET HER ATTENTION.

79
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,666
COME TO THINK OF IT,

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,166
I ATE A LOT OF PUNCHA NUTS
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID.

81
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:05,958
( sighs )

82
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,666
- HEY, RENTON.
- HUH?

83
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,916
- I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
ALL OF THE DETAILS.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,500
- MY UNNECESSARY COMMENT JUST
POURED GAS ONTO THE FLAME.

85
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,208
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT KIND OF PLACE

86
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,375
CONTRORADO IS SINCE
THAT'S WHERE THE NUTS ARE?

87
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,500
LOOK, WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT
MUCH MONEY TO BEGIN WITH

88
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,958
AND YET WE STILL
WENT OUT AND BOUGHT

89
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,000
ALL SORTS OF REALLY
EXPENSIVE FRESH FOOD

90
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,208
SO OUR WALLET IS TOTALLY EMPTY.
BESIDES THAT...

91
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,750
- HOLLAND WAS PRETTY MUCH
AGAINST THE IDEA AT FIRST,

92
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,083
BUT HIS ATTITUDE CHANGED
RIGHT AWAY WHEN I TOLD HIM

93
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,708
THAT IT WAS THE PLACE
WHERE MY SISTER AND I

94
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,416
SPENT OUR CHILDHOOD DAYS.

95
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
- JUST BE BACK BEFORE 3:00.

96
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,791
- ALL RIGHT!

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,041
- Renton: AND SO, WE GOT IT,

98
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,000
THE SPECIAL EXCEPTION
FROM HOLLAND.

99
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,541
WE GOT PERMISSION TO HEAD OUT.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,083
AND THAT'S WHEN UNEXPECTED
THINGS STARTED TO HAPPEN.

101
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,333
- Eureka: RENTON.
- HUH?

102
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,000
- I WANNA GO WITH YOU.

103
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,083
- BUT, EUREKA, I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WEREN'T FEELING WELL.

104
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,333
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

105
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,583
RENTON, I WANT TO GET IN
THE NIRVASH RIGHT NOW!

106
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,958
- Renton: ( voice over ) I WAS
CONVINCED THAT SHE REALLY

107
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,333
WANTED TO GO BY THE VERY
SERIOUS LOOK IN HER EYES,

108
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,458
AND EVERYTHING
WAS GOOD AS WE TOOK OFF.

109
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,416
OF THE LITTLE
VALUABLE TIME WE HAD,

110
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,750
WE SPENT OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF

111
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,833
PERFORMING A TEST DRIVE
OF THE NIRVASH.

112
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,375
- COME ON. FOR PETE'S SAKE,

113
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,791
WE'RE IN A HURRY HERE,
YOU KNOW?

114
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,833
- OH, WHY?

115
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,958
- HEY, EUREKA.

116
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,125
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE LEFT.

117
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,333
LET'S GET DOWN AND DO IT AGAIN.

118
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,500
- HMM.

119
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,375
- HEY, RENTON.
COME ON, LET'S GO!

120
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,083
- Renton: ( voice over )
EVENTUALLY, WE ARRIVED

121
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,083
IN DOWNTOWN CONTRORADO.
BUT ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT

122
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,041
THINGS THERE ARE
EXPENSIVE TO BEGIN WITH,

123
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,625
THIS YEAR'S CROP OF PUNCHA
NUTS HASN'T BEEN VERY GOOD.

124
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,333
THE PRICE WAS
GOING THROUGH THE ROOF

125
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,958
AND EVEN WITH
EVERYONE'S DONATIONS

126
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,833
AND ALL THE MONEY
MR. MATTHIEU WAS CARRYING,

127
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,750
WE COULDN'T EVEN BUY ONE NUT.

128
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,625
I KINDA FELT BAD FOR EVERYONE.

129
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,416
- AND SO YOU CAME HERE
TO STEAL A NUT.

130
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,833
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

131
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,791
- SO HOW ARE YOUR TWO
ACCOMPLICES HERE RELATED TO YOU?

132
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,958
- THEY'RE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW,

133
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,583
CLASSMATES OF MINE
FROM MILITARY SCHOOL.

134
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,875
- WHAT?

135
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,583
- BOTH OF YOU!

136
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,458
IS WHAT HE SAID THE TRUTH?

137
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,041
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

138
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,541
- HMM.

139
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,875
( thumping )

140
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,583
- HUH?
- YOU! YOU BIG FOOL!

141
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,666
- ( Renton groaning )

142
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,375
- IF THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS AND
CLASSMATES FROM MILITARY SCHOOL,

143
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,875
THEY'RE VALUABLE PEOPLE
YOU'LL ENTRUST YOUR DEAR,

144
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,583
LITTLE LIFE TO IN THE FUTURE!
AND WHAT DO YOU DO?

145
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:05,166
YOU MAKE THEM COME HERE
AND STEAL PRODUCE?

146
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,000
PLEASE FORGIVE HIM
FOR ALL THE RUDE THINGS

147
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,875
HE'S DONE.
HE IS STILL VERY YOUNG.

148
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,000
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.
I'M YUKATAN IGLACIAS,

149
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,791
AND I'M RENTON'S UNCLE.
NOW, PLEASE, STAND UP.

150
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,750
IF YOU ARE FRIENDS
OF MY NEPHEW, RENTON,

151
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,791
I CONSIDER YOU MY
FRIENDS AS WELL.

152
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,666
I KNOW THAT I HAVEN'T
GREETED YOU PROPERLY,

153
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,166
BUT PLEASE DO MAKE
YOURSELVES AT HOME.

154
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,791
HEY! SOMEONE GET
SOME SPIRITED DRINKS

155
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,500
AND FOOD OUT HERE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!

156
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,958
- ( clock chimes loudly )
- ( all gasp )

157
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,041
- Renton: IT'S 3:00.

158
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,375
- Matthieu:
THIS ISN'T LOOKING GOOD.

159
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,833
- Yukatan:
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

160
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,125
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN HIM IN QUITE A WHILE,

161
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,791
YET THIS NEPHEW OF MINE ALWAYS
CAUSES SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR ME!

162
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,833
- OF COURSE! NOTHING LESS
SHOULD COME FROM

163
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,583
THE SON OF OUR HERO, ADROC!

164
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,625
- THAT'S RIGHT, HE HAS TO BE A
LITTLE BIT OUT OF THE ORDINARY!

165
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,125
( laughs )
- Man: I'M ENVIOUS.

166
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,583
IF YOU ASK ME,
MY GRANDCHILD'S WAY TOO QUIET.

167
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,041
I WISH HE'D CAUSE A LITTLE
MORE TROUBLE ONCE IN A WHILE.

168
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,291
( all laugh )

169
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,625
- I HAVE A QUESTION.
YOU MEANTIONED ADROC.

170
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,750
DID YOU MEAN THE ADROC THURSTON?

171
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,250
- OF COURSE. ARE THERE
ANY OTHER ADROC THURSTONS?

172
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,666
- WHAT? SO YOU'RE
ADROC THURSTON'S SON?

173
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,958
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?

174
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,750
- Man: WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

175
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,541
SOMEONE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY
HAVE TO ASK THAT AT THIS POINT?

176
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,375
- OH...
- WHAT IS IT?

177
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,291
- UH-HUH...

178
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,500
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH IT?

179
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,875
- IT'S NOT A BAD THING AT ALL,
BUT... WOW!

180
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,333
- OH, YOU'RE JUST PLAIN JEALOUS,
AREN'T YOU? I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL!

181
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,500
- OH, NO, I REALLY DIDN'T
MEAN IT THAT WAY.

182
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,166
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, DRINK UP.
GO AHEAD. DON'T BE SHY.

183
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,666
- NO. NO, THANKS.

184
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,083
- AH, COME ON.

185
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,208
- ( sighs )

186
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,333
- ( Man 1 laughs )

187
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,875
TELL ME NOW, YOUNG ONE,
IS THIS LOVELY LADY OVER HERE

188
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,458
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
OR PERHAPS YOUR FIANCEE?

189
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,666
- ( gasps )

190
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,791
( stuttering )
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

191
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,833
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- BUT, UNCLE...

192
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,791
- I CAN'T GO INTO ANY DETAILS
JUST YET,

193
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,708
AS IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO MAKE
THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT,

194
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,833
BUT SHE'S THE DAUGHTER
OF A CERTAIN COMMANDER

195
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,125
OF THE TOWER STATE AND
HER MARRIAGE TO MY NEPHEW

196
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,041
HAS BEEN ARRANGED
BY THEIR PARENTS.

197
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,625
I HEARD SHE CURRENTLY ATTENDS

198
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,208
THE NORTH SHORE UNIVERSITY'S
GIRLS' MAGNET SCHOOL.

199
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,833
- HOLD ON A SECOND, UNCLE!

200
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,875
- ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
- UH...

201
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,333
( groans ) YEAH.

202
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,583
- Man 1: OH, YOU GOT ME THERE.
WOW! NORTH SHORE UNIVERSITY!

203
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,250
- NORTH SHORE UNIVERSITY
IS THE ELITEST OF THE ELITE,

204
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,708
ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR THE POSITION
OF TOP SCHOOL IN THE FEDERATION.

205
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,208
I HEAR THAT IT'S ESPECIALLY HARD
FOR GIRLS TO BE ADMITTED.

206
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,333
- MR. YUKATAN, YOU MUST BE
ONE HAPPY PERSON!

207
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,583
- ( sobbing )

208
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,000
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

209
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,083
- I APOLOGIZE.

210
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,791
I KNOW IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME,

211
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,708
BUT IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY.

212
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,666
ALL THE BEST, MY BOY.

213
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,166
- YEAH, THANKS.

00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,458
- EXCUSE ME.

226
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,291
- RENTON?

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,083
- HMM.

228
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,791
- THEY'RE LATE!

229
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,916
- ( birds chirping )

230
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,416
- ALTHOUGH THIS ISN'T
THE FIRST TIME THAT

231
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,958
MY UNCLE HAS
TALKED ABOUT STUFF

232
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,541
AND SLIPPED IN A COUPLE LIES
IN THE PROCESS,

233
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,291
IT STILL MAKES ME TIRED.

234
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,125
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT MY DAD
WAS MY UNCLE'S PRIDE AND JOY,

235
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,916
BUT IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,291
OF COURSE, THERE'S NO WAY
THAT I CAN TELL ANY OF THEM

237
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,000
THAT I'M A MEMBER
OF THE GEKKOSTATE.

238
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,458
I WONDER IF SIS
WOULD GO THROUGH THIS

239
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,833
IF SHE WERE IN MY SHOES,

240
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,333
THINKING THAT WOULD HELP
MY UNCLE OUT IN THE PROCESS.

241
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,166
BUT, I...

242
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,833
WOW! THIS IS GREAT!

243
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,208
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT MY UNCLE
ACTUALLY KEPT THIS AROUND.

244
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,166
- ( door opens )

245
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,916
- EUREKA.

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
- WHAT IS THIS ROOM?

247
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,791
- THIS IS WHERE I USED TO SLEEP

248
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,791
WHEN I CAME TO VISIT
MY UNCLE WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

249
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,666
- I SEE.

250
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,208
- I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER.

251
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,041
- EARLIER?

252
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,875
- YOU KNOW, HOW MY UNCLE
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT

253
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,166
YOU BEING MY FIANCEE
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

254
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,125
- YOUR FIANCEE?
- HUH?

255
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,500
- OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

256
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,208
- I'M SORRY, I REALLY WASN'T
LISTENING TOO MUCH.

257
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,333
- OH.

258
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,208
- WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU HOLDING?

259
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,541
- OH, THIS THING? IT'S A TOY
THAT I USED TO PLAY WITH.

260
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,541
THIS IS HOW I'D PRETEND
TO BE RIDING THE WAVES

261
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,000
BACK WHEN I USED TO PLAY AROUND.

262
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,375
YOU KNOW, LIKE PRETEND
TO DO A CUTBACK DROP TURN.

263
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,125
YOU REMEMBER THE COMIC CALLED
"AT THE BEACH," DON'T YOU?

264
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,666
- I DON'T KNOW.

265
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,958
- OH...
WELL, IT WASN'T A COMIC

266
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,208
THAT GIRLS WOULD
NORMALLY BE READING.

267
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,750
- HEY, RENTON, HOW LONG
ARE WE GOING TO STAY HERE?

268
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,125
- WHAT?

269
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,208
- WE REALLY HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE GEKKO PRETTY SOON.

270
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,750
I MEAN, YOU PROMISED TO BE BACK
BY 3:00.

271
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,083
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

272
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,625
BUT CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER

273
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,333
BEFORE WE GO BACK
TO THE GEKKO?

274
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,833
- UH, WHY?

275
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,375
- WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, MY UNCLE
IS KIND OF A HARDHEAED GUY

276
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,791
AND IT'S HARD TO COME UP
WITH A PROPER TIMING

277
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,375
TO TELL HIM THINGS.

278
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,708
- THAT, AND WE STILL HAVEN'T
GOTTEN THE PUNCHA NUT

279
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,708
THAT WE PROMISED
TO BRING BACK WITH US.

280
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,958
- OH.

281
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,125
OKAY, I'LL GO TALK TO HIM
FOR YOU.

282
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,666
- NO! HOLD ON A SECOND!

283
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,708
WAIT, WAIT, I'LL TELL HIM!
I PROMISE! I PROMISE!

284
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,791
I'LL TELL HIM MYSELF.

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,875
- WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

286
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,583
( gasps )
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

287
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,208
( gasps )
- ( Matthieu moaning )

288
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,625
- MR. MATTHIEU!
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

289
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,166
- Yukatan: THIS IS THE WAY
TO DO IT, RIGHT?

290
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,375
- HUH?

291
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,208
WHAT'S GOING ON?
UNCLE, WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

292
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,125
- I'M SURPRISED YOU WERE
ABLE TO INFILTRATE

293
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,083
THE ENEMY SYNDICATE
THIS WELL AS A SPY.

294
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,833
WELL DONE.
- WHAT?

295
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,958
- Old man: THAT'S ENOUGH
PRETENDING, YOUNG ONE.

296
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:56,125
I HEARD ALL ABOUT YOUR BRAVERY
FROM YOUR UNCLE HERE.

297
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,500
YOU FACED SUCH A TOUCH MISSION,

298
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,791
THOUGH IT WAS A
VERY SPECIAL ONE, I UNDERSTAND.

299
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,708
YOU HAVE MY RESPECT
AND GRATITUDE.

300
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

301
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,250
RENTON IS NOT A SPY AT ALL.
HE'S ONE OF US.

302
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,625
- EUREKA, WAIT...

303
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,916
- HE'S A FULLY-FLEDGED MEMBER
OF THE GEKKOSTATE.

304
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,375
- ( sighs )

305
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,333
- Old man: MR. YUKATAN,
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

306
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,041
- THIS IS WHY I WAS AGAINST IT
FROM THE BEGINNING.

307
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,500
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BE JOINING
SUCH A DANGEROUS MISSION

308
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,208
JUST BECAUSE HE'S ADROC'S SON.

309
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,500
EVERYONE, IT LOOKS LIKE
MY YOUNG NEPHEW HERE

310
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,583
HAS BEEN BRAINWASHED
BY THE ENEMY.

311
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,958
- BRAINWASHED?

312
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,375
- Man: YEAH, I'VE HEARD OF THAT.

313
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,583
SOMETHING ABOUT THEM USING
NARCOTICS TO MAKE PEOPLE

314
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,291
LOSE THE ABILITY TO
TELL THE DIFFERENCE

315
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,291
BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.

316
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,666
- NOW, LISTEN
VERY CAREFULLY, RENTON.

317
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,666
YOUR FRIENDS HERE ARE FOOLING
YOU. BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.

318
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,791
YOUR UNCLE WILL FIND YOU
A VERY GOOD DOCTOR.

319
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,833
I'M SURE HE'LL BE ABLE
TO GET YOU BACK TO NORMAL.

320
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,625
- THIS ISN'T RIGHT!
- HUH?

321
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,041
- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT
ABOUT YOU, UNCLE! I'M NOT...

322
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,500
- ( door opens )
- HUH?

323
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,583
- WHO IS THE INFORMANT?

324
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,416
- I AM, SIR.
- HUH?

325
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,125
- ( exhales heavily )

326
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,916
- LOOKS LIKE THERE IS NO DOUBT
HERE. TAKE THEM AWAY!

327
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,458
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

328
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,958
GOOD DAY!

329
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,916
- ( Renton trying
to say something )

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,291
- WE'LL TAKE THIS GIRL
WITH US AS WELL.

331
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,416
AFTER HER!

332
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,791
- ( screams )

333
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,666
- HOLD IT!
- ( all gasp )

334
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,125
- DAMN IT.
THIS IS A BUNCH OF CRAP!

335
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,125
I HAVEN'T BEEN BRAINWASHED
BY ANYBODY!

336
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,875
IT'S YOU, UNCLE,
AND ALL OF YOUR BUDDIES HERE

337
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,166
THAT HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED!

338
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,916
I ALWAYS LOOKED UP
TO THE GEKKOSTATE

339
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
AND DECIDED TO
JOIN THEM ALL ON MY OWN!

340
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:54,666
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY
FATHER NOR YOU NOR MY SISTER!

341
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,208
- ( all gasp )

342
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,875
- I AM WHO I AM!

343
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,708
- I'M SURE SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO THEM!

344
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:10,208
HOLLAND, PLEASE,
LET ME GO OUT WITH THE 808!

345
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,125
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO

346
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,041
WITH THEM COMING BACK
REALLY LATE OR NOT,

347
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,458
BUT THE TRAPAR DENSITY
IS RISING AT AN ABNORMAL RATE.

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,333
- Girl: HOLLAND.

349
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,916
- ( retching )

350
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,541
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

351
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,500
OH, MAN,
WE'RE REALLY IN TROUBLE.

352
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,333
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS.

353
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,666
- ( tires screeching )

354
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,791
- ( groans )

355
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,625
- Soldier: IT'S AN AMBUSH!
I SPOTTED ONE ENEMY LFO!

356
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,250
- Soldier 1: SQUAD, SWITCH OVER
TO HUMANOID MODE!

357
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,208
- IT'S THE NIRVASH?
- ( gunfire )

358
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,916
- WHO'S OPERATING IT?

359
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,250
- ( crash )
- ( groans )

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,666
( screaming)

361
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,541
- ( banging )

362
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,791
- ( gasps )

363
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,125
- AMAZING. IS THAT HOLLAND
IN THERE?

364
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,375
- CAN'T BE. NO. THAT'S...

365
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,250
IT'S RENTON.

366
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,166
IS THAT REALLY THE NIRVASH?

367
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,041
BUT THAT'S NOT LIKE THE NIRVASH
AT ALL.

368
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,666
- WHAT A GREAT FEELING!

369
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,625
- YEAH!

370
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,625
ANYWAY, IT WAS JUST AMAZING!

371
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,083
- Renton: OH, STOP THAT,
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME!

372
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,750
IT WAS JUST A REALLY GOOD WAVE
AND NOTHING MORE THAN THAT.

373
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,708
- DON'T BE SO HUMBLE.
YOU'RE STILL A KID!

374
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,875
YOU GET THE RIGHT TO BRAG!

375
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,958
- ( laughing )
WOULD YOU CUT IT OUT ALREADY?

376
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,250
- HEY, YOU TWO,
CAN I ASK SOMETHING?

377
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,958
WHERE'S THE PUNCHA NUT?

378
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,958
- ( chuckling ) OH, YEAH,
THAT THING? IT SMELLED AWFUL!

379
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,208
- IDIOT! NOBODY HERE GIVES
A DAMN WHAT YOU THINK OF IT.

380
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,583
AND BY THE WAY,
WHAT THE HELL TIME DO YOU

381
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,000
THINK IT IS RIGHT NOW ANYWAY?

382
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,958
- OH, HONEY, THERE'S A REAL GOOD
REASON WHY WE'RE LATE.

383
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,291
( hiccups )
- UGH!

384
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,416
YOU REEK OF BOOZE! COME WITH ME!
- OW! OW! STOP IT!

385
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,416
STOP IT, THAT HURTS! FEELS LIKE
YOU'RE RIPPING MY EAR OFF!

386
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,541
- UH...

387
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,291
- Holland: RENTON.
- HUH?

388
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,208
- MAKE SURE THAT YOU TAKE CARE
OF WHAT YOU STARTED.

389
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,708
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OF COURSE I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT!

390
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,500
- Renton: ( voice over )
IN THE END,

391
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,291
MR. MATTHIEU TOOK ALL THE
BLAME BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT

392
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,791
HIS SUPERVISION
WAS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE.

393
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,208
AT THE SAME TIME, THE BIG
HEALTH FAD THAT HAD BEEN

394
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,416
GOING AROUND THE GEKKO
QUIETLY FADED AWAY.

395
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,791
SINCE THAT INCIDENT,
EUREKA ALWAYS STANDS

396
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,250
IN FRONT OF THE NIRVASH,

397
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,083
BUT NEVER EVEN TRIES
TO TOUCH IT ANYMORE.

398
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,583
NOT ONLY THAT, SHE SEEMS
TO BE AGAINST THE IDEA

399
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,333
OF ME APPROACHING THE NIRVASH

400
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,291
AND KEEPS PUSHING
ME BACK WITH A GLARE,

401
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,458
AS IF I WAS SOME STRANGER.

402
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,375
HONESTLY, THAT DEPRESSES ME,

403
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,750
AND IT PISSES ME OFF,
BUT ONLY A LITTLE.

404
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,166
I MEAN, EUREKA'S MAD BECAUSE
I MANIPULATED THE NIRVASH

405
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,791
WITHOUT HER CONSENT, RIGHT?

406
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,791
IT'S BECAUSE I WAS ABLE
TO CONTROL THE NIRVASH

407
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:20,791
BETTER THAN SHE
COULD. THAT'S WHY.

408
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,125
I ALWAYS WANT TO BE
AT EUREKA'S SIDE.

409
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,208
I WANT TO BE HER STRENGTH.

410
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,500
THAT THOUGHT CHANGED ONE BIT.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT TO

411
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,708
STAY IN THE
PASSENGER'S SEAT FOREVER.

412
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,583
I HAVE A DREAM, TOO.
I HAVE THINGS THAT I WANT TO DO.

413
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,875
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
INTERFERING WITH THAT

414
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,375
AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SAY
ANTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT IT.

415
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,250
I AM WHO I AM.

416
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,250
I WANT TO PILOT THE NIRVASH
A LOT MORE.

417
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:16,416
I WANNA TEST MY POWERS
TO A MUCH, MUCH BIGGER EXTENT.

418
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,958
BECAUSE, RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE
I CAN DO ANYTHING!
