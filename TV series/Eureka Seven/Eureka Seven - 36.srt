1
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,208
- ( theme music plays )

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,166
- Ageha Member #1: WHEN
ORANGE ZERO TWO WAS TEST-FIRING,

4
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,875
IT SEEMS THAT THE END
CAME IN CONTACT

5
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,625
WITH A typeZERO VERSION, TOO.

6
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,125
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATENESS
OF THIS REPORT.

7
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,041
- Dewey:
YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT,

8
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,708
WITH THE SITUATION
BEING WHAT IT WAS.

9
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,666
- BUT WHAT ARE THEY PLANNING?

10
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,541
WHAT DO THEY WANT
WITH A VODARAC PRIEST,

11
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,041
AND WHY DID THEY TAKE HIM?

12
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,583
- NO NEED TO WORRY.
IT'S PERFECTLY CLEAR TO ME

13
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,500
WHAT THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO.

14
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,666
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
THAT THE GEKKO COULD BE HEADED.

15
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,375
OF COURSE, IT WOULD BE
BEST IF WE LOCATED

16
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,500
THE CENTRAL CORALIAN CORE

17
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,875
BEFORE THEY CAUSE
ANY MORE SITUATIONS.

18
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,875
BUT TO DO THAT,
WE NEED TO INCREASE

19
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,375
THE LANDING POINTS
OF THE ORANGE A BIT MORE.

20
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:25,125
I DON'T WANT TO SHED MORE BLOOD
THAN IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

21
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,791
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT, HOLLAND.

22
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,833
- ALL SECTIONS ARE
READY FOR DEPARTURE, SIR.

23
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,041
WE CAN BE UNDERWAY AS SOON
AS YOU GIVE THE COMMAND.

24
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,125
- Ageha Member #1:
WHAT WILL YOU DO

25
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,875
ABOUT THE VISITATION SUMMONS?

26
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,875
- CAN YOU RELAY A MESSAGE
TO THEM FOR ME?

27
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:49,375
TELL THEM THAT WHEN THE
TIME COMES, I WILL VISIT THEM.

28
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:53,125
SO I WISH FOR THEM TO HOLD OFF
ON THAT REQUEST FOR A WHILE.

29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,333
- Holland:
RENTON IS EUREKA'S PARTNER.

30
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,833
YOU ALREADY ADMITTED TO THAT,
AND THAT'S THE REASON

31
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,791
WHY YOU DECIDED TO COME WITH US
HERE ON THE GEKKO, RIGHT?

32
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,750
WE GATHERED UP THE CHESS PIECES,
WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?

33
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,666
HOW DO EUREKA AND RENTON GET
TO CROSS OVER THE GREAT WALL?

34
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,208
- DO YOU GOT ANY MORE?

35
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,458
- THAT'S ALL YOU GET RIGHT NOW.

36
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,458
- RIGHT.  HIT ME, OKAY.

37
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,750
- I DON'T SMOKE.

38
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,708
BY THE WAY, THIS ROOM
IS NON-SMOKING.

39
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,791
- FOR STARTERS,
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT

40
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,666
IF YOU TOOK ME BACK
TO THE VODARAC PALACE.

41
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,666
- THE VODARAC PALACE,
YOU MEAN YOUR HEADQUARTERS?

42
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,125
- ( snoring )

43
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,041
- ARE THOSE TWO
DRAWN TO EACH OTHER

44
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,208
FROM THEIR DEEPEST HEARTS?

45
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,125
THEN WE NEED TO HURRY UP.

46
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,416
- ( snoring )

47
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,875
- Renton: NO!

48
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,041
POOR THING, LOOK
AT THE BIG SCRATCH HE GOT.

49
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,416
AND WE JUST IMPROVED
ALL THE SPECS, TOO.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,750
- SCRATCHES ARE... BAD?

51
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,708
- UM, WELL I GUESS
YOU REALLY CAN'T HELP

52
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,000
GETTING SCRATCHED UP IN BATTLE.

53
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,541
BUT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT
NICE AND SMOOTH.

54
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,541
GREAT!

55
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,708
IT'S BACK AS GOOD AS NEW.

56
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,291
SEE, I'M SURE NIRVASH
IS HAPPY ABOUT IT, TOO.

57
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,458
YOU CAN HEAR HIM, CAN'T YOU?

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
EUREKA?

59
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,708
WANT TO HANG OUT
ONCE IN A WHILE?

60
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,791
- Gidget:
DOES IT BOTHER YOU?

61
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,291
YOU CAN HIDE IT
EASILY WITH CONCEALER.

62
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,041
- CONCEALER?

63
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,625
- OH, YEAH.  YOU'VE NEVER HAD
TO WEAR ANY MAKEUP BEFORE.

64
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,750
YOU'RE LUCKY.

65
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,458
- WHY DO YOU WEAR MAKEUP?

66
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,625
- I CAN'T IMAGINE LIFE
WITHOUT MAKEUP.

67
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,791
BECAUSE IT MAKES ME
LOOK PRETTIER.

68
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,166
DOGGIE'S HAPPY
WHEN I LOOK PRETTY.

69
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,958
- IF YOU BECOME
PRETTY WITH MAKEUP,

70
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,375
DOGGIE GETS REALLY HAPPY?

71
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,041
- MM-HMM.  IF I DON'T
WEAR MAKEUP,

72
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,083
HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME
GETS DIFFERENT.

73
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,500
- LIKE RENTON.

74
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,333
HE GOT VERY HAPPY, TOO,
WHEN THE NIRVASH GOT PRETTIER.

75
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,791
- SO, WHAT?  NOW I'M AN LFO?

76
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,458
- GIDGET?
- HM?

77
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,791
- CAN YOU PUT MAKEUP ON ME, TOO?
I WANT TO BE PRETTY LIKE YOU.

78
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,250
- Holland: RENTON.
- Renton: YES?

79
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,541
- WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG,
YOU HID YOUR SISTER'S SHOES

80
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,416
TO MESS WITH HER, DIDN'T YOU?

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,625
- WHY DID YOU ASK THAT?

82
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,458
- YOU REALLY GOT IN THE WAY
OF OUR VERY FIRST DATE.

83
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,083
THOUGH IT WAS STILL MEMORABLE.

84
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,625
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING--

85
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,666
YOUR SISTER, SHE WAS
MY FIRST LOVE.

86
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,875
- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER
IF I COULD HAVE LENT YOU MINE.

87
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,416
BUT YOUR SKIN'S MUCH DIFFERENT.

88
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,083
NOW, YOUR HAND.

89
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:11,500
- GIDGET, I--
- DON'T WORRY.

90
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,958
THIS COVERS REALLY WELL,
SO I THINK IT'LL DO JUST FINE.

91
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,958
- BUT I DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH MONEY, GIDGET.

92
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,166
I CAN'T BUY IT.

93
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,500
- JUST PUT IT ON RENTON'S TAB.
- HIS WHAT?

94
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,916
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,708
I MEAN, YOU'RE DOING THIS
TO MAKE HIM HAPPY, RIGHT?

96
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,875
- I JUST WONDER
IF HE'LL LIKE IT.

97
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,333
- Holland: IT WAS BEFORE
YOU WERE BORN, I GUESS,

98
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,208
BACK WHEN I WAS TWELVE.

99
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:40,541
THE FIRST TIME THAT I MET DIANE
WAS AT BOLNATA MILITARY BASE.

100
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,708
THANKS TO ADROC, WE WERE ABLE
TO GO IN AND OUT FREELY.

101
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:50,041
THAT HILL ALWAYS HAD
A GOOD WAVE COMING IN.

102
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,750
WHEN I COULD, I WOULD RUSH OVER
TO MY SECRET SPOT TO PRACTICE.

103
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,375
NOBODY ELSE WAS EVER THERE
OTHER THAN ME.

104
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,250
OH, DAMN.

105
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,791
- ARE YOU OKAY?

106
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,125
THAT'S QUITE A BUMP.

107
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,958
I BET YOUR FOREHEAD
REALLY HURTS.

108
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,708
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

109
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,041
- DAD DOES THAT TO ME.
WHENEVER I GET HURT,

110
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,416
OR FEEL BAD, OR WANT TO CRY.

111
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,291
- WHAT?  HOW THE HELL
DID YOU GET OUT HERE?

112
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,125
YOU'RE IN THE WAY.

113
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,208
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

114
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,750
- Holland:
I HEARD LATER ON THAT ADROC

115
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,208
HAD BROUGHT DIANE WITH HIM,
AFTER MUCH COAXING.

116
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,166
AND THAT SHE TENDED TO
COOP HERSELF UP

117
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,250
INSIDE THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME.

118
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:18,583
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
SHE'D COME OUT TO THAT SPOT.

119
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,166
SHE NEVER WENT BACK AGAIN.

120
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,458
AND RIGHT UP UNTIL
THE NEXT TIME WE MET,

121
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,166
I THOUGHT SHE HATED ME.

122
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,000
EVEN AFTER THE MILITARY
ANNOUNCED ADROC'S DEATH,

123
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,208
THEY KEPT DOING RESEARCH
ON THE DATA AND ITEMS

124
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,583
THAT HE LEFT BEHIND.

125
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,333
IT WOULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS
BEFORE IT WAS ALL OVER.

126
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,625
- SOMEONE THERE?

127
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,708
DIANE!

128
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,541
DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

129
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,375
WE MET JUST ONCE
AT THE LIFT SPOT

130
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,750
OVER AT BOLNATA.

131
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,875
YOUR DAD'S BELONGINGS
ARE WITH THE COMMANDER.

132
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:25,041
- WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS
MY FATHER TRYING TO PROVE HERE?

133
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,750
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.

134
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,875
WE LIVED TOGETHER
FOR SIXTEEN YEARS,

135
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,250
AND I KNOW NOTHING.

136
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:36,541
- ADROC'S RESEARCH DATA
IS ONLY OPEN

137
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,541
TO A SMALL PORTION
OF THE MILITARY.

138
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,916
- I SEE.

139
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,875
WHAT CAN I DO TO FIND OUT
MORE ABOUT IT?

140
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:48,916
PLEASE, HOLLAND.

141
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:57,416
I REMEMBER HOW WONDERFUL IT WAS
WATCHING YOU LIFTING.

142
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,875
- IF I CAN BE
OF ANY HELP, I WILL.

143
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,833
- CALL ME LATER.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,916
- Gidget:
YOU GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,833
- YEAH, I WANT
TO DO IT MYSELF.

146
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,625
- RIGHT.  WELL, GOOD LUCK!

147
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,291
- Holland: UNTIL THEN, I THOUGHT
THAT MAKING PHONE CALLS

148
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,583
WAS SOMETHING THAT WOMEN
WERE SUPPOSED TO DO.

149
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,625
OH, HI, DIANE!

150
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,541
IT'S UH-- ME, HOLLAND, CALLING.

151
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,791
- THERE'S NO ONE HERE
BY THAT NAME.

152
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,208
- ( phone clicks )

153
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,791
EXCUSE ME, AM I SPEAKING
WITH DIANE'S GRANDFATHER?

154
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,708
- THE NUMBER YOU HAVE DIALED
IS NO LONGER IN SERVICE.

155
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,291
AND THERE IS NO
NEW NUMBER, SORRY.

156
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,291
- ( phone clicks )

157
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,458
- ( knocking )

158
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,500
- HEY, WAKE UP.
YOU GOT A CALL FROM BELLFOREST.

159
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,875
AND IT'S A GIRL.

160
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,666
- ( dance music playing )

161
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,875
- Holland: SOUTHERN.

162
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,625
NO, WAIT--

163
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,041
TATSURO WOULD SET
A MUCH BETTER MOOD.

164
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,916
- I'M SO SORRY,
MY LITTLE BROTHER

165
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,500
HID MY SHOES ON THE WAY OUT.

166
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,208
- IDIOT! UGLY!

167
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:58,250
I'M GOING TO TELL GRANDPA
ABOUT THIS WHEN HE GETS BACK!

168
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,750
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- DON'T BE.

169
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,041
- YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D ACTUALLY COME HERE.

170
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,000
- I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED

171
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,750
YOU WERE OPTING
FOR THE MILITARY LABORATORIES.

172
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,750
I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE
TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

173
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,875
- IT'S 'CAUSE YOU RECOMMENDED
ME TO YOUR BROTHER, HOLLAND.

174
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,583
THANK YOU, FOR EVERYTHING.

175
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,083
- WELL...

176
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:28,083
- I'M SO HAPPY, HOLLAND!

177
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,541
I'M REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

178
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,291
- UH, WHAT IS IT?

179
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,916
- WHAT'S WRONG?

180
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,625
- UM, AN INTERVIEW?

181
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,125
- YEAH, I MEAN,

182
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,083
ISN'T INFORMATION PHYSICS
SOMETHING NEW?

183
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,125
- NO, IT'S JUST
THAT YOU'RE IGNORANT.

184
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,125
BUT IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE UP TO IT--

185
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,041
RIGHT, MY SWEET LITTLE CUB?

186
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,500
- IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE COULD
DO IT IN THE CONTEXT

187
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,958
OF A TALK WITH MASTER NORB.

188
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,708
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- GOT IT!

189
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,666
- Holland:
I WAS CRAZY ABOUT HER.

190
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,916
I BELIEVED FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY HEART, THAT SOME DAY,

191
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,125
WE'D BE TOGETHER.  BUT--

192
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,000
I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED IT.

193
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,375
THAT HER EYES WERE FIXED
ON SOMETHING ELSE.

194
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,875
STARING AT SOMETHING
OTHER THAN ME.

195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,583
- Diane:
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

196
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,958
I'M DOING MY BEST, OKAY?

197
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,500
THERE'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT MORE.

198
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,875
- ( door slams )

199
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,458
- THAT'S ENOUGH, DIANE!

200
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,958
ENOUGH!
- WHY ARE YOU MAD?

201
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,125
ALL I'M DOING IS TRYING TO PROVE
WHAT IT IS MY FATHER DISCOVERED.

202
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,458
- I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

203
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,541
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THIS
IS GETTING UNHEALTHY.

204
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,833
- IT'S ALL BECAUSE
I CAN'T GUIDE MYSELF

205
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,166
TO THE RIGHT EQUATION.

206
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,458
TO THE FACT THAT THE SCUBS

207
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,625
ACTUALLY WANT
TO COMMUNICATE WITH US.

208
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,208
- OH, YEAH?
WELL THE SCUBS CAN BITE ME!

209
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,791
ADROC WAS KILLED
IN THAT EXPERIMENT.

210
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,750
HE WAS POSSESSED BY SCUBS,
AND HE DIED!

211
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:04,291
DO YOU WANT TO FOLLOW
IN HIS FOOTSTEPS?

212
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,958
- YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

213
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,750
LIVING IN A WORLD LIKE THIS,

214
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,833
WE COULD NEVER
HOPE TO UNDERSTAND.

215
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,750
RIGHT, HOLLAND?

216
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,916
- Holland: THAT WAS THE LAST
TIME I LOOKED INTO DIANE'S EYES.

217
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,041
AFTER THAT,
I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN.

218
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,666
ADROC HAD PASSED AWAY.
AND DIANE HAD DISAPPEARED.

219
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,208
RENTON, YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, ARE YOU?

220
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,666
AS LONG AS I'M IN REACH OF YOU,

221
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,333
I SWEAR THAT I WILL PROTECT
YOU AND EUREKA, ALL RIGHT?

222
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,375
- HOLLAND...

223
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,375
I'M REALLY HAPPY
ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL.

224
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,916
BUT HOLLAND,
THAT'S A BIT TOUGH ON ME.

225
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,208
YOU SEE, I DON'T
WANT YOU GOING OUT

226
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,916
AND KILLING ANY MORE PEOPLE.

227
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,833
LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT I THINK
I HAVE THE RIGHT

228
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,416
TO SAY THIS ANYMORE,
BUT EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO DIED

229
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,583
FOR OUR SAKE HAVE PEOPLE
WHO THINK DEARLY OF THEM.

230
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,875
AND HURT FROM THEIR LOSS.

231
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,625
EUREKA FEELS
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

232
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,291
ACTUALLY, THINGS HAVE BEEN
MUCH TOUGHER ON HER

233
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,625
THAN THEY'VE BEEN FOR ME.

234
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,041
BECAUSE EUREKA CAN
ALSO FEEL THE HEARTS

235
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,375
OF ALL THE MACHINES
THAT HAVE BEEN BROKEN.

236
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,875
- YOU KNOW THAT, TOO.
DON'T YOU, HOLLAND?

237
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,875
- WHAT I KNOW, IS THAT EUREKA
DOESN'T REALLY THINK

238
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,250
THAT MACHINES HAVE
HEARTS AT ALL.

239
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,250
- BUT, WHAT ABOUT--

240
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,833
- PERHAPS IT'S TRUE THAT SHE CAN
TALK HEART-TO-HEART

241
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,291
WITH THE ARCHETYPES THAT WERE
MADE FROM SCUBS, JUST LIKE HER.

242
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,458
BUT MACHINES MADE BY HUMANS
ARE SOMETHING ELSE.

243
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,958
- THEN WHY DID EUREKA SAY
THAT SHE COULD HEAR

244
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,250
THE MACHINE'S VOICES?

245
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,750
- BECAUSE SHE SAW IMAGES
OF SCUBS ON THEM.

246
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,708
IF YOU ARRIVED AS A CLEAN SLATE
WITH NOTHING ON IT

247
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,750
AND WERE THROWN
INTO A GROUP OF BEINGS

248
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,625
THAT WERE
OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES,

249
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,916
WOULD YOU REALLY BE ABLE
TO OPEN YOUR HEART

250
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,458
AND INTERACT WITH THEM?

251
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,291
EUREKA CAME
INTO THIS WORLD ALONE,

252
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,541
AND SOUGHT A PLACE
WHERE SHE COULD BELONG.

253
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,250
EVEN WITH MACHINES
THAT SPOKE NO WORDS.

254
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,583
EUREKA JUST COULDN'T
ACCEPT HUMAN BEINGS.

255
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,583
UNTIL SHE MET YOU.

256
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:08,083
- ME?
- THAT'S RIGHT, YOU.

257
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,583
I CAN'T CHANGE THE WAY
THAT I FIGHT.

258
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,625
HUNDREDS OF GALLONS OF BLOOD

259
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,416
FROM ALL THE PEOPLE
I'VE KILLED IN THE PAST

260
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,791
HAVE SEEPED INTO THIS BODY.

261
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,333
EVEN IF I WERE TO CHANGE NOW,
THEY WOULDN'T FORGIVE ME.

262
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:27,000
BUT YOU CAN STILL TURN BACK,
YOU HAVE TIME.

263
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:31,000
YOU NEED TO GO AHEAD WITH THE
COMBAT STYLE YOU BELIEVE IN.

264
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,041
SHOW EVERYONE A COMBAT STYLE
I COULDN'T GET AWAY WITH.

265
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,083
I'M PUTTING MY TRUST
IN YOU, RENTON.

266
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,583
TAKE CARE OF EUREKA,
AND MAKE HER HAPPY.

267
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,333
- I WILL, HOLLAND.

268
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,916
- SO, HOW FAR
HAVE YOU GOTTEN WITH HER?

269
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,958
- WHAT?

270
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,833
- HAVE YOU AT LEAST
KISSED HER YET?

271
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,583
- NOTHING LIKE THAT!

272
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,000
- BE HONEST ABOUT IT.
TELL ME OR YOU DON'T GET OUT.

273
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,958
- BUT I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

274
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,958
- OUT WITH IT, DAMN IT!

275
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,666
- Hap: YOU WERE SOAKING
UNTIL YOU GOT DIZZY?

276
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,541
- HEY, WHERE'S STONER?

277
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,625
HE'S GOT TO GET
SOME PICTURES OF THIS.

278
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,166
- OH, HONESTLY.
WHAT WERE YOU TWO THINKING?

279
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,750
- CALL EVERYONE OVER.
YOU DON'T GET TO SEE

280
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,875
HOLLAND MAKING A FOOL
OUT OF HIMSELF VERY OFTEN.

281
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,708
- YEAH, VERY FUNNY.

282
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,875
- Renton:
I FINALLY HEARD IT.

283
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,416
THE WHOLE STORY
ABOUT YOUR VERY FIRST LOVE.

284
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,375
- JUST KEEP IT QUIET
FROM MATTHIEU.

285
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,791
- Eureka: RENTON.

286
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:43,875
- EUREKA?

287
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,916
- HOW...

288
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,875
IS IT?

289
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,333
- Gidget: EUREKA...

290
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,291
- ( children crying )

291
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,750
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE?

292
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,625
- Gidget: RENTON!

293
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,125
WHAT ARE YOU JUST SITTING
THERE FOR?

294
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,583
HURRY UP AND GO AFTER HER!

295
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,250
- OH, RIGHT.  EUREKA!

296
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,291
- VERY NAUGHTY.
- YEAH, ROUGE MAGIC.

297
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,916
- OH, NO.
THEY'VE LOST IT NOW.

298
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,583
- WILL EVERYBODY JUST SHUT UP?!

299
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,416
- DID THE KIDS
PULL A PRANK ON YOU?

300
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,500
WELL THEN WHO DID
THIS HORRIBLE THING?

301
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,875
WHAT HAPPENED EUREKA?
LET ME HELP YOU WIPE IT OFF.

302
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,750
HEY, COME ON.
I WANT TO SEE.

303
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,666
- WHO CARES?!

304
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,500
- HEY, WHY ARE YOU
MAD AT ME?

305
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,291
- LET GO!

306
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,583
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU, EUREKA!

307
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,458
- EARLIER TODAY
GIDGET TOLD ME,

308
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,291
IF I WORE SOME MAKEUP
I WOULD BE PRETTY.

309
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,041
I MEAN, I REALLY WANTED
YOU TO SEE ME

310
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,958
LOOKING ALL PRETTY
AND STUFF, RENTON.

311
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,958
I WANTED YOU TO BE HAPPY.

312
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,291
RENTON!

313
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,583
- OW.

314
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,083
- OH, RENTON,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

315
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,583
- EUREKA.

316
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:28,333
- I WANT TO TELL YOU,
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

317
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,541
I LOOK STRANGE.

318
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,708
- NO YOU DON'T.
YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY.

319
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,291
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE NOT
WEARING ALL THAT MAKEUP.

320
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,541
YOU SEE, I--

321
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,208
EUREKA, I--
I LOVE YOU.

322
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,750
MS. TALHO.

323
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,416
- EUREKA, COME WITH ME.

324
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,208
AT YOUR AGE,
YOU DON'T NEED MUCH MAKEUP.

325
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,166
JUST A LITTLE BIT WILL DO.

326
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,041
THERE, ALL DONE.

327
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,666
- ( gasps )

328
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,708
- DO YOU WANT THIS?

329
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,166
HERE, IT'S YOURS.

330
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,166
BE ON YOUR GUARD THOUGH.

331
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,208
THERE'S A LOT
OF SMOOTH-TALKING GUYS OUT THERE

332
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,166
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR A PRETTY GIRL

333
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,375
THAT THEY CAN SEDUCE
AND HAVE THEIR WAY WITH.

334
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,208
- SO YOU REALLY HAVEN'T?

335
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,666
- NO, WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

336
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,375
NOT YET.

337
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:41,375
- Dewey: I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, ANEMONE.

338
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,375
I HEARD THAT YOU
WERE TERRIBLY HURT

339
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,708
IN THE FIGHT YOU HAD
AGAINST typeZERO.

340
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,041
- IT'S NOT TRUE!

341
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,041
I WAS JUST CAUGHT
OFF GUARD, THAT'S ALL!

342
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,750
WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
I SEE THEM.

343
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,875
- SORRY TO TELL YOU THIS,
BUT PLAYING WITH THEM

344
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,041
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN
FOR A WHILE.

345
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,416
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
AN ENTIRELY NEW MISSION.

346
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,333
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ONE.

347
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,875
AND I THINK YOU ARE THE ONLY
PERSON I CAN TRUST WITH IT.

348
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,250
- COLONEL, I MUST ADVISE YOU

349
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,458
THAT ANEMONE IS
IN DESPERATE NEED OF A VACATION.

350
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,416
THE DOCTOR HAS EVEN--

351
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,041
- I'M TOTALLY FINE,

352
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,750
I CAN GO!
LET ME GO, PLEASE.

353
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,125
DEWEY?

354
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,208
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU NOW.

355
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,875
MY SWEET ANEMONE.

356
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,875
- Eureka and Renton:
TO BE CONTINUED.

357
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

358
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,583
- Talho:
WITH THE CROSSING OF TWO IDEAS

359
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,958
FROM OPPOSITE ENDS,
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE WORLD

360
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,333
STARTS TO COME OUT
INTO THE OPEN.

361
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,750
HOWEVER, IN THE WORLD
SWAYING UNEASILY,

362
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,833
A FALSE STORY IS BORN.

363
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,583
NEXT EPISODE--
"RAISE YOUR HAND."
