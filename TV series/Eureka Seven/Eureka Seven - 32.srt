1
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:15,500
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,375
♪ I JUST FLY AWAY ♪

4
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,375
♪ I JUST FLY AWAY! ♪

5
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,166
- ( sighs )
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

6
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,916
- Woman: HURRY UP AND GET US
THE NUMBER OF FATALITIES.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,958
- BUT THERE ARE SO MANY BODIES
THAT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED SO BADLY.

8
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,375
- COUNT ONE HEAD, ONE BODY,
TWO ARMS AND TWO LEGS

9
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,958
AS ONE PERSON.  THAT'LL HAVE TO
DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

10
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,958
- COLONEL DEWEY HAS ORDERED
THE CAPITOL SQUADRON

11
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,958
TO TEST LAUNCH THE SECOND
ORANGE-ZERO MISSILE.

12
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,791
WE WILL NOW HEAD
TO THE OBSERVATION POINT

13
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,291
OF THE SECOND MISSILE LANDING.
PLEASE, HURRY.

14
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,375
- Man: THE SO-CALLED
ANTIBODY CORALIAN

15
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:33,291
SUDDENLY STOPPED MOVING, BUT
IT WASN'T GIVEN A FATAL BLOW.

16
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,333
THE REASONS BEHIND THE STOP
ARE UNKNOWN.

17
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,000
CALCULATING BACK
FROM ITS SIZE AND ACTIVITY AREA,

18
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,791
IT WAS ON THE MOVE
FOR 1,246 SECONDS.

19
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,916
HUH?  1,246 SECONDS?

20
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,000
- Man: THE CONTROL
STICK HAS CHANGED.

21
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,916
STROKES FOR EACH PART WILL NOW
BE DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE.

22
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,958
- EUREKA.

23
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,875
EUREKA, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

24
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,125
- RENTON, LOTS OF PEOPLE
DIED AGAIN.

25
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,666
I'M SORRY.  I'M SORRY.

26
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,000
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

27
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,500
- PLEASE TELL ME, RENTON,
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

28
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,041
TELL ME WHAT TO DO, PLEASE.

29
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,916
- EUREKA.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,375
- WAIT A MINUTE.
A DISTRESS SIGNAL?

31
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,416
A REFUGEE SHIP FROM FERES.

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,583
- YOU MEAN SOME CIVILIANS
ESCAPED?

33
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,625
- WE'LL RENDEZVOUS.  REPLY
WITH A CONFIRMATION SIGNAL.

34
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:33,958
- RIGHT.

35
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,250
- YOU REALLY DO A GOOD JOB.

36
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,250
- THIS IS THE ONLY TYPE OF WORK

37
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,791
I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE TO DO.

38
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,083
THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST
THING I'M EVER

39
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,958
GOING TO BE ABLE
TO DO FOR HIM.

40
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,333
- Girl: WOW!
- HUH?

41
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,833
- AXEL, DID YOU REALLY
MAKE THIS BY YOURSELF?

42
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,666
- DON'T YOU GO TOUCHING IT NOW.

43
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,666
THE FILMS HAVEN'T
FINISHED DRYING.

44
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,083
- AMAZING!

45
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,333
- HEY, WAS SOMEONE HERE
UNTIL JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO?

46
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,833
- SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN.
WHY DO YOU ASK?

47
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,541
- SEE, I TOLD YOU.

48
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,416
- WAS SOMEONE SNOOPING
AROUND HERE?

49
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
- UH-HUH,
SOME CREEPY LOOKING GUY.

50
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,291
- HE WAS SNEAKING
ALL AROUND HERE.

51
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,291
- THIS ISN'T GOOD.
I THINK MAYBE THEY'RE ON TO US.

52
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,750
HMM?

53
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,833
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

54
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,833
IF THEY COME IN HERE BEFORE
THE GEKKO ARRIVES, IT'S OVER.

55
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,833
GIRLS, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE
AND GO STRAIGHT HOME.

56
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,833
- WHAT?
BUT WE ALL JUST GOT HERE.

57
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:44,875
SO WHAT?  GO HOME AND NEVER
COME NEAR THIS GARAGE AGAIN.

58
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,875
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
THAT WENT ON HERE.

59
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,875
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING AND YOU
DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING, EITHER.

60
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,208
GOT THAT?
- BUT, AXEL.

61
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,333
GOT THAT?

62
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,833
- HEY, WE'LL SEE YOU
AGAIN, RIGHT?

63
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,583
IT'S JUST A HUNCH.

64
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,833
BYE, AXEL.

65
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,291
- YEAH.  SEE YOU LATER.

66
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,333
- Man: IT WAS ALL WE COULD DO
TO ESCAPE FROM THE CITY.

67
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:38,041
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS.
- Holland: WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

68
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,291
- I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE
AN ARROW OF LIGHT FALL

69
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,000
IN THE DISTANT SKIES.
- ARROW OF LIGHT?

70
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,083
- THERE WAS A HUGE EXPLOSION,
AND THEN SUDDENLY,

71
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,125
WE HAD A TECTONIC SHIFT
IN THE CITY.

72
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,083
A HUGE, ROUND CLOUD
SUDDENLY POPPED UP

73
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,875
ALONG WITH A TREMENDOUSLY
DENSE STREAM OF TRAPARS.

74
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,583
( sobs ) AND THEN
EVERYTHING WENT CRAZY.

75
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,250
- WAIT A SECOND.

76
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,541
THE CLOUD APPEARED RIGHT AFTER
THE ARROW FELL TO THE GROUND?

77
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,250
- BEFORE WE KNEW IT, THOSE
THINGS WERE ALL OVER THE CITY.

78
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,791
- ANSWER ME!

79
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,625
THOSE THINGS ATTACKED THE CITY
AFTER YOU SAW THE EXPLOSION?

80
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,375
- HOLLAND.
- ( crying )

81
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,208
- SORRY.

82
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,208
- THE ARROW OF LIGHT,

83
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,708
THAT THING AT TRESOR, HOLLAND.

84
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,625
- WE CAN'T PUT IT OFF NOW.

85
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,416
WE NEED TO GET THAT SPEC
TWO BOARD IN RIGHT AWAY.

86
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,666
DEWEY'S GETTING SERIOUS.
HE'S STARTING UP.

87
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,208
- ( chattering )

88
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,000
- ( grunts )

89
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,750
( sighs )

90
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,791
- HERE, I GOT IT.

91
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,666
- HEY, YOU DID REALLY WELL.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, KID?

92
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,583
- THAT CHILD HAS LOST HIS VOICE.
- HUH?

93
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,583
- BOTH HIS PARENTS WERE KILLED
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM,

94
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:15,333
BY THOSE FILTHY MONSTERS.
- OH, I SEE.

95
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,666
- ( clattering )

96
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,166
- WHAT HAPPENED
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT THERE?

97
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,166
- EUREKA!

98
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,166
EUREKA, STOP.

99
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,666
YOU'RE STILL NOT FEELING WELL.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HELP OUT.

100
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,958
- LET ME DO THIS.
- ( gasps )

101
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,541
- PLEASE, LET ME HELP OUT.
I CAN'T STAND DOING NOTHING.

102
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,500
THANKS A LOT.

103
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,250
- ( whimpering )

104
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,250
- HEY, KID.

105
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:07,208
- ( screaming )
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

106
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,208
HOW CAN I BE EVER FORGIVEN
FOR WHAT I'VE DONE?

107
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,625
PLEASE, SOMEONE TELL ME.

108
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,625
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- DON'T, EUREKA.  HEY.

109
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,625
- AFTER ALL, I'M A HORRID
MONSTER TO THEM.

110
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,625
- MISS TALHO.

111
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:26,625
- GO BACK TO THE SHIP, EUREKA,
RIGHT NOW.

112
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,000
I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR YOU,
BUT TRY TO REMEMBER ONE THING.

113
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,666
YOU HAVE ALL OF US
AT YOUR SIDE.

114
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,625
- THE TEST MISSILE LAUNCH
WILL BE IN THREE HOURS.

115
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,083
THE MISSILE'S PRIMARY TARGET
WILL BE GREMIKOWA.

116
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,458
THIS SHIP SHOULD APPROACH
THE KUTE-CLASS TO THE LIMIT

117
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,500
OF THE ABSOLUTE SAFETY ZONE
AND ENTER A STANDBY ORBIT.

118
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,000
THE CLOSE-RANGE OBSERVATIONS
WILL BE HANDLED BY THE END.

119
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,250
- YOU'RE GOING TO
CRUSH ANOTHER CITY?

120
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,041
- COLONEL DEWEY IS CONCERNED
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS PLANET.

121
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:59,166
UNFORTUNATELY, SACRIFICING
A CITY OR TWO IS UNAVOIDABLE.

122
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,541
CHANGE COURSE TO 003.

123
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,708
DESTINATION: GREMIKOWA!

124
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,583
- THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
AN ATMOSPHERE

125
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,583
WHERE WE CAN TOAST
WITH BEERS IN HAND.

126
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,041
- ( camera shutter clicks )

127
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:27,041
- I SEE.  I'M SORRY I'VE MADE
SUCH DEMANDING REQUESTS.

128
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,875
I AM TRULY GRATEFUL
FOR THIS, DR. GREG.

129
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,250
- Axel:
GEKKO, DO YOU COPY?

130
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:36,375
THIS IS AXEL THURSTON
REPORTING FROM BELLFOREST.

131
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,083
I WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER
THE BOARD.

132
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,500
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS,
CONTACT WITH THE GEKKO WILL BE--

133
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,250
- OLD MAN, THEY'RE HERE.

134
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,500
- APPARENTLY, THE MILITARY
POLICE HAVE CAUGHT ON.

135
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,750
HE SAID THAT HE'S GOING TO
DELIVER THE BOARD BY PUTTING IT

136
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,500
UP ON THE LEY LINE.
- ON THE LEY LINE?

137
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,333
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?
WILL HE BE ALL RIGHT?

138
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,916
- GRAMPA.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,833
I'M TAKING THIS SHIP TO WHERE WE
CAN TRY TO MAKE CONTACT

140
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,541
WITH THE BOARD.
AND THAT'S IN GREMIKOWA.

141
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,875
- ( feedback whining )

142
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,958
- ( screaming )

143
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,750
- OLD MAN!

144
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,458
- HURRY UP.  AFTER HIM!

145
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,791
- HERE GOES.
- RIGHT.

146
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,250
- ISN'T IT ABOUT TIME
TO CUT THE CABLES?

147
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,083
- ( clicking )
- ( grunting )

148
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK THERE, OLD MAN?

149
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,250
- THE CABLE'S NOT COMING OFF.
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

150
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,875
DAMN IT, WHAT DO WE--
THIS IS BAD, OLD MAN.

151
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,458
- WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF ROAD.
- DON'T STOP!  KEEP IT MOVING.

152
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,458
IF YOU PUT THE BRAKES ON,
THE KITE WILL LOSE SPEED.

153
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,458
IF THAT HAPPENS, I WON'T GET
THE BOARD UP TO THE LEY LINE.

154
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,041
- THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

155
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:01,041
- UNTIL VERY RECENTLY, THAT BOY
WAS STILL WETTING HIS BED.

156
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,041
SINCE WHEN HAS HE BEEN
ABLE TO WALK ON HIS OWN

157
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,791
WITHOUT ME HAVING TO
PULL HIM ALONG BY THE HAND?

158
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,041
IT WAS AN INSTANT.

159
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,458
IT REALLY WAS
NOTHING MORE THAN AN INSTANT.

160
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,166
- HEY, HEY, OLD MAN!

161
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,791
- IN TIME,
HE'LL GROW TO BE AN ADULT.

162
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,958
HE DOESN'T NEED ME
TO HELP HIM ALONG WITH THAT.

163
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,458
THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'M GOING
TO MESS IN THAT KID'S AFFAIRS.

164
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,625
MY LAST JOB IS
TO DELIVER THIS BOARD.

165
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,166
AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
IT GETS DELIVERED.

166
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,458
- OLD MAN!

167
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,583
- CATCH THIS, RENTON!

168
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,458
- Man: FINAL ADJUSTMENTS
SHOW ALL BLUE LAMPS.

169
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:49,083
ZERO NUMBER TWO ORANGE, YOU HAVE
THREE SECONDS TO LAUNCH.

170
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,166
TWO, ONE...

171
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,458
- ( gasping )

172
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,500
- FIFTEEN SECONDS SINCE ZERO
NUMBER TWO ORANGE'S LANDING.

173
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,208
SIXTEEN, 17 SECONDS.

174
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,500
- Anemone: I DON'T WANT TO.
MY HEAD HURTS!

175
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,416
I DON'T WANT TO GO.  DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, DOMINIC.

176
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,583
DO SOMETHING!  OH!

177
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,541
- DAMN YOU!

178
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,791
- IT SEEMED YOU WERE HAVING
QUITE A FEW PROBLEMS

179
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,916
WITH OUR MR. ADVISOR, SIR.

180
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,416
A KUTE-CLASS COULD APPEAR
ANY MOMENT.

181
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,500
HAVE HER REPORT FOR OBSERVATIONS
AT THE CORALIAN IMMEDIATELY.

182
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,000
THAT'S AN ORDER
FROM COLONEL DEWEY.

183
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,041
- ANEMONE.

184
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,791
- ( grunts )

185
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,625
- THE CORAL SIGNALS. THEY'RE
SUDDENLY STARTING TO SURGE.

186
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,125
A KUTE-CLASS HAS APPEARED.

187
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,458
- OF ALL PLACES,
IT HAS TO BE HERE?

188
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,125
HEY, GIDGET, WHERE'S THE BOARD?

189
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,458
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO LOCATE IT YET.

190
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,791
- EUREKA.

191
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,916
- I HAVE TO GO TO NIRVASH.
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

192
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,125
- EUREKA.

193
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,958
- MY FRIENDS HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THIS AGAIN.

194
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,708
I CAN'T SIT STILL ANYMORE.

195
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,916
- OKAY, THEN.

196
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,208
ALL THE MORE REASON
TO GET THE BOARD.

197
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,791
- LEADER.
- IS IT THE BOARD?

198
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,458
- NO, ARMY SHIP APPROACHING
AT 10:00.

199
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,958
- A WHAT?
- YOU'RE SURE IT'S THE GEKKO?

200
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,958
- WE'RE ON A COLLISION COURSE.

201
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,958
AT PRESENT, OUR PATHS
WILL INTERSECT.

202
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,958
- PLEASE, YOU MUST
AVOID ALL BATTLE.

203
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,583
OUR MISSION IS
TO OBSERVE THE KUTE

204
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,958
AND ANTIBODY CORALIANS.  TELL
THAT TO THE PILOT OF THE END.

205
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,458
- Anemone:
OH, SO THAT SHIP IS HERE.

206
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,958
THAT'S EXCELLENT.
WELCOME, LOOK-ALIKE OF THE END.

207
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,208
I'M GONNA PUSH YOU AROUND.

208
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,208
- OH, NO!  IT'S THAT WEIRD KLF
THAT FOUGHT THE NIRVASH

209
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,708
BACK IN SALISA ORNE.

210
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:19,500
- WE SHOULD CHANGE COURSE.
- THE LEY LINE HAS A FAST FLOW.

211
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,000
THERE IS ONLY ONE WINDOW
OF OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE BOARD.

212
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,000
IF WE MISS IT, IT'S OVER.

213
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,833
- WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER
THE BOARD WILL GET HERE.

214
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,791
- TARGET IS APPROACHING.
THREE MINUTES TO CONTACT.

215
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:36,291
- HOLLAND, WHAT?
- Renton: NIRVASH, GOING OUT.

216
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,500
- RENTON!

217
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,541
- THAT'S ALL.  THERE ARE NO
CHANGES TO THE INTERFACE

218
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,250
OTHER THAN THE MODE SHIFTS.
GOT THAT?

219
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:49,041
- I KNOW THE BOARD IS GONNA
BE THERE.  I'M SURE OF IT.

220
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,041
HOLLAND.

221
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,791
- GIDGET, DO IT.
OPEN UP THE CATAPULT RIGHT NOW.

222
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,083
- RIGHT.

223
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,916
- ALL RIGHT,
IT'S TIME TO GO, EUREKA.

224
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:19,208
- DON'T BEG.  DO IT YOURSELF
OR ELSE YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING.

225
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,041
I REALLY HOPE YOU KNOW THAT
I BELIEVE IN YOU, GRAMPS.

226
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,333
I BELIEVE IN YOU!

227
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,666
- WHAT?  THAT THING.

228
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,750
COMING WITHOUT A BOARD?
ARE THEY MOCKING ME?

229
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,750
IF YOU WANNA DIE THAT MUCH,
I'LL BE HAPPY TO KILL YOU.

230
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,083
BASCUDE!

231
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,666
- RENTON.
- IT'S GRAMPS!

232
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,625
- WHAT WAS THAT?  STUFF LIKE
THAT IRRITATES ME.

233
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,500
- WHAT WAS THAT JUST NOW?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

234
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,000
DID YOU GET IT?
- NO GOOD.  IT WAS TOO FAST.

235
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,708
THE GUN SIGHT CAMERAS
COULDN'T KEEP UP WITH IT.

236
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:29,916
- CAN IT BE THAT THE typeZERO
HAS ACTUALLY EVOLVED?

237
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,791
- Renton: AMAZING!

238
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,250
THIS SPEC TWO IS JUST AMAZING.

239
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,250
- LET'S GO, COME ON.

240
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,708
- YEAH.
LET'S GO, TOGETHER.

241
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,166
- A SEVEN SWELL?

242
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,458
- NO, THIS IS MUCH MORE
BRILLIANT THAN THAT.

243
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,666
THIS-- THIS IS THE REAL.

244
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,500
- WHAT IS THAT?  THERE'S NO WAY
I'M EVER GONNA LET MYSELF LOSE

245
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,916
TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

246
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,833
DIE!  DIE!  DIE!
DIE AGAIN AND DIE AGAIN!

247
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,208
( gasps )

248
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,041
- ( screaming )

249
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,125
- WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

250
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,750
NO.  NO.  NO.  NO.  NO!

251
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,416
- ( crying )
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

252
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,625
- PLEASE.

253
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,666
HOLD MY HAND.
HOLD MY HAND.

254
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,708
- THE SIGNALS FOR THE ANTIBODY
CORALIANS ARE STARTING

255
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,875
TO GO AWAY
AND ARE GETTING WEAKER.

256
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,708
- AFTER WE RETRIEVE THE NIRVASH,

257
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,750
TAKE THIS SHIP
TO WHERE THE ZONE EMERGED.

258
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,041
PERHAPS THERE MIGHT
BE A FEW CIVILIANS

259
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,125
WHO MANAGED TO SURVIVE.
- ROGER THAT.

260
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,750
- ( whimpering )

261
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,750
- ANEMONE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

262
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,500
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
OUT THERE.

263
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,916
- Woman:
WE TOLD YOU TO GIVE PRIORITY

264
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,750
TO THE OBSERVATION
OF THE ANTIBODY CORALIANS.

265
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,875
I MUST REPORT THIS INCIDENT
TO THE COLONEL.

266
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,458
- WHAT?  IF WE LEAVE THE GEKKO
ALONE, SOMEDAY IT'LL PROVE

267
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,875
TO BE AN ENORMOUS THREAT
TO US.  NOW WE CAN CRUSH IT.

268
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,750
- WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT A MERE
BUNCH OF PIRATES TO DO NOW?

269
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,875
THE WILL OF OUR GALLANT COLONEL

270
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,625
IS AS BIG AS
THIS PLANET ITSELF.

271
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,208
- ( whimpering )

272
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,333
- HELLO, NIRVASH.

273
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,791
- RENTON.

274
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,791
I SEE HIS INTEGRITY HASN'T
CHANGED ONE BIT.

275
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,916
- WHAT?

276
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,958
A SHIPPING STATEMENT?
WHY ME?

277
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,916
IT'S FROM GRAMPS.

278
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,916
- Axel: GREETINGS.  FIRST
OF ALL, ARE YOU DOING WELL?

279
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,916
THE TOWN YOU WERE BORN IS
WEARING A VEIL OF SNOW

280
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,916
WAITING EAGERLY FOR THE ARRIVAL
OF VIBRANT SPRING.

281
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,958
SINCE YOU LEFT HERE, YOU HAVEN'T
SENT ME A SINGLE LETTER.

282
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,708
IF YOU HAD RETURNED
WITH EVERYTHING UP IN THE AIR,

283
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,875
I WAS CONSIDERING PUNCHING
YOUR LIGHTS OUT.

284
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,208
BUT IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND YOUR ANSWERS,

285
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,500
THAT'S FINE AS WELL.

286
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,666
THE CURRENT SITUATION
HAS CREATED A NEED

287
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,125
FOR ME TO GET OUT
OF TOWN AS WELL.

288
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,750
FOR A WHILE, I'LL LOUNGE AROUND
WHERE I CAN STAY OUT OF SIGHT,

289
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,333
BUT SOMEDAY I PROMISE I WILL
RETURN TO BELLFOREST.

290
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,833
I WILL RETURN AND WAIT
AS LONG AS I CAN FOR YOU

291
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,583
TO COME BACK TO THE PLACE
WE CALLED HOME.

292
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,416
OH, AND BRING THAT
NICE YOUNG LADY.

293
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,833
- ( sniffling )

294
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,500
- Man:
A CORALIAN AND A HUMAN.

295
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:24,375
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FAIRY TALE.

296
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,041
- Woman: THE ZERO NUMBER TWO'S
TEST LAUNCH WAS A SUCCESS.

297
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,041
THE ANTIBODY CORALIANS APPEARED

298
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,250
180 KILOMETERS NORTH
OF THE ORANGE IMPACT POINT.

299
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,083
JUST LIKE ZERO ONE, THE TARGET'S
ACTIVITY AREA IS WITHIN

300
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,541
THE RADIUS OF THE KUTE-CLASS
THAT APPEARED WITH IT.

301
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:43,041
OH, YES, AND THERE SEEMS TO BE
A LIMIT TO ITS ACTIVITY TIME.

302
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,041
- I SEE.
A VERY INTERESTING NUMBER.

303
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:50,083
1,246 SECONDS--
RECOGNIZE IT?

304
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,041
- YES, IT'S EXACTLY
THE SAME SPAN OF TIME

305
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,083
AS THE SEVEN SWELL EFFECT
