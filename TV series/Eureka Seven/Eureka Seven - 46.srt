1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,750
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,000
- WE'RE ALMOST DONE
SPECIFYING THE LOCATION

3
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,458
OF THE CONTROL CLUSTER.

4
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,000
- ( beeping )

5
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,833
- POINT ALPHA 2-2-C-5

6
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,500
IN THE CENTER OF
THE TENSION MOUNTAIN RANGE.

7
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,000
- SO, YOU'RE CERTAIN
THAT'S WHERE IT'S LOCATED?

8
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,708
- YES.  WE'RE JUST ABOUT
100% SURE THAT'S WHERE IT IS.

9
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,041
THOUGH WITH THE MARGIN OF ERROR,
IT COULD BE PLUS OR MINUS

10
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,166
THREE KILOMETERS.

11
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:10,958
- EXCELLENT WORK.

12
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,958
- ( gasping )

13
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,708
- LET'S PROCEED WITH
OPERATION NENOKATUS

14
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,375
- All: YES, SIR!

15
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,333
- Maurice: MAMA, I BROUGHT
THE FIRST AID KIT WITH ME.

16
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,041
- Maeter:
I MADE THE TOWEL WET.

17
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,458
- Eureka: THANK YOU.

18
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,916
- Maeter:
IS PUKEY GONNA DIE?

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,458
- OF COURSE HE ISN'T.

20
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,458
HE'S JUST GOT A FEVER.

21
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,458
- ( Maeter crying )
BUT...

22
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,750
BUT...

23
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,416
- RENTON.

24
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,750
RENTON?

25
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,083
SWALLOW THIS.
IT'S MEDICINE.

26
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,083
- ( coughs )

27
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,416
- ( sighs )

28
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,416
( gasps )
IT'S DRIED UP ALREADY.

29
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,166
GET THE TOWEL WET AGAIN.

30
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,416
- HUH?

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,416
- MAMA?

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,125
- ( gasps )

33
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,458
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

34
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,458
- YOU CAN TRUST IN OUR
TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.

35
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,125
IT WILL BE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SHIP THAN BEFORE.

36
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,250
- HUMPH. ( gasps )
- HMM?

37
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,750
YOU WANT SOME?

38
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,125
- UHH...

39
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,333
NO.  I REALLY DETEST SWEETS.

40
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,958
- YOU'RE IRRITATED BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUGAR

41
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,166
GOING ON IN YOUR BRAIN.
( swallows )

42
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,833
- ( groans )

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,958
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING?

44
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,958
- I'M JUST GOING TO RAISE
THE GENERATOR OUTPUT BY 3%.

45
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,458
- AND HOW MUCH PRESSURE
DO YOU THINK

46
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,166
THAT'S GONNA CAUSE ON OUR END?

47
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,208
WE NEED TIME TO MAKE CHANGES
TO THE CONTROL SUB-ROUTINE.

48
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,166
- BUT WE'RE FINE
THE WAY WE ARE NOW.

49
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,833
- NO.  WE'LL HAVE TO
SHUT IT DOWN

50
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,333
AND REBUILD IT FROM SCRATCH.

51
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,833
- THE EXTRA LOAD
ON THE SOFTWARE

52
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,833
WILL BE LESS THAN 0.5%.

53
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,541
- IT'LL BE MORE LIKE 0.7.

54
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,833
- ( grunts )

55
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,041
YOU HAD ENOUGH?

56
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,166
- I'M NOT EVEN CLOSE!

57
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,166
NOT WITH SO--
- STOP, RIGHT NOW.

58
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,500
MOVE.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

59
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,875
IT'S JUST A GUY THING.

60
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,250
- HOW COME WHEN
MEN GET TOGETHER,

61
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,750
THEY ALWAYS
ACT SO STUPID?

62
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,125
- HUH?

63
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,166
- IT'S TRUE THAT
NOT LONG AGO

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,666
WE KILLED MEN WHO WERE
WORKING UNDER YOU.

65
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,375
BUT I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF APOLOGIZING FOR THAT.

66
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,625
- HUH?

67
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,541
- BECAUSE THE PROBLEM
WON'T BE SOLVED

68
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,875
WITH APOLOGIES.

69
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,041
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'LL BE SATISFIED

70
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,625
BY US SAYING WE'RE SORRY

71
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:58,125
ANY MORE THAN YOU'LL BE
BY PUNCHING HIM.

72
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,083
THAT SAID,
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO

73
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,875
PUT ALL OF THAT
ASIDE FOR NOW.

74
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,500
WE HAVE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO DO HERE.

75
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,208
- OTHER THINGS NEED
TO BE DONE FIRST.

76
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,458
- ( grunts )

77
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,041
- YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

78
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,250
WHAT PART OF PUNCHING THIS

79
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,000
HALFWAY TO A HOSPITAL
PATIENT GUY IS FUN?

80
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,541
- ( grunts )
STOP IT.

81
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,416
- IF ALL OF YOU ARE
K.L.F. PILOTS,

82
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,416
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS, RIGHT?

83
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,666
I CHALLENGE ANY OF YOU
TO HAVE THE BALLS

84
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,416
TO GO OUT IN THIS THING
AND SURVIVE.

85
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
THIS MAN FEELS SO MUCH PAIN

86
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,125
THAT IT SEEMS LIKE HALF OF
HIS SOUL IS BEING TAKEN AWAY.

87
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,583
AND YET HE STILL FIGHTS.

88
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,083
- STOP IT, PLEASE.

89
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,708
- SHUT UP!
I'M NOT GONNA STOP.

90
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,250
DO YOU ALL WANT
TO KNOW WHY?

91
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,583
BECAUSE THE--

92
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,083
THE WORLD MIGHT BE
COMING TO AN END.

93
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,583
THAT IS IF WE LEAVE
EVERYTHING UP TO DEWEY.

94
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,583
- ( grumbles )

95
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,833
- OPERATION NENOKATUS
WILL START IN THREE HOURS.

96
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,583
- TAKE COURSE 106

97
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,875
AND HEAD TO
THE RENDEZVOUS POINT

98
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,458
TO JOIN THE THIRD
DISTRICT ARMY.

99
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,416
THE OPERATION BRIEF
WILL BE OPENED

100
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,208
ONLY AFTER THE RENDEZVOUS
OCCURS.

101
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,666
- WE WANT NO EXCUSES.

102
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,083
WE REQUIRE YOU TO ACT
JUST AS YOU'VE BEEN BRIEFED.

103
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,583
USE EVERYTHING
IN YOUR ABILITIES

104
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,875
TO DO AWAY WITH
ANY AND EVERY OBSTACLE.

105
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,375
- ( groans )

106
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,166
- HIS FEVER'S NOT LOWERING.

107
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,791
- ( grunts )

108
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,958
- DOES IT HURT BAD?

109
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,791
- ( exhales )

110
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,625
- OH, RENTON.

111
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,291
- Maeter: MAMA?
- ( gasps )

112
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,791
- CAN I COME SIT WITH YOU?

113
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,958
- YES, OF COURSE.

114
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,291
- MAMA, I'M SCARED.

115
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,291
- I'M AFRAID THIS TENT
MIGHT GET BLOWN AWAY.

116
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,000
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

117
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,666
- MAMA, YOU'RE WARM.

118
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,333
YOU SMELL NICE.

119
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,083
( grunts )

120
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,666
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
MAETER, WHAT'S WRONG?

121
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,333
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

122
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,000
SOMEWHERE--

123
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,000
SOMEWHERE WAY WAY BACK,

124
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,625
I WAS COVERED IN SOMETHING
THAT WAS WARM AND SMELLED NICE.

125
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,833
- ( gasps )
- STOP IT, MAETER.

126
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,333
- BUT THEN IT--

127
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,708
IT SUDDENLY WENT
REALLY COLD.

128
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,458
- ( gasps )
- I TOLD YOU, STOP IT!

129
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,166
- ( gasps )

130
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,500
- ( crying )

131
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,666
I'M SO SORRY.

132
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,333
I WAS THE ONE

133
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,041
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MAMA...

134
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,041
- MAMA, YOU'RE OUR MAMA NOW.

135
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,500
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE OUR MAMA.

136
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,708
- MAMA!

137
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,375
( sobbing )

138
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,583
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

139
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,208
- WE ADDED A HOMING LASER
ON A RUSH JOB,

140
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,375
INCREASED THE HANGAR SIZE,
AND NOT ONLY THAT--

141
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,416
- THAT'S NOT IT.
THE COLOR.

142
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,708
- HUH?

143
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,541
- A BATTLESHIP
SHOULD BE SOPPING WET

144
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,125
FROM THE HOT BLOOD
RUNNING IN THE MEN

145
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,458
WHO SERVE ABOARD IT.

146
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,708
- SO THAT MEANS BRIGHT RED?

147
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,875
- MM-HMM.

148
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,458
- ( sighs )

149
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:11,458
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
MEN IN THE MILITARY.

150
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,750
- YOU'RE TIRED FROM
PILOTING THE 303,

151
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,958
AND YOU PULL THIS
ACT OF STUBBORNNESS?

152
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,083
- YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

153
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,416
- HUH?

154
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,458
- I'M AFRAID.

155
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,750
- ( gasps )

156
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,416
( sighs )

157
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,416
- I SAID THAT I WOULD
SAVE THE WORLD.

158
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,416
BY US MAKING A STAND

159
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,083
AND FIGHTING AND WINNING,

160
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,958
I BELIEVE THAT
THIS PLANET WILL BE SAVED.

161
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,416
- SO DO I.

162
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,208
- THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

163
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,166
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT.

164
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,166
IF I SURVIVE,

165
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,208
I LIVE WITH YOU

166
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,958
AND THE KID THAT YOU'RE
CARRYING INSIDE OF YOU.

167
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,791
DO I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO LIVE THAT LIFE?

168
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,458
ME, THE MAN WHO
KILLED CHARLES AND RAY?

169
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,791
- ( door opens )
- HEY, LEADER.

170
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,291
THE ARMY'S MADE ITS MOVE.

171
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,125
THE LINES HERE
ARE ABOUT TO CRASH

172
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,125
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING
SO MUCH INFORMATION

173
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,125
FROM ALL THE DJ'S
AND REF BOARDERS.

174
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,125
LOOKS LIKE THE ARMY'S DEPLOYED
ON A WORLDWIDE SCALE.

175
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,125
- THAT MEANS THEY MUST HAVE
FOUND THE CONTROL CLUSTER.

176
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,458
GET WOZ AND GIDGET
WORKING ON THIS RIGHT AWAY.

177
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,500
- ROGER.

178
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,416
- LET'S DO WHAT WE CAN.

179
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,458
TO BE AFRAID AND TO WORRY,

180
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,708
WE'LL DO THAT AFTER
IT'S ALL OVER.

181
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,958
- YOU GOT IT.

182
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,833
- ( knocking on door )
- HMM?

183
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:47,958
- ( door opens )

184
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,166
- CAPTAIN.

185
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,166
- THE FEDERATION FORCE
IS ON THE MOVE.

186
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,166
- YES, I KNOW.

187
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,833
- THIS IS YOUR
LAST CHANCE TO LEAVE.

188
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,000
DOMINIC,
ARE YOU SURE

189
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,041
YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR
DESTINY WITH THIS SHIP?

190
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,416
- OF COURSE, SIR.

191
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,875
I THOUGHT I ALREADY WAS
CONSIDERED PART OF THE CREW.

192
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,833
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

193
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,166
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

194
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,916
- I'M SURE SHE'LL
UNDERSTAND ALL THIS.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,208
SOME DAY.

196
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,541
- SOME DAY, HUH?

197
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,750
THE FACT THAT
YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT

198
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,208
IS A SIGN YOU'RE YOUNG.
( chuckles )

199
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,208
( sighs )

200
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,875
SO, I SEE THAT THING

201
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,208
IS STILL TRYING TO
LAY CLAIM TO YOUR BED.

202
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,166
- WELL, YES.

203
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,541
- ARE YOU KEEPING IT
PROPERLY FED?

204
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,166
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S LOST SOME WEIGHT.

205
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,541
- ( door opens, closes )

206
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,583
- ( sighs )

207
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,208
Dominic: ANEMONE.

208
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,875
- ( grunts )

209
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:10,833
- ( gasps )

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,875
- ( shouting )

211
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,916
- DON'T THRASH AROUND.
YOU GOTTA LAY STILL.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,125
- AAH!
- I'M SORRY.

213
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,916
I'M SORRY.

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,875
- ( grunts )

215
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,666
- RENTON.

216
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,000
RENTON?

217
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,625
OH, PLEASE.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,875
( gasps )

219
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,958
- WHAT'S WRONG?  MAMA?

220
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,416
- ( shouts )

221
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,083
- MAMA?

222
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,583
- MAMA?
- NO!

223
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,291
AAH!

224
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,750
( screams )

225
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,958
- Kids: MAMA!

226
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,958
- ( grunts )

227
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,958
- OOH.

228
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,666
- LOOK, MAMA'S TURNED
INTO A BUTTERFLY.

229
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:35,958
- MAMA?

230
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,000
- I'M SORRY.

231
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,083
I-- I CAN'T BE

232
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,666
YOUR MAMA AFTER ALL.

233
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,000
- BUT WHY NOT?

234
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,000
MAMA, YOU'RE OUR MAMA.

235
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,250
- I MEAN,

236
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,666
I'M SO DIFFERENT
FROM ALL OF YOU.

237
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,916
( gasps )

238
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,208
- Kids: MAMA!

239
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,375
- ( giggles )

240
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,375
- SIGNAL RECEIVED FROM THE
IMMIGRANT SPACESHIP CABORTIS.

241
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,708
CONTROL OF
ORATORIO NUMBER EIGHT

242
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,250
AS WELL AS FOUR ADDITIONAL
GUSTAV CLASS SHIPS

243
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,250
HAS BEEN GRANTED TO US.

244
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,875
- SEVEN DAYS AND FIVE HOURS
SINCE THE OPERATION BEGAN.

245
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,416
IT'S TAKING WAY
TOO MUCH TIME.

246
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,958
- NO, IT'S NOT.

247
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,375
YOU SHOULD BE COMPLIMENTING
THE EXCELLENT SECURITY PROGRAM

248
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,625
THE SAGES HAVE GIVEN US.

249
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,041
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

250
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,291
IT CAN TAKE UP TO FIVE DAYS

251
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,708
TO LOWER
ORATORIO NUMBER EIGHT

252
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,916
FROM ITS ANCHOR POINT,
AND INTO POSITION

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,750
USING AN ORBITAL ELEVATOR.

254
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,750
IF THE DELAY IS ONLY TWO DAYS,
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

255
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,416
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT,
LOOK AT THE COLONEL.

256
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,250
HE'S LOOKING VERY RELAXED.

257
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,750
THE COLONEL HAS
SEEN THROUGH IT ALL

258
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,875
AND HAS THINGS
UNDER CONTROL.

259
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,750
- WE'VE GOT
THE RENDEZVOUS POINT.

260
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,083
IT'S IN THE TENSION
MOUNTAIN RANGE.

261
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,416
- IN OTHER WORDS,
THE ROOF OF THE WORLD.

262
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,833
IT'S PRETTY FAR.

263
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,416
- YEAH.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET.

264
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,083
- YOU'RE USING
AN ALTERED SIGNAL

265
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,416
HIDDEN BEHIND A DUMMY
SHORT-WAVE CARRIER.

266
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,083
DO ALL LIFTERS COMMIT
ILLEGAL ACTS LIKE THIS?

267
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,750
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

268
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,791
IN ORDER TO PROTECT
SOMETHING IMPORTANT,

269
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,916
WE BREAK THE LAW.

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,125
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS DO.

271
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,791
- SO NOW I'VE FALLEN
TO THE SAME LEVEL AS THUGS.

272
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,791
THIS IS A RECKLESS MOVE.

273
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,458
GOING AGAINST 13,000 SHIPS,

274
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,791
APPROXIMATELY 80% OF
THE ENTIRE FEDERATION AIR FORCE,

275
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,000
WITH JUST TWO.

276
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,750
- WE CAN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT

277
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,541
BECAUSE WE ONLY
HAVE TWO SHIPS.

278
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,125
- IT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

279
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,458
- YEAH, IT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

280
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,458
BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE ANYWAY.

281
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,000
AND IT HAS TO BE BY US.

282
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,208
- ORATORIO NUMBER EIGHT
IN PLACE.

283
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,791
HOLDING SCHEDULED ALTITUDE.

284
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,166
LOOKS TOWARDS 8:00!

285
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,166
IT'LL ENTER VISIBLE
OBSERVATION RANGE FROM THERE.

286
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,041
- ( all gasping )

287
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,208
- ( kids laughing )

288
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,250
- ( sighs )

289
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,166
I...

290
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,708
( grunts )

291
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,208
- RENTON.
YOU'RE FINALLY AWAKE.

292
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,208
( gasps  )

293
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,458
- ( grunts )

294
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,000
BEAUTIFUL.

295
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,041
- OHH.

296
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,875
- YOU'RE REALLY BEAUTIFUL,
EUREKA.

297
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,250
I THINK

298
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,083
THOSE WINGS LOOK
REALLY GOOD ON YOU.

299
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,083
- ( gasps )

300
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,000
RENTON!

301
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,750
- EUREKA.

302
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,875
- I--

303
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,875
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,
RENTON.

304
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,541
I WANT TO BE
WITH YOU FOREVER.

305
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,250
- ME TOO.

306
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,250
TOGETHER FOREVER.

307
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,041
IT'S A PROMISE.

308
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,041
- ( kids sigh )

309
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,250
- YOUR WOUNDS,
ARE THEY ALL RIGHT?

310
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,250
- YEAH.
THEY STILL HURT A LOT,

311
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,916
BUT I'LL MANAGE SOMEHOW.

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,250
- I'M SO GLAD.

313
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,625
- SO I GUESS YOU WERE
NURSING ME ALL NIGHT, HUH?

314
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,666
- THE KIDS WERE THE ONES
WHO TOOK CARE OF YOU.

315
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,875
- Linck: SOMETHING OVER THERE!
- Maeter: WHERE, WHERE?

316
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,291
- THEY HELPED ME TOO.

317
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,708
- CAN I TOUCH THEM?

318
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,041
- ( sighs )

319
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,750
- IT'S SO WARM.

320
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,333
- Linck: MAMA, RENTON!

321
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,125
THERE'S SOMETHING
REALLY AMAZING OVER HERE.

322
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,708
- HMM?

323
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,791
WOW!  AMAZING.

324
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,291
SUCH A HUGE
PIECE OF AMBER.

325
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,041
- Maeter: HEY, WAIT.

326
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,666
THOSE ARE FOOTPRINTS,
AREN'T THEY?

327
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,000
- THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.
( giggles )

328
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,541
- ( chuckles )

329
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,041
- Kids: WOW.

330
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,708
- I'M PRETTY SURE THIS
WASN'T HERE YESTERDAY.

331
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,833
- ( Nirvash powering up )
- HUH?

332
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,541
- HE'S FEELING BETTER.

333
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,333
- Jurgens: MY COMRADES,

334
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,458
WE ARE ABOUT TO
ENGAGE IN A BATTLE

335
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,875
THAT HAS NO GUARANTEES
OF VICTORY.

336
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,041
THIS IS THE WORST
TYPE OF OPERATION I KNOW.

337
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,708
STEP FORWARD IF YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.

338
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,333
IF YOU'RE READY TO FIGHT.

339
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,208
- CAPTAIN.

340
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,125
NO ONE WISHES TO DROP OUT.

341
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,541
- I GIVE MY THANKS
TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

342
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,375
BUT SOME DAY SOON,

343
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,416
YOU'RE CERTAIN TO REGRET
THE DECISION YOU'VE MADE TODAY,

344
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,916
AND CURSE ME FOREVER.

345
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,958
- THERE ARE DARK CLOUDS
WHERE YOU'RE HEADED.

346
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,583
- WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

347
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,791
- HOWEVER,

348
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,416
ONCE PAST THE CLOUDS,
THERE IS MUCH LIGHT.

349
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,083
- SO I'VE HEARD.

350
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,750
WELL, I GUESS IT'S
TIME TO GET STARTED.

351
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,750
- YEAH, I'M WITH YOU.
- RIGHT.

352
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,083
- IT IS NOW PAST 6:00.

353
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,500
THE ARRIVAL OF ALL SHIPS
AT SCHEDULED DESTINATIONS

354
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,833
HAS BEEN CONFIRMED.

355
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,083
THE MARGIN OF ERROR
IS THREE MINUTES.

356
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,250
- ORATORIO NUMBER EIGHT
AND ALL GUSTAV CLASS SHIPS

357
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,041
ARE OPERATING
WITHOUT PROBLEMS.

358
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,750
THREE HOURS UNTIL
FULL DEPLOYMENT IS COMPLETE.

359
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,416
- COMMENCING TO
FORWARD DATA SETTINGS

360
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,666
TARGETING THE TENSION
MOUNTAIN RANGE NOW.

361
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,458
- STATUS OF ALL
FLAGSHIPS CONFIRMED.

362
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,125
ALL SYSTEMS HAVE
PASSED THE BORDERLINE.

363
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,958
OPERATION NEOKATUS

364
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,791
COMMENCING COUNTDOWN.

365
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,958
- Dewey:
10,000 YEARS AGO,

366
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,750
THIS SYSTEM WAS
MADE TO BRING

367
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,916
WEALTH AND PROSPERITY
TO THE LAND.

368
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,875
WITH IT, WE WILL RID
THE LAND OF ALL EVIL.

369
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,291
WHEN WE, THE HUMAN RACE,
LIVE ON

370
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,125
AND SEIZE COMPLETE
CONTROL OF THIS PLANET.

371
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,291
YOU WILL SEE
THAT THIS SYSTEM

372
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,458
WAS USED FOR ITS
ORIGINAL PURPOSE.

373
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,125
THERE IS NO ONE
WHO CAN STOP US NOW.

374
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,375
- AND THEY'RE OFF.

375
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,666
- YEAH.

376
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,166
BUT IT'S NOT OVER YET.

377
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,416
WE STILL HAVE THIS TO DO.

378
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,458
- IT'S STILL TOO EARLY
TO JUST WAIT

379
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,083
AND LEAVE IT TO
THE GODS, HUH?

380
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,833
- HEY, RENTON?

381
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,833
WHAT'S THAT OVER THERE?
- HUH?

382
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,500
- MAMA, LOOK AT
THE COMPAC DRIVE.

383
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,500
- HUH?

384
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,166
- IT'S TELLING US
TO COME OVER.

385
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,125
- NOW I'M SURE OF IT.

386
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,416
THIS IS THE PLACE THAT
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

387
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,208
- NOW, IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR YOU TO HEAD OUT.

388
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:37,666
SHOW ME THE BEST DANCE
THAT YOU CAN PERFORM.

389
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,208
GOOD GIRL.

390
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,083
- IT'S REALLY BIG.

391
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,208
- Maurice: HEY, RENTON,
ARE WE GONNA BE LOST AGAIN?

392
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,208
- Renton:
NO, WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

393
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,916
I'M SURE THERE'S AN
ENTRANCE SOMEWHERE.

394
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,416
UH...

395
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,333
- RENTON,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

396
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,916
- ( gasps )

397
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,833
SIS!

398
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,916
- TO BE CONTINUED.

THE BOY AND THE GIRL FIND OUT
THE TRUTH BEHIND IT ALL.

402
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,791
A CERTAIN DECISION IS MADE

403
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:12,041
FOR THE TWO WHO
HAVE CHOSEN THEIR FUTURE.
