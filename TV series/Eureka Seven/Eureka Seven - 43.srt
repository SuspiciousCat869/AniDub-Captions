1
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:21,000
- ( theme music playing )
- ( vocalizing )

2
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,000
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,958
- Dominic: THE WORLD
HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED.

4
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,208
I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN WISHING
FOR IT TO HAPPEN.

5
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,708
- HEY, HOW IS IT OVER HERE?

6
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,125
- I THOUGHT I WAS PREPARED
TO SEE THE SIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

7
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,125
BUT STILL...

8
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,166
WHAT IS IT?

9
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,333
WHAT IS THIS FEELING
I HAVE?

10
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:25,166
HUH?
( gags )

11
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,375
( vomiting, coughing )

12
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,958
HUH?

13
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,916
ANEMONE.

14
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,416
- ( sliding door whooshes )

15
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,708
- ( footsteps )

16
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,541
- HUH?

17
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,000
AN ANEMONE?
- HUH?

18
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,083
IS THAT WHAT IT'S CALLED?

19
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,791
WELL, IT'S JUST
A COINCIDENCE.

20
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,208
I REALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT FLOWERS.

21
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,416
- DO YOU KNOW THE MEANING
BEHIND AN ANEMONE?

22
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,250
- UM, SORRY, NO.

23
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,208
- DISAPPEARANCE OF HOPE.

24
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,250
- EH.

25
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,500
- YOU MEANT IT
AS AN INSULT

26
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,375
FOR ALL MY FAILURES,
DIDN'T YOU?

27
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,041
- NO!  I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT FLOWERS.

28
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,875
- YOU DON'T KNOW?

29
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:33,083
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

30
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,250
YOU DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS
I FIGHT

31
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,750
OR WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO ME

32
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,000
IF I KEEP FAILING
IN MY BATTLES.

33
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,750
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

34
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,291
I-- HUH?

35
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,083
- TELL ME THEN,

36
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,958
WILL YOU SAVE ME?

37
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,958
ARE YOU WILLING TO SAVE ME
FROM THIS?

38
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,500
- OF COURSE.
I'D BE HONORED...

39
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,958
ANEMONE.

40
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,500
- ( punch lands )
- Dominic: AAH!

41
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,958
( grunts )

42
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,666
- YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
FEEL THAT WAY.

43
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,583
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME.

44
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,541
- ( gasps )
NO, YOU'RE WRONG!

45
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,083
- STOP IT!

46
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,041
DON'T CLING TO ME
DESPERATELY.

47
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,458
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

48
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,833
- UNDERGROUND,
THE GENUINE PROMISED LAND.

49
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,583
- BUT THE SKY LOOKS
BRIGHT AND SUNNY.

50
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,375
EVERYONE IS UP ABOVE THE SKY,
RIGHT?

51
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,291
- I THINK SO.

52
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,458
- Linck: I WONDER
WHAT HAPPENED TO HOLLAND.

53
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,250
- Maurice: LAST TIME WE SAW HIM
HE WAS FIGHTING A BATTLE.

54
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,416
- Linck: DID HE DIE?

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,458
- Maeter: WHAT ABOUT THAT
SMELLY OLD MAN?

56
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,458
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

57
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,875
I MISS HOLLAND AND TALHO
AND MATTHIEU.

58
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,458
- STOP IT, LINCK.
- Children: HUH?

59
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,666
- PLEASE, MOMMA,
I WANNA GO BACK.

60
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,833
- NO, LINCK,
WE CAN'T GO BACK YET.

61
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,625
- ( crying )
I WANNA GO.

62
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,916
- I WANT YOU TO STOP CRYING
AND LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,583
WE HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT
TO DO BEFORE WE HEAD BACK.

64
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,750
- Renton:
YEAH, BUT...

65
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,000
WHAT DO WE DO AND WHERE
SHOULD WE DO IT?

66
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,458
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

67
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,041
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW?

68
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,958
EUREKA, YOU WERE ABLE TO TALK
TO LADY SAKUYA.

69
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,666
AND BESIDES--
- I DON'T KNOW.

70
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,791
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T.

71
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,375
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

72
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,541
- ( sighs )

73
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,958
WHERE IS THIS?

74
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,375
WHERE ARE WE?

75
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,291
- REFUGEES ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE?

76
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,916
- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU,
ANEMONE.

77
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,875
- ( laughs )

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,125
- ( car door closes )

79
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,291
- ( knocks )
- HUH?

80
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:55,916
WHAT'S THIS?

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,083
- IT'S AN ORDER.
- Anemone: DEWEY!

82
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,750
HURRY UP!

83
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,916
- THE SELECTION OF THE NEXT
PILOT FOR TheEND IN WARSAW?

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,791
( gasps )
COLONEL!

85
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,875
I'M SORRY, ANEMONE,

86
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,541
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT
I CAN THINK OF TO SAVE YOU.

87
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,125
- ( tires screech )

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,250
- ( giggling )

89
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:40,208
- WHO IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?
( giggling )

90
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,166
- SO WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO NOW?

91
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,541
- Linck: HEY!
- HUH?

92
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,541
- THE WATER HERE
IS REAL SALTY.

93
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,041
- HUH?

94
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,458
UGH.

95
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,833
IT TASTES LIKE TEARS.

96
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,541
- ( moans )

97
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,166
HUH?

98
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,250
- Maeter: DID THE SMELLY OLD MAN
LEAVE THAT BEHIND?

99
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,833
- I FOUND IT
IN THE NIRVASH.

100
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,500
- WELL, THEN, MAYBE MASTER NORB
LEFT IT THERE ON PURPOSE.

101
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,500
- MOMMA, HURRY UP
AND OPEN IT.

102
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,000
SO WHAT DOES IT SAY?

103
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,000
- Maeter: I CAN'T READ IT.

104
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,458
- ME NEITHER.

105
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,750
- Renton: EARTH?
- UM, WHAT'S AN EARTH?

106
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,416
- EARTH IS THE PLANET
THAT HUMANS USED TO LIVE ON

107
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,583
BEFORE THEY CAME
TO OUR PLANET.

108
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,250
- LET ME GET
A GOOD LOOK, MOMMA.

109
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,083
- CALM DOWN,
I'M OPENING IT.

110
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,458
- HEY, IT'S THE SAME
AS THAT.

111
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:14,208
- HMM, OH-SHUN.

112
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,791
IT'S CALLED AN "OCEAN."

113
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,250
- OCEAN.

114
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,583
( gasps )

115
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,000
- ( waves crashing )

116
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,083
- NO WAY.

117
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,666
THE GENUINE PROMISED LAND
IS--

118
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,625
( gasps ) THE PROMISED
LAND IS REALLY THE EARTH?

119
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,750
- Dewey:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

120
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,000
I DEEPLY APPRECIATE YOU
GATHERING HERE

121
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,208
DESPITE THE RAMIFICATIONS
INVOLVED IN YOUR ATTENDANCE.

122
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,916
AT THIS TIME WE NEED
TO TAKE EACH OTHER'S HANDS

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,250
AND TOGETHER USHER IN
A BRAND NEW ERA.

124
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,916
LET US BUILD
FOR OUR FUTURE

125
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,416
A NEW KIND OF WORLD ORDER!
- ( guest muttering )

126
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,125
- A NEW WORLD ORDER.

127
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,000
WE IN THE MILITARY WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE BUILDING IT.

128
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,333
- YES, BY STEPPING
ON US NOBLEMEN.

129
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,291
PERHAPS NOW YOU'LL KNOW
HOW IT FEELS.

130
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,916
- ( clock chiming )

131
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,375
- HAPPY NEW YEAR,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

132
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:38,625
- ( waltz music playing )

133
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,541
- Dewey:
THESE ARE MILITARY MEN,

134
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,458
THE ONES WHO HOLD POWER
RIGHT NOW

135
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,208
AND THE FALLEN NOBLEMEN
WHO USED TO HOLD POWER.

136
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,291
- Anemone:
BOTH OF THEM ARE DISGUSTING.

137
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,250
- Dewey:
NOT ONE OF THEM KNOWS

138
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,625
THAT THE MUSIC WE ARE
DANCING TO RIGHT NOW

139
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,666
IS NOTHING MORE THAN
AN IMITATION.

140
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,750
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT IT ISN'T REAL.

141
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,583
THEY ARE THANKFUL FOR IT
NONETHELESS.

142
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,541
HOW PATHETIC THEY ARE.

143
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:07,041
- UM, DEWEY, DO YOU PREFER
THE REAL THING?

144
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,083
- ANEMONE, I AM DESCENDENT
FROM THE KING.

145
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,041
YES, A DESCENDENT
OF THE CLAN

146
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,875
THAT WENT INTO OUTER SPACE

147
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,375
AND GUIDED EVERYONE
TO THIS PLANET.

148
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,416
HOWEVER, THE CROWN THAT CAN
BE GIVEN ON THIS PLANET

149
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,166
IS FOR NOTHING MORE
THAN A SACRIFICIAL KING

150
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,291
TO CALM DOWN THE ROWDY LANDS.

151
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,541
- EH...

152
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,208
- ( waltz music continues )

153
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,041
( waltz music continues )

154
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,041
- ( woman grunting )

155
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,166
( breathing heavily )

156
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,250
( screams )

157
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,250
- ( baby crying )

158
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,416
- ( gasps, screams )

159
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,000
- Dewey: HOLLAND CAME INTO THIS
WORLD BY KILLING HIS OWN MOTHER.

160
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,416
IT SEEMS MY FATHER TOOK THAT
AS ABSOLUTE PROOF

161
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,916
THAT HE WAS
THE SACRIFICIAL KING.

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,625
WELL, WHO REALLY KNOWS?

163
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,416
PERHAPS MY FATHER
TRULY DID LOVE ME.

164
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,916
AND THAT WAS WHY
HE CHOSE HOLLAND.

165
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,250
OF COURSE, THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT
WILL NEVER BE KNOWN.

166
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,416
IT SIMPLY STANDS THAT HOLLAND
WAS THE ONE BETWEEN US

167
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,583
WHO WAS CHOSEN.

168
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,916
- ( waltz music continues )

169
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,583
- ( alarm beeping )

170
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,791
- Dewey:
DESPITE EVERYTHING,

171
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,166
OUR FATHER MADE HOLLAND
DO NOTHING.

172
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:36,000
AND THAT WAS WHY
I HAD TO DO IT ALL MYSELF.

173
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,458
THAT RITUAL.

174
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,541
- ( waltz music continues )

175
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,250
- ( explosion )

176
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,416
- ( waltz music continues )

177
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,958
- Dewey:
THAT WAS WHEN I UNDERSTOOD

178
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,958
THE TRUE MEANING OF IT.

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,500
IT WAS A RITUAL WHERE ONE
MURDERS HIS OWN FATHER.

180
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,250
A RITUAL WHERE A CHILD
LETS HIS PARENTS' BLOOD

181
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,958
FLOW ONTO THE GROUND
TO CALM THE ANGRY LAND.

182
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,083
SO THAT WAS IT.

183
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,083
PERHAPS FATHER NEVER MADE
HOLLAND DO ANYTHING

184
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,208
BECAUSE HE WAS BORN AS THE ONE
WHO KILLED HIS MOTHER,

185
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:46,750
BECAUSE HE WAS BORN
A SACRIFICIAL KING.

186
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,083
IT WAS AS IF THE LAND

187
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,583
DID NOT APPROVE
OF MY EXISTENCE.

188
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,458
THE ADULTS DID NOT APPROVE
EITHER.

189
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,625
THEY DECLARED THAT TECTONIC
SHIFTS HAD OCCURRED

190
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,000
BECAUSE SOMEONE
WHO WAS NOT QUALIFIED

191
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,333
HAD THE AUDACITY TO PERFORM
THE RITUAL,

192
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,416
AND THEY TOOK AWAY
ALL THE PRIVILEGES

193
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,333
THAT OUR CLAN POSSESSED.

194
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,458
- ( crashing )

195
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,958
- BUT STILL I WAS
A SACRIFICIAL KING.

196
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,208
THOUGH ALL ALONE.

197
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,916
- ( crashing )

198
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,416
- THAT'S RIGHT!

199
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,791
I WAS ALL ALONE.

200
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,000
- ( gasps )
- HMM?

201
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,041
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

202
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,000
- MM-MM.

203
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,708
- ( waltz music continues )

204
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,083
- ADROC WAS THE ONE
WHO SCIENTIFICALLY PROVED

205
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,291
THAT THE CROWN OF THIS WORLD
WAS NOTHING MORE

206
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,875
THAN THAT OF A CLOWN.

207
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,666
THE SACRIFICIAL KING DIED,

208
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,791
THE SCIENTIFIC KING
EMERGED.

209
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,250
I CURSED THEM ALL.

210
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,541
THE ONES WHO BLINDLY THOUGHT
THAT SUCH A RITUAL,

211
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,708
SO FILLED WITH HATE WILL BRING
CALM TO THE ANGRY LAND,

212
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,416
AND MORE SO, MYSELF

213
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,083
AND ALL THE BLOOD THAT WAS
RUNNING INSIDE ME.

214
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:10,833
- ( music stops, applause )

215
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,416
- THAT WAS WHY I HAD
TO PURGE IT FROM EXISTENCE,

216
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,083
BY THE SACRIFICIAL KING
BECOMING THE TRUE KING.

217
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,583
- ( waltz music plays )

218
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,208
- Man: YOUNG LADY
- ( gasps )

219
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,375
- MAY I HAVE THIS DANCE?

220
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,083
- Talho: HOLLAND!
HOLLAND, WAKE UP!

221
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,666
- ( heavy breathing )

222
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,833
DID YOU GET THEM?

223
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,000
- ALL OF THEM.

224
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,041
- THAT'S GOOD.

225
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,458
( grunts )

226
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,625
- IS ALL OF THIS
REALLY WORTH IT?

227
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,208
- YES, IT IS.

228
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,000
AT LEAST FOR ME.

229
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,333
- ( sighs )

230
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:15,000
- Holland: THE LIMITATION
OF QUESTIONS IS NEAR.

231
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,958
IT'S LIKELY DEWEY HAS ALREADY
NARROWED DOWN THE LOCATION

232
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,666
OF THE CORALIAN CORE.

233
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,875
ACCORDING TO DR. GREG'S
CALCULATIONS,

234
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,208
WE HAVE TWO MONTHS,
AT THE MOST.

235
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,958
THAT'S ALL THE TIME
WE HAVE LEFT.

236
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,541
I KNOW THAT EVERYTHING
I'M DOING RIGHT NOW

237
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,208
WON'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING
IMPORTANT OR DECISIVE.

238
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,958
SO, IF YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING,

239
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,500
I SAY I SHOULD BE TRYING
TO BUY AS MUCH TIME

240
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,541
AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM.
- ( gasps )

241
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,958
YOU'RE RIGHT, HOLLAND.

242
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,625
I'M SURE THAT RENTON'S GROUP
IS DOING THEIR BEST.

243
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,583
AND SO SHOULD WE.

244
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,375
- MAETER!
- RENTON!

245
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,916
IT LOOKS LIKE THE LIGHT
IS ALL FRIZZY UP THERE.

246
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,708
- HUH?

247
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,333
WOW!  I WONDER
WHAT THOSE ARE.

248
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,208
THE GROUND IS WAY UP
ABOVE THE SKY, RIGHT?

249
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,041
SO THEN...
WHY IS IT STILL A SKY?

250
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,625
- I REALLY DON'T HAVE
AN ANSWER TO THAT.

251
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,375
EUREKA!
- MOMMA!

252
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,583
- SO IT WAS NO GOOD?

253
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,083
YEAH, SAME HERE.

254
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,416
THE ROCKS ARE WAY
TOO BRITTLE,

255
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,833
AND IT'S NOT ANYTHING
THAT NIRVASH CAN GET OVER.

256
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,083
- WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO US?

257
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,875
- HEY, WE NEED WATER.

258
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,125
- WE'RE OUT OF WATER.
AND WE'RE OUT OF FOOD!

259
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,375
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

260
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,666
- I DON'T KNOW.

261
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,333
- I DON'T KNOW THIS
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT!

262
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,291
THE TRAPPERS ARE WAY TOO THIN
HERE TO FLY

263
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,125
AND THE CLIFF IS TOO FRAGILE
TO CLIMB.

264
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,625
WE'RE TRAPPED IN THIS INLET
RIGHT NOW

265
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,583
WITH NO WAY TO GET OUT!
( gasps )

266
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,541
- MM.

267
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,000
- Linck: MOMMA!
- HUH?

268
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,708
- MOMMA MOMMA,
LOOK, LOOK!

269
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,333
I FOUND SOMETHING
AMAZING OVER THERE!

270
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,041
- Maeter: WOW!
IT'S SO PRETTY!

271
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,041
WHAT IS IT?

272
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,083
- ( gasps )

273
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,541
- Linck: HEY, MOMMA,
WHAT IS THIS?

274
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,791
- I THINK THAT IT'S SOME KIND
OF A METAL RING.

275
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,375
BUT WHY IS IT EMBEDDED
INSIDE A CLEAR STONE?

276
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,750
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

277
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,250
- HUH?

278
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,250
WHITE HAIR?

279
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,708
( shrieks )

280
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,000
DOMINIC!  DOMINIC, WHERE ARE YOU
WHEN I NEED YOU?

281
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,125
HURRY UP AND GET ME OUT
OF HERE!

282
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,791
- TO THINK THAT THE FIRST JOB
AFTER COMING BACK

283
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,500
IS TO BE A DAMN TAXI.

284
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,666
- AS FAST AS YOU CAN,

285
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,416
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO TAKE US TO WARSAW.

286
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,375
- ( gasps )

287
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,041
- AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CARRY
THAT DAMN HEAVY LUGGAGE

288
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,708
TO YOUR QUARTERS
YOURSELF.

289
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,750
- DAMN HEAVY LUGGAGE?

290
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,000
- ( door hissing )

291
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,958
- ( grunts )

292
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,750
WHAT'S INSIDE HERE?

293
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,500
( gasps )

294
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,875
WHA--
- ( cooing )

295
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,166
- HUH.

296
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,166
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

297
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,250
AAH!

298
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,625
( sighs )

299
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:56,083
- ( whirring )

300
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,500
- I WONDER IF NIRVASH
IS DOING ALL RIGHT.

301
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,375
- LOOK, WE HAVE TO TRY
TO CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN

302
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,375
AND FIGURE OUT WHERE
WE ARE,

303
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,166
BEFORE WE CAN DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

304
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,125
- YES, BUT--
- ( crashing )

305
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,666
- MOVE ALREADY!

306
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,625
- ( screaming )

307
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,375
- ( crashing )

308
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,208
- Eureka: HOW IS HE?

309
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,750
- WELL, HE'S NOT BROKEN
OR ANYTHING.

310
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,625
- THEN WHY IS NIRVASH
IN SUCH BAD CONDITION?

311
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,125
-I DON'T KNOW.

312
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,958
- BUT WHY?
YOU'RE A MECHANIC, RIGHT?

313
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,708
- HMM.

314
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,083
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
ASKING HIM YOURSELF?

315
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,000
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND
HOW NIRVASH FEELS, RIGHT?

316
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:11,083
- ( waves crashing )

317
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,041
- ( gasps )

318
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,000
- Renton and Eureka:
TO BE CONTINUED.

319
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,375
- ( end theme playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )
