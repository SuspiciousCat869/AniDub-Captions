00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,375
♪ I JUST FLY AWAY ♪

00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,375
♪ I JUST FLY AWAY! ♪

5
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,875
- ( PA announcer
speaking indistinctly )

6
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,875
- Man: HEY, I HEARD ANOTHER
CORALIAN APPEARED.

7
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,333
- Man #2:
YEAH, ME, TOO.

8
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,000
- IN THE STATE OF GREMIKOWA,
IF I RECALL.

9
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,791
IT'S THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE PLANET,

10
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,041
SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

11
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:01,041
- ENOUGH.  CAN YOU JUST STOP IT
WITH THE DAMN NOISE ALREADY?

12
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,708
IT'S DISTRACTING.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

13
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,041
YOU'RE JUST SITTING THERE
READING A BOOK FOR FUN.

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,083
- THIS IS DIFFERENT.
I'M GATHERING INFORMATION.

15
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,375
- ( music playing )

16
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,041
- OH.

17
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,041
THAT'S STRANGE.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,958
- THIS BOOM BOX'S POWER
IS TURNED OFF.

19
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,333
- ( alarm blaring )

20
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:22,208
- UNKNOWN TRAPAR RESPONSE!
- HEY, WHAT IS THIS?

21
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,583
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

22
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,208
- AN UNKNOWN TRAPAR INTERFERENCE
HAS BEEN CONFIRMED.

23
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,083
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
WHERE?

24
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,750
- 3:00, DISTANCE, 52.

25
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,750
- Holland: 606, YOU'RE GONNA
ACT AS BACKUP TO 808

26
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,708
AND ENTER
FROM THE 23RD DISTRICT.

27
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,375
MEANWHILE, THE 909 AND NIRVASH
WILL ACT AS A DISTRACTION.

28
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,375
AS SOON AS TALHO GETS NORB'S
LOCATION FROM THE INFORMANT,

29
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,916
WE'LL HEAD STRAIGHT IN
AND GRAB HIM.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,583
- ( techno music playing )

31
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:58,166
- WE'LL FINISH EVERYTHING BEFORE
THAT OLD MAN GETS ON THE MOVE.

32
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,375
THE SUCCESS OF THIS OPERATION

33
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,916
RIDES ON NOTHING MORE THAN
OUR SKILLS AS ONE COMBINED TEAM.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,250
DON'T BEG FOR THINGS.
DO IT YOURSELF.

35
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,916
OR ELSE YOU WON'T GET
ANYTHING.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,250
WE CAN DO IT.  LET'S GO!

37
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,625
- THAT'S AN SL-1200 MARK II.
IMPOSSIBLE!

38
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,500
THIS IS THE CAPITOL.

39
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,416
- ( air raid sirens wailing )

40
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,291
- I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET,
YOU KNOW?

41
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,291
THIS WARNING SIGNAL HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

42
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,291
SOMEONE HAS
BREACHED THE PERIMETER

43
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,291
AND IS TRYING
TO INVADE THE CAPITOL.

44
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,958
- SOMEONE?

45
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,291
ARE THERE ANY
VODARAC RADICALS

46
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,541
WHO WOULD EVEN CONSIDER
THE IDEA

47
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,458
OF DIRECTLY ATTACKING
THIS PLACE?

48
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,458
OTHER THAN YOU, THAT IS?

49
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,750
- YOU KNOW, DEWEY,
I HAVE TO MENTION

50
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,458
THAT I'M NOT A RADICAL.

51
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:59,458
- I ONLY HAVE ONE LEAD
REGARDING THIS SITUATION.

52
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,375
NONE OTHER THAN THE MAN
TO WHOM YOU ENTRUSTED

53
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,500
THE FATE OF THIS PLANET,

54
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,541
TO WHOM YOU TOLD THE TRUTH.

55
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,750
- LAUNCH THE DEFENSIVE SCREENS.

56
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,833
- MASTER NORD,
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE WORDS,

57
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,916
"LOVE THY NEIGHBOR"?
- WHAT?

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,500
- WORDS WRITTEN
ON THE OLDEST DOCUMENTS

59
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,958
PASSED DOWN BY MANKIND
THROUGH THE AGES.

60
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,750
NOW WHY DO YOU THINK THAT
SUCH A PHRASE WAS WRITTEN

61
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,375
INTO THE OLDEST DOCUMENT
OF MANKIND?

62
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,625
IT IS BECAUSE
WITHOUT THOSE WORDS,

63
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:50,000
HUMANS HAVE LITTLE CHANCE
OF KEEPING EACH OTHER ALIVE.

64
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,875
HUMANS ARE SUCH
PATHETIC CREATURES,

65
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,375
DON'T YOU THINK?
- WHAT IS YOUR POINT?

66
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,041
- I ONLY THING I EVER WANTED
WAS TO WIN

67
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,375
USING MY OWN WORDS
AS A LIVING HUMAN BEING.

68
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,375
DID YOU KNOW THAT
THE PHRASE THAT WAS CONSIDERED

69
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,458
GOD'S FIRST REVELATION WAS

70
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,375
"IN THE BEGINNING,
THERE WAS THE WORD."

71
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,208
- OH, I SEE.

72
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,791
ARE YOU TRYING TO BECOME
SOMEBODY LIKE RASKOLNIKOV

73
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,416
OR SOMETHING?

74
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,833
- RENTON.
- THEY'RE COMING.

75
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,000
- ( gasps )
- Ken-Goh: CALM DOWN!

76
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,083
MAIN CANNONS LOCK ON.
FIRE!

77
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,416
- RENTON.

78
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,750
I KNOW.
AT LEAST I THINK I KNOW,

79
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,750
BUT I--
- SO DO I.

80
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,125
- ( alarm blaring )

81
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,958
- Holland: WE'VE GOTTEN PAST THE
MAIN DEFENSIVE PERIMETER

82
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,458
SURROUNDING THE CAPITOL.

83
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,458
THE FIRST STAGE
IS NOW COMPLETE.

84
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,125
ALL HANDS PROCEED
TO THE SECOND STAGE.  GOT THAT?

85
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,458
- All: ROGER.

86
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,458
- NIRVASH, WHAT'S WRONG?

87
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,500
- HEY, HOLLAND, WE GOTTA STOP
THIS BATTLE RIGHT HERE.

88
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,166
- IDIOT!  IT'S A LITTLE
BIT LATE IN THE GAME.

89
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,625
- I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOOD.

90
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,375
WE SHOULDN'T BE
FIGHTING THIS WAY.

91
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,500
THIS THIS ISN'T
OUR USUAL FIGHTING STYLE.

92
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,500
- I MADE IT CLEAR
DURING THE BRIEFING.

93
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,875
IF WE TURN BACK NOW, THIS PLANET
WILL LOSE EVERYTHING.

94
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:43,083
WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME LEFT.
- BUT, HOLLAND!

95
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,625
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

96
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:48,541
I CAN GO A LITTLE FURTHER.

97
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,541
BUT, RENTON,
PLEASE HOLD MY HAND.

98
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,416
- EUREKA.

99
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,500
- Man: AN EMERGENCY WARNING
HAS BEEN ISSUED.

100
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,166
EVERYONE,
PLEASE EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY

101
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,416
TO THE SHELTER TO WHICH
YOU HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED.

102
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
I REPEAT, AN EMERGENCY
WARNING HAS BEEN ISSUED.

103
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,041
EVERYONE,
PLEASE EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY

104
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,500
TO THE SHELTER TO WHICH
YOU HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED.

105
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,750
- ( gasps )

106
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,625
( groans )
- EUREKA!

107
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,416
- THERE WAS A CHILD THERE.
- HUH?

108
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,125
- I'M SO SCARED.

109
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,458
- ( explosion )
- ( gasps )

110
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,250
TRY HARDER, EUREKA.
- I KNOW.  I KNOW.

111
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,708
I'M TRYING,
BUT THE HARDER WE TRY

112
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,541
TO PRESS FORWARD
IN THIS BATTLE,

113
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,958
THE MORE OF THOSE PEOPLE
WE'RE GOING TO ANNIHILATE.

114
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,625
- I KNOW ALL THAT, BUT WE--

115
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,208
- I'M SCARED.
- EUREKA.

116
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,625
THOSE PEOPLE DOWN THERE
ARE SURE TO HAVE LOVED ONES

117
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,166
DEAR TO THEM.
JUST LIKE IF YOU, RENTON,

118
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,250
WERE TO DISAPPEAR
RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES.

119
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,333
IT'S JUST SO HARD FOR ANYONE
TO LOSE A LOVED ONE.

120
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,458
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT, I--

121
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,458
- ( screams )

122
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,083
- TALHO, ARE THEY?

123
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,208
- Talho: FIGHTING IS NOT
THE ANSWER FOR EVERYONE.

124
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,250
IF THOSE TWO DECIDED
TO MAKE THAT CHOICE, SO BE IT.

125
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,916
IF BY DOING THIS THEY CAN LOOK
INTO A FUTURE FILLED WITH HOPE,

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,166
THEN IT'S ALL--
- ( alarm blaring )

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
- I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

128
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,916
YOU'RE JUST TRUSTING THEM
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

129
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,083
- OH!  THEY WERE HIT
BY FRIENDLY FIRE.

130
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,291
- CALM DOWN.
IT'S PART OF THEIR PLAN.

131
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,291
WEREN'T YOU LISTENING
AT THE BRIEFING?

132
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,291
- YEAH, BUT I--
- ( crash )

133
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,625
- Ken-Goh: STARBOARD AFT IS HIT.
- I'VE GOT THREE KLF SQUADRONS,

134
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,750
AND THEY'RE HEADED THIS WAY.

135
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,208
- ALL RIGHT, MOONDOGGIE.

136
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,958
EVERYTHING IS RIDING
ON YOUR SKILL AND DETERMINATION

137
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,958
ON HOW BAD YOU WANNA SUCCEED.

138
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,208
- RIGHT, LET'S DO IT!

139
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,666
- ( laughs )
THEY MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

140
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,208
- OH.

141
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,458
HEY!

142
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,333
YOU NEVER TOLD ME.
DID THE COLONEL READ MY REPORT?

143
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,708
- WHAT REPORT?
- THE ONE I GAVE YOU.

144
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,333
THE NEW REPORT CONCERNING
THE TYPE ZERO AND ITS PILOTS.

145
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,958
- WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, I'M
CONFIDENT THAT HE'LL READ IT.

146
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,333
THAT IS IF IT REALLY WAS
SOMETHING TRULY IMPORTANT.

147
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "IF IT WAS
SOMETHING TRULY IMPORTANT?"

148
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,750
DON'T YOU GET IT?
THE TYPE ZERO'S SPECS WENT UP.

149
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,750
WHY CAN'T YOU PEOPLE UNDERSTAND?
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

150
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,166
( grunts )

151
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,375
ANEMONE.

152
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,166
- SO YOU'VE SUBMITTED A REPORT?

153
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,541
- UH--

154
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,625
- I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE,

155
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,208
BUT YOU DIDN'T WRITE THAT
THE END LOST, DID YOU?

156
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,375
- ANEMONE, THAT'S REALLY
NOT IMPORTANT HERE.

157
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,333
- OF COURSE IT'S IMPORTANT HERE!

158
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,291
DO YOU THINK HE'LL GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE TO TRY?

159
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,041
I FAILED TWICE ALREADY.

160
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,291
YOU THINK DEWEY WOULD
GIVE ME A THIRD CHANCE?

161
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,166
WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING SO SIMPLE?

162
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,916
WHY ARE YOU SUCH
A STUPID IDIOT?!

163
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,375
TELL ME, TELL ME.

164
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,291
WHY DID WE LOSE TO SUCH
AN UNFASHIONABLE ENEMY?

165
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,541
- ANEMONE?

166
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,666
- HE'S GONNA KILL US.

167
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,750
I'M SURE HE'S GONNA KILL US

168
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,583
I'M SURE.  I'M POSITIVE.
HE'S SURE TO--

169
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,583
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

170
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,583
I'M SURE WE'LL WIN NEXT TIME.

171
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,125
- SUCH LIGHT-HEARTED WORDS.

172
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,708
- WASN'T IT YOUR PLAN TO MEET UP
WITH SOMEBODY HERE?

173
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,500
- THANKS A LOT.

174
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,833
NOW LET'S BEGIN.

175
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,916
- A MOLE.

176
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,875
ACCORDING TO
HIS CONFESSION,

177
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,666
IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT
GEKKOSTATE KNOWS WE ARE HERE

178
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,875
AND WILL ATTEMPT TO ATTACK
VERY SHORTLY.

179
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,666
- HE USED TO WORK
IN INTELLIGENCE.

180
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,875
HE'S ONE OF TALHO'S PETS.

181
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,875
THE ENEMY IS NOT
COMING AFTER US.

182
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,875
THEIR TARGET IS THAT OLD MAN.

183
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,875
HOWEVER, EVEN IF THEY ARE ABLE
TO INFILTRATE THIS FAR,

184
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,875
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

185
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,000
THAT THE OLD MAN WILL
BOW DOWN TO HOLLAND.

186
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,333
HE'S DEBATING ON WHETHER OR NOT
TO TURN HIS OWN POWER

187
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,875
INTO A DESTRUCTIVE FORCE
IN ORDER TO SAVE THE PLANET,

188
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,875
OR TO ENTRUST THE GOOD FOR
NOTHING APPRENTICE WITH IT ALL.

189
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,875
LET'S WATCH IT UNTIL THE END.

190
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,166
WHAT CAN THEY ACCOMPLISH NOW?

191
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,875
THEY'VE MISSED THEIR
ONLY CHANCE.

192
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,708
CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED.

193
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,375
WE DON'T NEED
THE OLD MAN ANYMORE

194
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,458
NOW THAT WE HAVE
PERFECTED THE ORANGE.

195
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,291
- Gidget: I'VE GOT
A TRANSMISSION FROM MISS TALHO.

196
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,916
SHE SAYS THAT MASTER NORB IS
IN THE TILUA GARDENS.

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,916
- RIGHT, GOT IT.
WE'LL HEAD OVER THERE.

198
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,916
- BUT, LEADER, WAIT,
NIRVASH IS MISSING IN ACTION.

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,916
- I'M SURE THAT
THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

200
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,041
THERE'S NO WAY THOSE TWO WOULD
GO DOWN EASILY.

201
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,916
IF THEY'RE GONNA CHICKEN OUT
AT THIS POINT,

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,875
IF THEY MAKE A MISTAKE AND DIE
AT THIS POINT,

203
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,583
THEN THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE WILL
EVER BE ABLE TO LIVE THROUGH

204
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,958
THE DESTINY THAT AWAITS US.

205
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,666
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE'LL BE
ABLE TO PUSH TOWARDS THE FUTURE.

206
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,083
- DAMN IT, WE KEEP
HITTING THEM DOWN,

207
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,458
BUT THEN MORE COME OUT.
- WHAT ABOUT NIRVASH?

208
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,000
- I'M TRYING,
BUT THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING.

209
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,000
- TALHO SHOULD BE COMING OUT
THE POWER PLANT ANY MINUTE NOW.

210
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,541
AS SOON AS WE PICK HER UP,
WE CAN HAVE HILDA BREAK AWAY

211
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,000
AND HELP COVER HOLLAND'S REAR.
- ROGER.

212
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,250
- THERE ENOUGH TIME?

213
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,000
- THERE'S JUST GONNA HAVE TO BE.

214
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,750
HE'S THE ONE WHO I ENTRUSTED
THE FUTURE OF THE GEKKO TO.

215
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,750
THERE'S NO WAY THAT HE'D DIE
AT THIS POINT.

216
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,833
- ( screaming )

217
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,041
- ( grunting )

218
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,333
- SORRY FOR THE WAIT, OLD MAN.

219
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,333
- HELLO, HOLLAND.
- Dewey: IT'S ABOUT TIME.

220
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,833
IT'S FAIRLY LATE IN THE GAME
TO COME STROLLING IN.

221
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:25,041
YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO THE NOVAK FAMILY.

222
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,041
- BIG BROTHER.

223
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,416
- EUREKA, LISTEN.  "SOMEONE
WILL COME HERE AND SAVE US."

224
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,833
"THE MILITARY
WILL STOP ATTACKING."

225
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,500
WE CAN WISH FOR THINGS LIKE THAT
BUT UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING,

226
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,125
THE FACT THAT THE GUYS
ON THE GEKKO ARE IN TROUBLE

227
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,625
DOESN'T CHANGE.

228
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,666
THINK ABOUT IT, EVEN IF WE WERE
TO STOP FIGHTING NOW,

229
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,916
THE MILITIA WOULD NEVER
STOP THEIR ATTACKS.

230
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,916
- THEN LET'S RUN AWAY.
- EUREKA!

231
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,875
- RENTON, I'M SO SCARED.

232
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,416
WE MIGHT HAVE TO FACE A LIFE
OR DEATH SITUATION AGAIN.

233
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,416
AND NOT JUST THE TWO OF US.
EVERYONE ON THE GEKKO.

234
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,416
MAURICE AND THE OTHER KIDS.
( crying )

235
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,333
BESIDES, I JUST DON'T WANT

236
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,000
TO HARM ANYTHING ANYMORE.

237
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,708
- RENTON.

238
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,458
- IF IT'S THAT TOUGH FOR YOU,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT.

239
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:34,458
IF IT'S REALLY THAT HARD ON YOU,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

240
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,583
I JUST CAN'T STAND SEEING YOU

241
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,458
IN SO MUCH PAIN ALL THE TIME.

242
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,458
BUT STILL, EVEN IF WE
THREW EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW,

243
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,458
I DON'T THINK THIS WAR
WOULD END.

244
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,458
THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA FIGHT.

245
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,125
SO THAT I CAN TRY TO SOMEHOW
STOP THIS AWFUL BATTLE THAT'S

246
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,791
STARTED BETWEEN HUMANS
AND CORALIANS.

247
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,791
I BELIEVE IN MY HEART

248
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,458
THAT WITH YOU
AND THE NIRVASH AT MY SIDE,

249
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,375
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT
AN END TO THIS BATTLE

250
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,666
BEFORE IT DESTROYS EVERYTHING.

251
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,458
- I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME,
EUREKA.

252
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,958
- RENTON.

253
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:12,125
- LET'S DO SOMETHING THAT
WE BELIEVE IN, ALL RIGHT?

254
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,333
- SURE.

255
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:22,833
- WHAT'S WRONG, HOLLAND?  WHAT
HAVE YOU COME TO BEG FOR NOW?

256
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,500
UNFORTUNATELY, I HARDLY
HAVE ANYTHING TO GIVE TO YOU

257
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,333
OR YOUR ENTOURAGE.

258
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,833
RELEASE THE OLD MAN.
HE'S FREE TO GO.

259
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,833
- ARE YOU SURE IT'S ALL RIGHT?
- I DON'T CARE.

260
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,416
THE ONE WHO SHOULD COMFORT
MY WRETCHED BROTHER

261
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,291
IS ANOTHER WHO HAS
MISSED HIS TIME.

262
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,416
- ( scoffs )

263
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,416
- DO YOU KNOW WHY THIS
OLD MAN CAME HERE, HOLLAND?

264
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,416
HE FINALLY REALIZED THAT
YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE

265
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,458
TO FIND SOMEONE WHO COULD
BECOME EUREKA'S PARTNER

266
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,458
NO MATTER HOW LONG
YOU LOOKED.

267
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,458
THAT'S WHY HE'S GIVEN UP.

268
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,958
GIVEN UP TRYING TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE SCUB CORALS.

269
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,458
- I'M SORRY.

270
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,458
- JUST GET BEHIND ME.

271
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,583
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

272
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,458
THE GOODS I PROMISED.
- WHAT?

273
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,916
- Dewey: HOLLAND, YOU WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO SURPASS ME.

274
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
IT STARTED WITH LIFTING.

275
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,458
YOU EVEN ENTERED THE MILITARY
IN ORDER TO FOLLOW ME.

276
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,875
BUT AT ANY POINT IN TIME,

277
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,458
WERE YOU ABLE
TO REACH MY CALIBER?

278
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,875
TO TOP IT OFF, YOU EVEN PICKED
UP THE WOMAN THAT I DUMPED.

279
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,875
SHE'S SO PERFECT FOR YOU.
- ( grunts )

280
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,458
- PLEASE, GET BEHIND ME.

281
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,458
- SAME GOES FOR THAT
SILLY LITTLE MAGAZINE.

282
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,166
YOU TRIED TO TELL THE TRUTH
WITH THAT MAGAZINE OF YOURS,

283
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,500
BUT WHAT DID YOU ACCOMPLISH,
HMM?

284
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,500
ALL YOU DID WAS BLATHER AWAY
IN POINTLESS EDITORIALS,

285
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,666
AND MADE IT AN OVERALL WASTE
OF TIME FOR EVERYONE.

286
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,666
I MEAN, YOU DO REALIZE
THAT THE MASSES

287
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,375
AREN'T INTERESTED
IN THE TRUTH, DON'T YOU?

288
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,500
THE MASSES AREN'T MOVED
BY THE TRUTH.

289
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:58,333
WHAT YOU NEED IS A LOUD VOICE
AND A NOBLE CAUSE TO CHAMPION.

290
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:02,208
FURTHERMORE, IF YOU POKE AT WHAT
LITTLE PRIDE THOSE FOOLS HAVE,

291
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,916
I GUARANTEE THEY'LL CHOOSE

292
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,625
A FAKE OVER THE TRUTH
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

293
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,500
AS YOUR OLDER BROTHER,
I'M WARNING YOU.

294
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,625
TRY TO LOOK MORE
AT THE BIG PICTURE.

295
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,958
OTHERWISE,
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN WIN.

296
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,625
- YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

297
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,583
BUT I AM SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED.

298
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,416
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T MANAGED
TO CATCH UP TO ME AT ALL.

299
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,125
- WHAT WAS THAT?  OH!

300
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,875
- BUT THAT'S--

301
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,333
HE REALLY FOUND THE ONE?

302
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,083
- HEY, YOU GUYS ARE KIND
OF LATE, AREN'T YOU?

303
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,416
WHAT HAVE YOU TWO BEEN DOING?
- I'M SORRY.

304
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,833
WE HAD TO TAKE A SLIGHT DETOUR.
NOW, MR. NORB.

305
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:50,958
- PLEASE, HURRY!

306
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,166
- NO.

307

WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT VEHICLE?

DON'T BEG FOR THINGS.

309
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,750
DON'T BEG FOR THINGS.
DO IT YOURSELF,

310
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,500
OR ELSE YOU WON'T
GET ANYTHING.

311
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,041
THAT'S WHAT
THE GEKKOSTATE IS ALL ABOUT.

312
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,791
ALL RIGHT,
ALL SHIPS RETREAT.

WE'RE GOING BACK
TO THE GEKKO.

314
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,500
- OH, I SEE.
YOU CHOSE THE POWER PLANT

315
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,125
SO THAT YOU COULD
DO THIS TO IT.

316
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,583
- I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO
HAVE TO SEE THAT GUY'S FACE.

317
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,208
- ALL SHIPS ARE SECURED.

318
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,208
THE CATAPULT HAS BEEN
SAFELY STILLED.

319
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,541
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO!

320
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,625

HELD YOURSELF BACK.

321
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,625
- HELD BACK WHAT, HOLLAND?
- HUH?

322
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,583
WELL, DIDN'T YOU COME TO
THE CAPITOL TO DESTROY THE CITY?

323
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,250
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU WANT TO KILL ME?

324
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,083
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN.
MY AGE IS CATCHING UP.

325
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,333
IS THERE ANY WAY
I CAN GET A SMOKE NOW?

326
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,583
- YOU JUST SAID YOUR AGE IS
CATCHING UP AND YOU WANT THAT?

327
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:37,083
- EUREKA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YES, I'M FINE.

328
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,583
THANK YOU, RENTON.
NIRVASH IS HAPPY, TOO.
