1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,125
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,250
- THIS IS DEWEY NOVAK
THE CHIEF COMMANDER

4
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,166
OF THE UNITED
FEDERATION FORCE.

5
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,625
PLEASE STAY CALM
AS YOU LISTEN

6
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:00,958
TO MY FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT.

7
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,833
WE WILL NOW ATTEMPT TO REBEL

8
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,250
AGAINST THE SCUB CORALS.
- ( angry shouting )

9
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,750
- THE SURVIVAL
OF THE HUMAN RACE

10
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,750
DEPENDS UPON THE OUTCOME.

11
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,250
I AM CERTAIN THIS OPERATION
WILL BE A SUCCESS.

12
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,958
SOON THE CONTROL OF EARTH
WILL BE IN HUMAN HANDS.

13
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,833
- ( beeps )

14
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,291
- ORATORIO NUMBER EIGHT.

15
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,333
FIRE!

16
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,708
- Anemone: WELL, YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

17
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:35,375
HAPPEN IN LIFE. ANY REGRETS?

18
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,250
OF COURSE IF I SAID
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY,

19
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,666
IT WOULD BE A LIE.

20
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,125
I'M STILL VERY,
VERY YOUNG.

21
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,708
I WANT TO GO OUT SHOPPING,
AND EAT A LOT MORE

22
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,125
OF DIFFERENT
YUMMY FOODS OUT THERE,

23
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,333
AND LISTEN TO MUSIC
AND STUFF, YOU KNOW?

24
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,333
OH YES, AND OF COURSE

25
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,250
EVEN A WONDERFUL ROMANCE--

26
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,000
IF I COULD HAVE THAT,

27
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,208
IT WOULD REALLY
BE THE BEST.

28
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,583
REALLY THE BEST.

29
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,125
BUT THE WAY
I FEEL RIGHT NOW,

30
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,416
"OH BROTHER"
IS ALL I CAN SAY.

31
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,333
- ( alarm buzzes )

32
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,250
- Anemone: REALLY, OH BROTHER.

33
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,541
- Man: A GIANT HOLE
IN THE GROUND?!

34
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,083
- I INTERCEPTED A REPORT
FROM THE GINGA.

35
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,375
APPARENTLY,
THE EARLIER ENERGY WAVE

36
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,875
PENETRATED DEEP
INTO THE SCUB LAND.

37
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,541
I'LL LINK YOU TO IT.
- TheEND IS MOVING.

38
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,125
IT APPEARS SHE'S GOING
INTO THE SCUB'S OPENING.

39
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,916
- SHE'S WHAT?
- Anemone: SOMEONE ON MY MIND?

40
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,000
I HAD SOMEONE.
YEAH, PAST TENSE.

41
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,500
I THINK ABOUT HOW
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM

42
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,083
HOW I FELT.

43
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,333
I KIND OF HATE MYSELF
A BIT FOR THAT.

44
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,375
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW.

45
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,375
THE NEXT TIME
I'M BORN INTO THIS WORLD--

46
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,833
IF THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE,--

47
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,791
I'D LIKE TO BE BORN
AS SOMEONE WHO'S MORE CLEVER

48
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,791
THAN I AM NOW.

49
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,916
WELL, I REALLY CAN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

50
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,625
I FEEL THIS SELF-HATRED.

51
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,291
- I'M TAKING THE 303!

52
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,625
- BUT HOLLAND!

53
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,375
- I CAN'T LET TheEND
GET IN THE WAY

54
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,125
OF WHAT RENTON AND EUREKA
HAVE TO DO.

55
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,875
- HEY, GUYS,
THE OPENING LOOKS LIKE

56
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,333
IT'S STARTING
TO REPAIR ITSELF.

57
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,833
- TALHO, HURRY UP!

58
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,791
- COMMENCING FINAL
ENTRY SEQUENCE.

59
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,250
DOGGIE, TAKE US DOWN JUST
A FEW METERS OFF THE GROUND.

60
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,125
- YOU MEAN AT THIS SPEED?!
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY

61
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,458
TO KEEP US FROM
GETTING CAUGHT

62
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,958
BY THE MILITARY'S
OPTICAL ENEMY-SPOTTING SYSTEM.

63
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,875
- HMM.  CAN YOU KEEP
UP WITH ME, SLOWPOKE?

64
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:04,958
- JUST WATCH ME.

65
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,500
- WELL, I GUESS
I'LL BE GOING NOW.

66
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,541
- ( Gulliver warbles )
- ( grunts )

67
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,833
- ( trills )

68
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,541
- ( sighs )

69
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,791
WHAT?
- ( trills )

70
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,000
- HMM, I SEE.

71
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,375
( chuckles )

72
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,958
WE'LL GO TOGETHER.

73
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,208
- Holland: TALHO, RIGHT AFTER
THE LAUNCH OF THE 303,

74
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,041
THE GEKKO NEEDS TO ESCAPE
THE BATTLEFIELD

75
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,833
BY A POWER TRAJECTORY FLIGHT,

76
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,250
ALONG WITH THE IZUMO.

77
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,916
- HOLLAND, PLEASE.
- APOLOGIZE TO DOMINIC.

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,125
BUT I CAN'T LET ANYONE
GET IN THE WAY

79
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,625
OF RENTON AND EUREKA.

80
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,416
- RIGHT NOW, THE SCUB'S OPENING
IS MEASURING TEN.

81
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,541
SEVEN MINUTES
UNTIL IT CLOSES!

82
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,750
HURRY, HOLLAND!

83
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,375
- COMMENCING MY RUN!

84
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,875
- OPTICAL SENSORS
HAVE SOMETHING.

85
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,416
THE TARGET APPEARS
TO BE THE GEKKO

86
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,875
ALONG WITH ONE UNKNOWN SHIP.

87
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,500
- HMM.

88
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,750
- INTERFERENCE WAVES SPOTTED.

89
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,541
THE GINGA FLEET
HAS CAUGHT UP TO US.

90
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,291
- HMM.
- CAPTAIN.

91
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,125
I SHOW A BREACH ALERT
ON THE PORT-LAUNCH DOOR.

92
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,291
- WHAT?!

93
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,458
- Dominic: I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
- Jurgens: DOMINIC!

94
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,583
- DON'T WORRY,
I'LL STOP TheEND.

95
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,291
I'LL JUST CONVINCE THE PILOT
TO STAND DOWN.

96
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,625
- HEY, CALM DOWN. THIS IS
NO TIME FOR PERSONAL INTERESTS.

97
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,333
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH
PERSONAL INTERESTS?!

98
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,291
- ( gasps )
- LOOK, I DON'T CARE

99
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,916
IF YOU CALL ME A SNOB
FOR THIS,

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,416
BUT I WANT TO DO IT.

101
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,708
I WANT TO BE THE ONE
TO STOP THE ONE I LOVE.

102
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,958
SO PLEASE, LET ME GO!

103
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,125
- THE OPENING IS CLOSING FAST.

104
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,916
- OH NO, KLFs ARE COMING IN
FROM THE GINGA FLEET.

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,333
HOLLAND!

106
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,583
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL KEEP
THE KLFs AT BAY!

107
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,750
DOMINIC, GO!

108
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,375
( screams )

109
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,125
- 15 SECONDS LEFT!

110
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,625
- AH!
- ( metal clanging )

111
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,041
( clanging )

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,916
- ( alarm buzzes )

113
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,750
- WE--

114
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,291
WE'VE LOST THE SIGNAL

115
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,083
FROM THE HIGH-SPEED SHIP.

116
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,708
- NO!

117
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,541
- WE'VE LOST COMMUNICATION
WITH THE LIEUTENANT.

118
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,458
- AFTER CONFIRMING
THE GEKKO'S RECOVERY

119
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,875
OF THE 303,
IGNITE THE BOOSTERS.

120
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,083
WE'RE LEAVING
THE FRONT LINE.

121
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,500
- CAPTAIN.

122
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,166
- DIDN'T YOU
HEAR MY ORDER?!

123
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,250
- THE GEKKO AS WELL
AS AN UNKNOWN SHIP

124
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,083
ARE LEAVING THE LOCAL AIRSPACE.

125
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,333
SHALL WE HAVE
THEM FOLLOWED, SIR?

126
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,250
- NO, JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE.

127
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,125
HMM.

128
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,416
- Renton: HEY, DID YOU KNOW

129
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,541
THAT ALL OF THE FINGERS
ON OUR HANDS

130
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,541
HAVE SPECIAL NAMES?

131
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,500
THE THUMB IS THE DAD,

132
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,541
THE INDEX FINGER
IS THE MOM.

133
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,958
- YES, I KNOW.

134
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,041
THE MIDDLE FINGER'S
THE BIG BROTHER.

135
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,833
THE RING FINGER
IS THE BIG SISTER,

136
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,625
AND THE PINKY,
THE LITTLE BROTHER.

137
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,958
IT'S JUST LIKE OUR FAMILY,
ISN'T IT?

138
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,083
- ( both gasp )

139
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,166
- HUH?

140
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,916
NIRVASH?

141
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,625
- WHAT'S WRONG, NIRVASH?
ARE YOU OKAY?

142
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,375
- WHAT'S THAT UP THERE?

143
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,916
WAIT, THAT'S--

144
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,708
- ( gasps )
- IT'S THE BLACK LFO!

145
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,666
( grunts )

146
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,791
( straining )

147
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,833
- WHAT'S GOING ON?!

148
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,625
HEY, NIRVASH,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

149
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,333
- WHOA!

150
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,958
- ( both gasp )

151
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,166
( gasping )

152
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,750
- AH, DAMN IT!
- RENTON, YOUR LEFT!

153
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,625
- NO WAY IN HELL!

154
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,666
- ( gasps )
OUCH.

155
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,375
- RENTON, WAIT A MINUTE!

156
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,083
NIRVASH SAYS
THAT SHE'S IN PAIN.

157
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,958
HE'S TELLING US TO LISTEN
THE WHAT THE VOICE

158
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,208
BEHIND THE PILOT
OF THAT THING IS SAYING.

159
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,250
- YEAH, BUT--
BUT, NIRVASH,

160
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,125
THAT LFO IS THE ONE
THAT ATTACKED

161
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,791
THE CONTROL CLUSTER!

162
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,708
- RENTON, PLEASE LISTEN.

163
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,500
- Anemone: IF--
EVEN AFTER THIS BATTLE--

164
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,208
THEY TELL ME
I CAN LIVE ON...

165
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,375
- ( gasps )

166
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,416
- I'LL GO AND BUY
A SMALL MIRROR SOMEWHERE

167
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,958
AND PRACTICE SMILING.

168
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,791
- ( gasps, cries )

169
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,291
- SHE HAS A SAD VOICE.
- DON'T CRY.

170
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,416
- RENTON.
- HUH?

171
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,500
- LET'S SAVE HER.

172
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,333
- Anemone: I'LL PRACTICE
OVER AND OVER

173
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,541
SO THAT I CAN
SEE HIM ONCE AGAIN.

174
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,625
- I CAN HEAR IT.
I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE!

175
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,166
- Anemone: IF THEY TELL ME
THAT I CAN LIVE

176
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,750
WITHOUT HURTING
ANYONE ELSE,

177
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,166
I'LL LET MY HAIR
SWAY IN THE WIND,

178
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,833
TAKE A GIANT STEP
ONTO THE EARTH,

179
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,500
AND GO SEE HIM.

180
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,208
I WANT TO LIVE
TO SAY MY THANKS.

181
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,166
I WANT TO LIVE

182
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,541
TO GIVE SO MANY
FEELINGS TO PEOPLE.

183
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,583
- BUT YOU CAN!

184
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,041
- I WANT TO LIVE.

185
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,291
I WISH I DIDN'T REALIZE
I HAD FEELINGS LIKE THIS.

186
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,375
- Eureka: IT'S ALL RIGHT
FOR YOU TO LIVE!

187
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,333
NOBODY HAS EVER SAID THAT
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO LIVE!

188
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,625
- ( sobs )
BUT I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN!

189
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,000
HE'S NOT WHERE--
WHERE I CAN SEE HIM.

190
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,708
AND THAT'S--
AND THAT'S WHY...

191
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,750
( gasps )

192
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,416
- YOUR FEELINGS WILL
BE PASSED ON, ANEMONE.

193
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,958
- THEY WON'T, EUREKA.

194
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,833
THEY WON'T BE
PASSED ONTO ANYONE NOW.

195
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,958
- VASCUDA!
- Dominic: ANEMONE!

196

207
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,833
IT'S JUST LIKE THE NIRVASH.

208
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,125
- WE SHOULD GO TOO.
- RIGHT.

209
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,083

WELL THEN, HI, THERE.

215
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,250
WELL, LONGTIME NO SEE.
- IDIOT!

216
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,666
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING

217
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,875
LETTING YOURSELF FALL
INTO A PLACE LIKE THIS?

218
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,625
- I-- I'M SORRY.

219
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,083
- IT'S OKAY.

220
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,333
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION
AND FORGIVE YOU.

221
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,500
- HUH?

222

- YOU CAME TO FIND ME
AND YOU SAVED ME.

223
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,208
- I DON'T THINK
I REALLY SAVED YOU.

224
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,083
- YOU TRIED TO SAVE ME.

225
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,333
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

226
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,125
YOU'VE EVER GIVEN ME
THAT EXPRESSION.

227
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,625
IT'S QUITE WONDERFUL.

228
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,958
