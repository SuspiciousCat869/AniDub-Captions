1
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,208
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,166
- Man: NORMA 02 TO 01,

3
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,166
I HAVE REACHED
THE DESTINATION POINT.

4
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,750
- Man #2: ROGER, THIS IS 01.

5
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,500
ANY RESPONSE
FROM THE SENSORS?

6
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,750
- NO RESPONSE
FROM THE HEAT SENSOR

7
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,583
OR THE COMPAC
INTERFERENCE GAUGE.

8
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,833
- ROGER THAT.

9
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,666
CONTINUE TO BE ON ALERT
AS YOU SEARCH THE AREA.

10
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,333
- ( beeping )
- HEADQUARTERS TO NORMA 01,

11
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,041
REPORT YOUR CURRENT STATUS.

12
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,041
- WE'VE REACHED THE SPOT
WHERE THE WHITE K.L.F. SQUAD

13
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,750
HAD LAST REPORTED IN.

14
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,000
THE NUMBER OF SURVIVORS
IS UNKNOWN.

15
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,875
DUE TO THE DENSE FOG,
IT'S HARD TO SEE ANYTHING.

16
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,541
WE CAN'T EVEN CONFIRM
THE K.L.F.s RIGHT NOW.

17
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,541
- Man: CAPTAIN!
- 03, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,375
- RIGHT FRONT!
CONFIRMED HEAT SOURCE AT 2400.

19
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,791
I THINK IT'S AN ENEMY SHIP!
- WHAT?

20
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,291
- THIS IS 02. ANOTHER
INCOMING HEAT SOURCE CONFIRMED.

21
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,250
- ( alarm sounding )
- MULTIPLE TARGETS!

22
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,041
INCREASING IN NUMBER!

23
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,625
- 02,
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE?

24
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,291
I CAN'T CONFIRM FROM OVER HERE.
02?!

25
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,125
- HEADQUARTERS TO NORMA 01--

26
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,166
01, COME IN.
DO YOU COPY?

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,833
- ( gunfire )

28
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,791
- THIS MARKS THE SIXTH TIME,
STARTING WITH THE SERIES.

29
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,625
- I'M SURE THE MEDIA WILL
NO LONGER KEEP QUIET ABOUT IT.

30
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,750
- WE CERTAINLY HAVE NOT BEEN
NEGLECTING THE SITUATION EITHER.

31
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,291
SO I ASK YOU,
WHERE HAS THAT MAN GONE

32
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,083
AND WANDERED OFF TO NOW?

33
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,625
- ( door opens )

34
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,291
- WHOA, IT'S COLD.
- HEY, RENTON, WAKE UP.

35
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,708
COME ON.

36
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,541
- HUH?

37
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,583
- TIME FOR YOU TO GO TO WORK.

38
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,541
- Stoner: YOU MUST BE TIRED FROM
BEING IN THE BRIG FOR A WEEK.

39
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,666
- Renton: I THOUGHT THAT YOU
GUYS HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME.

40
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,416
- WELL, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

41
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,833
WE DID FORGET ABOUT YOU.

42
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,666
- THANKS!
- ( laughs )

43
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,875
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THAT'S
STONER'S BEST ATTEMPT AT HUMOR.

44
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
- IS IS ALL RIGHT THAT I'M OUT?
HOLLAND TOLD ME

45
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,666
THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
LOCKED UP FOR AT LEAST 10 DAYS.

46
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,208
- DON'T SWEAT IT.

47
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,166
I TOLD YOU I HAVE A SPECIAL JOB
THAT I WANT YOU TO WORK ON.

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,750
- LOOK, RENTON, THIS IS
AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT JOB

49
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,416
THAT CAN ONLY BE
ACCOMPLISHED BY YOU.

50
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,708
- ( block crashing )

51
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,708
- WAIT, IS THIS--

52
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,083
- LOOK OUT!
- ( gasps )

53
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,666
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

54
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,083
- HUH?
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

55
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,458
DON'T TOUCH IT
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS.

56
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,041
- BUT WHY?

57
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,833
- YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS
IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ITEM,

58
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,250
DON'T YOU?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

59
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,541
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HIM ABOUT IT, MOONDOGGIE?

60
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,166
- ALL RIGHT.

61
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,875
MOONDOGGIE GOIN' IN.

62
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,500
- ROGER THAT.

63
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,708
- NOW BE CAREFUL.

64
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,791
- HUH?

65
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:28,166
BUT ISN'T THAT A BOWL
OF ORDINARY RAMEN NOODLES?

66
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,291
- THAT'S RIGHT.

67
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,416
- Stoner: IT LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE A BOWL

68
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,916
OF PORK-FLAVORED RAMEN.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,916
- HOWEVER, WHAT THIS BOWL
CAN DO TO A CITY--

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
- AN ENTIRE CITY?  NO WAY.

71
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,291
- DON'T ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS.

72
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,375
IT'LL BE BETTER
IF YOU DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH.

73
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,250
HOWEVER, THE CIRCUMSTANCES
UNDER WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES

74
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,000
FORCE US TO DELIVER THIS
TO A CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL.

75
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,916
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
COMPLETELY UP FOR THIS JOB.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,458
IF I COULD FIND ANOTHER WAY,

77
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,916
I WOULDN'T BE ASKING YOU
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,458
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THERE
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

79
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,625
MY ONLY OPTION
IS TO ASK YOU TO HELP US OUT.

80
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,916
- OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,666
I MEAN, I WOULD BE HONORED
TO DO IT FOR YOU!

82
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,541
- HUH?  REALLY?

83
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,416
KID, YOU TOTALLY ROCK.

84
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,416
- I DON'T REALLY.

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,625
- IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO CHANGE
INTO THIS AND GET GOING.

86
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,791
- UH, WHAT IS THIS OUTFIT?

87
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,916
- Stoner: IT'S A TYPE
OF URBAN CAMOUFLAGE.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,458
IT'S TO KEEP YOU
FROM BEING SPOTTED BY THE ENEMY.

89
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,750
CAN WE DEPEND ON YOU, KID?
- YES.

90
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,750
- HA, THAT'S THAT SPIRIT.
- Hap: WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU.

91
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,083
- ( bell tolling )

92
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,125
- COME IN, MR. HAP.
IT'S RENTON.

93
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,208
- HAP HERE.  WHAT'S THE MATTER?

94
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,250
- IT'S THIS URBAN CAMOUFLAGE.

95
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,500
DON'T YOU THINK THAT IT KIND OF
MAKES ME STAND OUT?

96
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,000
- OF COURSE IT DOES.
- ( Stoner chuckling )

97
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,666
- BUT BECAUSE OF THAT, NOBODY
WOULD BELIEVE FOR A SECOND

98
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,125
THAT YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S
OUT THERE ON A SPECIAL MISSION.

99
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,291
YOU SEE?
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE SO.

100
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,291
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,

101
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,083
IT FEELS LIKE EVERYONE'S
STARING AT ME LIKE I'M A FREAK.

102
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,125
- ( chuckling )
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

103
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,291
THAT'S WHAT ADOLESCENCE
IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT.

104
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,875
- AH!

105
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,458
- WHAT'S WRONG?

106
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,916
- JUST NOW I SAW A MAN
WITH A CAMERA.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,375
I THINK HE'S GOT ME
UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

108
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,375
- YOU'D BETTER GET OUT OF THERE
RIGHT AWAY.

109
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,750
I'LL CONTACT THE CLIENT
TO CHANGE THE DROP.

110
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,250
- ROGER THAT.
- ( sighs )

111
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,958
- MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE.

112
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,666
- IS RENTON A PSYCHIC
OR SOMETHING?

113
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,291
HE'S PRETTY QUICK
ON THE UPTAKE.

114
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,958
- IT'S ALL MOONDOGGIE'S FAULT.
- HUH?

115
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,500
- HE INSISTED THAT HE WAS GOING
TO DO THE FILMING HIMSELF,

116
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,958
BUT HE'S JUST NO GOOD AT IT.

117
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,916
I SHOULD HAVE GONE MYSELF.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,500
- HEY, MOONDOGGIE?

119
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,458
HEY, DID YOU HEAR ME?

120
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,291
- YEAH, I CAN HEAR YOU.
- GET WITH IT, WILL YOU?

121
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,000
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

122
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,333
- YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT,
MOONDOGGIE.

123
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,375
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES,
OUR MONITOR HAS BEEN SHOWING

124
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,375
A BIG CLOSE-UP OF YOUR CROTCH.

125
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,750
- AH!

126
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,041
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
HAS GIDGET BEEN SITTING THERE

127
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,208
WATCHING THIS WHOLE TIME?

128
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,125
- Gidget:
GO FOR IT, MOONDOGGIE!

129
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,208
- AH!  ROGER.

130
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,083
- Hilda: THE RATE OF JUNK-FOOD
CONSUMPTION AROUND HERE

131
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,041
IS ABSURD. MAYBE I
SHOULD GO AHEAD

132
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,625
AND BAN IT ONCE AND FOR ALL.

133
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,041
( sighs )

134
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,833
- HILDA?
- AH! AHHH!

135
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,166
HEY, DON'T SNEAK UP ON ME
LIKE THAT.

136
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,541
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE RENTON IS?

137
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,416
I WENT TO GO
AND BRING HIM HIS FOOD,

138
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,750
BUT HE WASN'T IN THE BRIG.

139
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,625
- OH, HE STEPPED OUT
A FEW MINUTES AGO

140
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,125
SAYING HE WAS GONNA GO
ON SOME KIND OF ERRAND.

141
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,666
HE WAS WEARING A JOGGING OUTFIT
WAY TOO SMALL FOR HIM.

142
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,500
- OH, I SEE.

143
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,458
ALL RIGHT.  THANK YOU.

144
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,375
- ( whispering ) RENTON HERE.

145
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,875
I'M NOW INSIDE THE RAINBOW--

146
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,541
THE MEN'S SAUNA
THAT YOU SPECIFIED.

147
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,375
- STONER HERE. YOU'RE DOING
A GOOD JOB, RENTON.

148
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,208
HAP'S DOING AN EMERGENCY
DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE,

149
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,708
SO I'LL BE GIVING
THE COMMANDS FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

150
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,791
FIRST YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED TO LOCATE THE CLIENT

151
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,166
FROM AMONG THE SAUNA CUSTOMERS
YOU SEE AROUND YOU.

152
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,541
- OKAY.

153
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,041
- THE TARGET IS A LARGE TATTOO
ON HIS BACK.

154
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,416
- WHAT? REALLY?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

155
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,916
AND THE TATTOO IS THAT
OF A LEGENDARY CREATURE.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,208
UNDERSTAND?

157
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,416
- WELL, UH, MR. STONER?

158
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,750
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF MEN
IN HERE WITH TATTOOS LIKE THAT.

159
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,416
IF YOU COULD BE
JUST A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC,

160
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,291
THEN MAYBE
I CAN FIND THE RIGHT ONE.

161
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,833
- ROGER THAT, RENTON.
WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

162
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,041
WELL, WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

163
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,125
- A GUY WEARING
FLOWER-GREEN UNDERWEAR!

164
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,458
- NO, A LOINCLOTH GUY.

165
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,500
- WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WHO'S
WEARING A WIG? HOW'S THAT?

166
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,666
- THAT'S PERFECT.

167
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,958
I'VE GOT SOME MORE INFORMATION.
- RIGHT.

168
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,833
- APPARENTLY THE MAN
WEARS A WIG.

169
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,958
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
FIGURE OUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

170
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,166
THESE GUYS'D KILL ME.
- IF YOU PICK THE RIGHT GUY,

171
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,416
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET BY
WITHOUT MAKING HIM MAD.

172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,166
BUT IF YOU DON'T--
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

173
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,208
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT ANY OF IT.

174
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,833
- ALL RIGHT.  UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'LL HAVE TO CALL IT OFF.

175
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,666
( sighs )
THIS MISSION IS ABORTED.

176
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,625
COME ON BACK.

177
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,083
- ( laughs )

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,041
- I'LL DO IT.
- HUH?

179
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,708
- I'LL CONTINUE THE MISSION.

180
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,291
PROCEEDING WITH THE FULL SEARCH
INSIDE THE SAUNA ROOM.

181
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,000
- VERY WELL SAID, RENTON.

182
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,500
I WISH YOU LUCK.
- THANKS.

183
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,916
- WHAT IS UP WITH THIS GUY?

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,791
- THAT KID'S THE REAL DEAL.

185
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,583
- YEAH, HE'S A GENIUS.

186
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,458
NO WONDER MOONDOGGIE'S
GETTING SO JEALOUS.

187
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,458
- JEALOUS?

188
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,666
- ( door opens )
- HUH?

189
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,125
- WHAT'S UP?
DID HE THROW IN THE TOWEL YET?

190
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,583
- NOPE.  WE'RE JUST NOW
GETTING TO THE GOOD PART.

191
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,916
- OH YEAH!

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,083
HE'S ABOUT TO PULL THE WIG
OFF A MAFIA GUY.

193
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,083
- HE IS?

194
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,000
OH, WOW, THIS IS GREAT.

195
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,583
- Maurice: WE'RE STILL
NOT HOME FREE YET.

196
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,541
- WE CAN'T BE SURE
THERE'S REALLY A GUY

197
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,541
WEARING A WIG
INSIDE THE SAUNA OR NOT.

198
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,250
- OH, RIGHT.

199
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,833
- THE SCREEN IS ALL FOGGY.

200
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,791
IT'S GETTING HARDER
AND HARDER TO SEE.

201
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,291
- Hap: WE'RE GONNA
MISS THE GOOD PART.

202
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,625
COME ON, MOONDOGGIE!

203
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,208
- ( sighs )
- Stoner: HEY, THE LENS!

204
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,625
MOONDOGGIE, WIPE OFF THE LENS.

205
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,291
- WHY AM I DOING THIS?

206
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,375
I MUST BE OUT OF MY MIND.

207
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:57,166
HIS CHARACTER IS STARTING
TO BECOME STRANGELY CLEAR.

208
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,333
- Maeter: I'M SCARED!

209
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,125
HIS VOICE SOUNDS REALLY CREEPY.

210
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,750
- Hap: THAT IDIOT--
THE HEAT IS GETTING TO HIM.

211
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,916
- JUST AS I THOUGHT.
I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE BEHIND IT.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,041
- OH, WHAT'S WRONG, HONEY?

213
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,250
- DON'T YOU "HONEY" ME.

214
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,583
NO MORE JUNK FOOD
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

215
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,833
- ( groans )

216
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,625
- SO ARE YOU GENIUSES
HAZING OUR ROOKIE AGAIN?

217
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,791
- AW, COME ON, HILDA,
IT'S A TRADITION.

218
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,958
BESIDES, THIS IS REALLY A WAY
OF SHOWING OUR AFFECTION.

219
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,333
- IF YOU EVER SHOW ME
AFFECTION LIKE THIS,

220
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,750
I'LL PUNCH YOU IN THE MOUTH.
- GOT IT.

221
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,041
- NOW THEN, DO HOLLAND AND TALHO
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

222
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,041
- TALHO'S THE ONE
WHO SUGGESTED IT.

223
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,250
- AND HOLLAND THOUGHT
IT SOUNDED FUN TOO.

224
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,833
- HE'S THE ONE
THAT TOLD US TO MAKE SURE

225
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:37,916
TO GET THE VIDEO RECORDING.

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,916
- I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU GUYS.

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,333
- HEY, IT'S BACK.
- OH YEAH!

228
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,250
- HUH?

229
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,000
MR. MOONDOGGIE?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

230
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,250
- HUH?

231
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,250
- HEY, MAMA, COME WATCH WITH US.
- UH, I, UM...

232
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,791
- COULD IT BE

233
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,500
THAT YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY
TO HELP ME?

234
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,000
- IT'S RENTON.

235
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,916
- THREE DAYS AGO,
A TECTONIC SHIFT

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,083
WAS OBSERVED HERE
AT A DEPTH OF 45.

237
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,750
BY SUNSET,
THE AREA WITHIN

238
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,916
A 20-KILOMETER RADIUS
WAS SEALED OFF.

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,958
AT 0700, THE WHITE K.L.F. SQUAD
ENTERED THE AREA,

240
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,458
MET ENEMY FIRE
AND ENGAGED IN BATTLE.

241
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,250
AT 0740,
COMMUNICATIONS WERE SEVERED.

242
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,583
NEARLY TWO HOURS LATER,
ALL COMMUNICATION

243
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,375
FROM THE NORMA K.L.F. SQUAD
WAS ALSO SEVERED.

244
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,833
SIR?

245
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,416
LIEUTENANT COLONEL,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

246
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,875
- LOOK AT THIS.

247
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,666
- WHAT?!  ISN'T THAT...

248
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,208
NORMA 01?!

249
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,208
- YOUR OBSERVATIONS?

250
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,333
- WELL, THE FACT
THAT THE ENEMY FIRE

251
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,375
WAS FOCUSED
ON THE CAPTAIN'S CRAFT

252
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,416
IS THE SAME
AS IN THE LAST FIVE CASES.

253
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,416
- ( slurping )

254
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,166
MAN, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

255
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,083
WHAT THE HELL
IS MOONDOGGIE THINKING?

256
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,083
- WHAT ARE YOU
YELLING AT ME FOR?

257
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,041
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE DATING
OR ANYTHING YET.

258
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,708
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

259
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,958
YOU'RE ALWAYS HANGING AROUND
NEXT TO HIM MAKING GOOGLY EYES.

260
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,166
- YOU CAN AT LEAST SAY
THAT WE MAKE A CUTE COUPLE.

261
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,833
- HE'S JUST JEALOUS,
THAT'S ALL.

262
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,416
MOONDOGGIE
USED TO BE THE ONE

263
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,000
THAT EVERYBODY
LIKED TO MESS WITH.

264
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,875
- YEAH, I THINK
THAT'S WHAT IT IS TOO.

265
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,041
- WELL, IN ANY CASE,
LET'S THINK ABOUT

266
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,083
HOW WE CAN HAVE SOME FUN
WITH THIS SITUATION

267
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,958
WHILE WE WATCH THEM.

268
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,583
ANYWAY, THAT SURE IS
ONE HELL OF A VIEW.

269
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,125
- UM, YOU MEAN WE DON'T HAVE TO
CONTINUE WITH THE MISSION?

270
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:36,458
SO WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
RECORDING WITH THAT CAMERA?

271
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,250
- DON'T TOUCH IT.

272
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,750
- UH, THIS CAMERA IS YOURS,
ISN'T IT, MR. MOONDOGGIE?

273
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,333
- I JUST TOLD YOU
NOT TO TOUCH IT.

274
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,708
- I HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT
AT ALL.

275
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,250
- I DON'T THINK HE'S DOING
ANY OF THAT ON PURPOSE.

276
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,416
- A RARE TALENT.

277
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,958
- MOONDOGGIE LOOKS NORMAL
COMPARED TO HIM.

278
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,416
- GO!

279
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,458
WHOO-HOO!

280
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,750
- WOW!

281
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,000
THAT WAS
A GREAT ROUNDHOUSE CUTBACK!

282
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,041
TOTALLY COOL!

283
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,916
SO I GUESS
IT'S BECAUSE I'M SO PATHETIC

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,208
THAT YOU HAD TO COME HERE
AND HELP OUT, RIGHT?

285
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,583
BECAUSE I'M NOT DEPENDABLE?

286
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,833
IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

287
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:19,833
YOU COULDN'T LEAVE A MISSION--
A MISSION OF THIS IMPORTANCE

288
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,916
FOR ME TO TRY
AND ACCOMPLISH ALONE.

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,375
TO BE HONEST,
I WAS RELIEVED

290
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,083
TO SEE THAT YOU CAME HERE
TO HELP ME OUT, MR. MOONDOGGIE.

291
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,583
( crying )
HOW PATHETIC.

292
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:33,083
THIS IS TOO MUCH FOOD
FOR ME TO EAT.

293
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,375
- ( crying )

294
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,500
- WHAT?
WHY'D HE GO AND START CRYING?

295
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,750
IT'S GAME OVER, MAN.
- NOT QUITE.

296
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,250
THOSE ARE TEARS OF REGRET.
- YEAH, NOW WE GOTTA SEE

297
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,583
HOW MOONDOGGIE'S
GONNA RESPOND TO IT.

298
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,833
SHOULD BE PRETTY GOOD.

299
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,625
- THEN WE'LL FINALLY SEE
WHO THE GODS OF LAUGHTER

300
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,625
ARE GOING TO SMILE UPON.
- Hilda: THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

301
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,250
I THINK MY BRAINS
ARE GONNA ROT

302
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,958
IF I KEEP HANGING OUT
WITH YOU GUYS.

303
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,500
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

304
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,250
- YOU GOING ALREADY, HONEY?
- YEAH, I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

305
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,541
- Moondoggie: WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU UP TO ANYWAY?

306
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,041
- ( laughs )

307
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,791
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S
GOING ON AROUND HERE, DON'T YOU?

308
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

309
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,541
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO YOU RIGHT NOW

310
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,250
AND YOU'RE DOING
ALL OF THIS ON PURPOSE.

311
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,708
- AW, MAN, WHY'D HE HAVE TO GO
AND START SPILLING IT?

312
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,208
- HE'S SELF-DESTRUCTING.

313
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,000
- HE'S HONEST
ABOUT HIS FEELINGS.

314
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,041
- YEAH? WELL, I THINK
IT'S ABOUT TIME

315
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,958
FOR MOONDOGGIE TO MAKE HIS EXIT.

316
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,125
- DON'T JUST SIT THERE
PRETENDING TO BE CRYING.

317
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,125
YOU'RE JUST MAKING FUN OF ME.

318
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,791
- BUT, MR. MOONDOGGIE,

319
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,666
I THINK THAT
YOU'RE A REALLY NICE PERSON.

320
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,916
- HUH?
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

321
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,375
- WELL, I REALLY
HAVEN'T FINISHED ANYTHING YET,

322
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,166
AND I'M SITTING HERE
LONELY AND DEPRESSED.

323
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,708
I'M SORRY. I'M REALLY
EMBARRASSED RIGHT NOW.

324
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,666
I WASN'T TAKING MY POSITION
SERIOUSLY ENOUGH.

325
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,958
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, KID?

326
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,166
- I WAS REALLY SCARED.
- HUH?

327
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,083
- I WAS AFRAID THAT INNOCENT
PEOPLE WOULD GET HURT

328
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,666
IF I ACCOMPLISHED MY MISSION
AND DELIVERED THIS.

329
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,541
BUT-- BUT I CAN'T LET MYSELF
THINK THAT WAY, CAN I?

330
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,666
- SHUT UP.
- I'M SUCH A LITTLE KID!

331
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,250
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

332
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,541
- SEE, I MADE A DECISION WHEN I
CAME TO LIVE ABOARD THE GEKKO

333
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,666
THAT EVEN IF I HAD TO MAKE
AN ENEMY OF THE WHOLE WORLD,

334
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,416
I WOULD BE THERE
TO HELP EUREKA!

335
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,750
THANKS TO YOU,

336
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,041
I'M FINALLY CONFIDENT
IN MY DECISION.

337
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,791
THE KINDNESS
THAT RESTS WITHIN DISCIPLINE!

338
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,916
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
BROTHER DOGGIE!

339
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,500
- All: HA!  DOGGIE?

340
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,250
- "BROTHER"?

341
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,916
- ( all laughing
over earpiece )

342
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,583
- OH!
- WHAT?

343
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,666
WHAT'S WRONG, BROTHER?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

344
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,333
- AH!  SHUT UP!

345
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,416
I'M NOT YOUR BROTHER,
YOU STUPID IDIOT!

346
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,208
- AH.

347
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,666
OW!  OW OW OW!

348
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,875
THAT HURTS!  THAT HURTS!

349
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,500
OW OW OW!
- SHUT UP.

350
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,208
UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP,
I WAS-- I WAS-- I WAS--

351
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,208
- THAT'S TOO STRICT!

352
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,291
YOU'RE BEING TOO STRICT,
BROTHER DOGGIE.

353
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,125
- DAMN IT!

354
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,583
- OW!  OOH!  OW!  OOH!

355
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,458
OH!
- Man: HEY!

356
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,125
- I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU GIVE THE KID A BREAK, OKAY?

357
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,666
- THAT'S RIGHT.
HAVING TO FIGHT DOESN'T FIT IN

358
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,708
WITH THE ATMOSPHERE
OF THIS LIFT SPOT.

359
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,708
- Moondoggie:
OH, HEY, NO. YOU SEE,

360
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,125
WE WERE JUST PLAYING AROUND.

361
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,083
- A TATTOO OF HOLLAND.

362
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,916
MR. HAP, THE TATTOO
OF THE LEGENDARY CREATURE!

363
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,125
I JUST FOUND IT! IT'S THIS
BIG GUY--THE REF BOARDER.

364
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,125
- THAT'S HIM!  YOU DID IT.
HE'S THE RECIPIENT

365
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,125
OF YOUR IMPORTANT DELIVERY,
YOUNG RENTON.

366
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,833
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

367
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,583
I TOLD YOU YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD PULL THIS OFF.

368
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,250
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
YOUR HEIGHT IS SHORTER

369
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,916
THAN ANYONE ELSE ONBOARD.

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,041
AND THE KEY PHRASE
THE RECIPIENT GAVE ME

371
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,041
ALSO HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

372
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,916
ALL RIGHT,
THE KEY PHRASE IS...

373
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,708
- RIGHT.
I'VE GOT IT, MR. HAP.

374
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,958
- Boy: OH, THAT FELT GOOD.
- Man: YEAH.

375
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,833
WE SHOULD HEAD HOME NOW.

376
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,750
- HUGE!
- OH, MAN, THIS IS BAD.

377
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,333
RENTON IS DEAD FOR SURE.

378
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,041
- EXCUSE ME?

379
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,458
- OH!
HOW CAN I HELP YOU, LITTLE BOY?

380
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,916
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY IT.

381
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,750
- JUST CRY.
CRY AND GIVE IT UP ALREADY.

382
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,166
- HEY, BRO?
- HMM?

383
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,666
- WHAT IN THE HECK DO YOU HAVE
TO EAT IN ORDER TO GROW SO BIG?

384
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,708
( grunting )

385
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,250
- DON'T MOCK ME, BOY.

386
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,750
YOU'RE JUST BITING THE HAND
THAT FEEDS YOU.

387
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,666
- Boy:
MAN, WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO?

388
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,000
- LET'S GO.
- YEAH.

389
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,750
- HE DID IT.

390
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,000
- ( all laughing )

391
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,958
- Hap: OH, MAN, THIS ONE
WAS AN ABSOLUTE DEFEAT FOR US.

392
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,750
- Stoner: THE OPERATION
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS,

393
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,000
THOUGH THE CANDID CAMERA
WAS A TOTAL FAILURE.

394
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,000
- Hap: YOU'RE THE REAL THING,
KID.

395
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,541
- THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
IN THE WORLD WHO WOULD

396
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,125
GO TO SO MUCH TROUBLE
JUST FOR A LAUGH.

397
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,375
- WHAT ABOUT EUREKA?
- HUH?

398
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,333
- WAS SHE WATCHING?

399
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,375
- SHE WAS KIND OF WATCHING,
BUT SHE DIDN'T REALLY WATCH.

400
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,875
RIGHT?
- HUH?

401
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,916
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.

402
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,000
- HE'S TAKING IT PRETTY HARD.

403
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,375
- I THINK--
- WE WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR.

404
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,208
- Renton: YOU KNEW?

405
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,833
YOU KNEW AND YOU WERE
JUST LAUGHING AT ME

406
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,500
DEEP DOWN IN YOUR HEART.

407
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,583
- THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD HAVE LAUGHED.

408
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,916
THEY DID THE SAME THING
TO ME ONCE.

409
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,041
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS TOTALLY STOKED.

410
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,708
'CAUSE TO ME, HOLLAND AND THEM
WERE THE COMPLETE BOMB.

411
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,333
WITH THEM CHARFING ON ME
AND ALL, I WAS STYLIN'.

412
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,666
IT WAS LIKE I WAS
REALLY PART OF THEIR CREW.

413
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,666
- MOONDOGGIE.

414
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,250
- ( grunts )
SO HOW DO I DIAL THIS IN?

415
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,083
WHEN EVERYBODY
WAS HOOTING FOR YOU TODAY

416
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,333
AND YOU FULL-ON CHARGED THE
GO-OUT AND TOTALLY FLARED,

417
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,000
IT JUST FELT LIKE I'D BEEN
FRIGGED, YOU KNOW? SNAKED?

418
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,458
IT WAS JUST MASSIVE BLEAK.

419
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:48,791
SO FOR TODAY ANYWAY,
I'M CASHED, BRO.

420
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,083
BUT NEXT TIME,

421
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,291
COUNT ON IT--
YOU ARE TOTALLY GETTING STUFFED.

422
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,916
( laughs )

423
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,333
- MISS GIDGET?
- WHAT?

424
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,375
- CAN YOU TRANSLATE
WHAT HE JUST SAID?

425
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,083
- SO HOW'D IT GO?

426
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,833
- NOT GOOD. THEY WENT AHEAD
AND RELEASED HIM.

427
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,083
- I SEE.

428
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,666
- Hap:
WELL, AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

429
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,791
THERE'S NO USE
GETTING ALL WORRIED, YOU KNOW?

430
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,958
YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK
THAT THEY'D KEEP HIM IN THERE

431
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,000
LONG ENOUGH
TO CROAK IN PRISON, DID YOU?

432
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,708
- I GUESS NOT.

433
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,458
- HOW ABOUT YOU GO AND TAKE
A HOT BATH AND TRY TO RELAX?

434
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,208
- YEAH. AND I'M SURE
YOU WERE LOOKING FORWARD

435
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,541
TO WATCHING THIS.

436
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,791
- THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

437
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,333
- YEAH.  IT'S KIND OF TOUCHING
IN A SORT OF WEIRD KIND OF WAY.

438
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,583
NO COMPARISON TO MOONDOGGIE.

439
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,625
- SO DUMB.
- COME ON, HILDA, BE HONEST.

440
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,083
THE GODS OF LAUGHTER
SMILED DOWN ON US

441
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,625
AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES US
GEKKOSTATE.

442
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,458
- Dewey:
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

443
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,291
THEY DON'T
HAVE THE RESOLVE FOR IT.

444
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,916
IT'S COINCIDENCE THE SQUADRONS
WERE ALL ANNIHILATED

445
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,708
AFTER THEY'D LOST THEIR LEADER.

446
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,750
FOR THEM, THEIR LEADER
IS NOTHING BUT A MERE POINT

447
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,041
WHERE INFORMATION IS GATHERED
AND DISSEMINATED.

448
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,500
THEY ALL SWARM AROUND THERE
IN ACCORDANCE

449
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,041
WITH THEIR OWN HABITS.

450
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,791
THUS, IF WE WERE TO RETAIN
THE TRADITIONAL FORM

451
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,291
OF AN OPERATING SYNDICATE,

452
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,666
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT
WE HAVE NO CHANCE AT VICTORY

453
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,208
IN THE BATTLES AGAINST THEM.
WHAT IS IMPORTANT HERE

454
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,333
IS THE EXISTENCE
OF THE THREE SAGES,

455
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,750
WHO ALWAYS SHOW US
WHAT NOBLE CAUSES WE HAVE

456
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,750
FOR WHICH TO BATTLE.

457
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,000
THEY HAVE NOT EVOLVED

458
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,041
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT
EVEN BEEN AWAKENED YET.

459
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,375
THE SAGES
ARE CALLED CORALLIANS.

460
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,166
- ( sighs )

461
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,750
- Maeter: WHAT HAS
HE BEEN DOING IN THERE?

462
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,000
- HUH?

463
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,500
- IT'S BECAUSE HE
CAN'T GO SEE MAMA.

464
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,833
'CAUSE HE
WAS REALLY EMBARRASSED.

465
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,000
- SO UNCOOL!

466
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,000
- ( thinking )
YEAH YEAH.

467
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,541
JUST LIKE YOU SAY,
I'M REALLY NOT COOL AT ALL.

468
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,375
TO GET ALL SERIOUS
ABOUT A PRANK

469
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,000
AND THEN GET
DEPRESSED ABOUT IT.

470
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,666
- RENTON?

471
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,500
- AH!  WHAT-- WHAT'S UP,
EUREKA?

472
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,166
- DINNER.
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN YET.

473
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,208
HERE.
- WHAA--

474
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,541
THIS IS HARSH.

475
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,083
EUREKA'S KINDNESS
IS TOO HARD ON ME.

476
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,875
NO, WAIT.

477
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,541
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
REALLY KINDNESS.

478
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,041
THEN WHAT IS IT?

479
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,458
CAN IT BE PITY?

480
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,416
OH NO!

481
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,541
I MIGHT REALLY CRY OVER THIS.

482
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,541
- I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING.

483
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,666
- WOW!  LOOKS TASTY.

484
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,416
I'M SURE THIS RAMEN
WILL BE SALT-FLAVORED

485
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
FROM ALL THE TEARS.

486
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,250
DID YOU SAY AMAZING?!
- MMM.

487
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,916
- I MEAN,
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

488
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,875
- WELL, BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS
CHANGED SINCE YOU CAME ABOARD.

489
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,333
THEY ALL SEEM
TO HAVE SO MUCH FUN WITH YOU.

490
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,583
IT SEEMS THAT IT WASN'T
JUST THE NIRVASH THAT WAS HAPPY.

491
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,625
- NOT UNCOOL, BUT AMAZING?

492
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,541
- THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE
WAS SAYING AS THEY LEFT.

493
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,583
WHAT DOES "UNCOOL" MEAN?

494
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,375
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

495
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,208
IT'S BETTER IF YOU DON'T KNOW
RIGHT NOW. JUST BE WHO YOU ARE.

496
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,625
- OH, RENTON, CAN YOU
TAKE A LOOK AT THE NIRVASH?

497
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,500
IT CAN WAIT
UNTIL AFTER YOU'RE DONE EATING.

498
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,833
SOMETHING'S GOT ME WORRIED.

499
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,833
- ( thinking ) RIGHT NOW,
EVEN THOUGH IT'S STILL

500
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,291
A LITTLE VAGUE, I THOUGHT
I SAW A SLIGHT GLIMPSE

501
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,458
OF WHERE I MIGHT BELONG
IN THE GEKKOSTATE.

502
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,708
I'LL DO IT NOW!
I CAN EAT DINNER WHILE I WALK.

503
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,125
- ( laughs )

504
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,583
- Renton: WELL, I REALLY
HAVEN'T FINISHED ANYTHING YET,

505
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,625
AND I'M SITTING HERE
LONELY AND DEPRESSED.

506
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,291
I'M SORRY! I WASN'T TAKING
MY POSITION SERIOUSLY ENOUGH.

507
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,125
- Holland: I REALLY AM UNCOOL.

508
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,833
- Renton: TO BE CONTINUED!

509
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:32,833
- ( theme music playing )

510
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,541
- Narrator:
TERMINUS IS AFTER A KEY PERSON

511
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,500
IN AN ANTI-FEDERATION
ORGANIZATION.

512
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:08,291
THE BOY ENCOUNTERS THE DOOR
THAT LEADS TO THE WORLD.

513
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:12,041
