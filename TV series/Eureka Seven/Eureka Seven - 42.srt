1
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:20,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,541
- IT'S FINALLY BEGAN.

4
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:58,958
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

5
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,666
- THERE'S AN ENORMOUS
COMMOTION

6
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,708
GOING ON UP THERE.

7
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,916
THIS IS MOST LIKELY
A LARGE ATTACK

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,333
THAT WAS LAUNCHED BECAUSE
YOU TWO

9
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,208
WERE ABLE TO GET
TO THE VODARAC SHRINE.

10
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,583
- AN ATTACK?

11
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,875
BUT, FOR WHAT REASON?

12
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,041
IT'S THE WORK OF A MAN
WHO DOESN'T WANT

13
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,458
YOU TWO ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE ZONE.

14
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,541
A YOUNG LAD
NAMED DEWEY.

15
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,541
- WHAT ABOUT HOLLAND
AND THE OTHERS?

16
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,375
- REST ASSURED THAT MAN

17
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,583
IS NOT GOING TO BE
DEFEATED EASILY.

18
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,666
- YOU CAN TELL?

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,083
- HMM. IT'S JUST
A HUNCH.

20
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:32,291
THIS TOWER, IT WAS ONCE
WRAPPED IN A BARRIER,

21
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,041
USING A PORTION
OF LADY SAKUYA POWERS

22
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,541
TO MAINTAIN IT.

23
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,750
HOWEVER, NOW THAT WE'RE ABLE
TO HEAR THE DEEP RUMBLINGS

24
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,666
OF THE ATTACKS DOWN HERE,

25
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,750
IT IS A SIGN
THAT LADY SAKUYA HAS DECIDED.

26
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,083
THE POWER USED TO PROTECT
THIS TOWER

27
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,333
WILL NOW BE USED
FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE.

28
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,958
- ANOTHER PURPOSE?

29
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,500
- RIGHT NOW,
LADY SAKUYA IS SUMMONING UP

30
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,083
ALL HER POWERS
SO THAT TOGETHER WITH ME

31
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,541
SHE CAN SEND YOU TWO

32
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,541
TO THE GENUINE
PROMISED LAND.

33
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,541
- THE GENUINE--

34
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,958
- PROMISED LAND?

35
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,458
- ( siren blaring )

36
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,958
- Man: WHAT'S HAPPENING?

37
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,083
- IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.

38
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,625
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN WIN

39
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,750
IF WE GOT TO GO UP
AGAINST NINE OF THEM.

40
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,958
- AT LEAST THE SOLDIER MONKS
HAVE STOPPED ATTACKING,

41
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,250
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.

42
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,541
MATTHIEW,
I NEED A FAVOR.

43
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,500
- AHA?

44
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,541
- Talho:
WAIT A MINUTE, HOLLAND,

45
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,666
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

46
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,916
- I DON'T CARE!
IT'S THE ONLY WAY

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,708
FOR US TO GET THROUGH
THE SITUATION.

48
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,958
- LISTEN, HOLLAND,
YOU CAN'T BE RUSHED ABOUT THIS.

49
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,916
- I KNOW.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,291
- HEY, DOGGIE. YOU'VE HEARD
ALL THAT, DIDN'T YOU?

51
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,166
- ROGER THAT.
EVERYONE BETTER HOLD ON TIGHT!

52
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,083
- ( children cry ) Mama! Mama!

53
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,791
- I'M HAPPY I WAS ABLE
TO KNOW THE TWO OF YOU.

54
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,833
- STOP IT! YOU'RE SOUNDING
LIKE WE'RE NEVER

55
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,500
GONNA GET TO SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

56
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,750
- PEOPLE ALWAYS MEET OTHERS
VERY SUDDENLY.

57
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,500
BUT THOSE CHANCE ENCOUNTERS
CHANGE PEOPLE.

58
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,958
AS DO FAREWELLS.

59
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,250
BUT YOU SHOULD NOT
FEAR SUCH SUDDENNESS.

60
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,375
- MASTER NORB!

61
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,291
- THE TIME HAS COME

62
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,375
TO CREATE A POROROKA
WITH LADY SAKUYA.

63
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,375
- POROROKA?

64
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,416
- HMM.

65
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,958
I WILL MOMENTARILY
REVERSE THE BARRIER

66
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,541
THAT SURROUNDS
THE GREAT WALL.

67
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,875
THE TERM REFERS
TO THAT PHENOMENON.

68
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,375
FLY TOWARDS THE CENTER
OF IT ALL.

69
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,083
BEYOND IT IS THE ZONE

70
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,875
THAT LEADS TO THE GENUINE
PROMISED LAND.

71
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,875
- BUT WHAT OF SAKUYA?

72
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,083
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
MASTER NORB?

73
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,625
- ( chuckling )

74
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,208
JUST GO.
RENTON, EUREKA,

75
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,333
EVEN IF THE DARKNESS SPREADS
FAR BEYOND YOUR SIGHT,

76
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,250
WHERE YOU TWO TREAD
BECOMES THE PATH.

77
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,541
- ( firing, explosions )

78
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,125
- LEADER, ARE YOU SURE
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

79
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,250
- TALHO AND KEN-GOH HAVE BEEN
TRAINING HIM FOR A WHILE.

80
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,583
DOGGIE WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

81
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,583
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

82
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,750
CAN WE REALLY PULL THIS OFF?

83
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,083
- IT'S TIME.
TAKE OFF!

84
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,541
- DON'T BLAME ME
IF WE DIE.

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,583
- SO, ALL THE ATTACKS
HAVE SUCCEEDED?

86
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,750
- YES! WE'RE CURRENTLY
IN PHASE FOUR OF OUR ATTACKS.

87
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,416
BUT WE HAD CONFIRMED
THE DETONATION OF EVERY BULLET.

88
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,916
- LAUNCH AN ORANGE
ATTACK IMMEDIATELY.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,958
- BUT LEADER, THERE ARE
STILL THREE SHIPS

90
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,666
FROM OUR ALLIANCE LEAGUE
NEAR THE VODARAC SHRINE.

91
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,958
- THE SHRINE IN THAT AREA

92
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,125
USED TO HAVE A BARRIER
AROUND IT.

93
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,416
AND THE BARRIER
DISAPPEARING MEANS--

94
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,416
- OH! THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED
IN MAKING THEIR CONTACT?

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,333
- HAVE THE END
HEAD OVER THERE.

96
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,125
WE NEED TO SEND IT
THROUGH THE WALL,

97
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,958
BEFORE THEY HAVE
THE CHANCE.

98
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,458
IF NOT, THEN--

99
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,375
- Both: ROGER THAT, SIR!

100
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,458
- SO YOU HAD EMBARKED,

101
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,708
KNOWING YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE,
MY BROTHER?

102
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,458
- HMM.

103
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,125
WELL, MY LADY...

104
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,916
WE'RE FINALLY
ALONE AGAIN.

105
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,666
- ( vibrating )

106
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,416
- ( gasps )

107
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,000
( gasps )

108
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,916
LADY SAKUYA!

109
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,500
- NO WAY!

110
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,833
YOU INJECTED THIS YOURSELF?

111
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,458
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I DID IT,

112
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,166
BECAUSE I CAN'T FIGHT
WELL WITHOUT IT.

113
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,708
- ANEMONE, THAT'S ENOUGH.

114
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,000
WHAT REASON COULD YOU
POSSIBLY HAVE TO INJECT

115
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,500
THIS MUCH MEDICATION?

116
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,208
- I HAVE A GOOD REASON.
- ( sighs )

117
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:32,000
- I MEAN, IT'S WHAT DEWEY
IS WISHING FOR.

118
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,416
- ( gasps )

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
- ( thinking )
WHAT IN THE WORLD

120
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,208
IS THE GENUINE
PROMISED LAND?

121
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,625
- Master Norb: I DON'T KNOW.

122
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,958
I FAILED,
SO DON'T ASK ME.

123
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,833
- Children: MAMA!

124
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,958
- Master Norb: ONE THING.
- ONE THING?

125
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,250
- THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I WISH TO TELL YOU.

126
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,750
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU TWO HAVE

127
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,666
THAT LADY SAKUYA
AND I LACK.

128
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,333
HMM.

129
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,458
- MASTER NORB...
WAS IN TEARS.

130
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,000
WHAT THEY LACK?

131
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,708
IT WAS YOU!
WASN'T IT, NIRVASH?

132
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,000
- ( screeching )

133
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,541
- AMAZING!
WHERE ARE WE?

134
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,791
- ( firing, explosions )

135
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,041
- ( grunts )

136
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,041
- MOONDOGGIE!
KEEP YOUR HEAD ABOVE YOU!

137
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,583
- ( beeping )

138
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,833
- TIME TO GO!
- Woman: ROGER!

139
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,666
- WHERE'S THE 606?

140
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,666
- NOT HERE YET.

141
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,666
- ( grunts )

142
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,208
- IT'S HERE.
LAUNCH THE 909!

143
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,708
- DON'T DIE, LEADER!

144
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,541
- DON'T WORRY, I WON'T!

145
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:28,125
- ( yelling )

146
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,583
- ( firing, explosions )

147
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,666
- ( grunts )

148
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,166
- ( screaming )

149
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,500
- EUREKA!

150
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,458
( gasps )

151
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,000
- ( buzzing )

152
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,000
- ( gasps )

153
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,958
IT'S--

154
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,375
IT'S A KUTE-CLASS.

155
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,875
- EVERYONE IS...
IN DANGER.

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,375
- ( firing, explosions )

157
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,291
- ( people gasping )

158
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,791
- HOW MANY OF THESE THINGS
ARE THERE?

159
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,666
( screaming )

160
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,625
- HILDA!

161
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,041
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

162
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,333
- YEAH.
THANKS, MATTHIEW.

163
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,458
( gasps )
MATTHIEW!

164
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,416
- ( grunts )
DAMMIT!

165
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,833
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT
IN TIME!

166
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,791
- HOLLAND, YOU'RE HERE!

167
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,625
- HEY, GUYS.

168
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,625
SORRY I'M A LITTLE LATE.

169
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,333
- LEADER,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

170
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,125
WE'RE A BUNCH OF MICE
CAUGHT ON A TRAP!

171
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,458
- PROTECT THIS PLACE.

172
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,125
- Hilda: HOLD ON A SECOND!
HOW CAN WE PROTECT

173
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,958
ANYTHING IN THESE
CONDITIONS?

174
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,666
WE HAVE NO CHOICE!
RENTON'S GROUP STILL HASN'T--

175
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,125
- Renton: EVACUATE THE AREA!

176
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,583
- RENTON!

177
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,333
- SORRY WE MADE YOU
ALL WORRY,

178
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,458
BUT ALL OF US ARE SAFE.

179
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,041
HEY, WHY ARE MAETER
AND THE BOYS WITH YOU?

180
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,625
- IT'S A LONG STORY.

181
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,916
- WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
- ( sighs )
WHAT THE HELL?

183
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,625
- HOLLAND, MASTER NORBS
TOLD US TO GO.

184
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,916
- WHAT?
- BEFORE WE LEFT, HE SAID

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,625
THAT HE WOULD OPEN UP A ZONE
IN THE GREAT WALL JUST FOR US.

186
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,458
- WHERE IS HE?

187
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,541
- WITH LADY SAKUYA.

188
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,083
HE CHOSE TO STAY
UNDERGROUND.

189
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,041
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT?

190
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,875
- I FEEL SAKUYA'S FEELINGS.

191
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,750
AND ALSO MASTER NORB'S
FEELINGS, TOO.

192
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,791
IT'S TIME TO GO
BEYOND THE ZONE.

193
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,708
( gasps )
HMM.

194
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,000
Man: THIS IS THE 909!

195
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,291
TALHO, PICK UP THE 606
AND 808, RIGHT AWAY.

196
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,166
THE MINUTE THE ZONE OPENS
IN THE GREAT WALL,

197
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,208
WE'RE GOING IN.

198
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,333
- HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

199
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,041
YOU JUST SAID
WE'RE GOING IN,

200
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,875
BUT BETWEEN US
AND THE GREAT WALL.

201
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,208
- LADY SAKUYA,
I-- I AM--

202
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,541
WELL--

203
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,166
- ( snorts )

204
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,208
- ( gasps )
LADY SAKUYA!

205
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,041
IS-- IS THERE SOMETHING
THE MATTER?

206
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,375
AH... DO YOU FIND YOURSELF
DISSATISFIED TO BE HERE,

207
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,833
WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME?

208
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:26,041
I KNOW. YOU'RE STILL
NOT GOING TO FORGIVE ME

209
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:31,000
FOR LEAVING, FOR ABANDONING YOU
HERE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

210
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,666
- BACK THEN...

211
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,708
IF YOU HAD NOT CALLED
MY NAME LIKE YOU DID.

212
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,958
I'M SURE I WOULDN'T BE
HERE RIGHT NOW.

213
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,708
HERE, LOOK AT THIS!

214
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,833
IT'S MY BOOK!

215
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,791
- OHH!

216
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,208
- IT'S 40 YEARS
OF BLANK PAGES.

217
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,916
THE PAGES BEFORE THAT
ARE FULL.

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,125
- WHAT?

219
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,750
HMM.

220
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,208
SAKUYA...

221
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,791
- ( chuckling )

222
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,041
YOU FINALLY
CALLED OUT FOR ME.

223
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,583
I'M GLAD.

224
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,291
I'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME.

225
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,583
- ( gasps )

226
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,125
- LET'S GET STARTED,

227
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,125
FOR THE SAKE
OF THOSE CHILDREN.

228
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,208
- FOR THEM.

229
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,833
AND FOR OUR SAKE
AS WELL.

230
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,625
- WHAT IS IT?

231
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,416
- I THINK IT'S
THE POROROKA.

232
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,375
THAT MASTER NORB
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

233
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,291
- RENTON, LISTEN UP.

234
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,750
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA BE GOING

235
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,875
FROM HERE ON IN.

236
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,500
BUT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,

237
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,500
IF YOU END UP
IN A BIND FOR SOME REASON,

238
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,541
USE THE THING THAT IS PLACED
BEHIND THE SUB PILOT'S SEAT.

239
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,916
- BUT HOLLAND,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,416
- IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU DESERVE TO HAVE

241
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,416
SO MUCH MORE
THAN I DO.

242
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,291
- HOLLAND, WAIT!
- WE'RE OUT OF TIME!

243
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,166
WE'VE GOT TO GET THROUGH
THE ANTIBODY CORALIANS,

244
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,250
RIGHT NOW!
GOT THAT, TALHO?

245
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,500
- LET'S GO, DOGGIE!

246
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,708
- ROGER THAT!

247
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,041
- LOOK OUT!

248
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,750
IT'S NO GOOD.

249
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,000
AT THIS RATE, BEFORE WE MAKE IT
THROUGH, ALL OF YOU ARE---

250
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,375
- RENTON!
LISTEN TO ME.

251
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,875
YOU HAVE TO GO NOW.
YOU TWO ARE THE ONLY HOPE

252
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:07,875
FOR ALL OUR FUTURES.

253
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,333
- TALHO--

254
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,666
- THE HOPE YOU'RE CARRYING
IS NOT JUST FOR US,

255
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,708
NOT JUST FOR MANKIND,
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

256
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,000
IT'S THE HOPE FOR EVERY LIVING
THING ON THIS PLANET!

257
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,375
- HOPE FOR EVERYTHING?

258
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,125
- ( explosion )

259
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,916
- MIS TALHO!

260
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,083
- WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

261
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,083
DON'T WORRY, RENTON.
WE'LL MAKE SURE

262
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,875
TO SURVIVE
UNTIL YOU GET BACK.

263
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,375
WE'LL ALL BE WAITING FOR YOU,

264
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,083
ALL RIGHT?
HARRY UP AND GET GOING.

265
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,041
- ( crying )

266
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,791
- Holland: DON'T HESITATE!
GO!

267
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,833
- NO, NIRVASH, STOP!

268
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,125
- LET'S GO BACK.
PLEASE, WE HAVE TO GO BACK.

269
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,833
- IT'S IN YOUR HANDS,
RENTON, EUREKA.

270
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,208
- LEADER, ATTACKING ONE KLF
APPROACHING FAST.

271
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,291
- WE'VE GOT TO STOP IT!

272
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,375
- NOW WHAT'S UP WITH THIS?

273
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,958
YOU JUST GONNA RUN AWAY?

274
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,166
- I WON'T LET YOU INTERFERE
WITH THEM.

275
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,458
- WHAT IS THIS?

276
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,916
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
I'M SUPPOSED TO FIGHT!

277
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,750
NOT BAD.
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

278
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,666
- DAMMIT!
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

279
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,000
WHAT THE HELL?

280
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,666
- BYE BYE, MR. UGLY.

281
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,375
IT'S YOUR FAULT
YOU GOT IN THE WAY.

282
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,833
- ( screaming )

283
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,875
- HOLLAND, NO!

284
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,250
GO BACK, NIRVASH!

285
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,041
GO BACK, PLEASE!

286
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,583
- RENTON, LOOK!

287
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,666
- SO I TAKE IT YOU WANNA
RUN AWAY FROM ME.

288
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,083
STUFF LIKE THAT...
PISSES ME OFF!

289
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,083
- RENTON!

290
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:23,208
- ( crying )

291
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,291
- ( inaudible )

292
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,625
- LET'S GO.

293
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,625
- ( gasps )

294
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,875
- LET'S GO, EUREKA.

295
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,291
FOR EVERYONE'S SAKE!

296
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,375
- ( explosion )

297
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,708
- OH! WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

298
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,666
( grunts )

299
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,083
( grunts )

300
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,541
WHY CAN'T I CATCH UP?

301
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,541
NO, NO!
I WON'T ALLOW IT!

302
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,083
( gasps )

303
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,083
( crying )

304
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,958
- TypeZERO HAS SWITCHED
TO SUPERSONIC FLIGHT MODE.

305
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,958
IT'S ENTRY INTO THE ZONE
IS CONFIRMED.

306
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,125
I HAVE CONFIRMATION
OF THE END'S POSITION

307
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,291
AS 8-2-5-2-7.

308
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,958
GETTING PAST THE ZONE.

309
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,791
- IT WAS A TOTAL FAILURE.

310
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,250
- YES.

311
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,958
- DON'T WORRY,
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

312
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,958
I WANT THE END
RECOVERED QUICKLY.

313
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,083
WE'RE GOING BACK.

314
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,166
- HAVE A SAFE JOURNEY...

315
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,916
RENTON, EUREKA.

316
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,333
- MASTER NORB.

317
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,958
I JUST FEEL LIKE...

318
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,208
LIGHT REFLECTS ALL
SORTS OF STUFF BEHIND US.

319
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,791
- I'M NOT SCARED.
YOU KNOW WHY?

320
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,416
'CAUSE I'M WITH YOU,
RENTON.

321
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,791
- YEAH, ME TOO.

322
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,541
- HEY, WAKE UP!

323
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,375
