1
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,791
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,500
- GET OFF.

4
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,916
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
I'M TELLING YOU,

5
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,250
GET OFF MY BUNK!

6
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,083
THIS IS MY BED, YOU GOT IT?

7
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,500
AND THIS ONE IS YOURS.

8
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,375
AH, DAMN IT.  WHO IN THE WORLD
BROUGHT HIM HERE?

9
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,500
MAYBE THE COLONEL?

10
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,041
NO, NO MORE THINKING.

11
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,000
I GOTTA SNAP OUT OF THIS.

12
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,875
HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED.
RIGHT NOW, THE PRIORITY

13
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,750
IS FINDING A GIRL
TO REPLACE ANEMONE.

14
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,375
THAT'S GREAT, YOU'VE GAINED
WEIGHT AGAIN, HAVEN'T YOU?

15
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,750
- WHAT'S WRONG?

16
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,416
- JUST HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO MAKE ME WAIT?

17
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,208
- THERE'S A LARGE THUNDER CLOUD
DIRECTLY AHEAD OF US.

18
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,541
AND THE CONTROL TOWER WON'T
GRANT US CLEARANCE TO LAND.

19
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,500
- HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE WE
ENTERED THE SKY ABOVE WARSAW?

20
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,250
- IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY,
YOU'RE PERFECTLY FREE

21
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,541
TO USE ONE OF THE SHIPS
MINIATURE HIGH-SPEED PODS,

22
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,500
LIKE YOU DID BEFORE.

23
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,375
- I'M GETTING NOWHERE WITH YOU.

24
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,083
CAPTAIN.

25
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,541
- Captain:
REQUEST LANDING CLEARANCE

26
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,750
WITH THE CONTROL TOWER.

27
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,750
A SMALL CRACK HAS OPENED UP
IN THE CLOUDS.

28
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:37,750
- Maria:
YES, SIR.

29
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,416
- Holland: HOW LONG ARE THEY
GONNA TIE ME DOWN IN HERE?

30
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,916
- Talho:
HOLLAND!

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,041
- THEY SHOULD KNOW BY NOW
THAT WE'RE IN TROUBLE

32
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,791
IF WE DON'T HURRY!

33
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,833
- RIGHT NOW, WHAT YOU NEED
TO DO IS REST.

34
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:00,875
PLEASE TRY TO RELAX.

35
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,333
- WHY CAN'T THEY UNDERSTAND?

36
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,250
I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN
BEFORE IT'S ALL TOO LATE.

37
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,250
PLEASE, TALHO, LET ME GO...

38
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:21,750
- THANKS, MISCHA.

39
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,500
- WHEN YOU SAY THAT,
I START TO FEEL

40
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,208
APOLOGETIC FOR SOME REASON.

41
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,708
- MISCHA...

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,708
- Morita:
BEFORE LIMITERS WERE INSTALLED,

43
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,958
LFOs OF THAT KIND
REQUIRED TWO TYPES

44
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,375
OF MEDICATION FOR THE PILOT--

45
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,208
ONE TO ELEVATE THE STIMULATION
OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM,

46
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,291
AND ONE TO FORCE
A STATE OF SLUMBER

47
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,833
AFTER PILOTING THE VEHICLE.

48
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,375
Talho: THE NEGATIVE
LEGACIES OF THE FRONTIER ERA

49
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,333
OF THE HUMANOID MOBILE MACHINES.

50
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,625
- Morita: THEY SHOULD
RIGHTFULLY BE SEALED AWAY.

51
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,125
BUT WE'RE THE LAST PEOPLE
WHO SHOULD BE SAYING THAT.

52
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,833
WE'RE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THEM.

53
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,458
Talho: BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE
THAT WE HAVE TO SHOOT DOWN

54
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,291
THE AFX NO MATTER WHAT, RIGHT?

55
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,291
- YES.

56
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,791
- AT THIS RATE, HOLLAND
WILL DIE BEFORE THEN.

57
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,708
- ( gasps )
I KNOW.

58
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,333
I KNOW THAT, BUT THAT'S
STILL NOT A REASON TO STOP HIM.

59
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,625
- TALHO...

60
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,833
- THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
GIVE UP RIGHT NOW.

61
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,958
NOT 'TIL THE FINAL MOMENT
CRASHES DOWN ON US.

62
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,416
- I THINK THAT GOING
ANY FURTHER COULD BE DANGEROUS.

63
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,208
FOR NOW, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GO BACK

64
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,083
TO THAT NICE SPRING
WE PASSED A WHILE AGO.

65
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,166
- I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK.

66
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,208
- I GUESS YOU GUYS MUST BE
GETTING PRETTY TIRED, RIGHT?

67
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,250
- MY BOTTOM HURTS.

68
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,125
- I WANNA GO OUTSIDE.

69
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,125
- DID YOU HEAR THEM?

70
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,125
- LOOK AT THAT.

71
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,791
- THIS IS HORRIBLE.

72
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,333
AND IT'S BEEN
WELL OVER TEN YEARS

73
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,375
SINCE THE CIVIL WAR ENDED.
AND IT'S STILL LIKE THIS?

74
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,833
THOSE THAT CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE RESTORATION

75
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,500
BECOME REFUGEES AND MOVE
TO OTHER TOWER STATES.

76
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,500
SO THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
TO A TOWER STATE

77
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,666
WHEN THE TOWER FALLS.

78
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,166
- UM, LIEUTENANT DOMINIC?

79
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,666
- HUH?

80
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,083
- STOP THE CAR.

81
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,541
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

82
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,250
- Dominic:
WHAT IS HE DOING?

83
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT QUESTION
CAME FROM SOMEONE

84
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,791
WHO USED TO WORK
AT INTELLIGENCE.

85
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

86
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,041
- THE CAPTAIN WAS
ORIGINALLY FROM THIS AREA.

87
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,541
- Dominic: WHAT?

88
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,041
- Maria: YEAH, THE CAPTAIN LOST
HIS WIFE AND TWO DAUGHTERS

89
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,208
RIGHT THERE IN THAT HOUSE.

90
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,166
- SO WHAT IF HE DID?

91
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,708
- ( horn honking )

92
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,375
- STOP IT, WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

93
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,791
- ( honking continues )

94
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,625
- DAMN IT, I TOLD YOU
TO STOP DOING THAT!

95
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,500
- SORRY, CARRY ON.

96
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,250
- YES, SIR.

97
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,791
- DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE

98
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,000
WHO LOST HIS FAMILY
IN THE DAMN WAR?

99
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,416
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
SUFFERING THAT KIND OF PAIN.

100
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,791
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

101
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,416
- ( sighs )

102
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,416
- Maurice: STOP IT.

103
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,000
- SORRY.

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,958
I THINK WE'RE
RIGHT ABOUT HERE RIGHT NOW.

105
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,666
- IT DOESN'T MATTER,
IT'S ALL THE SAME.

106
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,333
BECAUSE WE'LL NEVER LEAVE HERE
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

107
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,416
- LOOK, I'M SURE
WE'LL FIND A WAY.

108
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,083
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT.
UP UNTIL NOW,

109
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,375
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT
THROUGH EVERYTHING.

110
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,083
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

111
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,541
THIS IS DIFFERENT
FROM BEFORE.

112
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,125
EVERYTHING'S TOTALLY
DIFFERENT!

113
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,708
- MAURICE...

114
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,833
- HOLLAND'S NOT HERE.

115
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,083
TALHO'S NOT HERE.

116
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,000
AND HILDA, AND STONER,
THEY'RE ALL GONE!

117
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,250
AND MOMMA'S GONE CRAZY.
SHE'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER.

118
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,083
SO SAVE ALL YOUR CRAP
FOR THE OTHERS.

119
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,666
- Linck:
RENTON!

120
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,083
LOOK, I FOUND SOME FOOD.

121
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,708
- THERE'S STILL A LOT OF 'EM
UP ON THE TOP OF THE TREE.

122
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,208
COME ON, LET'S GO GET 'EM.

123
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,125
- YEAH, LET'S GO.

124
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,875
- YOU SHOULD COME
WITH US, MAURICE.

125
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,583
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

126
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,958
- LINCK, I'M CURIOUS--
WHERE'D YOU FIND

127
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:14,958
ALL THE NICE FRUIT?

128
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,125
- OVER HERE.

129
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,125
- HERE.

130
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,125
WAIT UP, GUYS!
I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU.

131
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,166
- MOMMA...

132
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,500
- THEY'RE OPENING IT.

133
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,125
- SO YOU ARE SPECIAL MISSIONS
LIEUTENANT DOMINIC.

134
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,625
- YES.  AND YOU ARE?

135
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,583
- I'M DECKARD.  LET'S JUST SAY
I'M A REPRESENTATIVE

136
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,166
FROM THE NOVAK FOUNDATION.

137
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,458
- NOVAK?

138
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,666
LIKE THE COLONEL?

139
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,125
- I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU, LIEUTENANT.

140
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,083
- Dominic:
MAY I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

141
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,333
- Deckard: GO AHEAD.

142
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,458
- HAVE I MET YOU
SOME TIME IN THE PAST?

143
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,125
- YES, ONCE
AS MATTER OF FACT.

144
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,458
WHEN I DELIVERED IT.

145
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,375
- DELIVERED IT?

146
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,125
SO THOSE GIRLS
ARE GONNA REPLACE ANEMONE?

147
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,416
- THE ONES YOU SEE HERE
WERE JUST DELIVERED TO US TODAY.

148
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,875
- FROM WHERE, SIR?

149
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,875
FROM WHERE DID THEY ALL COME?

150
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,375
THE BATTLEFIELD?

151
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,125
- OF COURSE, THIS CITY
IS NEVER LACKING

152
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,541
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACQUISITION
OF TEST SUBJECTS.

153
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,375
I'M SURE YOU KNOW
THE OTHER NAME FOR THIS TOWN.

154
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,666
WARSAW IS ALSO KNOWN
AS JOY DIVISION.

155
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,833
I WOULD THINK
THAT OFFICERS LIKE YOU

156
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,666
WOULD KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

157
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,916
NOW, LET'S GET GOING.

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,541
I'M AFRAID WE'RE MAKING
THE NEXT ANEMONE WAIT.

159
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,416
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

160
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,916
- HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

161
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,250
WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY HERE
WITH ALL OF US?

162
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,875
YOU'RE ACTING STRANGE,
EUREKA.

163
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,666
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

164
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,250
IF YOU'VE GOT
SOME KIND OF COMPLAINT,

165
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,250
THEN JUST SAY IT.

166
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,250
- Eureka:
I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS.

167
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,916
- YOU'RE LYING.

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,708
- I'M NOT, IT'S THE TRUTH.

169
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,375
- THEN STAY HERE WITH US.

170
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,750
WHEN YOU GET LIKE THIS, THE KIDS
REALLY START TO WORRY ABOUT YOU.

171
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,916
WE CAME DOWN HERE
BECAUSE EVERYONE SENT US.

172
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,500
I KNOW HOW PRESSURED
YOU FEEL,

173
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,833
BUT THAT'S
ALL THE MORE REASON

174
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,750
WE NEED TO TACKLE
THIS PROBLEM TOGETHER.

175
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,250
EUREKA, PLEASE.

176
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,291
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

177
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:02,750
I'M SORRY.

178
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,000
DON'T FOLLOW ME.

179
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,833
- ( gasps )

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,791
- WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

181
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,458
THIS IS ANEMONE?

182
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,666
- ARE YOU SATISFIED
WITH WHAT YOU SEE?

183
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,708
OUR SKILLS IN PLASTIC SURGERY
HAVE INCREASED QUITE A BIT

184
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,250
SINCE THE LAST ATTEMPT
TO CREATE SUCH A BEING.

185
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,208
WE RESTRUCTURED THE SKELETONS
AND LEARNED TO CONTROL

186
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,916
THE ACTIVITY OF MUSCLES
USED IN FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

187
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,375
THUS MAKING THEM RESEMBLE
THE ORIGINAL MORE CLOSELY.

188
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,416
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

189
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,000
- Deckard: THEY'RE
PERFORMING THE FINAL TEST.

190
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,833
THE REQUIRED LEVELS
ARE MUCH LOWER

191
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,500
THAN WHEN WE FIRST
SHIPPED THE ORIGINAL ANEMONE.

192
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,833
BUT OUR LORD DEWEY
HAS ORDERED US

193
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,458
TO PREPARE THREE NEW BODIES
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

194
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,666
- START THE MEDICATION.

195
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,958
- ( whimpering )

196
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,291
- ( all gasps )

197
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,333
- THAT GIRL FROM THE LAST TIME
WE DID THIS WAS QUITE SPECIAL.

198
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,500
HER TOLERANCE OF THE MEDICATION
WAS HIGH.

199
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,166
AS WAS HER DEPENDENCE
TOWARDS THE ZONE.

200
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,791
NORMALLY,
BY INJECTING MEDICATION

201
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,708
WITH A HIGH STIMULUS EFFECT
ONE CAN DRAG THE SUBJECT

202
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,458
BACK TO REALITY
FOR AT LEAST A BRIEF MOMENT.

203
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,541
BUT EVEN IN THAT SENSE,
SHE WAS SPECIAL AS WELL.

204
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,833
INCLUDING THE SUBJECTS
FOUND IN THIS TOWN,

205
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,541
SHE WAS THE ONE
WITH THE MOST PROMISE.

206
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,208
- ANEMONE, YOU WERE...

207
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,791
YOU... YOU...

208
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,583
ALL THIS TIME, YOU...

209
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,791
- ( alarm ringing )

210
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,291
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

211
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,875
LORD DEWEY HAS
SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED

212
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,041
THAT YOU BE THE ONE
TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE

213
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,500
OF THE THREE
FINISHED PRODUCTS

214
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,583
WILL BECOME
THE FINAL REPLACEMENT.

215
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,166
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO?

216
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,208
- ( vomiting )

217
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,750
- Dominic:
IT'S ME.

218
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,833
THE EXPERIMENT
ENDED A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

219
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,166
AS A RESULT...

220
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,833
NONE OF THEM WERE ABLE
TO BECOME ANEMONE'S REPLACEMENT.

221
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,916
YOU KNOW, I LOST MY FAMILY
IN THE WAR LIKE YOU DID.

222
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,625
I THOUGHT I KNEW MORE
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

223
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,333
THE PAIN OF LIVING ALL ALONE.

224
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:59,583
THAT WAS ALL THE MORE REASON,
WHY I WANTED TO SUPPORT ANEMONE.

225
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,125
EVEN THOUGH I KNEW
THAT THE MEDICATION

226
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,041
SHE WAS TAKING WAS EATING
AWAY AT HER MIND AND BODY.

227
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,750
I DID EXACTLY
AS SHE HAD WISHED.

228
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,791
I... I...

229
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,291
...I KNOW THAT I CAN SAVE HER
FROM THE LIFE

230
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,916
SHE'S LEADING RIGHT NOW
BY FINDING

231
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,458
A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT
FOR HER.

232
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:25,875
BUT-- BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
I HAVE TO CHOOSE SOMEBODY ELSE.

233
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,208
AND I CAN'T.

234
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,708
WHAT'S THIS?

235
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,375
- IS THE STORY THAT'S WRITTEN
IN THERE TELLING THE TRUTH?

236
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,333
THE APPEARANCE
OF ANTIBODY CORALIANS,

237
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:44,708
THE COLLAPSE
OF THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE,

238
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,791
IS EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
PART OF A PLAN

239
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,250
THAT THE COLONEL
HAS CONJURED UP?

240
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,041
KNOWING THAT INNOCENT CIVILIANS
WOULD BE DESTROYED BY IT ALL?

241
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,666
I SEE.

242
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,666
- WHAT IS THIS?

243
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,083
IT'S REALLY HEAVY.

244
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,416
- WHAT IS THAT?

245
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,708
- Renton:
HOLLAND TOLD ME TO USE THIS

246
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,958
IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO US.

247
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,125
- WOW.

248
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,291
- HOLLAND,
I'VE GOT TO OPEN IT.

249
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,583
- SO HUGE.

250
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,791
- YES, YES.

251
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,708
- ( clicks )
- Eureka: RENTON!

252
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,583
- MAETER, WHAT'S WRONG?

253
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,208
- MOMMA, MOMMA IS--

254
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,000
- EUREKA?

255
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,000
EUREKA...

256
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,250
- ( crying )

257
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,000
- MAURICE!

258
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,958
- MOMMA!  MOMMA!

259
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,875
- I'LL BE BACK,
STAY RIGHT HERE.

260
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,958
- MOMMA!  MOMMA!

261
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,000
MOMMA!

262
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,416
- MAURICE, COME BACK!

263
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,791
- MOMMA?

264
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,166
- MAURICE, WAIT.

265
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,458
- MOMMA, WAIT!

266
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,416
- MOMMA!

267
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,166
- Soldier: MOMENTS AGO,
FEDERATION FORCE HEADQUARTERS

268
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,541
GAVE AN ORDER TO ATTACK
THE TRESSOIR FACILITY.

269
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,250
- TO TRESSOIR?

270
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,375
- YES, APPARENTLY MEMBERS
OF GEKKOSTATE ARE BEING HARBORED

271
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,541
WITHIN THE TECH LABORATORY.

272
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,000
- Jurgens: AND?

273
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,041
- UM, AFTER JOINING THE
EIGHTEENTH INDEPENDENT SQUADRON,

274
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,708
WE ARE TO IMMEDIATELY CAPTURE
THE MEMBERS OF GEKKOSTATE,

275
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,083
AS WELL AS ALL
LABORATORY WORKERS IN TRESSOIR.

276
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,083
- CAPTAIN...

277
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,208
- IS THERE ANYWHERE WE CAN
STOP AND REPLENISH

278
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,583
OUR WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION
ON THE WAY TO TRESSOIR?

279
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,625
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

280
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,791
- WE'VE BEEN GIVEN AN ORDER.

281
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,708
- ( Maria over P.A. )
ATTENTION ALL CREW MEMBERS,

282
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,125
THIS SHIP WILL HEAD
TO THE TRESSOIR TECH LABORATORY.

283
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,958
ALL HANDS IMMEDIATELY TAKE
YOUR ASSIGNED POSITIONS.

284
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,083
REPEATING-- THIS SHIP
WILL NOW HEAD

285
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,916
TO THE TRESSOIR
TECH LABORATORY.

286
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,291
ALL HANDS IMMEDIATELY TAKE
YOUR ASSIGNED POSITIONS.

287
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,458
- ( thinking )
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

288
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,791
ANEMONE...

289
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,291
- Eureka and Renton:
TO BE CONTINUED.

290
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,708
- ( theme music playing )

291
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,000
Narrator:
THE BOY AND THE OTHERS

292
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,833
TRY TO HEAD FROM THE TRUTH
OF THE PAST

293
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,000
TOWARDS THE TRUTH
YET TO BE SEEN.

294
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,583
THE WORLD, SEPARATED
INTO HEAVEN AND EARTH,

295
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:13,041
BECOMES REUNITED
FROM A CERTAIN BOND.

296
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,250
NEXT EPISODE--
"DON'T YOU WANT ME?"
