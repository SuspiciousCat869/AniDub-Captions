00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,833
- ARE YOU DONE?

12
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,791
- HOW IS SHE?

13
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,291
WHEN A BEING WHO HAS GONE TO THE
VERY END OF THE EIGHTH REALM,

14
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,958
IS RETURNED TO THE WORLD,

15
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,333
WE KNOW THE WORLD OF
THE THIRD REALM,

16
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,791
IT IS SAID THAT THEY ALWAYS
END UP LOOKING LIKE THIS.

17
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,291
- SOMEONE WHO TOUCHED
THE END OF THE WORLD?

18
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,208
I HAVE PERFORMED
THE RYOJU RITUAL

19
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,583
THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN
TO ME BY MASTER NORB.

20
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,708
NOW, WE CAN ONLY
WAIT AND SEE

21
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,166
WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE
THE VODARAC WILL SHOW

22
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,375
TO THIS GIRL'S IMPRISONED SOUL.

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,916
IT WAS A DREAM.

- ( beeping )

28
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,500
- Holland: SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU.

29
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,875
- NOT AT ALL, I WAS THE ONE
THAT WAS RESCUED.

30
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,541
- IS EUREKA ALL RIGHT NOW?

31
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,791
- MOST LIKELY.

32
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:28,666
- HOWEVER, DON'T LET THE CAUSE
OF ALL THIS GET CLOSE TO HER.

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,375
- ALL RIGHT.

34
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:36,166
- THEN EVERYTHING IS AS
THE VODARAC GUIDES IT TO BE.

35
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,041
- YOU ALL HEARD HIM.

36
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,083
THE HIGH PRIEST SAID
HE'S DANGEROUS.

37
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,625
- COME ON, HOLLAND.

38
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,875
DON'T YOU THINK YOU ARE JUMPING
TO CONCLUSIONS A LITTLE BIT?

39
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,625
- WHO ELSE COULD HAVE CAUSED
ALL THIS TO HAPPEN?!

40
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,041
EVER SINCE HE GOT HERE,

41
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,791
EUREKA HAS BEEN BECOMING
STRANGER AND STRANGER EVERYDAY.

42
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,208
- BUT HOLLAND,
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

43
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,500
- OH, YEAH? HOW IS THAT?

44
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,833
- YOU BROUGHT HIM HERE.

45
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,083
- YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR BRINGING HIM ABOARD,

46
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,250
KNOWING THAT HE WAS DIANE'S
YOUNGER BROTHER.

47
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,791
- WHERE IS HE?

48
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,208
- HE'S COOPED HIMSELF UP
IN HIS OWN ROOM.

49
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:26,791
- WITH THESE HANDS,
I KILLED SOMEONE.

50
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:34,250
OF COURSE, IT SEEMS I HAVE
BEEN KILLING PEOPLE ALL ALONG.

51
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,625
- ( stomach grumbling )

52
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,916
- SIS, EVEN WHEN
THEY'RE IN PAIN,

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,916
PEOPLE STILL
BECOME HUNGRY.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,375
( munching loudly )

55
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,166
- MY HUNGER DISAPPEARED
WHEN I ATE,

56
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,541
BUT, THE PAIN IN MY HEART
DIDN'T GO AWAY.

57
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,458
- I'M SORRY,
BUT CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR

58
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,958
AND PUT THIS ON MY TAB? THANKS.

59
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,000
- I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN,

60
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,541
YET NOT ONE PERSON HERE GIVES
ME EVEN THE TINIEST KIND WORD.

61
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,666
- WHY ARE YOU HERE, RENTON?
- YOU GO AWAY, PUKEY.

62
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,000
- YEAH, GO AWAY.

63
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,833
- IT WAS YOU WHO DID
THAT AWFUL THING TO MY MAMA.

64
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,583
- HOLLAND TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT.

65
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,291
- WHAT'S ALL
THE COMMOTION ABOUT?

66
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,958
- THERE ARE NO
VISITS ALLOWED,

67
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,500
BUT RENTON'S KEEPS TRYING
TO GO IN TO SEE MAMA.

68
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,708
- MISS MISCHA...

69
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,166
HOW'S EUREKA?

70
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,875
- THANKS TO THE VODARAC PRIEST,

71
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,208
SHE IS STARTING TO
STABILIZE PHYSICALLY.

72
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,708
HOWEVER, SHE'S
MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

73
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,125
IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

74
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,875
NO VISITORS ARE ALLOWED.

75
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,916
- SO, I CAN'T SEE HER?

76
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,208
- I'M SORRY.

77
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,083
- ( munching loudly )

78
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,750
- IS SOMETHING WRONG, RENTON?

79
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,875
GEEZ, I WONDER
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

80
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,208
- WAIT A MINUTE,
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

81
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,541
- NOTHING. I BEHAVED JUST LIKE
I ALWAYS DO AROUND HIM.

82
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,750
- ARE YOU SURE?
- OF COURSE, I AM.

83
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,833
- I'M REALLY GOOD AT THAT
KIND OF STUFF, YOU KNOW?

84
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,916
- I DOUBT THAT.
- COME ON, IT'S TRUE.

85
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,375
- ( humming )

86
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,791
- HUH? HEY, RENTON,
GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK UP.

87
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,708
BY THE WAY, DID THE PACK
OF SILK UNDERWEAR

88
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,000
I ORDERED COME IN YET?

89
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,875
I'M DOWN TO MY LAST GOOD PAIR.

90
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,000
HEY, RENTON,
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

91
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,708
- ( mumbling )

92
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,041
- THAT'S GREAT.

93
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,583
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER
EVER TEACH YOU

94
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,625
NOT TO TALK WITH YOUR
MOUTH FULL OF FOOD?

95
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,041
ESPECIALLY POTATO CHIPS.

96
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,250
- ♪ UNDERWEAR, UNDERWEAR,
WHERE'S MY UNDERWEAR? ♪

97
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,583
HMM? WHAT'S THIS?
( chuckles )

98
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,791
WHO'S GOING TO WEAR
SOMETHING THIS HUGE?

99
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,500
- MR. MATTHIEU.
- WHAT, I AM?

100
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,916
- EVERYONE KNEW ALL ALONG.

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,750
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

102
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,333
EVERYONE KNEW ALL ALONG,
AND THEY ARE STILL DOING IT.

103
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,000
EVERYONE HERE KNEW.

104
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,291
EVERYONE KNEW THIS IS A WAR.

105
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,791
WE'RE KILLING PEOPLE!

106
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,666
- ( sighs ) YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

107
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,416
THINK ABOUT IT, RENTON.

108
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
ALL KLFS ARE PILOTED
BY PEOPLE.

109
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,041
AND WHEN WE DEFEAT THEM,
THOSE PEOPLE DIE.

110
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,666
I MEAN EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

111
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,041
- WHY DO YOU DO IT?

112
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,583
- JUST WHO DID
YOU THINK WE WERE

113
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,166
WHEN YOU JOINED UP WITH US?

114
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,166
A BUNCH OF CAREFREE GUYS WHO
DID NOTHING BUT RIDE TRAPARS?

115
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,833
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

116
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,750
THERE'S NO WAY
A BUNCH OF REF BOARDERS

117
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,750
COULD HAVE EQUIP THEMSELVES
WITH WEAPONS AND LFOS.

118
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,125
IN ORDER FOR US TO SURVIVE,

119
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,791
SOMETIMES WE HAVE
TO KILL PEOPLE.

120
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,750
THAT'S THE DESTINY OF
SOMEONE WHO FIGHTS

121
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,791
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
AND SOCIETY.

122
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,750
IF WE DON'T FIGHT, THEY'LL JUST
COME AND HUNT US DOWN.

123
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,000
IF YOU WANT TO GO
AND CALL THAT A WAR,

124
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,750
THEN I GUESS WHAT WE ARE DOING
IS FIGHTING A WAR.

125
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,416
- THEN, HOW COULD YOU DO IT?

126
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
HOW CAN YOU BEHAVE NORMALLY
LIKE NOTHING IS HAPPENING?

127
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BEHAVE NORMALLY?

128
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,291
I MEAN, COME ON, THIS IS
EVERYDAY LIFE FOR US HERE.

129
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,833
AND YOU KNEW THAT ALL ALONG
WHEN YOU JOINED GEKKOSTATE.

130
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,875
- ( gasps )

131
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:21,375
- MAN, THIS SURE IS A HUGE
PAIR OF UNDERWEAR.

132
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,583
- NOW, I'M TRUSTING YOU, KIDS.
- LEAVE IT TO US.

133
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,541
- HUH? A RAT?

134
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,875
- A RAT? A RAT.
- IT WENT THAT WAY.

135
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,083
- All: WAIT.

136
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,958
- ( beeping )

137
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,375
- RENTON.

138
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,625
- EUREKA.

139
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,791
- WHAT?

140
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,750
- GOT A MINUTE?

141
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,250
- Eureka: I WAS TOLD THAT I
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE YOU.

142
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,541
- THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME, TOO.

143
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,500
- THEY SAID THAT IF
I GET CLOSE TO YOU,

144
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,291
YOU COULD BECOME UNSTABLE AGAIN.

145
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,791
- THEY'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

146
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,958
I MEAN,

147
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,000
I CAN ALREADY FEEL MY HEART
STARTING TO SPEED UP.

148
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,708
- ( beeping )

149
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,833
- I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.

150
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,125
- UNDERSTAND WHAT?

151
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,166
- THAT WE'RE FIGHTING.

152
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,333
- I HONESTLY THOUGHT
I HAD UNDERSTOOD IT

153
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:21,500
BACK WHEN YOU TOLD ME,
THAT WE ALL WERE IN A WAR.

154
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,083
THAT WE WERE
ACTUALLY FIGHTING.

155
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,291
BUT I DIDN'T.

156
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,625
- ( sobs ) IT DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE IT WAS REAL.

157
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,208
IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE,

158
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,041
LIKE THERE WAS REALLY SOMEONE,

159
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,625
INSIDE THAT KLF.

160
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,125
- YOU WERE FIGHTING
WITHOUT REALIZING THAT?

161
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,166
- ( gasps )

162
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,875
I...

163
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,208
YOU KNOW, EUREKA, I WANT
YOU TO KNOW ONE THING.

164
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:02,208
THE WHOLE TIME I WAS ONLY
FIGHTING TO PROTECT YOU.

165
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,958
- BUT, IF YOU DESTROY A HUMAN,
THEN HE'LL NEVER COME BACK.

166
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,750
- ( gasps ) THAT'S A
CRUEL WAY OF PUTTING IT.

167
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,875
YOU REALLY DIDN'T
HAVE TO SAY IT THAT WAY.

168
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,166
I DID IT ALL FOR YOU.

169
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,083
BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU
ARE SOMEONE I CAN MAYBE...

170
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,208
- NO!

171
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,833
- ( beeping rapidly )

172
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,375
- ( crying ) I'M SORRY.

173
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,583
THIS SUCKS. I'M SUCH A JERK.

174
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,708
( exclaims )

175
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,250
IT WASN'T ABOUT A WAR

176
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,500
OR HOW THE PEOPLE
OF GEKKOSTATE LIVE.

177
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,125
I WAS HERE BECAUSE
I WANTED TO PROTECT EUREKA.

178
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,291
BUT... BUT NOW,

179
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,958
EUREKA HATES ME.

180
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,125
THIS IS THE WORST.

181
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,958
- ( gasps ) THE AMITA DRIVE.

182
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,000
DOESN'T MATTER, IT'S OVER.

183
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,833
- HELLO, THERE. CARE FOR TEA?

184
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,500
- ( wind blowing )

185
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,333
- WELL, GIVE EVERYONE MY BEST.

186
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,625
THERE'S NOWHERE FOR ME
TO STAY ON THE GEKKO ANYMORE.

187
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,125
BUT THE SKIES I JUMPED INTO,

188
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,500
SEEMED ALL WARPED
BECAUSE OF MY TEARS.

189
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,041
- ( siren blaring )

190
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,750
- COME ON, CHARLES,
WE'VE GOT A JOB.

191
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:35,375
- HMM? BUT MY PIZZA
IS GOING TO GET COLD.

192
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,416
- I'M SURE YOU CAN GET
RID OF THE PIRATES

193
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,708
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

194
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,125
- YEAH, YEAH. I GUESS
I HAVE TO DO IT

195
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,666
FOR A CUTE LITTLE RAY.

196
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,833
- ( chuckles )
HEY, DON'T SWEET TALK ME.

197
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,708
NOW, COME ON, LET'S GO.

198
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,291
- ( burps ) AH, PIZZA.

199
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,750
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH OF THAT.

200
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,333
WE'RE JUST ABOUT
IN RANGE, CHARLES.

201
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,583
- YEAH, I KNOW.

202
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,125
THIS IS PERFECT
FOR A PRE-MEAL EXERCISE.

203
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,750
- I'LL BE DAMNED.

204
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,666
I GUESS THAT BOARD
WAS A DECOY.

205
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,958
- ( loud explosion )

206
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,166
- MAN, I HOPE THAT PIZZA
IS STILL HOT.

207
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,208
- WAIT A MINUTE, DON'T WE
HAVE TO PICK UP THE LOOT

208
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,625
FROM THE FALLEN SHIP?

209
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,125
- I DON'T KNOW. DO WE GET
TO CHARGE EXTRA FOR THAT?

210
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,458
WELL, WE GET A BONUS FOR THIS.

211
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,416
SO, I GUESS WE SHOULDN'T
BE TOO GREEDY.

212
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,083
- ( giggles ) I LOVE YOU.

213
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,541
- ( grunts )

214
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,083
- BORING! BORING! BORING!
IT'S ALL BORING!

215
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,000
WHY WON'T YOU LET ME
GET ON THE END, HUH?

216
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,583
HE'S CRYING OUT FOR ME,
YOU KNOW.

217
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,500
- ANEMONE, PLEASE CALM DOWN

218
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,000
AND TRY TO LISTEN
TO WHAT I'M SAYING.

219
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,500
- I DON'T GET IT.

220
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,541
- ( grunts )

221
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,166
- THE AGEHA PROJECT IS COMING
TO A CRITICAL STAGE.

222
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,000
IT'S ABOUT THE GEKKOSTATE.

223
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,833
WE CAN'T LEAVE THEM ALONE NOW.

224
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,000
- THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO USE
THE END TO CRUSH THEM,

225
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,541
TYPE ZERO AND ALL!

226
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,958
ANEMONE, THE COLONEL SAID THAT
JOB IS TOO MUNDANE FOR YOU.

227
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,500
TOO EASY.

228
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,166
- DEWEY SAID THAT?

229
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,583
- YEAH, HE DID.

230
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,833
AND THIS VERY MOMENT,

231
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,166
HE'S CONTACTING SOMEONE
TO DO THAT JOB FOR YOU.

232
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,000
- I'M AFRAID THAT
THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY

233
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,708
FOR ME TO CONTACT
THE TWO OF YOU.

234
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,500
PLEASE DON'T THINK BADLY OF ME.

235
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,375
- DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE SAVAGE

236
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,791
FORCING A
DOCKING LIKE THAT?

237
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,000
WELL, I SUPPOSE THAT'S
THE WAY YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

238
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,833
- SO, WHAT DOES A HIGH-RANKING
ARMY OFFICER WANT FROM ME?

239
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,625
COMING OUT HERE WITH
A HIGH-SPEED SHIP AND ALL?

240
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,833
- YOU STILL USE THIS?

241
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,375
- IT'S WHAT I GOT
INSTEAD OF DISCHARGE PAY.

242
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,833
- DO YOU KNOW THE ORIGIN
OF THE TERM FREELANCE?

243
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,208
- HUH?
- COMES FROM FREE LANCE.

244
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,500
- IN OTHER WORDS, A SPEAR.
A SOLDIER FOR HIRE.

245
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,958
A CUTTING EDGE AIMED
AGAINST ANYONE

246
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,208
AND GIVEN MONEY IN RETURN.

247
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,791
I'D BE HAPPY TO
GIVE YOU THAT MONEY.

248
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,000
- YOU WANT ME BACK
IN THE MILITARY?

249
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,375
YOU ALREADY KNOW MY ANSWER.

250
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,541
I WON'T DO IT.

251
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,791
THE CAREFREE LIFE OF A
MERCENARY FITS MY PERSONALITY.

252
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,625
I CAN'T GO BACK
TO AN UPTIGHT ARMY, NOW.

253
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:17,416
BESIDES, THIS WAY
WE CAN LIVE IN PEACE.

254
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,041
- AND THAT'S THAT.

255
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,875
AND NOW, WILL YOU
GO HOME, PLEASE?

256
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,500
- I'LL LET YOU SETTLE
YOUR SCORE WITH HOLLAND.

257
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,541
- ( gasps )
- DO YOU STILL DECLINE?

258
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,708
- DON'T BEG FOR THINGS.

259
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,875
DO IT YOURSELF.

260
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,583
- THEN IT WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU.

261
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,083
- ( sneezes )

262
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,250
SOMEONE'S SPREADING
RUMORS ABOUT ME.

263
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,083
- OH, YEAH?
AN OLD GIRLFRIEND MAYBE?

264
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,333
- WELL, YOU SOUND
AWFULLY IRRITATED.

265
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,916
- AND YOU'RE TREATING
RENTON PRETTY BADLY.

266
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,625
- IT'S NOT BAD TREATMENT.

267
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,458
IT'S JUST HE IS...
HE'S DANGEROUS, THAT'S ALL.

268
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,333
- AND WHICH FOOL DID THAT
DANGEROUS BOY SAVE?

269
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,583
- HUH?

270
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,375
- YOU WENT OFF AND TRIED
TO SAVE EUREKA.

271
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,916
BUT, AT THE SAME TIME,

272
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,458
RENTON WAS TRYING
TO SAVE HER, TOO.

273
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,333
YOU HAVE TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND
HIS FEELINGS FOR HER.

274
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,750
- WHY, HE'S DANGEROUS!

275
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,458
- YOU REALLY ARE IMMATURE.

276
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,500
- ( door closes )

277
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,791
- ( grunts )

278
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,750
- HEY, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE MY BAG WENT?

279
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,666
- YOUR BAG?

280
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,958
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

281
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,916
YOU SEE, MY FAVORITE ONE
IS MISSING.

282
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,916
- LOOK, I'M NOT IN CHARGE
OF REMEMBERING

283
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,916
WHERE YOU PUT YOUR STUFF.

284
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,166
- ( sobbing )

285
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,458
- HMM.

286
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,708
- ( all giggling )

287
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,833
- HUH?
- DID RENTON STOP BY?

288
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,541
- WE SHOOED PUKEY AWAY.

289
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,833
- Linck: WE WON'T LET HIM
ANYWHERE NEAR MAMA.

290
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,041
- I SEE.

291
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,416
- ( beeps )

292
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,291
- DID SOMEONE JUST STOP BY?

293
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,583
- DON'T KNOW.
WHY DO YOU ASK, DEAR ?

294
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,500
- I HAD A FEELING
THAT RENTON MIGHT COME VISIT.

295
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,416
- WHY DID YOU THINK THAT?

296
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,166
- I DON'T KNOW.

297
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,875
- HEY, RENTON?

298
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,083
- CARE FOR SOME TEA?

299
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,583
- UM, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE RENTON WENT?

300
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,666
- RENTON LEFT.

301
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,750
HE SAID TO GIVE HIS
BEST REGARDS TO EVERYONE.

302
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,333
- THAT DAMN BRAT.

303
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,375
WITHOUT ANY PERMISSION,
HE JUST...

304
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:06,166
WHEN HE COMES BACK, I'M GOING
TO GIVE HIM A GOOD SPANKING.

305
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,791
- ( sneezes )

306
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,625
- I GUESS I REALLY JUMPED
OUT OF THE SHIP.

307
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,333
NOW, WHAT DO I DO?

308
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,958
TO BE CONTINUED.

309
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,458
- ( closing theme playing )

310
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,375
