1
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,833
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,375
♪ I JUST FLY AWAY ♪

4
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,375
♪ I JUST FLY AWAY! ♪

5
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:47,458
- SO NORB IS STILL ALIVE.

6
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,458
WITH THE EMERGENCE
OF ANTIBODY CORALIANS,

7
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,458
IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE LAND
IS TRULY ABOUT TO AWAKEN.

8
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,500
I'M SURE THEY ARE FRETTING
NOW AS WELL.

9
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,166
- DEWEY'S ACTS ARE THE ROOT
OF ALL THE EVIL WE'RE SEEING.

10
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,166
- IT SEEMS WE'VE GIVEN HIM
TOO MUCH LEEWAY.

11
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,250
I THINK THE TIME HAS COME
FOR US TO PULL HIM BACK.

12
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,583
- MY, OH, MY.

13
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:32,166
SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME
ONE OF THE SAGES?

14
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,833
- THEY'VE BEEN RATHER SLOW
ABOUT GETTING ANYTHING DONE.

15
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,500
UNSHACKLE HIM.
- YES, SIR.

16
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,375
- THEY SAY, "WITH AGE, YOU MUST
FOLLOW YOUR CHILDREN,"

17
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:48,375
BUT WE HAVE A PRETTY
INSOLENT CHILD HERE.

18
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,375
- IT IS DESTINED FOR THOSE WHOSE
TIME HAS PASSED TO STEP DOWN.

19
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,500
NORB.

20
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,416
- IT'S CONFIRMED.
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

21
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,958
NORB HAS BEEN CAPTURED
IN THE CAPITOL.

22
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,958
- HE'S GOT SOME NERVE PLUNGING
HIMSELF IN THERE BY HIMSELF.

23
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,958
- IF WE DON'T HURRY,
HE'S GONNA DIE.

24
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,291
- AND THE CITY
WILL BE DESTROYED.

25
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,958
- MAYBE EVEN THE WHOLE PLANET.

26
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,958
- WHAT?  THE PLANET, BUT WHY?

27
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,291
- NORB IS THE LEGENDARY
SUPER-STRENGTH MONK.

28
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,000
- THIS IS SOUNDING LIKE ANOTHER
CANDID CAMERA STUNT.

29
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:29,000
- WELL, IT'S NOT.  THIS TIME,
WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS.

30
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,000
- WE ARE, HUH?  WHAT KIND
OF OLD MAN IS HE?

31
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,000
- YOU'LL SEE WHEN YOU MEET HIM.

32
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,000
- IN ANY CASE,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HURRY.

33
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,000
IT WOULD TAKE A FEW DAYS
IF WE STAYED ON THE LEY LINE.

34
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:43,000
THAT'S WHY WE'RE MAKING
A TRAJECTORY FLIGHT.

35
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:46,000
- ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE GET READY.

36
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,625
- ROGER THAT.

37
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,000
- I'M GONNA GO CLEAN UP ALL
THE MERCHANDISE IN THE SHOP.

38
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,666
- NO, YOU LEAVE THAT JOB
TO MOONDOGGIE.

39
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,791
I HAVE SOMETHING THAT I WANT
TO TALK TO TWO ABOUT.

40
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,833
- SURE.

41
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,791
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, BROTHER.

42
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,500
- ( children laughing )

43
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,041
- DON'T TOUCH.

44
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,041
- HEY, WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?
- SHOULD WE DRINK IT?

45
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,541
- YEAH, LET'S DRINK IT.

46
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,291
- YOU BETTER NOT DRINK IT
WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT.

47
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,916
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL
AT THEM.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,041
- YOU'VE BEEN REALLY STRANGE.
- STRANGE, STRANGE, STRANGE.

49
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,041
- SHUT UP.  YOU SHOULD
BE ON THE BRIDGE.

50
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,666
STUFF LIKE THIS IS ABOUT
ALL I CAN DO.

51
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,666
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

52
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,666
LOOK, IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY IT.

53
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,666
BESIDES, IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO DO,

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,708
YOU CAN GO FIND SOMETHING.
- YOU CAN!

55
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,875
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

56
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:52,375
- I WOULDN'T, HUH?
DOGGIE, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

57
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,083
- YOU IDIOT!

58
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,875
- SO WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

59
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:04,250
- I UNDERSTAND
YOUR DETERMINATION, RENTON.

60
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,875
HOWEVER, IT'S NOT AN EASY THING
TO GET BEYOND THE GREAT WALL.

61
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,958
IN REALITY, WE NEED
TO MEET NORB TO DO IT.

62
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,958
- RIGHT.

63
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,958
- I TALKED TO HIM
BACK IN <i>CUIDADES DEL CIELO.</i>

64
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,958
- <i>DEL CIELO.</i>

65
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,000
- NO, WAIT.  I WANT
TO TELL RENTON ABOUT THIS.

66
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,000
- NO, THIS IS MY JOB.

67
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,375
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO HEAR THIS,

68
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,000
YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW YOU SHOULD
BE ACTING FROM NOW ON.

69
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,583
THE STORY OF HOW
I FIRST MET EUREKA.

70
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,750
I FIRST MET HER BACK WHEN I WAS
STILL A MEMBER OF THE SOF.

71
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,416
A MYSTERIOUS GIRL WHO COULD
CONTROL THE OLDEST LFO

72
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,291
IN THE WORLD.

73
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,791
THAT WAS ALL I CONSIDERED HER.

74
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:33,000
BUT BACK THEN THAT WAS ENOUGH.

75
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,041
EVEN IF SHROUDED IN MYSTERY,

76
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,333
EUREKA'S HIGH FIGHTING POTENTIAL
WAS EXTREMELY VALUABLE

77
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,833
TO THE SOF.

78
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,583
BESIDES, EUREKA WAS
A VERY OBEDIENT GIRL,

79
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,583
NEVER SHOWING
ANY EMOTIONS.

80
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,375
AND THEN THAT DAY CAME.

81
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,583
THE MISSION THAT WE
WERE GIVEN THAT DAY

82
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,208
WAS TO COMPLETELY ANNIHILATE
THE VODARAC RESISTANCE

83
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,041
THAT HAD BEEN GROWING
IN <i>CUIDADES DEL CIELO.</i>

84
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,500
- OH!

85
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,791
- EUREKA,
WHAT'S THE STATUS THERE?

86
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,791
- THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.

87
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,458
- ALL RIGHT,
SHIFT OVER TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

88
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,791
WE'LL SPREAD OUT THE ATTACK.
YOU SHOULD GO BEHIND THE TEMPLE.

89
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,500
- ROGER THAT.

90
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:58,041
- THE SOF HAD ONE MORE
OBJECTIVE FOR US TO ACCOMPLISH.

91
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,458
THAT WAS THE CAPTURE OF NORB,

92
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,916
THE HIGH PRIEST OF THE VODARAC.

93
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,791
- DAMN YOU.
WHAT DID YOU DO?

94
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,083
- ( coughs )

95
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,083
- IT'LL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CAPTURE
ME USING SUCH MEAGER POWER.

96
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,083
- WHY DIDN'T YOU ESCAPE IF YOU
KNEW THAT WE WERE COMING?

97
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,291
NORB!
- HMM.

98
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,125
WHY DO YOU COME
AND DESTROY THIS CITY?

99
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,125
- BECAUSE IT'S A NESTING
GROUND FOR TERRORISTS.

100
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,750
- THERE'S NO WAY THAT EVERY
BELIEVER IS A TERRORIST.

101
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,791
TERRORISM OCCURS BECAUSE
YOUR MILITARY

102
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,666
WON'T EVEN ATTEMPT
A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.

103
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,250
- THAT'S JUST SELFISH REASONING.

104
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,541
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO MAKE
PEACE WITH FANATICAL WORSHIPPERS

105
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,166
OF CORALIANS,
OF MONSTERS WHO EAT HUMANS?

106
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,750
- CORALIANS ARE NOT MONSTERS.

107
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,416
THEY ARE THE DREAMS
THAT THIS LAND WATCHES.

108
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,416
- THIS IS GETTING US NOWHERE.

109
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,250
- THERE WAS A GIRL NAMED SAKUYA.

110
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,416
A GIRL THAT I MET
AT A VERY YOUNG AGE.

111
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,208
SHE WAS MY FIRST LOVE.
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT?

112
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,000
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LISTEN
TO OLD STORIES.

113
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,666
- SAKUYA WAS NOT A HUMAN BEING.
- SHE WHAT?

114
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,000
- NOT A HUMAN,
BUT A CORALIAN.

115
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,000
JUST LIKE THE GIRL
YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU.  EUREKA.

116
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,000
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT EUREKA?

117
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,750
- SAKUYA ONCE TOLD ME THE LAND

118
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,166
HAD BROUGHT FORTH
YET ANOTHER CHILD.

119
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,000
ANOTHER HUMANOID CORALIAN.
- IMPOSSIBLE.

120
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,500
DON'T BE SO DEPRESSED.  I KNOW
IT'S VERY SHOCKING TO YOU.

121
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:05,000
SHE'S A VERY CUTE GIRL,
BUT SHE'S NOT HUMAN.

122
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,000
BUT BECAUSE SHE'S CUTE, DOES IT
MATTER IF SHE'S NOT A HUMAN?

123
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,000
I MEAN, SAKUYA IS PRETTIER
THAN THE FLOWERS.

124
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:14,208
- DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "HUMANOID?"

125
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,416
- ( gasps )
- ( whimpering )

126
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:37,041
- Norb: SHE WAS BORN FROM
THE SHEER WILL OF THE LAND

127
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,333
TO LEARN ABOUT HUMANS.

128
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,875
THAT IS WHY SHE SEEKS
INTERACTION WITH HUMANS.

129
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,083
- ( wailing )

130
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,708
- LITTLE BY LITTLE,
SHE WILL UNDERSTAND HUMANS

131
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,083
AND AWAKEN TO HER SENSE OF SELF.

132
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

133
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,083
- SHE IS THE SAME
AS A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER.

134
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:03,083
EMPTY AND PREPARED TO RECORD
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

135
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,875
WHAT GETS WRITTEN DOWN DEPENDS
ON HOW PEOPLE INTERACT WITH HER.

136
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,208
BIT BY BIT, THAT IS HOW
SHE CHANGES INTO A HUMAN.

137
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:15,083
HOWEVER, NEITHER YOU
NOR DEWEY CAN CHANGE HER.

138
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,083
ALL THE TWO OF YOU WILL DO IS
USE HER FOR DESTRUCTION

139
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,083
AND ULTIMATELY LEAD THIS
WORLD AND HER TO RUIN.

140
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,083
- WE'RE DOING ALL THIS
SO WE CAN SAVE THE WORLD.

141
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,750
- HIS OBJECTIVE IS TO BRING
ABOUT A SECOND SUMMER OF LOVE.

142
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,750
HE'S ATTEMPTING TO USE EUREKA

143
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,750
TO LEAD THIS LAND
TO A BREAKDOWN.

144
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,750
HE'S NOT EVEN
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

145
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:36,750
THE SOUL OF THIS LAND.
- THE SOUL OF THIS LAND, HUH?

146
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,875
DID YOU THINK I'D BELIEVE YOU?

147
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,000
- HMM.  VERY WELL.

148
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,666
YOU SHOULD WATCH CLOSELY.

149
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,791
THE LAND REPLIED
TO THE WILL OF THE HUMAN.

150
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,791
- IT'S COINCIDENCE.
- I HEAR THAT LIFTERS

151
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,791
CAN READ THE FLOW OF TRAPARS
INVISIBLE TO THE EYE.

152
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,250
CAN YOU DO THAT?

153
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,750
TRAPARS ARE THE BREATHS
OF THIS LAND.

154
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,458
YOU CAN FEEL IT,

155
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,333
SO WHY CAN'T YOU TAP
INTO THE SOUL OF THIS WORLD?

156
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,500
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

157
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,750
- IF YOU WILL OPEN YOUR EYES,
THEN ALL WILL BE WELL.

158
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,750
IF YOU ARE TO AWAKEN, THEN THIS
IS THE TIME TO SAVE THEM.

159
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,833
BOTH HER AND THIS PLANET.

160
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,333
- HUH?
- ( rumbling )

161
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,500
- ( grunting )
- OH!

162
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,458
( sighs )

163
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,416
- ( wailing )

164
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,041
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

165
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,208
WHAT IS THIS?
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

166
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,416
LOOK THERE.

167
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,166
JUST LIKE HUMANS,
THAT IS HOW SHE LIVES NOW.

168
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,875
BESIDES, WE STILL MIGHT
HAVE SOME HOPE.

169
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,875
IF HER PARTNER COMES,
SHE WILL BE SAVED.

170
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,625
- WHAT?  A PARTNER?

171
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,416
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
EUREKA SMILE?

172
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,916
- NO.

173
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,750
- HER SMILE IS THE SIGN
OF CHANGE.

174
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,750
SEARCH FOR SOMEONE THAT
CAN MAKE HER SMILE

175
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,125
FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART.

176
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,875
IF HER PARTNER EMERGES,

177
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,916
THEN HUMANS AND SCUB CORALS
CAN COME TOGETHER

178
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,875
AND THE PATH TO THE GREAT WALL
WILL OPEN.

179
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,791
- WHAT IS THE GREAT WALL?

180
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,916
- THE PATH LEADING TO HOPE.

181
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,916
THE PATH THAT WILL
SAVE THIS WORLD.

182
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,541
THIS IS NOT A TEACHING
OF THE VODARAC.

183
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,791
AS THE VANQUISHED,
THEY ARE MY OWN WORDS.

184
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,791
- Man: MASTER NORB!

185
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,791
- I WAS CONFUSED.

186
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,208
BECAUSE I HADN'T BEEN TOLD
ANYTHING.

187
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,250
I FOUND OUT LATER THAT DAY

188
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,750
THAT EVERYTHING HAD CRUMBLED
DOWN ALONG WITH THE CITY.

189
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,958
- ( grunts )

190
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,000
- BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING
THAT EMERGED OUT OF ALL THAT.

191
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,208
I WAS ABLE TO LEARN
ABOUT THIS WORLD,

192
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,916
AND THE TRUTH THAT THE MILITARY
WAS TRYING TO BURY.

193
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,208
AND HOW WE'VE BEEN ACTING
SINCE THAT INCIDENT,

194
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,208
YOU CAN READ "RAY-OUT" FOR THAT.

195
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,208
- MASTER NORB,
HE'S AN AMAZING PERSON.

196
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,208
- HE'S A PREPOSTEROUS OLD MAN.

197
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,250
HE ENTRUSTED ME
WITH THE ENTIRE WORLD.

198
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,250
- THE WORLD?
- I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU.

199
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,583
THE PERSON WHO IS EUREKA'S
PARTNER ISN'T ME.

200
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,166
IT'S YOU, RENTON.

201
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,166
- ( both gasp )

202
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,166
- ( alarm blaring )

203
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,250
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU
DID TO BECOME THE PARTNER,

204
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,000
BUT I KNOW NO MATTER WHAT YOU
NEED TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

205
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,666
REMEMBER THAT THOUGH
YOU CHOSE HER FIRST,

206
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,708
SHE CHOSE YOU IN THE END.

207
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,041
- ( laughing )
- IT'S DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE.

208
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:55,041
I'M STARTING TO KNOW MORE
AND MORE ABOUT EUREKA.

209
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,458
BUT...

210
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,750
- ( gasping )

211
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,916
- Renton:
THE GREAT WALL.

212
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,375
- I WANT TO PROTECT EUREKA.

213
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,875
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING A PARTNER

214
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,416
OR ABOUT THE WORLD
IN GENERAL.

215
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,416
I JUST WANT TO BE
BY EUREKA'S SIDE.

216
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,083
THAT FEELING HASN'T CHANGED
ONE BIT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

217
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,875
- SPEAK NOW.
TELL ME WHERE NORB IS.

218
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,541
- NORB.  HE LEFT THE ROOM WITH
COLONEL DEWEY A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

219
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,416
- HE WHAT?
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

220
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,458
- WHERE HAVE THEY GONE?
- WELL, UH, UM...

221
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,500
- Woz:
WE'RE ALMOST TO THE CAPITOL.

222
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,416
OPERATIONAL ORDERS
ARE IN PLACE.

223
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,333
WE'LL RENDEZVOUS
WITH OUR INFORMER AFTER

224
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,250
WE INFILTRATE THE PERIMETER.

225
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,750
- HOW ARE WE GOING TO SNEAK
INTO THE CAPITOL?

226
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,458
- WE'LL GO RIGHT IN
THROUGH THE FRONT GATE.

227
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,458
IF WE DON'T HURRY, THE CITY
WILL VANISH ALONG WITH NORB.

228
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,458
- AND WE'RE GONNA INVITE
SUCH A DANGEROUS OLD MAN

229
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,000
ONBOARD THE GEKKO?

230
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,500
- NOW WE HAVE ONE PROBLEM
WITH THIS.

231
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,125
TALHO IS THE ONLY ONE
THAT KNOWS

232
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,458
WHAT THE INFORMANT
LOOKS LIKE.

233
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,750
- IT'S SIMPLE THEN.
I'LL HEAD OUT.

234
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,750
- BUT WHO'S GONNA TAKE CONTROL
OF THE GEKKO WHILE YOU'RE GONE?

235
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,500
- I WILL.
- YOU, DOGGIE?

236
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,500
- I WANNA DO IT.

237
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,208
I HAVE
A SHIP OPERATION LICENSE.

238
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,291
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

239
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,125
- COME TO THINK OF IT,
I REMEMBER HEARING THAT.

240
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:52,125
- I NEVER HAD ANYTHING
IMPORTANT TO DO UNTIL NOW.

241
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,625
THAT'S WHY NO MATTER WHAT,

242
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,166
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
THAT WILL HELP EVERYONE OUT.

243
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,333
- THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN
BOTHERING YOU?

244
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,166
- DOGGIE GREW UP ON SHIPS.
MAYBE IT'LL BE OKAY.

245
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,166
- IMPOSSIBLE.
LOOK AT OUR SITUATION.

246
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,083
- HOW ABOUT WE LET HIM TRY?
PART OF OUR DETERMINATION

247
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,166
COMES FROM BELIEVING
IN OUR COMRADES.

248
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,375
I'M CONFIDENT THAT HE HAS THE
DETERMINATION TO PULL IT OFF.

249
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,000
- I DON'T KNOW.
- I SUPPORT HIM, TOO.

250
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,125
SO, PLEASE!

251
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,208
- ( sighs )

252
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,708
- STOP THE ORANGE.

253
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:32,375
THE SCUB CORAL
IS NOT CALLING FOR YOU.

254
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,750
IF YOU CONTINUE THIS RESISTANCE,
THE WORLD WILL DIE.

255
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,750
- YOU'VE MISSED
YOUR OPPORTUNITY.

256
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,208
WHAT CAN YOU LECTURE ME
ABOUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME?

257
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,208
IF THEY DO NOT CALL ME,
ALL I NEED TO DO IS

258
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,833
TO DESTROY THE WILL
OF THE SCUBS.

259
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,750
IF YOU HAD GIVEN ME
AN OPPORTUNITY

260
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,875
TO CONTACT THE SCUB CORALS
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

261
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,708
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO RESORT
TO SUCH DRASTIC MEASURES.

262
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,750
- I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF HELPING YOU.

263
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,750
NO, EVEN IF I WERE
TO ASSIST YOU,

264
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,958
YOU STILL WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
COMMUNICATE WITH THE CORALS.

265
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,250
- THERE IS NO NEED
TO COMMUNICATE.

266
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,625
- SO HOTHEADED.  YOU WANT
TO DESTROY THE SCUB CORALS

267
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,250
WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT
THEIR TRUE MEANING IS.

268
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,708
THE ENTIRE PLANET, INCLUDING
YOURSELF, MAY ALL BE GONE.

269
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,750
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN WHAT
HAPPENED AT <i>DEL CIELO?</i>

270
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,791
HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU NEED
TO FAIL?

271
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,791
- YOU WERE THE ONE THAT FAILED.

272
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,791
YOU ATTEMPTED TO BECOME THE
PARTNER OF A HUMANOID CORALIAN.

273
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,291
IN THE END,

274
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,583
ALL YOU DID WAS DESTROY
THE ONE YOU LOVED.

275
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,416
- PERHAPS,
BUT I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP HOPE

276
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,250
OF COMMUNICATING WITH THEM.

277
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,750
- COLONEL DEWEY, LIEUTENANT
DOMINIC HAS CALLED IN

278
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,250
AND IS SAYING HE HAS AN URGENT
REPORT THAT ME MUST GIVE YOU.

279
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,250
- I'M ENTERTAINING A GUEST
RIGHT NOW.  MAKE IT LATER.

280
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,750
- YES, SIR.

281
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:46,750
- AND NOW I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT I SHOWED YOU THE WORLD.

282
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,291
- YOU SCARED?

283
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,291
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, TALHO?

284
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,000
WHY DID YOU CUT YOUR HAIR?
- DON'T YOU LIKE IT?

285
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,958
- NO, IT DOESN'T SUIT YOU.

286
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,000
- YOU SAID THAT BACK
WHEN YOU BROKE UP WITH HER.

287
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,500
I'M OVER IT NOW.
ALL OF IT.

288
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:24,875
- ( grumbles )

289
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,291
- NO MORE INDECISION.
I'M FIGHTING.

290
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,791
- SO STRONG.

291
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,291
- WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MADE ME THAT WAY.

292
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,625
AND GAVE ME A FUTURE.

293
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,791
UNDERSTAND?

294
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,166
THERE'S ANOTHER LIFE HERE.
- ( gasps )

295
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,250
BUT HOW?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

296
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,875
I CAN'T TAKE YOU WITH ME NOW.

297
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,000
IF SOMETHING WERE
TO HAPPEN TO YOU

298
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,708
THEN WHERE SHOULD I GO?

299
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,166
WHERE IS THERE A SAFE HAVEN
IN THIS WORLD?

300
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,500
WELL, THERE AREN'T ANY.
I WANNA FIGHT TO PROTECT

301
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,708
WITH MY LIFE THIS CHILD

302
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,666
AND ALL THE OTHERS.

303
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,666
MAETER, MAURICE, LINCK,

304
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,500
RENTON AND EUREKA.

305
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,958
- BOY, YOU SURE HAVE
A LOT OF KIDS.

306
