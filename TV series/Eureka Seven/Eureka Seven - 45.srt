1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,750
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,041
- I THINK BY NOW EVERYONE'S
READ THE HEADLINE ARTICLE

3
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,791
IN THE NEWEST ISSUE
OF "ray=out."

4
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:13,583
53 LIFTING SPOTS HAVE BEEN
CONFISCATED BY THE ARMY.

5
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,041
NOT ONLY DO THEY
TAKE THE SPOTS,

6
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,250
THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY
THE WAVES TOO,

7
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,916
AS WELL AS THE VERY LAND
THAT FUELS IT ALL.

8
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,958
- ( sighs )

9
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,291
- ACCORDING TO THE INTERVIEW

10
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,291
BETWEEN THE VODARAC
HIGH PRIEST NORB

11
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,416
AND DR. BEAR,
THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO BECOME

12
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,041
CAUGHT UP IN SOMETHING
EXTRAORDINARY.

13
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,958
- WELL, BUSINESS SEEMS
TO BE FLOURISHING.

14
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,250
SHOULD I BE JEALOUS?

15
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,250
- NO, IT'S NOT
GETTING ANY BETTER.

16
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,625
- WELL, DON'T PUSH
YOURSELF TOO FAR.

17
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,625
- THANKS FOR YOUR HARD WORK.

18
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,625
- HEY, IS ALL OF IT TRUE?

19
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,625
THAT STUFF MENTIONED
ON THE SHORT WAVE?

20
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,708
- HERE YOU GO.

21
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,458
IT'S THE LAST ONE
I COULD GET.

22
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,708
HAD TO SNEAK IT IN
BEHIND THE ARMY'S BACK.

23
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,291
NOW GO READ UP,

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,125
AND SHARE IT WITH
ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

25
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,125
- MM-HMM.

26
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,791
- THIS IS NO TIME
TO JUST SIT AND WATCH.

27
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,791
PERHAPS WE COULD
FIND SOMETHING,

28
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,125
SOMETHING TO DO
ABOUT THIS SITUATION.

29
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,500
- ( sighs )

30
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,500
( groans )

31
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,166
- ( knocks on door )

32
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,791
- ( door opens )
- HUH?

33
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,583
- IT'S A BIT ROUGH.

34
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,541
- ( door closes )

35
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,500
I'LL LEND YOU
A HIGH SPEED POD.

36
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,458
HOWEVER, WAIT TILL
WE CLEAR THE CLOUDS

37
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,625
BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF.

38
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,833
SO WHAT'S THE MATTER?
AREN'T YOU GOING TO USE IT?

39
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,125
- WRITHING ABOUT ON MY OWN

40
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,166
WON'T GET ANYTHING
ACCOMPLISHED NOW.

41
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,500
IN ORDER TO SAVE
THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLANET,

42
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,166
I NEED TO FIRST
STARE AT THE TRUTH.

43
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,833
- THOSE ARE THE WISEST WORDS
YOU'VE EVER SPOKEN.

44
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,500
- HUH?

45
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,500
- YOU KNOW,
IT'S TRUE THAT IN PRINT

46
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,083
YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT ANYTHING.

47
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,875
AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL
IF IT'S REAL OR FAKE, RIGHT?

48
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,916
WE HAVE TO CONFIRM IT.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,208
- WHAT?

50
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,208
- WE CAN GET AROUND TO
CRUSHING GEKKOSTATE

51
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,541
AFTER EVERYTHING IS DONE.

52
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,166
- Holland: YOU WANT TO HAVE
A CHAT WITH DR. BEAR?

53
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,541
- MYSELF AND LIEUTENANT DOMINIC

54
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,875
WILL BE THE ONLY ONES WHO
WILL COME ONBOARD THE GEKKO.

55
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,208
AS LONG AS WE ARE
ON YOUR SHIP,

56
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,083
OUR K.L.F. SQUADRONS
WILL NOT MOVE TO ATTACK.

57
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,083
- LISTEN TO HIM, HOLLAND.
HE'S AN HONORABLE MAN.

58
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,000
- WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU KNOW THE GUY?

59
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,875
- I COULD TELL
THAT MUCH ABOUT HIM

60
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,583
AFTER A SINGLE BATTLE.

61
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,750
- HMM.

62
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,125
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
- HMM.

63
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,916
- Jurgens: YOU'RE IN COMMAND
WHILE I'M GONE.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,583
- IT'S DANGEROUS, CAPTAIN.

65
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,250
I DON'T AGREE WITH THIS.

66
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,916
- YOU'RE FREE TO ORDER
THE SQUADRONS TO ATTACK

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,250
IF YOU HEAR NOTHING
FROM US FOR AN HOUR.

68
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,458
LIEUTENANT DOMINIC!
- BUT CAPTAIN!

69
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,833
- SO, WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT FROM DR. BEAR?

70
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,958
- IS WHAT'S IN HERE THE TRUTH?

71
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,958
- WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

72
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,166
- HMM.

73
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,500
WE ALL SAW THE BIG SPEECH

74
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,625
DEWEY MADE
IN BELL FOREST.

75
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,958
WHAT'S IN "ray=out"
IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT.

76
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,291
SO HOW MUCH DID IT COST?

77
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,708
- I REALLY DON'T...

78
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,625
- WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME
TO DEAL WITH IDLE CHITCHAT.

79
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,666
NOW WHERE IS DR. BEAR?

80
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,958
- ( yawns )

81
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,625
I'VE GOTTEN TIRED OF
EXPLAINING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

82
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,833
HMM.

83
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,000
- ( panting )

84
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,625
- Renton: EUREKA!

85
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,666
- GO AWAY!
LEAVE ME ALONE.

86
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,791
( grunts )

87
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,041
- Linck: MAMA.
- ( gasps )

88
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,541
- OH, MAMA.

89
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,000
- ( crying )

90
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,000
( grunts )

91
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,791
- MAMA!

92
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,916
( gasps )

93
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,791
- EUREKA.

94
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,041
- I TOLD YOU TO
LEAVE ME ALONE.

95
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,416
( grunts )

96
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,375
- EUREKA, PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR ARM.

97
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,041
- DON'T LOOK AT IT.

98
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,375
PLEASE.

99
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,375
DON'T LOOK AT IT.

100
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,708
- ( sighs )

101
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,041
- ( crying )

102
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,375
I THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD
FINALLY BE TOGETHER.

103
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,375
I THOUGHT THAT WE
WOULD BE TOGETHER.

104
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,583
THIS IS SO CRUEL.

105
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,750
( crying )
OH, WHY.

106
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,083
NO.

107
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,458
( crying )

108
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,416
( gasps )

109
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,083
- WAIT.
LET'S COOL IT DOWN.

110
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,416
STOP THE SWELLING.

111
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,291
- Eureka:
THAT WON'T HELP.

112
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,750
- Renton:
LET'S TRY IT OUT.

113
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,416
- Eureka:
THIS ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

114
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,375
I'M NOT LIKE ALL OF YOU GUYS.

115
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,958
I'M NOT A HUMAN BEING.

116
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,416
I'M A DIFFERENT
KIND OF CREATURE.

117
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,416
- DAMN IT.

118
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,958
DAMN IT!

119
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,083
- I'M SO SORRY.

120
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,125
- I JUST DIDN'T
REALIZE ANY OF THIS.

121
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,958
I COULDN'T SEE
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

122
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,791
EUREKA,
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

123
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,125
( grunts )

124
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,041
- STOP THAT, RENTON.

125
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,791
- NOW WE'RE THE SAME.

126
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,666
IF MY LEFT ARM
COMPLETELY SWELLS UP

127
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,458
THEN WE'LL BOTH
BE THE SAME.

128
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,625
YOU SEE?
WE'LL HAVE MATCHING ARMS.

129
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,458
IT'S THE SAME.
- ( gasps )

130
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,125
- THEY'RE THE SAME NOW.

131
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,125
WE'LL ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.

132
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,458
I MEAN,
WE MADE A PROMISE, RIGHT?

133
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,791
THAT WE'D ALWAYS
BE TOGETHER.

134
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,125
THAT I WOULD PROTECT YOU.

135
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,125
SO PLEASE SMILE FOR ME.

136
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,125
EUREKA.

137
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,083
IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO SMILE.

138
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,083
- IDIOT.

139
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,833
- ( gun cocks )

140
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,708
- Maurice: GET AWAY.
- ( both gasp )

141
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,875
- I'M TELLING YOU,
GET AWAY FROM MY MAMA, RENTON!

142
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,875
- GET AWAY FROM HER,
RENTON.

143
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,208
- NO, MAURICE.
DON'T DO IT.

144
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,833
- Maurice: WHY NOT?
- ( gasps )

145
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,500
- Maurice: WHY ARE YOU
SO INTO RENTON, MAMA?

146
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,750
IT'S UNFAIR.

147
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,208
YOU DIDN'T FORGET,
DID YOU?

148
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,541
THAT YOU, MAMA,

149
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,708
SHOT AND KILLED
OUR REAL MAMA.

150
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,791
- ( gasps )

151
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,541
- YOU TOOK HER
AWAY FROM US.

152
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,875
NOW YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
LEFT FOR US, MAMA.

153
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,833
AND YOU WANT TO RUN AWAY
ALL BY YOURSELF.

154
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,875
IT'S NOT FAIR, MAMA.

155
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,750
DON'T JUST GO OFF
ON YOUR OWN

156
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,625
AND LOVE SOMEONE
OTHER THAN ME.

157
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,375
NO ONE BUT ME.

158
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,250
LOOK AT MORE OF ME.

159
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,625
( sniffles )

160
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,583
I CAN READ ALL THAT
OUTLINE OF THE EARTH STUFF TOO.

161
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,916
I CAN GO AND GATHER UP
A LOT OF FRUIT.

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,875
I'M MUCH MORE USEFUL
THAN THAT STINKY RENTON.

163
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,750
- PUT IT DOWN,
MAURICE.

164
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,250
- Maurice:
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!

165
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,583
MAMA'S BODY TURNED OUT LIKE THIS
BECAUSE YOU SHOWED UP.

166
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,000
YOU'RE WHY SHE
CHANGED SO MUCH, AREN'T YOU?

167
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,916
- ( crying )

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,250
- ( gun cocks )

169
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,916
- TURN IT ALL BACK.

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,208
TURN IT ALL BACK
TO THE WAY IT WAS.

171
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,583
- EUREKA, DON'T.

172
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,958
( gasps )

173
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,125
- ( gasps )

174
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:49,625
- YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR MAMA
'CAUSE SHE LOOKS LIKE THIS?

175
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,291
IT'S MAMA'S SMILE.

176
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,625
DO YOU HATE IT
THAT I SMILED

177
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,875
AFTER I TOOK THE LIFE
OF YOUR REAL MAMA?

178
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,458
I WOULD UNDERSTAND
IF YOU DID.

179
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,958
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU
DECIDED TO HATE ME FOREVER,

180
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,083
MAMA LOVES YOU, MAURICE.

181
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,291
THAT'S WHY I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO THROUGH

182
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,125
WHAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH,

183
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,625
FEELING REGRET
EVERY MINUTE OF MY LIFE.

184
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,958
- ( crying )

185
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,333
MAMA.

186
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,666
- THANK YOU.

187
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,000
- ( sobbing )

188
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,583
- ( crying )

189
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,458
( all sobbing )

190
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,041
- I'VE BEEN WATCHING
YOU GUYS ALL ALONG.

191
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,708
LINCK, YOU'VE GROWN TALLER.

192
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:14,375
MAETER, YOU'VE BECOME
THE BIG SISTER FOR THEM NOW.

193
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,041
MAURICE,

194
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,375
I WATCHED YOU THE MOST.

195
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,958
MAMA ALWAYS HAD
HER EYES ON YOU.

196
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,375
- WHEN YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP,
MAURICE,

197
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,041
I'M SURE THAT
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS ONE

198
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,375
WILL BE THE STUFF
OF THE DISTANT PAST.

199
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,375
BUT UNTIL THEN,

200
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,416
I'LL ALWAYS
DO MY BEST FOR YOU.

201
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,750
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU.

202
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,416
AS MUCH AS YOUR MAMA DOES.

203
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,250
AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
WITH A SMILE.

204
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,791
AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY

205
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,166
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
USING A GUN LIKE THIS.

206
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,750
THAT RIGHT, MR. CHARLES?

207
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,750
- AND SO THAT'S
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

208
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,791
- AND THE TWO FEATURED
ON THE COVER?

209
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,916
- THEY TOOK THE NIRVASH AND WENT
TO THE GENUINE PROMISED LAND

210
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,333
IN ORDER TO ARBITRATE
WITH THE SCUB CORALS.

211
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,791
- ( alarm beeping )

212
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,208
- Man: VICE-CAPTAIN.

213
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,458
IT'S FROM THE GEKKO.

214
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,791
- CAPTAIN?

215
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,666
- Jurgens: I WANT YOU TO
BROADCAST THE RECORDING

216
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,958
I'M ABOUT TO SEND YOU TO
ALL THE SHIPS IN OUR FLEET

217
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,583
AND ALL THE K.L.F'S AS WELL.

218
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,291
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,

219
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,958
IF THE SCUB CORALS ARE ALIVE,
THEN WHAT IS OPERATION ORANGE,

220
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,625
THE PROGRAM THAT
THE ARMY IS WORKING ON,

221
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,125
SUPPOSED TO DO TO THEM?

222
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,750
- MAKE THEM CREATE
ANTIBODY CORALIANS.

223
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,500
- THAT'S BECAUSE
THE LAND IS DREAMING.

224
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,333
- I KNEW IT!

225
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,083
MY WORKING HYPOTHESIS
WAS CORRECT AFTER ALL.

226
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,250
I'VE BEEN SAYING
FOR SEVERAL YEARS

227
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,166
THE SCUB CORALS WERE IN
A STATE OF DEEP HIBERNATION.

228
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,875
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVEN'T REACHED
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS YET.

229
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,916
- IF THE LAND REAWAKENS,
THE SKY WILL TEAR.

230
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,250
- WHY WOULD THE ARMY
GO THROUGH ALL THIS

231
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,833
TROUBLE AND EXPENSE
TO AWAKEN THE SCUB CORALS

232
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,833
IF THE MATERIAL WORLD
IS GOING TO END?

233
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,208
- THE ARMY IS PLANNING
ON ANNIHILATING ALL OF

234
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,916
THE SCUB CORALS
BEFORE THAT CAN HAPPEN.

235
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,166
- NOT THE ARMY.

236
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,166
A YOUNG MAN NAMED
DEWEY NOVAK.

237
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,625
- ( gasps )

238
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,166
- THERE ARE TWO PATHS.

239
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,500
THE FIRST, TO STAND UP
AND PROTECT THIS PLANET.

240
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,125
THE OTHER, TO TACITLY
ACCEPT IT ALL.

241
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,791
- NO, SIR.

242
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,875
THERE IS ONLY ONE.

243
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,583
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

244
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,041
WE OF THE MILITARY
ONLY EXIST

245
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,875
TO PROTECT THE WORLD
AND ALL THE PEOPLE ON IT.

246
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,208
HOWEVER,
I'VE JUST DISCOVERED

247
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,500
THAT IMMENSE POWER
HAS BEEN USURPED

248
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,833
BY A SELECT FEW

249
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,875
WHO ARE TRYING TO
ANNIHILATE THIS UNIVERSE

250
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,083
BY USING A CLEVER
AND DIABOLICAL TRAP.

251
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,375
THE IZUMO WILL NOW
WITHDRAW FROM

252
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,375
UNITED FEDERATION
FORCE JURISDICTION

253
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,416
AND DECLARES A TEMPORARY
CEASEFIRE WITH GEKKOSTATE.

254
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,875
- ( gasping )

255
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,708
- WE WILL JOIN FORCES
IN A REBELLION

256
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,083
AGAINST OUR MUTUAL ENEMY,

257
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,708
A FACTION WITHIN
THE MILITARY.

258
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,833
- DAMN IT, JURGENS.
ARE YOU INSANE?

259
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,958
- NO, I'M NOT!

260
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,666
DEWEY WANTS TO EXTERMINATE

261
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,583
ALL SCUB CORALS
IN ONE SWEEP

262
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,583
BEFORE THE LIMIT
OF QUESTIONS IS REACHED,

263
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,250
EVEN IF IT MEANS
SACRIFICING ALL OF MANKIND.

264
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,083
IN ORDER TO PROTECT
THIS PLANET,

265
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,416
AND ALL THE PEOPLE ON IT,

266
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,916
I WANT TO FIGHT THIS EVIL
ALONGSIDE GEKKOSTATE.

267
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,458
- ( explosion )
- HUH?

268
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,250
- WHO FIRED THAT SHOT?

269
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,041
CEASE ALL ATTACKS.

270
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,166
STOP IT.  STOP IT!

271
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,916
- Soldier: WHAT KIND OF
COWARDLY CRAP IS THAT?

272
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,750
FIGHT ALONGSIDE THE GEKKO?

273
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,583
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
OF US THEY'VE KILLED?

274
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,916
- I KNOW HOW MANY.

275
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,166
LET'S JUST LISTEN TO
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

276
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,250
- ( sighs )

277
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,625
SO MANY INNOCENT LIVES
HAVE BEEN THROWN AWAY.

278
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,166
AMONG OUR RANKS,

279
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,625
THERE MUST BE MANY WHO HAVE
LOST FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

280
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,625
THINK ABOUT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

281
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,958
WHY DID THEY HAVE TO
SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES

282
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,958
FOR SOME MAD
PURSUIT OF POWER?

283
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,291
YOU MUST SEE

284
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,958
WHAT WE THE LIVING,
STANDING HERE TODAY

285
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,125
NEED TO RISE UP
AND STAND AGAINST.

286
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,291
- TO PROTECT THE PLANET
AND THE FUTURE OF ALL MANKIND.

287
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,875
- HEY.
- UHH?

288
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,583
- I REALLY GET DISGUSTED WITH
ALL THAT GOODIE TWO-SHOES TALK.

289
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,958
- ( gasps )

290
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,958
ALL RIGHT THEN.

291
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,583
THERE'S SOMEONE I LOVE.

292
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,083
- All: HUH?

293
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,750
- NO, MORE LIKE INFATUATED.

294
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,666
AND SHE DOESN'T
CARE FOR ME ONE BIT.

295
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,041
BUT THEN...

296
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,291
NONE OF THAT REALLY MATTERS.

297
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,750
I DON'T WANT HER TO
BE IN ANY MORE PAIN

298
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,291
THAN SHE ALREADY HAS BEEN.

299
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,666
I JUST WANT TO SAVE HER!

300
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,666
SHE'S THE PILOT OF THE END.

301
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,333
I WANT TO PROTECT ANEMONE.

302
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,750
- THIS IS NOT A BATTLE
FOR RANK OR GLORY.

303
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,000
THIS IS A BATTLE THAT
LIEUTENANT DOMINIC AND I

304
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,000
ARE GOING TO CHALLENGE
OURSELVES TO FIGHT

305
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,541
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE
LIVING ON THIS PLANET,

306
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,000
AND THE ONES WE LOVE.

307
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,083
THOSE OF YOU
WHO CANNOT AGREE WITH US

308
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,416
ARE FREE TO LEAVE.

309
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
GO BACK TO COMMAND

310
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,750
AND INFORM THEM
ABOUT OUR ACTIONS.

311
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,125
THE ENEMY THAT
STANDS BEFORE US

312
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,041
NUMBERS IN
THE TENS OF THOUSANDS.

313
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,291
AND SO,

314
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,375
I WILL THANK FROM
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART

315
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,041
EACH OF YOU WHO
OFFERS TO STAND UP

316
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,041
IN ORDER TO SAVE THIS WORLD.

317
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,708
THOSE WHO LEAVE...

318
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,666
I'LL BE SURE TO SEE YOU

319
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,416
SOMEWHERE ON
THIS PLANET SOME DAY.

320
