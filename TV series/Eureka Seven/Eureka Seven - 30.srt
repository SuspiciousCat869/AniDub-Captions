1
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,333
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,291
- ( grunting )

4
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,541
- Moondoggie:
THERE, GOT IT.

5
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,875
- WOW.

6
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,166
- HELP HIM.
- ALL RIGHT.

7
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,416
- YOU KNOW GUYS,
THIS THING IS PRETTY HEAVY.

8
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,833
- QUIT YOUR COMPLAINING.

9
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:08,833
- Stoner:
GOOD, LET'S GO.

10
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,333
- Renton: RIGHT NOW, I'M KIND
OF GOING ABOUT EVERYDAY LIFE

11
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,333
AS A MEMBER OF THE GEKKO CREW,
JUST LIKE I DID BEFORE.

12
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,458
THE THING THAT TALHO MENTIONED,

13
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,708
ABOUT EUREKA ACTUALLY BEING
SOMETHING CALLED A CORALIAN--

14
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,916
HONESTLY, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND MUCH OF IT.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,500
TO ME, EUREKA'S NOTHING
MORE THAN JUST A GIRL.

16
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,708
IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT HOLLAND
TOLD ME IN THE PAST,

17
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,041
I THOUGHT ABOUT TAKING
EUREKA WITH ME,

18
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,708
AND RUNNING
TO SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY.

19
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,666
I THOUGHT THAT SEARCHING
TOGETHER FOR A PLACE

20
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,750
WHERE WE COULD LIVE IN PEACE
WAS A GOOD IDEA.

21
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,750
BUT--

22
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,791
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS QUITE IT AT ALL.

23
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,416
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT I DON'T ALREADY KNOW ABOUT.

24
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,708
AND ONCE I KNOW EVERYTHING
I DON'T ALREADY KNOW ABOUT,

25
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,916
EVEN THEN, I'M GOING
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,958
I'M GOING TO PROTECT
YOU, EUREKA.

27
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,208
THAT'S THE PROMISE
I MADE WITH CHARLES AND RAY,

28
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,875
RIGHT BEFORE I LEFT THEM.

29
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,208
I GUESS I HAVE TO TELL
HOLLAND ABOUT THIS.

30
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,750
- HOLLAND'S SLEEPING.
- HM?

31
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,125
- HOLLAND'S ASLEEP.

32
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,708
- TALHO, YOU DON'T--

33
00:03:56,791 --> 00:04:00,083
YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
DO YOU, TALHO?

34
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,083
ABOUT MY BLOOD FLOWING
THROUGH HOLLAND'S BODY.

35
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,750
- HOLLAND NEVER FORGETS

36
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,416
ABOUT PEOPLE
HE USED TO CARE ABOUT.

37
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,625
ABOUT DIANE,

38
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,125
WHO'S NO LONGER HERE,

39
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,458
ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,708
- WAIT, WHY WOULD HOLLAND
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MY SISTER?

41
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,083
- BECAUSE HE'S JUST
THAT KIND OF GUY.

42
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,625
HE CAN'T FORGET
ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO DUMPED HIM.

43
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,291
HE'S UNFASHIONABLE, STUPID,
CLUMSY, AND NOTHING BUT A FOOL

44
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,833
WHO KNOWS ONLY
HOW TO ACT PHYSICALLY.

45
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,083
HE REALLY IS A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING.

46
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,041
- ( crying )

47
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,333
I'M SORRY, RENTON--

48
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:44,416
THAT HOLLAND IS
SOMEONE LIKE THIS.

49
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,666
- TALHO, IT'S TRUE OF COURSE,
I REALLY DID LIKE MY SISTER.

50
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,291
BUT I'M--

51
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,291
I'M NOT HER.

52
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:59,041
I AM WHO I AM.

53
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,666
BESIDES, I THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN

54
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,916
SUPPORT HOLLAND RIGHT NOW

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,791
AND GIVE HIM
EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDS.

56
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,208
- IDIOT.

57
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,541
- Matthieu: WE'RE HEADING
TOWARDS AN ARMY LABORATORY?

58
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,750
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS, ARE YOU?

59
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,083
- Hap:
WE CAN'T HELP IT.

60
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,708
THE ONLY PLACE THAT WE CAN
GET THE NIRVASH REPAIRED

61
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,666
IS THE TRESOR LABORATORY
WHERE IT WAS MADE.

62
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,000
- AND YET YOU PULL OUT
ALL THIS SCARY STUFF

63
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,083
LIKE WE'RE GOING
TO GO OUT AND ROB SOMEONE.

64
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,416
- BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY,
I ALWAYS SAY.

65
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,458
A FAKE ID CODE
HAS BEEN SENT OUT.

66
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,333
- WE'LL GO IN FAST.

67
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,583
MAKE SURE TO GRAB ONE PERSON
TO BE A HOSTAGE.

68
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,541
- Woz: HEY, I DON'T THINK
THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR THAT.

69
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,375
- YOU SEE, IT'S TRUE
THAT THEY'RE AN ARMY FACILITY,

70
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,375
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE
ARE RESEARCHERS

71
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,666
BEFORE THEY'RE
ARMY EMPLOYEES, RIGHT?

72
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,750
- MM-HMM.
IF THEY'RE RESEARCH GUYS,

73
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,583
ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO
IS SHOW THEM THE NIRVASH.

74
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:55,583
ESPECIALLY IF THAT'S THE PLACE
WHERE HE WAS MADE.

75
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,708
- Stoner:
I SEE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

76
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,541
THE SAME KIND OF GUYS HERE.

77
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,416
- THAT'S WHY I DON'T THINK
ANY OF YOU WILL BE NEEDING GUNS.

78
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,208
- Matthieu: IT'S ALl RIGHT, I
WON'T BE HURTING ANYONE WITH IT.

79
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,541
- Hap:
WE'RE JUST BEING CAREFUL.

80
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,041
- Holland:
I'LL DO THE DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS.

81
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,416
- Talho: HOLLAND!

82
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,000
WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

83
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,666
- I'M FINE.

84
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,833
- BUT HOLLAND, ISN'T TRESOR
WHERE YOUR LEAST FAVORITE--

85
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,375
- Holland:
DON'T WORRY.

86
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,083
YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST ME.

87
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:54,125
- Renton:
I WONDER IF HE'S ALRIGHT.

88
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,125
- Hap: YEAH, I REMEMBER
THAT MORITA, THE LAB CHIEF,

89
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,000
AND HOLLAND DIDN'T
GET ALONG VERY WELL.

90
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,041
WAIT!

91
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,250
THE TECHNICAL NERDS
ADMIT DEFEAT.

92
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,625
- THIS IS--

93
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,375
IS THE ARCHETYPE
REALLY CHANGING SHAPE?

94
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,916
- Job?????:
YES, NOTHING FITS

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,916
THE PREVIOUS
STANDARDIZATIONS NOW.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,750
- THIS SIMPLY CAN'T BE!

97
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,958
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

98
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,958
- PERHAPS, BUT IT'S SITTING
IN FRONT OF US.

99
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,833
- WHO ARE THE PILOTS FOR THIS?

100
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,166
- Holland:
THEY'RE BEHIND YOU.

101
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,791
I WANT YOU TO MAKE NEW PARTS

102
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,791
FOR THE MOTION
AND SIGNAL RELAYS.

103
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,208
AND HOW ABOUT A NICE NEW COWL
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

104
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,458
- YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE
ASKING THAT, AFTER STEALING

105
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,458
MILITARY EQUIPMENT
AND GOING AWOL.

106
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,833
- Renton:
PLEASE, HELP HIM!

107
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,291
PLEASE, YOU HAVE
TO SAVE NIRVASH.

108
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,958
- Eureka: ONLY THE
PEOPLE HERE CAN SAVE HIM.

109
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,958
PLEASE DON'T TURN US AWAY.

110
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,250
- BUT IF THE ARMY
FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS--

111
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,541
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.

112
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,125
I'LL JUST THE FORGE
THE REPORT DOCUMENTS.

113
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,958
- ( sighs )

114
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,583
- Morita: RIGHT NOW, THIS LAB
IS CONFUSED ENOUGH AS IT IS

115
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,833
WITH THE PREPOSTEROUS ORDERS

116
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,750
COMING FROM THE ARMY'S
NEW SQUADRON.

117
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,958
EVERY LAB RESEARCHER
IS STRETCHED TO THEIR LIMITS.

118
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,375
- I GUESS I'LL HAVE
TO ASK SOMEONE ELSE.

119
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,500
- HOWEVER, THAT'S ALL
THE MORE REASON OUR RESEARCHERS

120
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,000
COULD USE A BREAK.

121
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,083
A BREAK CALLED A typeZERO.

122
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,250
- THANK YOU, SIR.

123
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,291
- SORRY.

124
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,666
- TECHNICIANS LIKE US
ARE ALL LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW?

125
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,833
ATTENTION, PLEASE.

126
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,458
WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE SHIFTS
AGAIN TODAY.

127
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,750
I REPEAT, WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE
SHIFTS AGAIN TODAY.

128
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,666
I'LL RELAY THE DETAILS
TO ALL DEPARTMENTS

129
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,500
IN 35 MINUTES.

130
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,000
- EXCUSE ME, CHIEF?

131
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,041
I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK.

132
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,958
- Morita: ALL SHIFTS WILL BE
EXTENDED BY EIGHT HOURS

133
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,541
FOR DESIGN OF CIRCULAR SPECIAL

134
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,333
AS WELL AS PROTOTYPES FOR RAPID.

135
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,708
DETAILS WILL BE SENT TO ALL
DEPARTMENTS IN 45 MINUTES.

136
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,583
MOVE THE CIRCULAR SPECIAL
FROM THE HANGAR

137
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:58,583
TO THE P-WING, AND START
MEASUREMENTS IMMEDIATELY.

138
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,791
- Eureka:
POOR THING, HE'S ALL NAKED NOW.

139
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,750
- I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT HIM, EUREKA.

140
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,375
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE
ALL JUST LIKE MY GRANDPA.

141
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,875
- HUH?

142
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,708
- THEY'RE ALL SLIGHTLY STRANGE,
BUT I CAN BELIEVE IN THEM.

143
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,583
- Sonia: OH, SO THIS IS
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN HIDING.

144
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,916
- Eureka: SONIA!

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,583
- IT'S BEEN
QUITE A WHILE, EUREKA.

146
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,208
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN WELL.

147
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,291
- YOU KNOW HER?

148
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,333
- YEAH.

149
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,083
- YOU SEE, THIS WAS
THE FIRST PLACE

150
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,833
THEY BROUGHT ME TO,
BACK WHEN THEY FOUND ME.

151
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,625
I'VE KNOWN SONIA
SINCE THAT DAY.

152
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,041
- FOUND?

153
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:34,083
THAT'S RIGHT, EUREKA
WAS FOUND AS A CORALIAN.

154
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,000
EUREKA IS--

155
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,333
- Sonia: SO THIS MUST BE
THE MUCH-RUMORED RENTON.

156
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,875
NICE TO MEET YOU,
I'M SONIA WAKABAYASHI,

157
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,583
HEAD OF THE TECHNICAL
RESEARCH TEAM.

158
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,458
I'M SURE WE'LL GET ALONG.

159
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,833
- NICE TO MEET YOU,

160
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,791
I'M RENTON THURSTON.

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,125
- YOU SHOULD GET SOME REST,
YOU MUST BE TIRED.

162
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,083
- YEAH I AM,
THANKS TO A VERY SELFISH LEADER.

163
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,916
- BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT
THIS TIME AROUND.

164
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,208
HOLLAND MADE UP HIS MIND
IN HIS OWN WAY AND IS

165
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:12,416
TRYING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE SITUATION.

166
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,416
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE CONVINCED
ABOUT EUREKA AS WELL.

167
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,458
- I'M NOT SURE
IF I CAN BE CONVINCED

168
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,500
OF EACH AND EVERY THING.
I JUST DIDN'T WANT HOLLAND

169
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,666
RUNNING AWAY
FROM THE TRUTH ANYMORE.

170
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,000
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE I WANT HIM

171
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,916
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR IT OR ANYTHING.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,125
I JUST WANTED HOLLAND
TO STAY THE HOLLAND

173
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,666
THAT I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

174
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,208
AND THAT'S ALL.

175
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,250
- ( sighs )

176
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,291
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE
REALLY BEEN THINKING ABOUT,

177
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,666
THEN TALHO--
- WHAT?

178
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,833
- YOU SHOULD PROBABLY STOP
DRESSING LIKE THAT ALREADY.

179
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

180
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,708
HE'S TOO DENSE, AFTER ALL.

181
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,458
- Morita:
IN 120 SECONDS,

182
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,708
WE WILL CONDUCT
AN EXPERIMENT FOR ORANGE.

183
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,583
- Gidget:
THIS IS WHERE THEY DESIGN

184
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,333
THE ARMY KLFs AND STUFF, RIGHT?

185
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,625
THAT'S SO STRANGE, BECAUSE
IT SEEMS NICE AND PEACEFUL HERE.

186
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,666
- I AGREE.

187
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,000
- THE GUYS HERE ARE AWARE

188
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,750
OF HOW THE WEAPONS
THEY MAKE ARE USED.

189
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,666
I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO KNOW BEFORE
THEY CAN EVEN DESIGN THEM.

190
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,958
IT'S WHAT THEY DO HERE.

191
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,208
- ORIGINALLY THIS WAS A LAB
OPEN TO EXPERIMENT

192
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,958
WITH THE UNEARTHED ARCHETYPES.

193
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,458
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'VE
BEEN MAKING WEAPONS

194
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,833
TO KILL PEOPLE WITH
FROM THE GET-GO.

195
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:18,833
- ( rumbling )

196
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,666
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

197
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,666
- Morita: THE ENTRY SURFACE
AREA IS STILL TOO LARGE.

198
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,708
- HELL OF A WEAPON,
THAT'S SO UNLIKE YOU.

199
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,208
- YOU CAN STAY ASLEEP.

200
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,541
- THAT WEAPON HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE NEW SQUADRON

201
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,083
THE ARMY'S FORMING, DOESN'T IT?

202
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,375
- THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

203
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,125
- IT'S DEWEY, ISN'T IT?

204
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:57,375
- I DON'T KNOW.  IN ANY CASE,
WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

205
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,208
HOW THE GROUP THAT ORDERED IT
WAS CREATED.

206
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,666
OR WHO'S ACTUALLY IN IT.

207
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,333
IT'S A MYSTERY SQUADRON.

208
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,041
IT'S THE AGEHA SQUAD.

209
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,625
- AGEHA?

210
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,625
- THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DELIVER
AS STRONG AN IMPACT AS POSSIBLE

211
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,083
TO THE DEEPEST AREA OF SCUBS.

212
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,125
WE PUT IT ON THE AFX,
A REMOTE-CONTROLLED BOMBER

213
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,916
THAT USES TRAJECTORY FLIGHT.

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,083
THE  MISSILE ITSELF
IS 24x DENSER THAN USUAL.

215
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,083
FURTHERMORE, THE WARHEAD WE'LL
BE USING ON THE FINAL VERSION

216
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,500
IS AN ANTI-RELATIVITY BOMB.

217
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,333
- POLLUTED AIR
ACROSS A DYING WASTELAND.

218
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,375
I GUESS THEY'VE GOT SOME

219
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,208
PREPOSTEROUS
FANTASIES OF THE FUTURE.

220
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,250
- ATTENTION ORANGE TEAM,

221
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,541
BEGIN ENTRY SURFACE AREA
RECALCULATION IMMEDIATELY.

222
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,375
- ONCE THE GEKKO
IS FULLY REPAIRED,

223
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,583
WE'LL GET OUT OF HERE.

224
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,916
- HEY, IMPROVING THE SPECS
OF THE TYPE ZERO

225
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,541
IS GOING TO BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

226
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:50,125
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT HOW
TO REPAIR THAT BODY OF YOURS.

227
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:01,541
- IN THE END, I GUESS I
WAS RUNNING AWAY AS WELL.

228
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,500
I HAVE TO CHANGE, TOO.

229
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,583
- Sonia:
THIS IS AMAZING.

230
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,791
THE ARCHETYPE HAS
EVOLVED CONSIDERABLY.

231
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,666
THIS DOESN'T INVOLVE
JUST THE OUTER HULL PARTS,

232
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,291
IT MIGHT REQUIRE A COMPLETE
MAKEOVER OF THE LAYOUTS.

233
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,708
- WILL THAT TAKE MUCH TIME?

234
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,833
EVEN IF WE GET A MOLD USING
THE LIGHT MOLDER WE HAVE HERE,

235
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,000
THE TOUCH-UPS ARE
ALL DONE BY HAND.

236
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,791
IT COULD TAKE 10 DAYS.

237
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,416
- Mischa:
I GUESS WE'RE TROUBLING YOU.

238
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,125
- WE NEED EVENTS LIKE THIS
EVERY SO OFTEN.

239
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,416
- HEY...

240
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,166
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
ANYWHERE AROUND HERE TODAY.

241
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,458
- HE'S ON
AN ON-SITE RESEARCH TRIP.

242
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,166
HE'LL BE BACK IN NO TIME.

243
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,375
- OH, BROTHER.

244
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,333
DOES HE HAVE
REALLY AWFUL TIMING, OR WHAT?

245
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,666
- Eureka:
SEE, IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

246
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,125
LOOK CLOSELY AT THE COCKPIT
ON THE BACK.

247
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,666
- Renton:
WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

248
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,750
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
HE'S TRYING TO TELL US

249
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,875
TO MAKE TWO SPACES THERE.

250
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,166
- SEE?

251
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,000
- THAT WAS WHAT SEPARATED
THIS FIRST ARCHETYPE

252
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,416
FROM ALL THE OTHERS
THAT CAME LATER.

253
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,625
ALL OF THE ARCHETYPES
THAT WERE UNEARTHED LATER ON

254
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,291
MAY HAVE LOOKED SIMILAR
ON THE OUTSIDE TO THE typeZERO,

255
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,166
BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY ARCHETYPE
THAT HAD BEEN STRUCTURED

256
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,666
FOR TWO SEATS
FROM THE BEGINNING.

257
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,583
WHY WERE THERE TWO SEATS
PREPARED ON THIS ONE?

258
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,750
AND WHY WERE THE ARCHETYPES
ALWAYS MADE IN THE SHAPE

259
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,416
OF GIANT HUMANOID CREATURES?

260
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,166
DEBATE OVER THE MEANING
OF THIS STRUCTURE

261
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,666
CONTINUES TO RAGE ON.

262
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,958
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE

263
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,041
IF EUREKA COULD HAVE
ANSWERED THESE QUESTIONS.

264
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,208
- I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST DON'T
HAVE ANY MEMORIES

265
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,625
FROM WHEN I WAS CREATED.

266
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,833
- Sonia: I KNOW!

267
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,416
OUR CHIEF MADE A MOVIE
ALL ABOUT THIS SUBJECT.

268
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,416
YOU WANT TO WATCH?

269
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,875
- MOVIE?

270
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,875
- ( music playing )

271
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,000
- Narrator:
THE UNEARTHED ARTIFACT

272
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,541
WAS IN THE SHAPE OF A HUMAN.

273
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,833
AND IT WAS UNKNOWN
EXACTLY HOW LONG AGO

274
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,375
IT HAD BEEN CREATED.

275
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,583
FORTUNATELY, AS ITS CONDITION
WAS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD,

276
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,208
AND THANKS TO THE SUPERIOR
TECHNICAL SKILLS

277
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,375
OF THE TRESOR LABORATORY
RESEARCHERS,

278
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,125
THE ARTIFACT WAS ABLE TO BE
ALMOST COMPLETELY RECONSTRUCTED.

279
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,208
IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT WHEN
AN ELECTRIC CURRENT WAS APPLIED

280
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,041
TO THIS ARTIFACT,
IT COULD BE DIRECTED

281
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,416
TO MOVE EACH OF ITS PARTS.

282
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,125
THE CIRCUITS THAT WERE
BELIEVED TO BE

283
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,041
THE NEUROLOGICAL
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM

284
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,833
WERE CONCENTRATED ON ITS BACK.

285
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,083
INDICATING THAT
THE ARTIFACT'S COMMAND POINT

286
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,458
HAD BEEN PLACED
THERE BY ITS DESIGNERS.

287
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,666
UPON THE ADDITION OF
THE MOTION TRANSMISSION SYSTEM,

288
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,666
THE ARTIFACT WAS CONFIRMED
TO BE IN THE SHAPE OF A HUMAN

289
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,708
AND WAS ABLE TO MIMIC
THE MOVEMENTS OF HUMANS AS WELL.

290
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:50,958
HOWEVER, THE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS
COULD NOT BE LOCATED

291
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,625
AND ITS OPERATION
WAS TOUGH, AT BEST.

292
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,666
BUT WHEN EUREKA,

293
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,166
THE GIRL WHO WAS RESCUED
FROM THE EXCAVATION SITE

294
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,875
AT THE SAME TIME
AS THE ARTIFACT,

295
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,833
OPERATED IT-- AS SHOWN HERE,

296
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,041
IT BECAME SOMETHING
AKIN TO A CAR.

297
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:21,000
IT WAS THE MISSION
OF THE TRESOR LABORATORIES,

298
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,125
KNOWN FOR ITS HIGH
TECHNICAL SKILLS,

299
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,625
TO DRAW OUT,
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE,

300
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,791
THE HIDDEN POWERS
OF THIS ARTIFACT.

301
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,625
WE DISCOVERED THAT USING TRAPARS

302
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,041
AS ITS ELECTRICAL POWER SOURCE
WAS OPTIMAL.

303
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,458
AND TO MAXIMIZE ITS POTENTIAL,

304
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,250
WE ADDED A FUNCTION SIMILAR
TO THE POPULAR SPORT OF LIFTING.

305
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,333
THE CREATION
OF THIS GIANT REF BOARD

306
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,750
PROVED TO BE AN ENORMOUS
TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE

307
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,500
FOR THE TRESOR
RESEARCH DESIGNERS.

308
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,666
- GRANDPOP...

309
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,083
- I REMEMBER A FEW THINGS
ABOUT THAT TIME.

310
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,708
- Narrator: THE ARTIFACT WAS
CHRISTENED, THE NIRVASH.

311
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,208
AND BECAME THE PERMANENT
TEMPLATE FOR ALL THE LFOs

312
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,000
THAT WERE LATER FOUND OR CREATED

313
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,666
BY THE EXPERTS
HERE AT TRESOR LABORATORIES.

314
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,708
- ( clapping )

315
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,041
- THAT WAS PRETTY STRANGE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

316
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,458
- MM-HMM... OH, IT'S LINCK!

317
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,000
- YOU GUYS WERE HERE, TOO?

318
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,458
- HEY, RENTON, WHY ARE YOU
FIDGETING LIKE THAT?

319
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,875
- Maeter:
YOU WERE TRYING TO TOUCH MAMA

320
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,333
WHILE IT WAS ALL DARK,
WEREN'T YOU?

321
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,583
- WHAT?! THAT'S NOT TRUE!

322
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,041
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?

323
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,541
- HEY, WHERE'S MAURICE?

324
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,708
- I DON'T KNOW.
- ME NEITHER.

325
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,291
- YOU THREE DIDN'T
COME HERE TOGETHER?

326
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,833
- UH-UH.
- MAURICE HAS BEEN

327
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,666
ACTING REAL FUNNY.

328
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,916
HE'S TRYING NOT TO LOOK
AT YOU ALL THAT MUCH, MAMA.

329
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,666
- RENTON, MOVE!
- WHAT?

330
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,750
- Maeter and Linck: MAMA!

331
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,041
- EUREKA!

332
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,958
- Eureka: MAURICE!

333
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,000
MAURICE, WHERE ARE YOU?

334
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,625
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

335
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,500
- YOU'VE CHANGED.

336
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,125
TALHO, YOU'VE CHANGED!

337
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,916
- NO, I DIDN'T.

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,083
I JUST WENT BACK.

339
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,000
YOU KNOW, FOR A WHILE THERE,

340
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,500
I THOUGHT ABOUT THROWING
IT ALL AWAY.

341
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,000
I MEAN, IT WAS
REALLY TOUGH ON ME.

342
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,916
BUT THE WAY THINGS TURNED OUT
GOT ME THINKING.

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,500
IN THE END, NOTHING HAD CHANGED.

344
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:11,625
HOW I FELT BEFORE,
MY EMOTIONS FROM MY PAST,

345
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,041
EVERYTHING WENT BACK
TO HOW IT USED TO BE.

346
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,083
IT'S SO STRANGE.

347
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,833
- I THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT.

348
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,333
I MEAN, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW,
YOU'VE CHANGED, TALHO.

349
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,166
I WENT THROUGH SOME CHANGES
MYSELF WITHOUT REALIZING IT.

350
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,583
AND NOW YOU'VE
CHANGED AS WELL, TALHO.

351
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,208
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T THINK ABOUT IT
AS A SCARY THING.

352
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,041
- OH, BROTHER.

353
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,833
CAN'T SEEM TO WIN,
NO MATTER WHAT.

354
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,208
I'M REALLY JEALOUS.

355
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,541
- ( phone clicks )

356
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,208
- OH, MAN.  HE'S STILL STUBBORN
AND OLD-FASHIONED.

357
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,458
- Renton:
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF?

358
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,166
- WHAT'S WRONG?

359
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,208
- I SAW THE MOVIE.

360
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,625
I WAS REAL SURPRISED TO SEE
THAT MY GRANDPA WAS IN IT.

361
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,583
SEE, MY GRANDPA IS...

362
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,541
- YOUR GRANDPA AXEL IS WHAT YOU
WOULD CALL A MENTOR TO ME.

363
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,833
- WHAT?!

364
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,041
- Morita: YOUR GRANDPA IS
A VERY FORCEFUL MAN.

365
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,375
HE HAD A HUGE ARGUMENT
WITH THE BUREAUCRATS

366
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,750
OF THIS DEPARTMENT AND QUIT.

367
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,500
AFTER THAT, I VISITED HIM

368
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,041
IN HIS BELLFOREST GARAGE
ONLY ONCE.

369
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,833
I COULDN'T GET THE REF BOARD
FOR THE typeZERO

370
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,375
TO WORK THE RIGHT AWAY.

371
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,541
I BOWED MY HEAD DOWN
TO OLD THURSTON,

372
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,666
AND HAD HIM FINISH IT UP.

373
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,041
YOUR HOMELAND,
IT'S A VERY NICE PLACE.

374
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,958
- IT'S BORING, IT DOESN'T HAVE
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

375
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,041
- ( sirens )

376
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,166
- Morita: ATTENTION,
WE ARE ENTERING

377
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,541
THE CIRCULAR SPECIAL SHIFT.

378
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,500
- HEY, HEY, HEY, YOUR MIC'S
FEEDING BACK, YOU KNOW?

379
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,166
- WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

380
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,666
- ( loud dance music playing )

381
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,625
- ( cheering )

382
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,791
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

383
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:33,291
- WHAT IS UP WITH
THIS OLD-FASHIONED MUSIC?

384
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,416
IT PUTS ME IN A BAD MOOD.

385
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,291
- Talho:
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

386
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,333
YOU'VE ALWAYS HATED
OLD MUSIC LIKE THIS.

387
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,750
AT LEAST SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU.

388
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,666
- SHUT UP, WILL YOU?

389
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,750
- WE SAY ALL THIS STUFF NOW,

390
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,583
BUT SOMEDAY, WE'RE GOING
TO BE OLD MEN AND WOMEN, TOO.

391
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,208
- I SAID, SHUT UP.

392
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,166
- EUREKA!

393
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,916
DID THEY ALREADY START
MAKING IT?

394
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,666
- YEAH, YOU SEE?

395
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,708
NIRVASH IS HAPPY, TOO.

396
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,750
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU, NIRVASH!

397
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,791
IT'S ALRIGHT FOR YOU
TO CHANGE, TOO.

398
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,708
JUST LIKE ME!

399
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,208
- Renton and Eureka:
TO BE CONTINUED!

400
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,708
- ( theme music playing )

401
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

402
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,000
- Talho:
ARROWS OF LIGHT PIERCE THE LAND.

403
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:05,333
TO COERCE THE WORLD TO AWAKEN.

404
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:10,416
THEIR AWAKENING TRAPS PEOPLE
IN THEIR WORST NIGHTMARES.

405
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,833
- NEXT EPISODE,
"ANIMAL ATTACK."
