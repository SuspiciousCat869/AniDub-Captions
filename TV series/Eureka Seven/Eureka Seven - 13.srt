1
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,708
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,500
- Man:
ESCAPING THE TRAPAR LOSS AREA.

4
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,458
BOTH LIFT AND PROPULSION
ARE RETURNING.

5
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,458
- Woman: THE SHIP
WILL STABILIZE SOON.

6
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,125
- WHAT ABOUT THE ENEMY?

7
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,541
- NO SIGNS OF ENEMY SHIPS
WITHIN DETECTABLE RANGE.

8
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,125
- WHAT'S THE STATUS
OF THE END?

9
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,041
- I'M GETTING NO RESPONSE.
- WELL, KEEP TRYING.

10
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,041
DON'T YOU WORRY, MAJOR.
WHEN WE STABILIZE THE SITUATION,

11
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,708
WE'LL IMMEDIATELY GO
AND RECOVER THAT DOLL.

12
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,708
MAJOR SOREL.
- SECURITY WARNING, SIR.

13
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,750
AN OPEN AFT HATCH.
- WHAT?

14
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,500
- SOMEONE'S LAUNCHED ONE
OF THE LIFE BOARDS.

15
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,333
- DAMN IT, HE'S GOING OFF
ON HIS OWN.

16
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,500
- Renton: I KNOW--

17
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,000
I KNOW MY NAME.

18
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:36,000
THAT'S RIGHT.
MY NAME IS RENTON THURSTON.

19
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,000
I REMEMBER.

20
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,541
DADDY THUMB,

21
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,541
MOMMY FINGER,

22
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,041
BROTHER FINGER,

23
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,541
SISTER.

24
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:52,291
EUREKA HELD THIS HAND
BACK IN THAT OCEAN.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
EUREKA.  EUREKA.

26
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,458
EUREKA!

27
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,833
EUREKA.

28
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,791
HEY, NIRVASH.

29
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,291
OPEN YOUR EYES
AND WAKE UP!

30
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,541
HEY, EUREKA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

31
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,791
THE GEKKO WILL BE COMING
TO PICK US UP SOON.

32
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,125
JUST HANG ON UNTIL THEN.

33
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,666
THE WAVES ARE PULLING BACK.

34
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,250
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

35
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,166
WHO THE HELL WOULD DO ALL
OF THIS TO EUREKA?

36
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,583
I-- I KNOW-- I KNOW YOU.

37
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,333
YOU'RE THAT GIRL.

38
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,166
SO IT WASN'T A DREAM?

39
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,416
BUT WAIT.
MAYBE I'M STILL DREAMING.

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,125
- PUT BOTH HANDS BEHIND YOUR
HEAD AND TURN AROUND TO FACE ME.

41
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,291
- HEY, WAIT JUST A MINUTE.
WHAT DID I DO?

42
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,041
- CALM DOWN.
JUST SLOWLY DO WHAT I SAID.

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,500
IT'S YOU.
- ( Anemone screaming )

44
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,250
( coughing )

45
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,083
- ( winces )

46
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,833
- EUREKA!
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT MOVING.

47
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,625
- ANEMONE, HOLD ON A MINUTE.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE MEDICATION.

48
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,708
- HURRY UP!
I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE.

49
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,458
- EUREKA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
EUREKA.

50
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,958
- ALL RIGHT, ANEMONE,
NOW LIFT YOUR CHIN.

51
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,125
DO IT.
- OW!

52
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,000
- THAT HURT.
- ( sobbing )

53
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,708
DOMINIC, PLEASE.
MY HEAD.  DO SOMETHING.

54
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,541
I CAN'T TAKE IT.
- I DON'T HAVE A SPARE.

55
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,000
COME ON, LET'S GO BACK
TO THE SHIP.

56
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,666
CLIMB OUT.  I'LL HELP YOU.

57
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,666
- DON'T TOUCH ME.
LEAVE ME ALONE!

58
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,333
COME ON, DOMINIC, HURRY!

59
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,208
WHY ARE YOU STANDING THERE?
DO SOMETHING.

60
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,416
DO SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS HEAD OF MINE!

61
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,208
- ( grunting )
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

62
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,666
- THE CLOSEST TOWN
IS SALISA ORNE.

63
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,333
IF WE CAN FIND
A GOVERNMENT-RUN HOSPITAL,

64
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,541
I'M SURE WE'LL FIND
THE MEDICINE YOU NEED.

65
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,875
YOU JUST LAY HERE FOR A WHILE.
TRY TO REST.

66
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,083
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

67
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,208
- IF I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO
END UP LIKE THIS,

68
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,375
I SHOULD LEAVE EUREKA
AND GO GET HELP.

69
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,583
HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

70
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,583
- WHO ARE YOU?  YOU'RE IN MY
WAY.  HURRY UP AND MOVE.

71
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,333
- I WANT YOU
TO TAKE ME WITH YOU.

72
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,083
- WHAT A PEST.
GO AWAY.

73
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,583
- IF YOU REFUSE
TO TAKE ME WITH YOU--

74
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,916
- YEAH, WHAT?

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,583
- SHOOT ME.  YOU'RE NOT GETTING
AWAY FROM HERE ANYWAY.

76
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

77
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,416
- YOU MISSING THIS?

78
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,541
- ( screams )
WHEN THE HELL DID YOU--

79
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,041
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH FOOLING AROUND.

80
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,791
I REALLY WILL SHOOT,
YOU KNOW?

81
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,250
- GO AHEAD.
- I WILL.

82
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,500
- I'M PRETTY SURE YOU
DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS.

83
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,958
- WHAT?  THE MUFFLER?!

84
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,208
DAMN IT,
WHEN THE HELL DID HE--

85
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,708
- I CAN FIX IT.
BUT IN RETURN,

86
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,916
YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME ALONG.

87
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,666
- FINE.  HURRY UP.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

88
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,916
- Woman: TypeZERO IS STILL
MAINTAINING SILENCE.

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,625
AND RENTON'S VITAL SIGNS
HAVE DISAPPEARED.

90
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,958
- WOZ, CONFIRM WITH JOBS WHETHER
OR NOT WE CAN LAUNCH THE 909.

91
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,000
- OKAY.
- TALHO, TAKE US DOWN

92
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,666
TO A LOWER ALTITUDE.
- THERE ARE NO WAVES OUT THERE.

93
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,666
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO USE AN LFO.

94
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,666
- IF I GO IN VEHICLE MODE,
I WON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

95
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,666
- AND HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU
THINK THAT'S GONNA TAKE?

96
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,666
- THE MILITARY KLF WENT DOWN
RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE NIRVASH.

97
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,666
- SO WE CAN ASSUME THEY'LL BE
SENDING DOWN A RETRIEVAL TEAM.

98
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,250
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS

99
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,666
WE RUN INTO THEM DOWN THERE.

100
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,916
- THAT'S ALL THE MORE
REASON TO GO.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,666
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAND THOSE
TWO AND NIRVASH TO THE MILITARY.

102
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,666
SO AM I MISTAKEN
ABOUT ANY OF THAT?

103
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,291
- NO, YOU'RE NOT
MISTAKEN, BUT--

104
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,666
- THEN IT'S TIME TO GO.

105
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,666
- I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS.

106
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,166
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
GET THERE WITHOUT THE GEKKO?

107
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,166
HEY, COME BACK,
HOLD ON RIGHT THERE!

108
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,208
- I DID TELL YOU TO FIX IT,

109
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,708
BUT I NEVER SAID ONE WORD ABOUT
TUNING IT TO RUN THIS LOUD.

110
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,916
- GOTTA HURRY, 'CAUSE IF WE
DON'T, EUREKA WILL BE--

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,250
THAT GIRL, WHO IS SHE?

112
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,541
COME ON, PLEASE, TELL ME.

113
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,125
THAT KLF.  WHY DOES IT LOOK
SO MUCH LIKE THE NIRVASH?

114
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,708
- I HAVE NO NEED
TO ANSWER THAT.

115
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,375
- YES, YOU DO.  IT'S BECAUSE
OF HER THAT EUREKA'S HURT.

116
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,250
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

117
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,083
WHAT YOU GUYS WERE REALLY
TRYING TO DO UP THERE?

118
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,208
- YOU MEAN THE MILITARY KNOWS?
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT HUGE CLOUD,

119
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,375
CALLED A CORALIAN IS?  YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT THING IS ALL ABOUT?

120
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,041
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

121
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,875
WHO TOLD YOU THAT NAME?
- HEY, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

122
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,750
- HUH?  WHOA!

123
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,125
- ( brakes screech )

124
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,291
- HUH?
- WHO DID YOU HEAR IT FROM?

125
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,750
WHO DID YOU HEAR
THE NAME CORALIAN FROM?

126
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,833
- IS IT BAD FOR ME
TO KNOW THAT?

127
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,208
- ON YOUR FEET.

128
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,958
- SO WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS A CORALIAN?

129
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,208
- ( gasps )

130
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,750
IT'S GONE.
WAIT.  DID I DROP IT?

131
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,500
WHERE'D IT GO?

132
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,583
DON'T TELL ME YOU
DID IT AGAIN?

133
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,833
- YOU MEAN THAT OVER THERE?

134
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,500
- LOWER IT SLOWLY, OKAY?
ON THREE.

135
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,208
- COME ON, TELL ME.
I WANNA KNOW WHAT A CORALIAN IS.

136
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,625
- I TOLD YOU.
I HAVE NO NEED TO ANSWER.

137
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,500
- IT BOTHERS ME, OKAY?

138
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,500
WHEN I ENTERED THAT CLOUD,

139
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,250
I FELT LIKE I WASN'T
MYSELF ANYMORE.  BUTTERFLIES.

140
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,500
- ENOUGH WITH
THE DAMN BUTTERFLIES.

141
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,958
- OH, AND IT FEELS LIKE
I GOTTA PEE MY PANTS.

142
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,125
( urinating )
- ( sighs )

143
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,166
- THERE'S ONE THING THAT
I'D LIKE TO CONFIRM RIGHT NOW.

144
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,500
WHAT YOU TOLD ME EARLIER.

145
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,166
YOU ENTERED INTO THE ZONE,
DIDN'T YOU?

146
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,333
- ( engine revving )

147
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,625
- GET ON.  TIME'S SHORT.

148
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,875
- Man: ATTENTION ALL REMAINING
CITIZENS IN THE AREA.

149
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,708
YOU ARE TO EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY

150
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,958
TO YOUR NEAREST
COMMUNITY CENTER.

151
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,833
THERE ARE NO SCHEDULED TIMES
OR DATES AS TO

152
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:48,458
WHEN THE WATER, GAS
AND ELECTRICITY WILL RESUME.

153
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,708
- GET THE MAP FILE.
- HUH?

154
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,041
- THERE'S ONE THERE
UNDER YOUR FEET.

155
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,375
HURRY UP AND FIND A HOSPITAL.

156
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,208
- I GUESS THIS IS IT.

157
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,333
SALISA ORNE.

158
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,708
WHERE IS IT?
SALISA ORNE.

159
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,208
OH.  "SALPO MALOO?"
NO, THAT'S WRONG.

160
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,625
- OH, GIVE ME THAT!
- ( grunts )

161
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,083
- WHERE'S NORTH?

162
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,041
TELL ME WHICH WAY
NORTH IS ON THIS MAP.

163
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,416
- NORTH IS ALWAYS UP.

164
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,791
AND BY THE WAY,
YOU'VE GOT IT REVERSED.

165
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,750
- IT'S UP?  REVERSED?  WHERE?

166
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,958
- OH, BROTHER,
HE'S SERIOUSLY NUTS.

167
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,833
- DISGUSTING WORTHLESS SOLDIER!
- OH!

168
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,375
- ( blows raspberries )
- ( engine turns over )

169
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,875
- HOLD ON TIGHT.

170
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,125
WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THE MAIN
PART OF TOWN FOR NOW.

171
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,583
- ( panting )

172
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,958
THE SIGNS ARE ALL COVERED
IN GRAFFITI.  I CAN'T READ 'EM.

173
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,000
- NO GOOD.

174
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,416
THIS SLUMMY TOWN IS BUILT
LIKE SOME DARK LABYRINTH.

175
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,125
EVEN THE KIDS HERE
ARE LOWLIFES.

176
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,958
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

177
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,458
EVEN IF WE WANTED TO ASK FOR
DIRECTIONS, THERE'S NO ONE HERE.

178
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,958
BUT THERE'S NO WAY.

179
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,666
THE CORALIAN COULDN'T HAVE
CAUSED THIS, NOT THIS MUCH.

180
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,833
"MILITIA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.

181
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,125
ON WEST STREET
IN THE 7th DISTRICT."

182
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,125
- Man: YOU'RE SAYING IT WAS
ABNORMAL WEATHER?

183
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,708
- Sorel:
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

184
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,625
- THERE ARE MORE TECTONIC
SHIFTS HAPPENING NOW.

185
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,833
IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH
THAT GIANT CLOUD, DIDN'T IT?

186
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,708
- WE'RE INVESTIGATING THAT.

187
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,000
NOW LET GO OF ME.

188
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,666
- THAT'S WHAT YOU PEOPLE SAY
EVERY TIME WE ASK YOU SOMETHING.

189
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,291
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE YOU
IN THE MILITARY?

190
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,666
- THE PURPOSE OF OUR EXISTENCE
IS TO PROTECT CIVILIANS.

191
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,000
- QUIT THAT JOKE
YOU'RE TELLING THERE.

192
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,791
- THE TOWN'S DESTROYED.
YOU SAW IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES.

193
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,291
AND IT'S THANKS TO YOU GUYS
IN THE MILITARY.

194
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,333
- DAMN YOU TO HELL!

195
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,666
- DAMN.

196
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,833
YOU LOUSY GOOD-FOR-NOTHING
TRAITOR.

197
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,958
- WHAT DO YOU GUYS
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

198
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,166
THIS IS NO TIME TO BE FIGHTING
OVER SOMETHING STUPID.

199
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,166
WE'VE GOTTA GET GOING.  I FOUND
THE LOCATION OF THE HOSPITAL.

200
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,625
- THIS KID'S ONE OF YOUR GUYS?

201
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,333
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU WANNA MAKE SOMETHING OF IT?

202
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,750
- IN THAT CASE,
WE NEED TO GIVE HIM OUR THANKS.

203
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,833
- HEY, DO THINGS LIKE THAT
HAPPEN TO YOU A LOT?

204
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,833
- SHUT UP.  IF YOU FOUND
THE LOCATION OF A HOSPITAL,

205
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,833
YOU COULD HAVE JUST GONE
ON THERE ALONE, YOU KNOW?

206
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,833
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME WHAT KIND
OF MEDICINES THAT YOU NEEDED.

207
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,833
ANYWAY, HEAD WEST.

208
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:47,666
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD AT LEAST
GIVE ME ONE WORD OF THANKS.

209
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,333
I KEEP TELLING YOU
WE GOTTA GO WEST.

210
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:56,833
- SORRY,
BUT IS WEST THE DIRECTION

211
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,333
OF THE HAND YOU HOLD
YOUR FORK WITH?

212
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,791
- THIS GUY IS REALLY NUTS.

213
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,875
- WHO MAY I ASK ARE YOU TWO?

214
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,875
- JUST DISPENSE THE MEDICATION
EXACTLY AS YOU SEE ON THAT NOTE.

215
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,541
- HEY, HOW MANY PATIENTS
ARE YOU TREATING?

216
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,875
- TWO.

217
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,541
- YOU'D KILL BOTH OF THEM
WITH THIS MUCH.

218
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,208
- THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR CONCERN.

219
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,875
THE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT WILL
SEND THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

220
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,833
AND DON'T ASK ME WHY.

221
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,500
JUST SHUT UP
AND GIVE ME THE PRESCRIPTION.

222
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,791
- HMM.

223
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:37,500
- I WONDER WHY THINGS HAD
TO END UP THIS WAY.

224
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,750
- I GUESS SAYING SO WON'T
CHANGE ANYTHING NOW.

225
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,416
YOU CAN PICK IT ALL UP
AT WINDOW SIX.

226
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,208
THE ER's ON THE FIRST FLOOR.

227
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,458
YOU SHOULD SWING BY.

228
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,041
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH.

229
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,916
WE'RE GOING TO HEAD BACK
BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN.

230
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,916
COME ON!
- HUH?

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,041
OH, RIGHT.

232
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,250
- ( laughs )

233
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,916
- WHAT THE HELL DO
YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

234
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,125
- SHIT!
- HEY, HOLD IT!

235
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,500
DAMN YOU!
I TOLD YOU TO HOLD IT.

236
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,208
- BIKE THIEF.  BIKE THIEF!

237
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,916
- ( groans )

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,250
HMM?
- LOOK, THERE.

239
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,791
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS TUNE THEM UP
SO THEY SOUND SO LOUD

240
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,791
AND ACT SQUIRRELLY?

241
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,541
- THAT GIRL WE SAW BACK THERE.
- YEAH.

242
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,500
- THAT GIRL
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL,

243
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,291
WHAT KIND OF ILLNESS
DID SHE HAVE?

244
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,041
SHE WOULDN'T TAKE HER EYES
OFF THAT COMPAC DRIVE.

245
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,958
- DESPERATION DISEASE.

246
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,958
- DESPERATION?
WHY DO THEY CALL IT THAT?

247
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,958
- WHO KNOWS?
- WHAT'S THE CONNECTION

248
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,208
BETWEEN DESPERATION DISEASE
AND A COMPAC DRIVE?

249
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,958
- THAT WAS JUST A PLUSH TOY,
NOT A REAL DRIVE.

250
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,500
- A PLUSH TOY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

251
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,958
ASK A DOCTOR OR A SCHOLAR
IF YOU'RE THAT CURIOUS ABOUT IT.

252
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,000
- I REALLY HAVE NO CLUE.

253
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,041
- NO, I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T.

254
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,750
- Renton: THAT'S RIGHT.
DRINK IT REALLY SLOWLY.

255
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,833
- AT LEAST FOR NOW,

256
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,000
I HOPE YOU REST WELL, ANEMONE.

257
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,000
- THAT GIRL.
- HMM?

258
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,000
- I HAD A CRAZY DREAM ABOUT
THAT GIRL

259
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,000
WHILE I WAS INSIDE
THAT HUGE CLOUD.

260
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,000
I HAD NEVER MET HER BEFORE
IN MY LIFE,

261
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,291
BUT I KNOW IT WAS HER.

262
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,833
I NEED FOR YOU TO TELL ME
WHO SHE IS.

263
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,000
I EXPECT THAT YOU CAN'T
ANSWER THAT QUESTION, EITHER.

264
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,875
- WAS SHE THE ONLY PERSON
YOU MET INSIDE YOUR DREAM?

265
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,041
- ( gasps )

266
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,333
- NO, I ALSO SAW EUREKA

267
00:15:55,416 --> 00:16:00,041
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH
FELL FOR TROUBLESOME LADIES.

268
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,208
SO, RENTON...

269
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,041
- HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

270
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:09,250
- DOMINIC.
I'M DOMINIC SOREL.

271
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:20,000
- UGH!  WHAT WAS THAT?
- IT CAN'T BE.

272
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,666
DAMN THEM!  BLASTED!  THEY'RE
GOING OFF ON THEIR OWN AGAIN.

273
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,250
- BEHIND US, TOO.

274
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,083
- Holland: YOU GOT THAT?  TOP
PRIORITY GOES TO THE NIRVASH.

275
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,750
ALL OF US ARE SECOND TO THAT.

276
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,708
DON'T LET THEM LAY
A FINGER ON IT.

277
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,750
- HOLLAND AND THE GANG ARE
ON THEIR WAY HERE.

278
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,541
YOU GOTTA HOLD ON
A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

279
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,750
- OPEN COMMUNICATIONS QUICKLY.

280
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,083
HAVE THEM STOP
THE CANNON BARRAGE NOW.

281
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,958
ANEMONE IS RIGHT
IN THE LINE OF FIRE.

282
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,125
- DAMN IT.

283
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:16,125
STOP SHOOTING!
EUREKA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

284
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,125
EUREKA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

285
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,208
I'LL PROTECT YOU.

286
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,375
I PROMISE I'LL PROTECT YOU!

287
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,916
- ( gasping )

288
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,166
- NIRVASH.

289
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,291
YOU'RE TELLING ME TO GET IN.

290
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,208
- Woman:
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

291
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,166
THE GRAPHS ARE SHOWING
INCREASES, BUT NO SIGNS OF LIFE.

292
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,166
- NO WAY.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

293
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,208
- Woz: TRAPAR RESPONSE
IS SUDDENLY INCREASING.

294
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,166
- SO THE TRAPARS HAVE COME BACK?

295
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,166
- THE SOURCE IS RIGHT WHERE
THE CORALIAN WAS.

296
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,250
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
OH, MY!

297
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,208
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS GOING ON HERE?

298
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,250
- ( wind howling )

299
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,208
- HEY, LEADER!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

300
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,500
- HEY, QUIT ALL THAT YAPPING
AND JUST GET ON THE LFO.

301
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,791
THE TRAPAR WAVES
ARE MAKING THEIR COMEBACK.

302
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,041
- WHAT?
- JEEZ.

303
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,958
THERE ARE THINGS OUT THERE
THAT EVEN I CAN'T EXPLAIN.

304
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,250
- THE BELT MIGHT BE A LITTLE
TIGHT, BUT JUST BEAR WITH ME.

305
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,416
SOON I'LL HAVE YOU BACK
TO HAVE MISS MISCHA.

306
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,416
EUREKA ( gasps )

307
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,625
IT'S JUST LIKE THAT ONE TIME
WHEN WE--

308
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,833
EUREKA,
WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU--

309
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,416
- TypeZERO'S ACCEPTING
SOMEONE WHO'S NOT EUREKA?

310
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,291
COLONEL DEWEY,
THIS IS ALMOST AS IF...

311
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,416
- THE NIRVASH.

312
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,583
LEADER,
CONFIRMING IT'S THE NIRVASH!

313
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,583
IT'S HEADING BACK
TO THE GEKKO.

314
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,583
- ALL SHIPS,
PULL BACK IMMEDIATELY.

315
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,583
WE'RE GOING HOME, TOO.
- Talho: ROGER THAT.

316
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,583
- THIS WORLD IS FULL
OF THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

317
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,583
BUT THERE IS ONE THING

318
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:32,083
THAT I TOTALLY
BELIEVE IN-- ANEMONE.

319
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,791
AND NOW IT APPEARS AS IF WE
FINALLY MET OUR TRUE ENEMY.

320
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,083
OUR TRUE NEMESIS.

321
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,625
- Girl: MAMA!
- Girl #2: MAMA!

322
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,666
- MAMA, DOES YOUR HEAD
STILL HURT?

323
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,083
- WAKE UP.  WAKE UP!
- SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

324
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,625
SHE'LL BE UP AND ABOUT
AND WITH YOU SOON ENOUGH,

325
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,958
SO BE GOOD AND LEAVE
HER TO REST, OKAY?

326
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,583
TAKE HER TO THE MEDICAL ROOM.
- ALL RIGHT.

327
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:02,291
- THE ONLY ONE
TO EXPERIENCE THE ZONE.

328
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,416
- THAT'S AMAZING.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

329
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,583
THAT'S VALUABLE RESEARCH.
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THEM.

330
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,541
- ( children crying )

331
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,500
- PLEASE, TELL ME.
- TELL YOU WHAT?

332
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,083
- WHAT IN THE WORLD IS EUREKA?

333
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,750
- JUST AN ORDINARY GIRL.

334
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,041
- YOU FORCED AN ORDINARY GIRL
ONTO THE BATTLEFIELD

335
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,291
JUST SO SHE COULD GO THROUGH
WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH?

336
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,625
YOU KNEW ALL ALONG,
DIDN'T YOU?

337
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,625
YOU KNEW THAT SHE
WOULD END UP LIKE THIS

338
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,708
IF SHE GOT IN CONTACT
WITH THE CORALIAN.

339
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,000
AND YOU KNEW THAT PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE STRANGE DREAMS

340
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,708
INSIDE THE ZONE.

341
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,500
AND THE NIRVASH--

342
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,625
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
IN YOUR DREAM?

343
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,083
WHAT IN THE WORLD
DID YOU SEE IN THERE?

344
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,708
- IT FELT LIKE I WAS ABLE
TO SEE HER.

345
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,333
MY OLDER SISTER.

346
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,708
IT DIDN'T SEEM REALISTIC.

347
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,875
NOTHING ABOUT EUREKA OR ABOUT
THE NIRVASH SEEMED REAL.

348
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:04,416
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GIRL
IN THE BLACK NIRVASH,

349
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,625
AND ABOUT DOMINIC SOREL
SEEMED UNREAL.

350
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,125
IF EVERYTHING REALLY HAPPENED
THE WAY I REMEMBERED IT,

351
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,875
WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE YOU GONNA
COME FROM TO VISIT ME,

352
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,708
SIS?

353
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,791
- RENTON, WHAT ARE YOU?

354
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,875
WHAT ARE YOU REALLY?

355
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,958
- Renton:
TO BE CONTINUED.

356
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,958
- ( theme music playing )

357
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

358
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,125
- Woman: THE APPEARANCE AND
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE CORALIAN

359
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:04,000
HAS CHISELED OUT THE MYSTERIES
LEFT IN THIS WORLD.

360
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,708
THE MEN LIVING IN THIS WORLD
BRAINSTORM IN ORDER

361
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,916
TO PIECE TOGETHER THE PUZZLE
DISPERSED ACROSS THE GLOBE.
