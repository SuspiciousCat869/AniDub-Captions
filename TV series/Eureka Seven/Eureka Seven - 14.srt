1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,875
- THE SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE
OF THE CORALIAN

4
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,125
MADE A HUGE IMPACT
ON THE SURROUNDING AREA.

5
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,791
ALL THE TRAPAR
DISAPPEARED ALONG WITH IT.

6
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,541
AND IN THE BATTLE THAT ENSUED
RIGHT BEFORE IT HAPPENED,

7
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,875
THE GEKKO WAS HIT
WITH A MISSILE

8
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:58,416
AND LOST THE RIGHT SIDE
VRF NUMBER 2 ENGINE.

9
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,041
BECAUSE OF THE HUGE AMOUNTS
OF REFLECTION FILM

10
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,958
THAT WE LOST
WHEN THE MISSILE STRUCK,

11
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,958
NOT ONLY WERE WE UNABLE
TO INCREASE SPEED,

12
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,291
BUT WE COULDN'T RETURN TO THE
ULTRA-HIGH ALTITUDE LEY LINES.

13
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,416
AND IF ALL THAT WASN'T ENOUGH,
WE WERE RANKED AT THE TOP END

14
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,041
OF OUR COUNTRY'S
MOST WANTED LIST.

15
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,250
HE'S BEEN AT THE TOP
OF THAT LIST FOR A WHILE.

16
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,916
AND SO WE'VE BEEN WANDERING
AROUND WHILE CRUISING

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,916
AT SUPER-LOW ALTITUDES.
THAT'S IT.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,875
SINCE THE INCIDENT, EUREKA HAS
BEEN ASLEEP IN THE MEDICAL ROOM,

19
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,041
RECEIVING TREATMENTS
FROM MISS MISCHA.

20
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,208
BUT SHE FINALLY WOKE UP TODAY,

21
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:34,041
AND WAS ACTUALLY ABLE
TO MANAGE TO SIT HERSELF UP.

22
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,083
MISS MISCHA WAS SURPRISED AT
THE SPEED OF EUREKA'S RECOVERY

23
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,666
AND SAID THAT IN A FEW DAYS
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO RETURN

24
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,458
TO EVERYDAY LIFE
AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.

25
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:48,250
EUREKA, THE GIRL THAT CAME
TO MY HOMETOWN OF BELL FOREST.

26
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:54,041
NOT ONLY IS SHE THE PILOT OF
THE LEGENDARY LFO, THE NIRVASH,

27
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,083
HER NAME IS THE SAME WORD
AS THE ONE SPELLED OUT

28
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,083
IN MY COMPAC DRIVE AS WELL
AS THE DRIVE IN THE NIRVASH.

29
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,083
SHE'S THE GIRL
I'M IN LOVE WITH.

30
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,583
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS

31
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,125
HAD SUDDENLY APPEARED
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

32
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,250
IT'S TRUE THAT SHE'S
A LITTLE ON THE STRANGE SIDE

33
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,083
AND DOESN'T ALWAYS
MAKE SENSE.

34
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,916
BUT SHE'S LIKE AN ANGEL TO ME.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,625
I DIDN'T PANIC WHEN I HEARD
SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF MAETER

36
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,958
AND THE OTHER KIDS.

37
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,291
OF COURSE, THAT'S A LIE,

38
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,833
BUT BACK THEN

39
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,958
I SOMEHOW FELT THAT NOTHING
THAT HAPPENED WAS COINCIDENCE.

40
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,958
THE BELT MIGHT BE A LITTLE
TIGHT, BUT JUST BEAR WITH ME.

41
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,250
SOON I'LL HAVE YOU BACK
TO MISS MISCHA. ( gasps )

42
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,791
EUREKA.

43
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,250
- MAMA, DOES YOUR HEAD
STILL HURT?

44
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,250
- MAMA.
- WAKE UP!  WAKE UP!

45
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,958
- SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

46
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,500
SHE'LL BE UP AND ABOUT
AND WITH YOU SOON ENOUGH,

47
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,833
SO BE GOOD AND LEAVE
HER TO REST, OKAY?

48
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,500
TAKE HER TO THE MEDICAL ROOM.
- ALL RIGHT.

49
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,458
- ( children crying )

50
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,125
- PLEASE, TELL ME.
- TELL YOU WHAT?

51
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,666
- WHAT IN THE WORLD IS EUREKA?

52
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,333
- JUST AN ORDINARY GIRL.

53
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,625
- YOU FORCED AN ORDINARY GIRL
ONTO THE BATTLEFIELD

54
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,833
JUST SO SHE COULD GO THROUGH
WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH?

55
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,416
YOU KNEW ALL ALONG,
DIDN'T YOU?

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,416
YOU KNEW THAT SHE
WOULD END UP LIKE THIS

57
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
IF SHE GOT IN CONTACT
WITH THE CORALIAN.

58
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,791
AND YOU KNEW THAT PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE STRANGE DREAMS

59
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,500
INSIDE THE ZONE.

60
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,291
AND THE NIRVASH--

61
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,416
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
IN YOUR DREAM?

62
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,875
WHAT IN THE WORLD
DID YOU SEE IN THERE?

63
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,500
- IT FELT LIKE I WAS ABLE
TO SEE HER.

64
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,125
MY OLDER SISTER.

65
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,041
SIS, EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW,

66
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,791
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE,

67
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,791
WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?

68
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,791
AND, EUREKA,

69
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:59,291
I WISH I KNEW
WHO IN THE WORLD YOU ARE.

70
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,458
- ( typing )
- MY NAME IS JUST AN OBSERVER.

71
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,458
I STAND IN THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN PHENOMENA

72
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,000
AND MENTAL IMAGES.

73
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,791
ALL SORTS OF NATURAL PHENOMENA
WOULD NEVER BE WRITTEN DOWN

74
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,791
IF SOMEONE WASN'T THERE
TO OBSERVE IT AS IT HAPPENS.

75
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,791
MY NAME IS JUST AN OBSERVER.

76
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,833
ALL SORTS OF PHENOMENA CAN LEAVE
THEIR EXISTENCE TO POSTERITY

77
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,333
ONLY BY BEING OBSERVED
WITH THE EYES OF SOMEONE

78
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,958
IN THE MIDDLE GROUND
SOMEONE SUCH AS MYSELF.

79
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,833
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A CORALIAN IS?

80
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,208
REGARDING THE EXISTENCE THAT
PEOPLE REFER TO AS "CORALIANS,"

81
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,208
THERE ARE VERY FEW WORDS
THAT CAN BE SAID.

82
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:49,250
EVERYONE SPEAKS OF IT AS IF
IT WERE A GHOST OR A MONSTER.

83
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,750
HOWEVER, IN REALITY, IT IS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH EITHER.

84
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,916
WITH THE CORALIAN IN FRONT OF
US, THE OVERWHELMING AWE ROBS US

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,750
OF THE FEW WORDS
WE CAN MUSTER.

86
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,750
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
A CORALIAN IS?

87
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,416
EVEN IF WE WERE GIFTED WITH
LANGUAGE THAT WAS MORE ADVANCED

88
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,791
THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW,

89
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,750
WE WOULD STILL BE UNABLE
TO EXPRESS IN WORDS,

90
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,916
NOR SHARE THE EMOTIONS WE FELT
WHILE IN CONTACT WITH IT.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,708
WE ARE POWERLESS WHEN ARE
IN FRONT OF THE CORALIAN.

92
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,750
- THIS IS 02.  ANOTHER HEAT
SOURCE CONFIRMED.

93
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,416
MULTIPLE TARGETS,
INCREASING IN NUMBER.

94
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,583
02, WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE?
I CAN'T CONFIRM FROM OVER HERE.

95
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,250
02!

96
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,916
- ( alarm blaring )

97
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,041
- WE ARE LIKE ANTS
CRAWLING IN A DESERT.

98
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:49,083
TRYING TO IMAGINE WHAT THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE SKY IS LIKE.

99
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,000
IN THIS WORLD SO FULL OF THOSE
WHO SPEAK ONLY SUPERFICIALLY,

100
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,958
THEREBY SHIELDING US ALL FROM
THE TRUE NATURE OF THEIR BEINGS.

101
00:06:56,041 --> 00:07:00,500
IS IT WORTH ANYTHING TO PLAY
ALONG WITH THE SUPERFICIALITY

102
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,500
AND WEAVE WORDS
OF DESCRIPTION?

103
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,500
IF WE CANNOT GET THE POINT
ACROSS, WE SHOULD TRY HARDER.

104
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,333
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THE EXTRA EFFORT,

105
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:11,000
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THIS PLACE
EMBRACING THE ETERNAL SILENCE.

106
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,333
THIS IS THE EXACT THEORY THEY
HAVE BEEN PROVING ALL THIS TIME.

107
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,458
- ( gasping )

108
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,250
HELP ME, SIS!
HELP ME!

109
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,541
- TO THE LIFTERS
WAITING FOR BIG WAVES,

110
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,541
THE FACT IT EXISTED TOLD THEM
EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED TO KNOW.

111
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,541
EVERYTHING IS SPOKEN
THROUGH EXPERIENCE.

112
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,208
EXPRESSED WITH SIMPLE WORDS

113
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,541
THAT WERE PREPARED
IN ADVANCE FOR THEM.

114
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,041
BUT THEY CHOOSE TO EXPRESS
THEMSELVES WITH THOSE WORDS,

115
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,708
COMBINED WITH THE DEEP TRUTHS
CARRIED BENEATH THE SIMPLICITY

116
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,708
OF WORDS ALONE.
WHAT DO THEY SPEAK OF?

117
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,541
THE TRUTH.

118
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,041
HOWEVER, THE MOST SUPERFICIAL
WORDS ARE PUT TO USE.

119
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,875
SO PEOPLE ARE SURE
TO MOCK THEM

120
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,541
AS CHEAP AND MEANINGLESS.

121
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,541
WHO IN THE WORLD REALLY
KNOWS WHAT TRUTH IS?

122
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,583
TO USE LOFTY LANGUAGE
TO DESCRIBE THE PHENOMENA

123
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,250
THAT JUST HAPPENED IN FRONT
OF THEIR EYES

124
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,625
IS EXACTLY WHAT MAKES THAT
PHENOMENA SEEM HYPERBOLIC.

125
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,583
A PHENOMENON IS WHAT IT IS.
NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS.

126
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,916
TO SPEAK OF A PHENOMENON,

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,250
ONE MUST BECOME
THE PHENOMENON ITSELF.

128
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,250
BUT WE ARE UNABLE TO TRULY
ACCOMPLISH THAT FEAT.

129
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,125
THE PHENOMENON EXISTS
OUTSIDE OF OUR REALM,

130
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,750
AND THERE ARE PHENOMENA
THAT ARE CREATED

131
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,791
FROM A PLACE OTHER
THAN WHERE WE STAND.

132
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,916
( gasps )

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,916
WAIT, THAT'S...

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,375
MY SISTER.

135
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,166
- RENTON.

136
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,625
- ( sniffles )
EUREKA.

137
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,166
- LET'S GO BACK TOGETHER.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,916
- YEAH.

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,458
- LET'S GO BACK TOGETHER.

140
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,958
- THAT'S RIGHT. PHENOMENA
HAPPEN EVEN IF WE'RE NOT AROUND

141
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,375
TO WITNESS THEM, HOWEVER THEY
ALWAYS LEAVE SOMETHING BEHIND

142
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,833
FOR THOSE THAT DO.

143
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,041
WHETHER THAT TURNS OUT TO
BE INJURY TO THE WITNESS,

144
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,333
OR MATERIAL FOR GROWTH.

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,875
THE WAVES SAY NONE
OF THAT REALLY MATTERS.

146
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,750
- NIRVASH,
YOU'RE TELLING ME TO GET IN?

147
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,333
THE INCIDENT THAT ANEMONE AND I
EXPERIENCED IN SOUTH AILESS

148
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,000
PERHAPS IT WAS
A TURNING POINT WITH REGARDS

149
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,000
TO WHAT LIES AHEAD OF US.

150
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,500
THE RENDEZVOUS
BETWEEN THE TWO INDIVIDUALS--

151
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:20,666
ANEMONE AND EUREKA--
TYPE THE END AND typeZERO,

152
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,583
AND THE STRANGE PHENOMENA
WE SAW AT GROUND ZERO

153
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,250
THAT WAS EXCLUDED
FROM THE OFFICIAL REPORT.

154
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,666
THIS IS PROOF
OF WHAT LIEUTENANT COLONEL--

155
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,333
NO, COLONEL DEWEY
HAS BEEN MENTIONING.

156
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,083
BUT THE EXPLOSION AT GROUND ZERO
SHOW THAT SOMEONE OTHER

157
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,000
THAN THE TWO GIRLS WAS PRESENT
AT THE TIME.

158
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,375
I BELIEVE THAT PERSON'S
NAME IS RENTON.

159
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,375
ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION
GATHERED BY DEPARTMENT FOUR,

160
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,791
HE IS SAID TO HAVE JOINED
THE GEKKOSTATE AFTER THE BATTLE

161
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,458
OF BELL FOREST.

162
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,291
THAT FACT IS ALSO OBVIOUS
FROM THE COVER

163
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,375
OF "RAY-OUT" ISSUE 18.

164
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,375
BELL FOREST.  THAT'S RIGHT.

165
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,375
THE SAME PLACE WHERE I WENT
AFTER THE typeZERO

166
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,375
WITH THE IZUMO FLEET,
AND WITNESSED ITS AWAKENING.

167
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,500
COULD ALL OF THESE EVENTS
BE COINCIDENCE?

168
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,833
OR ARE THEY?

169
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,125
- TypeZERO HAS BAILED OUT.

170
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,375
- IT WAS SHOT DOWN?
- DID WE GET IT?

171
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,375
- NO WAY!
- MATTHIEU, PULL BACK.

172
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,333
- WHY SHOULD I?
- JUST GET OUT OF THERE.

173
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,541
IT'S THAT KID.

174
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,083
THAT LITTLE KID WAS SOMEHOW
ABLE TO DELIVER THE AMITA DRIVE

175
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,000
TO THE NIRVASH.
IT'S COMING.

176
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,208
THE SEVEN SWELL.

177
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,916
- ( gasping )
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

178
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,333
- UNKNOWN PARTICLES APPEARING
FROM THE POINT OF IMPACT.

179
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,041
TRAPAR AREA IS INCREASING
IN RANGE.

180
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,291
- THEN THIS IS...

181
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,916
IMPOSSIBLE.

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,791
THEN THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL
THE SEVEN SWELL EFFECT.

183
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,541
- Man: TO LEAVE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS BEHIND

184
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,958
THAT'S CAPABLE
OF CAUSING SUCH AN EVENT.

185
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,958
AND THEN GETTING YOUR SON
INVOLVED IN THIS AS WELL.

186
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,750
YOU BRING GREAT MISFORTUNE
TO YOUR PARENTS.

187
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,041
THIS IS A LIGHT THAT DESTROYS

188
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,208
AND THAT GUIDES US ALL
TO DEATH.

189
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,083
HOWEVER, IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

190
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,916
- Man: ELECTROMAGNETIC
RADIATION INCREASING.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,458
THE TRAPAR FIELD IS REVERSING
POLARITY.

192
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:46,333
NO.  YOU GOTTA ORDER
THE MONSOONO TO RETREAT AT ONCE.

193
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,625
IT'S IN DANGER.

194
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,250
- TypeZERO.

195
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,958
THE VERY FIRST
LFO THAT WAS EVER FOUND.

196
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,875
REPORTS SAY THREE SCIENTISTS
WERE RESPONSIBLE

197
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,291
FOR ITS DISCOVERY.

198
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,000
DR. YAUCHI, DR. DIAMOND

199
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,583
AND ADROC THURSTON,

200
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,666
WHO WOULD LATER BECOME FAMOUS
AS THE MAN WHO SAVED THE WORLD.

201
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,291
SECOND LIEUTENANT DEWEY NOVAK,

202
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,625
HEAD OF THE INTELLIGENCE
DEPARTMENT AT THE TIME

203
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,500
HAD JOINED THEM ALONG
WITH A FEW OF HIS MEN.

204
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,166
IN A WAY THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST
INSTANCE THAT WE THE HUMAN RACE

205
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,250
HAD ENCOUNTERED AND INTERACTED
WITH AN UNKNOWN EXISTENCE.

206
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,875
PROJECT AGEHA CONTINUED ON
AFTER DR. ADROC'S DEATH,

207
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,875
BUT WAS DESTROYED BY SOMETHING
NO ONE HAD EVER IMAGINED.

208
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,083
THE GIRL THAT HAD BEEN
MAINTAINED BY OUR FORCES

209
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:26,083
AS THE SECRET OF ALL SECRETS.
EUREKA.

210
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,541
IT IS STILL A MYSTERY AS
TO WHY SHE WAS ASSIGNED

211
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,375
TO BE A MEMBER OF THE SOF
FIRST MOBILE SQUADRON.

212
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,041
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE.

213
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,125
THE ABDUCTION OF EUREKA
CARRIED OUT BY HOLLAND,

214
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,166
A SOF MEMBER, WAS DONE IN
A VERY INTELLIGENT MANNER,

215
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,125
FAR FROM THE IMAGES ONE HAS
OF THE CHARACTER IN QUESTION.

216
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,666
A BRAND-NEW SHIP,
THE SL-1200 MK2

217
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,250
HAD BEEN BUILT UNDER
TOP SECRET CONDITIONS.

218
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,666
AND HAD NOT EVEN BEEN INITIATED
AT THE TIME OF ITS ROLLOUT.

219
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,666
- Renton:
THIS IS THE GEKKO.

220
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,833
THIS IS THE SHIP HOLLAND USES.

221
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,166
THE REAL GEKKOSTATE SHIP!

222
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,875
- ELEVATOR HAS BEEN ATTACHED
TO THE RUNWAY AND IS SECURE.

223
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,416
ALL SIGNS OF THE KLF SHIPS
AHEAD ARE CONFIRMED GONE.

224
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,916
- Man: STARTING THE FLYWHEEL.

225
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,750
- EVERYONE IS IN SYNC.
PROCEED WITH LAUNCH SEQUENCE.

226
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,000
- ROGER THAT.
LAUNCHING NOW.

227
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,291
- Man: A FACT THAT LATER
BECAME A HUGE PROBLEM.

228
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,583
THE DEVELOPMENT, LET ALONE
CONSTRUCTION OF THIS BATTLESHIP,

229
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,083
HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY
THE HIGHER-UPS OF THE MILITARY.

230
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,333
NOR EVEN BY THE SAGE COMMITTEE.
IN OTHER WORDS,

231
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,750
IT WAS A NEW BATTLESHIP
THAT DID NOT EXIST ON RECORD.

232
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,958
THE ABDUCTION HAD TAKEN
UTMOST ADVANTAGE OF THIS.

233
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,500
THE OPERATION WAS DONE
BY ON-SITE PAPERWORK ALTERATION

234
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,833
AND INFORMATION MANIPULATION.

235
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,958
THEY CREATED A FALSE IMMINENT
INVASION ALERT

236
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,916
AND THE SHIP WAS HANDED
OVER TO THE MANAGER OF THE SOF

237
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,916
IN ORDER FOR THEM
TO EXECUTE AN OPERATION

238
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,333
THAT DID NOT REALLY NEED
TO BE EXECUTED.

239
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:27,291
THE FACTS OF THE ABDUCTION WOULD
BE COVERED UP ON SITE.

240
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,958
AND THUS THE MILITARY OFFICERS
WHO HAD NO MEANS OF KNOWING

241
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,083
OF ITS EXISTENCE, WERE CAUGHT
COMPLETELY OFF-GUARD.

242
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,125
AND IT WAS
ALL BECAUSE OF THAT MAN.

243
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,166
- Woz: THE TRAPAR COUNT
IS SKYROCKETING.

244
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,291
TALHO, WE CAN FLY.
- ALL RIGHT!

245
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,000
- Man:
HOWEVER, THEY WASTED NO TIME

246
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,791
IN PUTTING THE NEW SHIP
INTO THE PUBLIC'S EYE.

247
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,541
THAT OPERATION,
THOUGH STUPID AT FIRST,

248
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,083
SUCCEEDED IN CAUSING
ANGER AGAINST THE MILITARY,

249
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,375
WHICH COULD NOT ADMIT
TO CREATING A SHIP

250
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,125
THAT HAD SUPPOSEDLY BEEN
WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE.

251
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,125
THEY NOT ONLY HID THE FACT THAT
THEY WERE ALL AWOL SOLDIERS,

252
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,875
BUT THEY DEVELOPED
THEIR OWN MASS-MARKET MEDIA

253
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,458
AND USED IT TO DISCLOSE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE CORALIAN

254
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,500
THAT THE MILITARY HAD BEEN
KEEPING SECRET ALL THIS TIME.

255
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,458
BUT BELL FOREST IS ONE THING
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

256
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:34,000
EVEN WITH ALL THE ANALYSIS
OF THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE

257
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,541
THAT HAD BEEN TRACKING THEM
FOR SOME TIME.

258
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,416
WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT
WHY THEY DECIDED

259
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,583
TO STOP BY A TOWER
LIKE THEY DID.

260
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,541
- Woman: IF YOU DO THAT, THE
BARRICADE AROUND THE GEKKO--

261
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,833
- Jurgens: TypeZERO
COMES FIRST.  DO IT!

262
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,958
- OH!
- AN EXPLOSION!

263
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,416
- Renton: WHAT'S GOING ON OUT
THERE? DID THE ELEVATOR EXPLODE?

264
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,541
- NO,
THAT'S JUST A SMOKE SCREEN.

265
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,083
- SMOKE SCREEN?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

266
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,333
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S A LITTLE
TOO LATE.  I'M SORRY.

267
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,708
- WHAT?
- YOU BETTER HOLD ON TIGHT.

268
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,708
- THAT WAS

269
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,833
THE NIRVASH.

270
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,416
- Renton: I CAN'T NAVIGATE
BECAUSE OF THE FALL WE TOOK,

271
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,791
BUT I PATCHED THE HOLE,
AND THE DATA CAN BE SEEN

272
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,458
ON THE MAIN MONITOR,
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

273
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,000
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

274
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,000
IF WE GO AROUND THE TOWERS,
WE MIGHT NOT GET THERE IN TIME.

275
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,833
- IT'S OKAY.
JUST LOOK IN FRONT OF YOU.

276
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,708
WE CAN SLIP THROUGH THE SPACE
BETWEEN THE TWO TOWERS

277
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,958
AND GET AHEAD OF THEM
THAT WAY.

278
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,041
- Jurgens: ALL RIGHT, TIME'S UP.
MISSION COMPLETE.

279
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,791
ALL TROOPS WITHDRAW
FROM THE AREA IMMEDIATELY.

280
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,791
- CAPTAIN, AN UNKNOWN SHIP
HAS APPEARED AT 2:00.

281
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,125
AN UNIDENTIFIED LFO APPROACHING
THE SHIP AT HIGH VELOCITY.

282
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,625
- AN LFO?  YOU'RE SURE
IT'S NOT AN RPG?

283
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,000
- ( alarm blaring )
- WHAT?

284
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,583
- ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES.
- IT'S OKAY.

285
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,041
- ( screaming )

286
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,666
- I SEE, SO THAT IS WHAT
YOU TWO HAVE DECIDED.

287
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,625
FROM THIS TIME FORWARD, EVEN IF
A ROAD OF HARDSHIPS AWAIT YOU,

288
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,000
MAY THERE BE A GLORIOUS LIGHT
SHINING DOWN

289
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,583
ON YOUR DESTINATION.

290
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:57,208
- Man: HOWEVER, SINCE THAT
APPARENTLY MEANINGLESS STOP

291
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,875
AT BELL FOREST, THE typeZERO HAS
BEEN REPORTED TO SHOW

292
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,875
AN AMAZING INCREASE
IN ITS CAPABILITIES.

293
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,083
WHAT REASON DID THEY HAVE
TO STOP BY BELL FOREST?

294
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,875
AND FURTHERMORE, WHAT ABOUT
THAT BOY NAMED RENTON?

295
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,375
EVERYTHING BEGINS
AT THAT LOCATION.

296
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,083
SO WOULD IT BE WORTH MY TIME
TO HEAD OVER THERE

297
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,875
TO BELL FOREST?

298
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,583
- AT THIS POINT, I ONLY NEED YOU
TO CHECK IT OUT.

299
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,416
- I'VE FINALLY MADE UP MY MIND.
- WHAT?

300
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,708
- WE'RE HEADING HERE,
FOR MAINTENANCE REPAIRS

301
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,833
AS WELL AS GETTING
SOME NEW REFLECTION FILM.

302

SITE, HUH?

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,666
AND IT'S ONE THAT CLOSED DOWN
QUITE A LONG TIME AGO.

304
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,625
SO NO CIVILIAN COMPANIES
OR MILITARY UNITS

305
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,583
WILL EVEN THINK ABOUT
CHECKING IT OUT.

THROUGH.

SOUND SO TERRIBLE.

309
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,833

ANOTHER NIGHT.

00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,375
- Stonefield: YOU MEAN THIS IS
THE LAST SONG OF THE SHOW?

314
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,875

HOW ABOUT A FRESH HEAP

315
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,625

316
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,750

COME TO THINK OF IT, I STEPPED
ON SOME DOG CRAP RECENTLY.

318

COME ON, GET ON WITH IT,
OR YOU'LL RUN OUT OF TIME AGAIN.

ALL RIGHT, ANYWAY,
I'VE GOT THE PICK OF THE WEEK.

320
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,625
IT CAME OUT JUST LAST WEEK,
I THINK.

321
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,083
