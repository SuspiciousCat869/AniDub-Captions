11
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:48,291
WE'VE ARRIVED AT THE
RENDEZVOUS POINT, A-557. OVER.

12
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,833
- THIS IS TEOS 01.
COORDINATES CONFIRMED.

13
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,458
ENTRY ANGLE IS GOOD.
PROCEED TO YOUR POSITIONS.

14
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:01,083
- ( humming )

15
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,666
- WHOA! WHOA!

16
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,791
- AMAZING! IT'S LIKE IT'S ALIVE!

17
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,833
- ( giggles ) YEAH,
IT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

18
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,541
SO YOU GUYS NEVER PLAYED AROUND
WITH STUFF LIKE THIS BEFORE?

19
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,666
- NEVER!

20
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,666
- I LIKE IT! DO IT
AGAIN! DO IT AGAIN!

21
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,333
- ( giggles )

22
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,000
OH, ALL RIGHT.

23
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,708
- HURRY! HURRY!

24
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,833
- GIDGET, DO YOU KNOW...

25
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,791
- UH, DO I KNOW WHAT?

26
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,583
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT LOVE IS?
- UH, WHAT?

27
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,208
- THE OTHER DAY YOU MENTIONED
THAT IT MUST BE LOVE.

28
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,750
I DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS.

29
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,333
- HMM, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE...

30
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,666
RIGHT! IT MEANS THAT
YOU "LIKE" SOMEONE.

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,458
- LIKE?

32
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,291
LIKE.

33
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:07,083
BUT WHY? WE WERE
ALWAYS TOGETHER BEFORE!

34
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,500
PLEASE.

35
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,291
YOU WANT RENTON TO BE
IN THE COCKPIT, TOO, DON'T YOU?

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,291
( groans )

37
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,291
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

38
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,291
YOU SHOULDN'T
PUSH YOURSELF SO HARD!

39
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,458
IT'S BETTER IF YOU JUST WAIT!

40
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,916
HOLLAND SAID THAT HE WOULD
BRING HIM BACK, RIGHT?

41
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,750
- MMM-HMM.

42
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,833
- EVEN IF HE WENT TO GEARNUS,
THE NEAREST CITY TO HERE,

43
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,125
IT'LL STILL GOING TO TAKE
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

44
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,500
- GEARNUS?

45
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:41,291
- YEAH. IT'S THE ONLY DECENT
CITY IN THIS WHOLE AREA.

46
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,375
EITHER TO WORK, OR TO LIVE.

47
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,416
- HEY, MAMA,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

48
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,125
- CAN YOU FIX THIS, MAMA?

49
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,083
RENTON MADE THIS
FOR US A WHILE AGO.

50
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,791
I CAN'T GET IT TO MOVE ANYMORE,
NO MATTER WHAT.

51
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,208
- WE WERE THINKING OF
ASKING RENTON TO FIX IT,

52
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,541
BUT HE'S NOT COMING
BACK ANYMORE!

53
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,958
- HEY, MAMA? IS RENTON
EVER COMING BACK HOME?

54
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,250
- ( gasps ) I DON'T KNOW.

55
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,666
- MAYBE HE'S NOT COMING BACK.

56
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,833
- MAURICE.
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

57
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,541
- HE'S COMING BACK, YOU'LL SEE!
- HOW ABOUT IT, MAMA?

58
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,041
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HOLLAND SAID THAT

59
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,833
HE WOULD BRING
HIM BACK HERE.

60
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,208
- REALLY?

61
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,750
- YES. AND HAS HOLLAND EVER
BROKEN A PROMISE TO US?

62
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,708
- YEAH. RIGHT?
- YEAH! A LOT OF TIMES!

63
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,166
- HE BREAKS MORE PROMISES
THAN HE KEEPS.

64
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,958
- THE OTHER DAY HE SAID TO ME
THAT HE WAS GOING TO

65
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,625
BUY ME LOTS AND LOTS
OF NEW CLOTHES!

66
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,416
- IT'S OKAY. 'CAUSE HOLLAND
HAS NEVER ONCE

67
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,625
BROKEN A PROMISE TO YOUR MAMA.

68
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,666
I'M SURE IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

69
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,250
- THIS IS CANTO 03.

70
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,708
WE'VE ARRIVED AT THE
RENDEZVOUS AREA. OVER.

71
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,708
- THIS IS TEOS 01.
YOUR COORDINATES ARE CONFIRMED.

72
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,458
HOLD YOUR POSITION AND STAND BY
FOR ORDERS FROM THE FLAGSHIP.

73
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,500
- ROGER THAT!

74
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,333
- ( beeping )

75
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,125
- HUH? THE 606?

76
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,541
- HOLLAND? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

77
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,166
HE'S SUDDENLY GOING OFF
WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE?

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,833
- THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON
WHY HE COULDN'T TELL US.

79
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,125
TALHO! OPEN UP THE HATCHES!

80
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,208
- WE'RE CHANGING DIRECTION.
- BECAUSE OF THE ARMY?

81
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,000
- NO.
- HMM?

82
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,750
- CHARLES AND RAY ARE COMING.

83
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,250
THEY'VE HOOKED UP
WITH THE STATE ARMY.

84
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,750
HOWEVER, THEY HAVEN'T
COMPLETED THE BARRICADE YET.

85
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,375
RIGHT NOW, I THINK WE CAN BARELY
SQUEEZE BY AT JACKSON 286.

86
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,583
- RIGHT. GOT IT.
- WE GOT TO HURRY.

87
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,750
- AW, DAMMIT.

88
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,833
- WAIT.
- HUH?

89
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,250
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT RENTON?

90
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,250
- A RUNAWAY BOY OR THE GEKKO?

91
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,000
EVEN A LITTLE KID SHOULD
UNDERSTAND WHICH COMES FIRST.

92
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:56,291
THEN, I GUESS
YOU ARE LOWER THAN A LITTLE KID.

93
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,041
- MATTHIEU, WHERE'S EUREKA?

94
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,541
- I, UH...
I THINK SHE'S IN HER ROOM.

95
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,375
- SHE'S NOT HERE.

96
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,000
- ( door opens )

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
- EUREKA.

98
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,083
- ( gasps )

99
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,166
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

100
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,375
- ( groans )

101
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:55,583
- SO, IS THAT RENTON'S?
- HAVE YOU FOUND HIM?

102
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:59,500
- I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE
CHANGING COURSE TO I-709.

103
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,125
- WHAT ABOUT GEARNUS CITY?

104
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,708
- WE CAN REPLENISH
SUPPLIES AT KALZAS.

105
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,000
WE'RE FACING CHARLES NOW.
THOSE GUYS...

106
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,583
- BUT WHY?

107
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,916
- BECAUSE CHARLES AND RAY HAVE
HOOKED UP WITH THE STATE ARMY.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,375
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN!

109
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,291
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GOING TO GEARNUS!

110
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,166
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO GO
AND BRING RENTON BACK

111
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,708
TO THE GEKKO! WHY AREN'T YOU?

112
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,625
- LOOK, IT CAN'T BE HELPED!
THE GEKKO ITSELF IS IN DANGER!

113
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,583
- BUT YOU FACED HUNDREDS
OF MILITARY GUYS

114
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,000
IN THE PAST AND BEAT THEM!

115
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,000
- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
CHARLES HERE!

116
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,958
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

117
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,208
( exhales )

118
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,041
- DO YOU REALLY HATE RENTON
THAT MUCH, HOLLAND?

119
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,958
- I DON'T HATE HIM. IT'S JUST
THAT HE ACTS LIKE A BRAT.

120
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,208
- THAT'S WHY
YOU LEFT HIM BEHIND?

121
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,500
THAT'S WHY YOU PUNCHED HIM?
THAT'S WHY YOU KICKED HIM, TOO?

122
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,125
- THAT'S NOT IT. I JUST...

123
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,083
I...

124
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,625
YOU WERE MORE IMPORTANT
TO ME THAN RENTON, THAT'S ALL.

125
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,916
- WELL, I...

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,750
I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT WAY.

127
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,000
- ( door closes )

128
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,916
- STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.
HUH, HOW REASSURING.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,166
- BUT WITH HIM AS THE COMMANDER
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

130
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,416
- HEY, HE'LL HEAR THAT!

131
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
- I AM THE FLEET COMMANDER,
MY NAME IS MOALUTDAR.

132
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,166
- LONG TIME NO SEE.

133
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,541
WE ARE HERE WITH
THE FEDERAL ARMY RESERVE UNIT,

134
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,125
CHARLES BEAMS REPORTING.

135
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,750
- IT'S TRULY A CATASTROPHE.

136
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,083
IF IT WAS ONLY 20 KILOMETERS
MORE TO THE SOUTH,

137
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,416
KALZAS CITY'S WOULD'VE
HAD THE PROBLEM.

138
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,750
SO, IS HE REALLY
GOING TO SHOW UP, BEAMS?

139
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,750
- THE BARRICADE
I ASKED YOU TO MAKE,

140
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,958
HAS A SLIGHT OPENING IN IT.

141
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,500
ON THE JACKSON MAP, PAGE 286.

142
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,708
- WON'T HE TRY TO
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT?

143
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,458
- WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE HIM TAKE IT.

144
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,000
I KNOW THIS GUY WELL,
HE WOULDN'T MISS THIS CHANCE.

145
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,791
THERE'S NO QUESTION,
HE'LL SHOW UP ALRIGHT.

146
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:16,208
- HEADING I-709. WE'RE GOING TO
GET AWAY FROM THIS AIRSPACE.

147
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,000
- YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THIS?

148
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,958
- IT'S ONLY A MOMENTARY EXIT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

149
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,250
- I'LL ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME.
YOU'RE REALLY SURE ABOUT THIS?

150
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,083
- YEAH. I'M REALLY SURE.

151
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,125
- NIRVASH WON'T MOVE FOR ME.

152
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,833
AND I CAN'T COUNT ON HOLLAND.

153
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,541
THAT MEANS I...
I HAVE TO GO MYSELF!

154
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,875
RENTON WAS THE ONE THAT
ALWAYS STARTED THINGS OFF.

155
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:46,916
BUT THIS TIME...

156
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,666
( gasps )

157
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,166
- HELLO. CARE FOR TEA?

158
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,166
- PLEASE! PLEASE, WAIT FOR ME,
RENTON! WAIT FOR ME!

159
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,875
- JACKSON 286.

160
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,875
JUST LIKE CHARLES SAID.

161
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,583
WAIT FOR ME, EUREKA!
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

162
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,125
- HEY, HOLD ON
A SECOND, KIDDIES.

163
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,458
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY REF BOARD,

164
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,791
I HAD IT RIGHT HERE?

165
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,541
- NO, I DON'T KNOW.
- I DON'T KNOW, ETHER.

166
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,583
- ME NEITHER!

167
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,833
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

168
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:43,916
( gasps )

169
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,750
- ( all gasp )

170
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,166
- IT'S PUKEY! IT'S PUKEY!

171
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,583
IT'S RENTON!

172
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,666
- BOOSTERS AT FULL IGNITION,
MAXIMUM THROTTLE!

173
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,375
KEEP GOING UNTIL
WE'RE OUT OF HERE!

174
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,791
- ROGER THAT.

175
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,041
- HEY, HAP,
YOU GOT TO STAY ON TOP OF

176
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,416
THE TRAPAR VALUE READINGS!

177
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,708
- YEAH, I KNOW.

178
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,583
WHAT ABOUT LAUNCH
PREPARATIONS FOR THE LFO'S?

179
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,125
- NO NEED! EVERYONE
JUST CONCENTRATE

180
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,583
ON THE GEKKO ESCAPING
FROM HERE AT FULL SPEED!

181
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,416
- WELL, THIS IS GOOD TIMING.

182
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,750
LOOK WHO JUST WANDERED
BACK IN, HOLLAND!

183
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,916
- WHO KNOWS WHERE THE HELL
HE'S BEEN ALL THIS TIME.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,625
- HEY!
- RENTON!

185
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,833
- THE RETURN OF
THE PRODIGAL SON!

186
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,583
- GO ON, APOLOGIZE TO HIM.
YOU CAUSED HIM A LOT OF TROUBLE!

187
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,333
- HEY, MATTHIEU.

188
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,583
WHAT IS HE DOING UP HERE?

189
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,333
TAKE HIM TO THE BACK.
WE'RE BUSY RIGHT NOW.

190
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,916
- DON'T BEG FOR THIS,
DO IT YOURSELF.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,125
OR ELSE YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING.

192
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,083
TELL ME MR. ADROC,

193
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,458
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE ALL OF US SEEKING HERE?

194
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,041
- FLAGSHIP COMMAND
CALLING ALL SHIPS!

195
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,708
THIS FLEET HAS ENTERED
THE SEA OF RAINBOW CLOUDS.

196
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,583
50 KILOMETERS TO
OPERATIONAL DESTINATION.

197
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,708
- HOLLAND, I FOUND
OUT THAT THE GEKKO

198
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,125
IS ABOUT TO COME UNDER...

199
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,458
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
BY COMING BACK HERE LIKE THIS?

200
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,333
I DON'T REMEMBER
GIVING YOU PERMISSION

201
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,291
TO COME BACK ABOARD THIS SHIP!

202
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,958
WELL?

203
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,708
- COME ON, HOLLAND,
LET'S BE HONEST, OKAY?

204
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,833
YOU KNOW THAT RENTON IS...

205
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,083
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

206
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,458
- I DIDN'T COME BACK.
- HUH?

207
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,833
- I'M NOT INTERESTED
ONE BIT IN BECOMING

208
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,000
A CREW MEMBER
HERE ON THE GEKKO AGAIN.

209
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,916
I'M NOT EVEN HERE BECAUSE
I THINK THAT, I MIGHT BENEFIT.

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,083
I CAME FOR...

211
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,625
EUREKA.

212
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,416
I CAME HERE JUST TO SEE EUREKA!

213
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
- HUH.

214
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,541
- ( whistles )

215
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,833
- ( gasps )

216
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,916
- SO, YOU'VE LEARNED
HOW TO TALK BIG.

217
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,666
- ( chuckles )

218
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,708
- 30 MORE KILOMETERS
TO GEARNUS CITY.

219
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,166
IF I CAN RIDE WELL, I CAN MAKE
IT THERE IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS.

220
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,541
A SWARM OF SKY FISH.

221
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,416
PRETTY.

222
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,916
( gasps ) IT'S THE STATE ARMY!

223
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,625
- HEY, CHARLES, COME IN.
CHARLES!

224
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,208
- YEAH, YEAH.
I CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE, RAY.

225
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,541
- I'M GOING IN.
YOU BETTER PREPARE FOR LAUNCH!

226
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,791
- HEY, THE OPERATION ISN'T
SCHEDULED TO START YET.

227
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,333
WE DON'T NEED TO HURRY.

228
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,083
- BUT EUREKA IS MOVING TOWARD US
AND SHE'S ALL BY HERSELF!

229
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,833
- NOW, THAT'S
A GOOD REASON TO HURRY.

230
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,375
- GEKKO! CAN YOU HEAR ME, GEKKO?

231
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,250
- WHAT? WHAT WAS
THAT COMMUNICATION?

232
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,833
HELLO? COME IN.

233
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,916
- A-307, A BIG FLEET OF THE
STATE ARMY APPROACHING. HURRY!

234
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,458
- HELLO? HELLO?
- WHO WAS IT?

235
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:55,041
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
THE NOISE WAS REALLY BAD.

236
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,916
BUT IT'S A VOICE
I'M SURE I RECOGNIZE.

237
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,583
( gasps )

238
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,333
I THINK IT COULD BE EUREKA.

239
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,375
- Both: EUREKA?

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,541
- THEY'RE SHOOTING AT ME!

241
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,916
THE COMMUNICATOR!

242
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,208
( gasps )

243
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,833
- THE STATE ARMY?

244
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,666
- YEAH! THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION!

245
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,041
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

246
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,000
THE RADAR DIDN'T SHOW
ANY SIGNS OF A LARGE FLEET!

247
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,541
- BUT, SHE SAID THAT
THE FLEET WAS AT A-307!

248
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,625
- THE SEA OF RAINBOW CLOUDS!

249
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,916
THE COORDINATES
ARE AT THE CENTER OF

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,708
THE SEA OF RAINBOW CLOUDS!

251
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,250
BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE TRAPAR
TURBULENCE IN THAT AREA,

252
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:51,083
THE RADAR SIGNAL IS REFLECTING
BACK TO US IN A DEFUSED MANOR,

253
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,333
- HE'S USING NATURAL COMPAC
INTERFERENCE TO HIDE.

254
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,375
( grunts ) DAMN CHARLES!

255
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,708
- I'VE GOT SOMETHING!

256
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,458
- I DON'T GET IT.
WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS--?

257
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,666
- GIVE ME A SECOND!

258
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,875
- Both: AN OUTSIDE LINE?

259
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,958
- IT'S EUREKA!

260
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,125
- IT'S IN THE SEA OF CLOUDS.

261
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,000
SHE'S USING A
POCKET COMMUNICATOR.

262
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:16,625
- OH! THE REF BOARD I LEFT
IN THE DINING HALL!

263
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,041
EUREKA WAS PROBABLY
THE ONE THAT TOOK IT.

264
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,791
- ( grunts )

265
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,583
YOU WAIT TILL NOW
TO REALIZE THAT?

266
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,708
HEY! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

267
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,541
- Charles: RAY,
DON'T DO ANYTHING HARSH

268
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,208
BEFORE I DO, OKAY!

269
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,791
- Ray: I WAS
JUST INTIMIDATING HER.

270
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,333
I WASN'T GOING TO
HIT HER OR ANYTHING.

271
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,333
- Charles: WELL THEN, HOW ABOUT
WE PLAY OUR USUAL GAME?

272
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,833
- ( giggles ) OH, CHARLES,
I LOVE YOU!

273
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,583
- EUREKA! EUREKA!
EUREKA! EUREKA!

274
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,250
( panting )

275
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,500
NIRVASH.

276
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,208
NIRVASH, LET'S GO!

277
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,833
- HOLD STILL, WILL YA?

278
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,750
- WHERE IS HE?

279
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,291
( gasps )

280
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:31,833
( gasps )

281
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,875
- WHAT... WHAT WAS THAT?

282
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,291
HEY, RAY! THE MERMAID
HAS JUMPED INTO THE BUCKET!

283
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,250
LET'S KEEP HER THAT WAY.
MAKE SURE THE HATCH IS OPEN.

284
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,291
- ROGER!

285
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,708
- ( grunting )

286
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,791
( groans )

287
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,041
NO!

288
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,041
( screams )

289
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,625
- OH, NO!

290
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,125
GODDAMN IT!

291
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:18,291
- IN, IN THE END, I COULDN'T
EVEN KEEP ONE PROMISE.

292
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,333
I'M SORRY, MAETER,
LINCK, MAURICE.

293
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,541
I'M SORRY, RENTON!

294
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,458
- TEOS 01 HAS JUST
BEEN SHOT DOWN!

295
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,625
- WHO DID IT?
WHERE DID THEY SHOOT FROM?

296
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,625
- FROM JACKSON 103!
I PRETTY SURE IT'S THE GEKKO!

297
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,791
- THIS IS NOT THE WAY
WE PLANNED IT!

298
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,166
ALL SHIPS PREPARE
FOR BATTLE IMMEDIATELY!

299
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,250
- WE'LL USE THE SEA
OF CLOUDS AS A SHIELD!

300
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,083
TALHO! MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THOSE
BOOSTERS IGNITED, ALRIGHT?

301
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,625
- THEY CAN BE FIRED UP
AT ANY TIME!

302
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,958
- HAP! CONTINUE WITH
THE LAUNCH PREP!

303
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,416
TELL MATTHIEU AND HILDA
TO GO AND PICK UP EUREKA!

304
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:57,875
- ROGER THAT!

305
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,500
- CHANGE IN OPERATIONS!

306
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,208
THE GEKKO HAS APPEARED
IN JACKSON 103!

307
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,000
BEAMS, GET TO YOUR POSITION!

308
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,791
- HANG ON. JUST A LITTLE LONGER!

309
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:14,916
WHAT WAS THAT?

310
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,375
A WHITE LFO?

311
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,708
- EUREKA!

312
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,333
EUREKA!

313
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,958
- ( gasps ) RENTON!

314
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,541
( gasps )

315
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,250
( groans )

316
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,291
- BEAMS! THE GEKKO IS
ATTACKING US! DO YOU HEAR ME?

317
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,333
- RENTON.

318
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,416
- CHARLES, I...

319
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT I
WISH WE HAD A CHILD.

320
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,708
- YEAH, OF COURSE I KNOW.

321
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,333
I KNOW ALL OF YOUR WISHES.
NOW LET'S GO!

322
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,458
- RENTON! I WAS ABLE
TO DO IT BECAUSE OF YOU.

323
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,833
IT CAN'T BE ANYONE BUT YOU.

324
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,291
RENTON, I...

325
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,208
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I...

326
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,541
( gasping )

327
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,916
- YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY
TO DO ALL THIS BY YOURSELF.

328
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,916
AND I'M REAL GLAD.

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,083
- I... I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ALL THIS TIME.

330
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,125
- RENTON.
- ME, TOO.

331
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,625
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU.

332
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,083
SO MUCH I WANT TO SHARE.

333
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,750
- WHY? WHY CAN'T I
CATCH UP TO THEM?

334
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,416
THE SPECS OF THIS SHIP SHOULD
BE MUCH BETTER THAN THEIRS!

335
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,583
WHAT'S GOING ON?

336
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,833
- IT'S NO GOOD! THE GEKKO'S
MOVED INTO THE SEA OF CLOUDS!

337
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,125
AND I CAN'T GET THEIR POSITION!

338
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,666
- THERE'S NO NEED TO PANIC!

339
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,083
WE'RE DEALING WITH ONE SHIP!
THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL LOSE!

340
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,916
COMMUNICATIONS! WHAT THE HELL
IS BEAMS DOING?

341
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,125
- DAMMIT, WHERE DID THEY GO?
I'M TIRED OF THIS HIDE AND SEEK!

342
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,125
- RENTON, THAT'S...

343
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,958
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

344
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,458
I'M NOT GOING TO KILL ANYONE!

345
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,666
BUT I'LL MAKE IT
SO THEY CAN'T FIGHT.

346
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,333
- ROLF 01'S RIGHT ARM
HAS BEEN DESTROYED!

347
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,625
AND 03!

348
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,958
AND NOW 02!
THEY'RE ALL DEFENSELESS!

349
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,583
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND!
WHY JUST THE WEAPONS?

350
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,166
- FLYING ALL AROUND
THE BATTLEFIELD

351
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,166
AND SHOWING EVERYONE MERCY.

352
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,375
THAT WILL GET YOU KILLED.
YOU'RE WAY TOO KIND.

353
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,333
- WELCOME BACK.
- HUH?

354
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,791
- THAT'S WHAT NIRVASH
IS SAYING TO YOU.

355
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,250
- HMM, I'M BACK.

356
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,000
SORRY TO LEAVE YOU ALL ALONE.

357
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,083
- ( gasps )

358
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,958
RENTON, YOU JUST SAID "ALONE".

359
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,500
ABOUT THE NIRVASH!

360
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,333
HEY, RENTON.
LET'S DO IT TOGETHER!

361
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,458
- HMM!

362
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,125
- ALL FLEET COMMUNICATION
IS DOWN!

363
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,416
THE REFLECTION FILMS ON
THE SHIPS ARE ALL PEELING OFF!

364
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,083
- WHAT THE HELL DID
THE TYPE ZERO DO?

365
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,791
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

366
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,958
IT'S LIKE A GIANT RAINBOW.

367
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,125
RETREAT! HURRY!

368
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,875
- HOLLAND, YOU THINK
THAT THIS IS...

369
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,375
- IT CAN'T BE.

370
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,208
THAT ISN'T A SEVEN SWELL.

371
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,875
THAT TWERP,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S HIM.

372
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:14,416
I DON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT.
I CAN'T ADMIT IT!

373
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,541
WHAT IS THIS FEELING
THAT I'M HAVING?

374
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,083
- BOY, THEY SURE KNOW HOW
TO RETREAT AT FULL SPEED.

375
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,833
- THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.
WE SHOULD RETREAT, TOO.

376
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,166
- CHARLES! REALLY?

377
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,916
- COME ON, RAY. WE'RE GOING TO
PULL BACK FOR NOW.

378
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,208
- ROGER!

379
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,500
- THE SON OF THE KING.

380
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,166
DEWEY, IS THAT WHAT
ALL THIS MEANS?

381
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,083
- Eureka: HEY, RENTON.

382
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,041
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT

383
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,083
ALL SORTS OF THINGS
WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

384
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,208
- Renton: I MET ALL SORTS
OF PEOPLE OUT THERE.

385
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,583
PEOPLE WHO WERE STRANGE,
PEOPLE WHO WERE AMAZING,

386
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,625
PEOPLE WHO WERE SAD.

387
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:51,291
AND I REALIZED SOMETHING.

388
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,458
I REALIZED WHAT WAS
IMPORTANT TO ME.

389
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,125
- I THINK I REALIZED IT, TOO.

390
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,916
I MEAN, WHAT'S DEAR TO ME.

391
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,458
- ( both gasp )

392
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:03,500
- SKY FISH!
- THEY REALLY CAME BACK.

393
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,625
HEY, RENTON?

394
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,708
YOU KNOW, I'VE CHANGED.

395
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,291
PEOPLE SAY I'VE CHANGED!

396
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,541
GIDGET AND NIRVASH
BOTH SAID THAT

397
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,125
I'M DIFFERENT FROM
THE WAY I WAS BEFORE.

398
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,500
- I'VE CHANGED A LOT
FROM WHO I WAS, TOO.

399
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,666
EVER SINCE THAT DAY
WHEN YOU FELL INTO MY HOME.

400
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,625
- TELL ME,
I WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT IT.

401
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,583
- AND I WANT TO HEAR THE WAYS
THAT YOU'VE CHANGED, EUREKA.

402
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,250
- ( laughing )

403
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,916
I SEE. THAT'S WHAT
IT WAS ABOUT.

404
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,166
I UNDERSTAND NOW, DIANE.

405
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,250
WHAT IT IS
I SHOULD BE DOING NOW!

406
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,958
- WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP.

407
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:50,875
NEVER.

408
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,083
- Both: TO BE CONTINUED!

409
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,000
- Ray: THOSE THAT FIGHT
LAY THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE,

410
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,875
FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE
THEY WISH TO PROTECT.

411
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,666
IN THAT BATTLE,
WHAT WILL THE ONE

412
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,041
WITH FREEDOM ON HIS HANDS,
SHOW THE BOY?

413
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,750
NEXT EPISODE, "HELTER SKELTER."
