11
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,166
- Eureka: DO WE REALLY
HAVE TO GO BACK?

12
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,666
I DON'T WANT TO GO
INTO THAT CAVE AGAIN.

13
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,000
- IT'S MUCH SAFER
INSIDE THE GEKKO,

14
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,166
THAN IT COULD POSSIBLY BE
AROUND THIS PLACE.

15
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,375
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM.

16
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,583
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
CAUSING YOUR CONDITION,

17
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,083
AND SO I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW I SHOULD TREAT IT.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,875
RIGHT NOW,
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS...

19
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:14,041
PLEASE, TRY TO BEAR
WITH IT, EUREKA.

20
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,000
- NO GOOD.
PUKEY-FACE WON'T COME OUT.

21
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,125
- CRYBABY!

22
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,625
- ( knocking on door )

23
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,708
- Mischa: RENTON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,416
WE'VE GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE GEKKO.

25
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,958
RENTON! RENTON!

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,875
- THOSE THAT PUNCH,
THOSE THAT GIVE UP.

27
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,416
THOSE THAT LEAVE ME BEHIND.
EVERYONE IS SELFISH.

28
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,708
EVERYONE SAYS WHAT THEY WANT,

29
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:01,416
AND THEN DESTROY
MY FAITH IN THEM.

30
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,791
SAME GOES FOR EUREKA.

31
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,625
SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO
REALIZE HOW I FEEL

32
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,916
WHEN I PILOT THE NIRVASH
ALL BY MYSELF.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,166
I'M ONLY PILOTING
THE NIRVASH FOR HER SAKE.

34
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,750
BUT, EUREKA DOESN'T BELIEVE ME.

35
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,166
- ( car approaching )

36
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,541
- ( banging on door )

37
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,083
- RENTON, I'M TELLING YOU,

38
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,666
HURRY UP AND GET
BACK ON THE GEKKO!

39
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,416
- WHAT AM I DOING?

40
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,916
IT'S NO TIME TO BE
THINKING STUFF LIKE THIS.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,333
- UH...

42
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,041
- RENTON, LISTEN TO ME.

43
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,833
NEXT TIME YOU TAKE
YOUR TIME LIKE THAT,

44
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,833
WE GONNA LEAVE YOU
BEHIND, YOU GOT IT?

45
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,250
HAP, HOW'S THE GEKKO?

46
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,583
- Hap: DOING WELL.

47
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,625
IT TOOK A WHILE
TO INSTALL THE VRFS

48
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,250
THAT WE BOUGHT
FROM THE JUNK SHOP,

49
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,750
BUT THERE ARE NO GLITCHES
IN THE TIME SCHEDULE.

50
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,875
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GETTING
THE OF LAST FILMS SECURED.

51
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:51,708
BUT THANKS TO ALL OF THAT,
OUR FATIGUE IS ALSO AT ITS PEAK.

52
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,166
I THINK THAT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM

53
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,250
THAN THE LACK OF
TRAPARS IN THIS AREA.

54
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,541
- RENTON!

55
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,791
WE'VE GOT IT HERE.

56
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,291
YOU CAN GO PREPARE MEALS
FOR EVERYBODY.

57
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,000
- O-OKAY.

58
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,708
- ( whimpering )

59
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HURRY UP AND GET GOING.

60
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,625
YOU DO REALIZE WHAT KIND OF
SITUATION WE'RE IN NOW, RIGHT?

61
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,666
HEY, HAP. WHERE'S HOLLAND?

62
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,791
- UH? OH, YEAH.

63
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,041
I SAW HIM HEAD TOWARDS
THE JUMP CATAPULT.

64
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,291
HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO GO READ THE WAVES.

65
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,458
- ( wind blowing )

66
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,333
- ( door opening )

67
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,416
- Talho: DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?
- Holland: BELIEVE WHO?

68
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,375
- Talho: YOU KNOW.
THAT DIGGER NAMED BRITTANY.

69
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,750
THAT THE SCUB DOWN THERE
IS STILL ALIVE,

70
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,916
AND THAT THERE'S A
MASSIVE TRAPAR SPRING

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,416
DEEP UNDERNEATH THIS CAVE.

72
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,625
- Holland: WHO KNOWS?

73
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,625
- Talho: WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING ON DOING NOW?

74
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,333
- NO IFS, ANDS OR BUTS.

75
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,875
WE GOTTA GO OUT
AND CRUSH THEM.

76
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,875
- AND THE NIRVASH?

77
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,958
WHAT ABOUT IT?
ARE YOU SENDING IT OUT?

78
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,291
- WITH EUREKA IN THE
CONDITION THAT SHE'S IN...

79
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,791
- YOU ARE FULLY AWARE
THAT RENTON IS GOOD ENOUGH

80
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,250
TO COVER US IN COMBAT, RIGHT?

81
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,375
- JUST SHUT UP!

82
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,083
- DO YOU WANT ME TO
SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD?

83
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,333
DON'T RUN AWAY.

84
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,916
- ( scoffs )

85
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,375
- ( gasping )

86
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,416
PLEASE, WAIT.

87
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,500
I'M SORRY.

88
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,125
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.

89
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:07,541
DO ALL OF YOU HATE ME NOW,
AS MUCH AS THE NIRVASH DOES?

90
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,291
- UH...

91
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,458
- ( crying )

92
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,875
- WHAT'S UP, YOU GUYS?
WHAT'S WRONG?

93
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,041
- ( grunting softly )

94
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,166
( screams )

95
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,750
- WHY DID YOU ASK ME?

96
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,958
ALL RIGHT.

97
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,000
EUREKA, MAETER AND THE KIDS

98
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,041
WANT TO SIT AND EAT A PIZZA
TOGETHER WITH YOU.

99
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,416
UH, YOU DON'T MIND, RIGHT?

100
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,458
IS IT ALL RIGHT
FOR ME TO COME IN?

101
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,500
EUREKA?

102
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,416
- Eureka: WHAT SHOULD I DO?

103
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,708
IT SEEMS THE KIDS
HATE ME NOW, TOO

104
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,916
I WISH I KNEW WHY.

105
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,708
WHY DID THINGS END UP THIS WAY?

106
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,833
I GUESS,
IT'S BECAUSE I'VE CHANGED.

107
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,625
IF THAT'S THE REASON,

108
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,000
I WISH I HADN'T CHANGED AT ALL.

109
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,375
- ( machine starting )

110
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,875
- FINAL SHEET APPLICATION
IS COMPLETE.

111
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,583
ALL THE WORK IS NOW DONE.

112
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,000
- ( all sighing )

113
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,958
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
WE ARE FINISHED.

114
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,125
- THE PROBLEM IS,
WE HAVE NO TRAPARS,

115
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,625
WE JUST CAN'T
LIFT OFF FROM HERE.

116
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,166
- ( tires screeching )

117
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,208
- CAN IT BE? EUREKA?

118
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,500
- Holland: IT HEADED TOWARDS
THE DEEP END OF THE CAVE?

119
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,833
WHAT THE HELL FOR?

120
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,291
- LIKE I WOULD KNOW.
I DIDN'T SEND IT THERE.

121
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,291
- HEY, DO YOU THINK
RENTON'S IN IT?

122
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,875
- OF COURSE HE IS.

123
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,375
EUREKA WOULD NEVER DO
SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT.

124
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,541
- Renton: ALL RIGHT,
YOU GUYS WAIT HERE, OKAY?

125
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,291
I'LL FIND SOME WAY
TO BRING EUREKA

126
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,500
AND THE NIRVASH BACK HERE.

127
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,666
- BUT, THE TRAPARS ARE DENSE
DEEP IN THE CAVE.

128
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,333
SO, IT'S DANGEROUS, RIGHT?

129
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,750
- I'LL BE FINE. I'M SURE
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

130
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,041
- Pilot: ENEMY SHIP
HAS CROSSED THE PERIMETER.

131
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,041
IT'S PROBABLY A SCOUT SHIP.

132
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,916
- WELL, THEY'RE FINALLY HERE.

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,541
- ( beeping )
- WHAT'S WRONG?

134
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,083
- NEW DATA.

135
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,583
IT'S THE INTERFERENCE NUMBERS,
THEY'RE INCREASING RAPIDLY.

136
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,875
- THE TOTAL NUMBER IS...
A HUNDRED?

137
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,375
- WHAT THE...

138
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,625
THE MILITARY MUST HAVE DECIDED
TO FIGHT US WITH QUANTITY.

139
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,750
- (screaming)

140
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,333
- IT'S JUST THE FIRST WAVE.

141
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,541
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY
FOR ALL SHIPS.

142
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,750
ALL LFOS, PREPARE FOR LAUNCH,
AND BRACE FOR THE SECOND ATTACK.

143
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,125
- Man: THE OBSERVED QUANTA
LEVEL HAS DROPPED.

144
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,500
WE SEE NO SIGNS OF THE GEKKO
LAUNCHING FROM FAC51.

145
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,000
- EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED.

146
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,541
THEY CAN'T ESCAPE AS LONG
AS THERE ARE NO TRAPARS.

147
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,250
- PREPARE TO FIRE
THE NEXT SHELL.

148
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,583
- YES, SIR!

149
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,958
ATTENTION ALL AUTOMATIC
CANNONS AND SQUADS,

150
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,750
CHARLIE, BACKWORM AND ECHO,
OPEN FIRE!

151
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,750
- Holland: WOZ, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY ARE OUT THERE?

152
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,791
- Woz: I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
THE EXACT NUMBER

153
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,791
BECAUSE THEY DESTROYED THE
SENSORS THAT WE PUT OUT THERE.

154
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,333
BUT, WE STILL DON'T SHOW ANY
ATTACKS FROM THEIR KLF SQUADS.

155
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,458
IT LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT BOARDS
THEY CAN'T APPROACH US, EITHER.

156
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,583
- HEY, HAP, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE TRAPARS?

157
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,500
- Hap: THE NUMBERS
ARE STILL REALLY LOW.

158
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,958
THEY'LL SHOOT US DOWN
IF WE DO A NORMAL LAUNCH.

159
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,250
- KEN-GOH, REMOVE THE SAFETY
LOCKS FROM ALL WEAPONS.

160
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,291
- WAIT, DO YOU REALIZE HOW
OUT-GUNNED WE ARE RIGHT NOW?

161
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,083
- ALL WE NEED IS A DISTRACTION.

162
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,791
TALHO, WE'RE GOING TO USE
THE BOOSTERS TO LAUNCH US.

163
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,666
- START THE COUNTDOWN.
- Talho: HOLD ON JUST A SECOND.

164
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,291
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

165
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ABOUT THE NIRVASH?

166
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,875
BY THE WAY, RENTON'S IN IT
RIGHT NOW, IN CASE YOU FORGOT.

167
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,583
- I NEED TO
CONCENTRATE MORE ON

168
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,291
OURS AND EUREKA'S SURVIVAL
THAN THE NIRVASH'S.

169
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,666
- AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

170
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,666
- IF EUREKA'S SAFE,
WE CAN GO GET THE NIRVASH LATER.

171
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,791
- THAT'S NOT IT!

172
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,916
I'M TALKING ABOUT...

173
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,083
ISN'T RENTON THE YOUNGER
BROTHER OF YOU-KNOW-WHO?

174
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,250
- Gidget: WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

175
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,541
- GIDGET, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

176
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,833
- WELL, MISCHA JUST SAID
EUREKA IS MISSING.

177
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,625
- WHAT?
- ( gasping )

178
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,750
- THAT'S RIGHT. THE KIDS
WERE IN THE WAREHOUSE,

179
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,208
SO I ASKED THEM WHAT HAPPENED.

180
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,625
IT SEEMS THAT EUREKA IS THE ONE
WHO TOOK THE NIRVASH.

181
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,750
- ( gasps )
- THEN, WHERE'D RENTON GO?

182
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,833
- Mischa: THEY SAID HE WENT
TO GO AFTER EUREKA.

183
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,875
- HOLLAND!

184
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,333
- WE'LL WAIT, UNTIL THE
LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT.

185
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,583
- ROGER THAT.

186
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,041
- ALL HANDS, STAND BY IN
EMERGENCY LAUNCH MODE.

187
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,625
- WHAT?!

188
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,000
- KEEP THE SAFETY LOCKS ON ALL
WEAPONS SYSTEMS IN OFF POSITION.

189
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,416
START THE
BOOSTER FLYWHEELS NOW.

190
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,000
AND ONCE THAT'S ALL DONE,

191
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,916
WE'LL WAIT AS LONG AS WE CAN
FOR RENTON TO FIND EUREKA.

192
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,000
- Renton: THE TEMPERATURE
TOPPED THIRTY DEGREES.

193
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,041
AND I'VE JUST PASSED BELOW
EIGHT HUNDRED METERS.

194
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,875
EUREKA, WHERE ARE YOU? EUREKA!

195
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,291
- ( gasps )

196
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,625
- WHAT IS THAT?

197
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,500
( gasps )

198
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,875
- RENTON.
- ( gasps )

199
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,916
THAT WAS CLOSE.

200
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,375
HUH?

201
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,875
THE NIRVASH.

202
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,791
- THEY JUST HIT
THE JUMP CATAPULT.

203
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,750
- NOT GOOD. AT THE RATE
THINGS ARE GOING,

204
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,833
IT'LL BE IMPOSSIBLE,
EVEN WITH THE BOOSTERS.

205
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,166
HOLLAND, WHAT DO WE DO?

206
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,500
- Renton: THE AMITA DRIVE
HAS BEEN TAKEN OFF.

207
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,208
WHO THE WORLD WOULD DO THAT?

208
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,583
EUREKA!

209
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,000
EUREKA, WHERE ARE YOU?

210
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,541
EUREKA! EUREKA!

211
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,625
WHERE ARE YOU, EUREKA...

212
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,916
( gasps )

213
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,458
EUREKA?

214
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I WAS LOOKING FOR A BOOK.

215
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,458
I HAVE TO FIND IT.
I HAVE TO FIND THE BOOK.

216
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,708
IF I DON'T HURRY,
THE BUS WILL LEAVE WITHOUT ME.

217
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,791
IF I DON'T HURRY,
THE SUN WILL SET.

218
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,916
I HAVE TO HURRY
AND FIND MY BOOK.

219
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,791
IF I DON'T HURRY,
THE NIGHT WILL MELT ME AWAY.

220
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,291
I FOUND IT.

221
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,458
(gasps)

222
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,416
THIS IS ME,
A BOOK WITHOUT WORDS.

223
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,208
A BOOK WITH NOTHING
WRITTEN IN IT.

224
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,625
THIS IS ME.

225
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,250
THERE IS NOTHING TO ME.

226
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,166
I AM NOTHING AT ALL.

227
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,541
I COULDN'T FIND WHO I REALLY AM.

228
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:27,291
MELTING, MELTING.
I'M MELTING AWAY.

229
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,458
SCARED. I'M SCARED.

230
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,583
SOMEONE... SOMEONE, HELP ME.

231
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,916
PLEASE, SOMEONE...
SOMEONE HELP ME.

232
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,291
HELP ME, RENTON.

233
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,166
- (grunts)

234
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,125
- I'M SORRY.

235
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,625
I TOOK THE AMITA DRIVE,

236
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,458
AND THIS IS WHAT I DESERVE FOR
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

237
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,541
- EUREKA!

238
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,750
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS
GOING TO BECOME OF ME?

239
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,625
- LET'S GO BACK.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE GEKKO NOW.

240
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,125
- I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

241
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,625
- I'M SO SORRY.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

242
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,416
I PROMISE...
I PROMISE I'LL PROTECT YOU.

243
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,666
- OH, NO. WE'LL BE BURIED
ALIVE IF WE DON'T MOVE.

244
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,708
- BUT WE...
- Holland: LAUNCH.

245
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,541
GEKKO WILL DO A
HIGH-SPEED LAUNCH.

246
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,041
PREPARE TO FIRE THE BOOSTERS!

247
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,250
- BUT, WHAT ABOUT RENTON AND...
- LAUNCH.

248
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,750
HURRY UP, TALHO.

249
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,458
- HOLLAND.

250
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,708
- Renton: I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

251
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,416
I'M SORRY.

252
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,875
IT'S ME WHO NEEDS
TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

253
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,208
IT'S ME WHO WAS
ACTING SO SELFISH.

254
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,541
YOU WERE DESPERATELY
TRYING, EUREKA.

255
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,375
YOU WERE DESPERATELY
REACHING OUT,

256
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,333
WHEN YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
ENTRUSTING ME WITH THE NIRVASH.

257
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,000
BUT I JUST DIDN'T...
I COULDN'T.

258
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,000
PLEASE, NIRVASH,
PLEASE HELP ME!

259
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:15,291
GIVE ME POWER! GIVE ME THE
POWER TO PROTECT EUREKA!

260
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,958
- Man: BOOSTERS AND
FLYWHEEL ARE STABLE.

261
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,291
COMMENCING THE COUNTDOWN.

262
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,958
- ALL CREW MEMBERS,
STRAP YOURSELVES IN NOW.

263
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,333
- ALL CIRCUITS ARE STABLE.

264
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,208
WE'RE ABLE TO FIRE
THE MAIN CANNONS NOW.

265
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,041
- Hap: EVERYTHING IS
IN POSITION.

266
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,333
WE'RE READY FOR LA--

267
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,875
HEY, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

268
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,000
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

269
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,750
- THE TRAPAR VALUES
ARE SKYROCKETING.

270
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,958
- HOW IS THAT?

271
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:46,000
- THERE IS A GIANT WAVE,
RIGHT BEHIND US.

272
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,375
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

273
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,083
- WAIT, THIS IS

274
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,833
A TRAPAR SOURCE STREAM?

275
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,916
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

276
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,000
EUREKA, YOU'VE GOT TO ANSWER ME!

277
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,833
COME ON, ANSWER ME!

278
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,708
- Woz: A SHOCK WAVE
HAS BEEN CREATED

279
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,416
WITH THE SECOND TRAPAR WAVE!

280
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,083
OH, NO, IT'S A BIG ONE.

281
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,000
- FIRE THE BOOSTERS.
EMERGENCY LAUNCH!

282
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,375
- Officer: WHAT? WHAT IS THIS?

283
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,416
RETREAT. ALL SHIPS, RETREAT.

284
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,750
- EVERYBODY PULL BACK
TO THE DEFENSIVE LINE.

285
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,041
- ROGER!

286
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,666
- Hap: I'VE CAUGHT TRAPARS
IN THE VRF.

287
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,166
THE SHIP IS STABLE.

288
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,583
WE'LL BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO
THE LEY-LINE IN 30 SECONDS.

289
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,375
- OH, HOLLAND.

290
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,833
- Woz: I'VE GOT AN LFO SIGNAL
FROM RIGHT ABOVE FAC51.

291
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,125
- WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

292
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,708
THE NIRVASH IS STILL...

293
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,458
CAN IT BE?

294
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:15,083
THAT THE HUGE TRAPAR WAVE
WE JUST SAW WAS A SEVEN SWELL?

295
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,416
WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN?

296
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,166
- Renton: I DON' T KNOW.

297
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,708
- YOU WERE THERE,
WEREN'T YOU?

298
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,125
- I DON'T KNOW! I WISH I DID.

299
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,083
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON, TOO.

300
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,583
- I WON'T ACCEPT THAT.

301
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,791
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

302
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,375
WHAT DID YOU DO TO EUREKA?

303
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,375
HOW DID YOU COME BACK
FROM DOWN THERE?

304
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,791
- I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
TO ANY OF THAT.

305
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,541
BY THE TIME I FOUND EUREKA,
SHE WAS ALREADY LIKE THIS.

306
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,833
- AND THEN EUREKA PASSED
OUT IN THE MIDDLE AND--

307
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:55,875
- WHAT?

308
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,708
THEN, YOU DID THIS
ALL BY YOURSELF?

309
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,708
- YES, BUT ONLY
BECAUSE EUREKA...

310
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,041
BECAUSE EUREKA ENDED UP
IN THAT CONDITION.

311
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,416
- LISTEN UP, RENTON.

312
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,625
YOU ARE NOT TO GET
ON THE NIRVASH ANYMORE.

313
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,666
GOT IT? AND IF YOU TELL ANYONE
