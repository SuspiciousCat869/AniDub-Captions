1
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,625
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,541
- Man: I UNDERSTAND, CAPTAIN.

3
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,041
BUT EVEN THOUGH
WE ARE IN CHARGE

4
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,041
OF KEEPING THE PEACE
THROUGHOUT BELLFOREST,

5
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,041
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
TO DO MORE THAN DECLARE AN ALERT

6
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,500
WITHOUT ALL
OF THE PROPER DOCUMENTATION.

7
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,875
BESIDES, A FORCED LANDING
AT AN AIRPORT

8
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,000
COUPLED WITH THE PHYSICAL
SHUTDOWN OF THE RUNWAY

9
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,250
WOULD BE TOO MUCH.
NOW IT'S TRUE

10
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,458
THAT THE STRANGE PHENOMENON
IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN,

11
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,291
BUT EVEN THE AIR FORCE,
IF IT'S TOO RECKLESS,

12
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,500
WILL HAVE A LOT OF PRESSURE
COMING DOWN ON THEM

13
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,916
FROM THE AVIATION CORPORATION.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,333
- Jurgens:
YES, THAT MAY BE TRUE!

15
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,333
BUT NOW WE KNOW
THAT THE GEKKOSTATE,

16
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,291
THE GROUP
THAT WE BELIEVE IS CONNECTED

17
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,250
TO THAT STRANGE PHENOMENON
WE SAW EARLIER,

18
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,083
HAS PARKED THEIR SHIP,
THE GEKKO,

19
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,291
DOWN IN PUBLIC DOCK #23.

20
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,208
- I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND

21
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,625
HOW THIS WILL AFFECT
THE REPUTATION

22
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,875
OF A PUBLIC CORPORATION.

23
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,291
- I DON'T CARE!

24
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,625
THIS IS NO TIME TO BE WORRYING
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK!

25
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,416
GOT IT?  WE'VE ALREADY LOST
TWO K.L.F. SQUADRONS OUT THERE!

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,541
WE JUST CAN'T ALLOW THEM
TO DO AS THEY PLEASE

27
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,041
ANY MORE
THAN WE ALREADY HAVE.

28
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,708
- YES, BUT WHAT THE GEKKOSTATE
HAS SUBMITTED

29
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,416
IS AN OFFICIALLY
CERTIFIED DOCUMENT

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,166
CREATED
BY THE FEDERATION GOVERNMENT.

31
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,708
I SAW IT MYSELF.

32
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,875
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
I CAN JUST IGNORE, CAPTAIN.

33
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,208
- ARGH!
I'LL WAIT 10 MINUTES.

34
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,916
IF YOU CAN'T
GET THOSE GATES OPEN BY THEN,

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,541
WE'LL USE PHYSICAL FORCE
TO RIP THEM OPEN, GOT IT?!

36
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,541
- OH MY.

37
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,916
HOW MANY SHIPS ARE WAITING
FOR CLEARANCE TO LAND?

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,583
- WELL, RIGHT NOW
THERE ARE THREE CRAFTS

39
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,041
IN HOLDING PATTERNS.

40
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,875
HOWEVER,
IF WE HAVE ANY MORE DELAYS,

41
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,583
THE CORPORATION'S GONNA WANT
TO KNOW WHY.

42
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,625
- WE JUST CAN'T WAIT.

43
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,083
THE GEKKOSTATE, HUH?
JEEZ.

44
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,583
THEY'VE CERTAINLY BROUGHT US
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

45
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,125
- ( radio static )

46
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,250
- Holland: SO HOW ARE THINGS
OVER ON YOUR END?

47
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,541
- Woman: THE PITS!

48
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,625
WHILE YOU GUYS
WERE LOUNGING AROUND OVER THERE,

49
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,041
THE RUNWAY
HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN ON US.

50
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,708
ON TOP OF THAT, THEY PROHIBITED
USE OF THE ELEVATORS.

51
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,833
ALL THE PAPERWORK HILDA
FORGED FOR US IS NOW USELESS!

52
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,291
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

53
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

54
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,125
- WAIT A MINUTE!
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

55
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,666
- YOU KNOW, THIS ALL HAPPENED
BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WERE COMING

56
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,541
TO THIS GODFORSAKEN PLACE.

57
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,791
GET OFF YOUR BUTT
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!

58
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,458
- HEY, DON'T YELL AT ME.
GIVE ME A SEC.

59
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,000
I'LL CALL BACK
IN THREE MINUTES.

60
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,166
- HUH?  HOLLAND!

61
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,125
- OH, JEEZ.
WHAT'S SHE WORKED UP ABOUT?

62
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,916
- Eureka: HOLLAND?
- HMM?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,416
- WE SHOULD HURRY UP
AND GET BACK TO THE GEKKO.

64
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,916
- NO.  LOOK LIKE
WE'RE A LITTLE TOO LATE.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,750
SEEMS WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE A FORCEFUL EXIT.

66
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,875
HUH?

67
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,500
- FORCEFUL EXIT?
THEN WHAT?

68
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,500
- I SEE.

69
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,666
WAIT HERE FOR A BIT.
I'M GONNA READ THE WAVES.

70
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,666
- WAIT.
- HUH?

71
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,416
- WHY DON'T YOU LET ME DO IT,
HOLLAND?

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,000
LET ME READ THE WAVES.

73
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,833
- BUT YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU
WEREN'T FEELING WELL LATELY.

74
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,166
- I'M ALL RIGHT NOW,
SOMEHOW.

75
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,500
I'M REALLY FEELING
A LOT BETTER TODAY.

76
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,041
RIGHT?
- HUH?

77
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,291
OH, WAIT! HOLD ON A MINUTE.

78
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,250
- IMPOSSIBLE.

79
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,916
IT JUST CAN'T BE.

80
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,416
- ( birds chirping )

81
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,041
- LIKE THIS.

82
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,250
YOU JUST RAISE YOUR HAND
UP TOWARD THE SKY.

83
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,750
NOW YOU TRY IT.

84
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,791
- HUH?

85
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,750
- HURRY.

86
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,958
- UM, OKAY.

87
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,833
HEY, CAN YOU REALLY READ
THE WAVES JUST BY DOING THIS?

88
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,250
- STAY QUIET.

89
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,416
- OH, SORRY.

90
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,041
- IT'S HERE.

91
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,208
- ( gasps )

92
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,541
- YOU REALLY ARE AMUSING,
AREN'T YOU?

93
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,250
- UH, I'M AMUSING?

94
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,458
- MM-HMM.
THE WAY YOU ACT,

95
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,500
IT'S JUST LIKE
YOU'RE ONE OF MY CHILDREN.

96
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,500
I'LL GO INFORM HOLLAND
ABOUT THIS.

97
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,791
- WAIT, I'M LIKE HER CHILDREN?

98
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,250
OH NO, NOT THAT!

99
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,416
( grunting )

100
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,166
THERE IT IS.

101
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,750
"MAN'S HORIZON SERIES #107,"
"THE RIGHT RENDEZVOUS."

102
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,333
"THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR
WHEN YOU MEET A WONDERFUL GIRL.

103
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,833
IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

104
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,333
TO MAKE A FRIENDLY
FIRST IMPRESSION.

105
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,500
HOWEVER, IF THAT IMPRESSION
COMES OFF AS TOO FRIENDLY,

106
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,750
FOR EXAMPLE,
LIKE A SIBLING OR A COUSIN,

107
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,000
IT'LL BE DIFFICULT
FOR A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP

108
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,500
TO GROW OUT OF IT.

109
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,833
AT TIMES AS A MAN, YOU MUST
BEHAVE LIKE A WILD ANIMAL."

110
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,500
OH NO!

111
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,833
THAT'S WHAT SHE THINKS.
- YOU'RE JUST LIKE A KID.

112
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,333
- I'M SURE OF IT!
- YOU'RE A CHILD.

113
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,791
- SHE THINKS I'M LIKE A KID!

114
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,625
AT THIS RATE--
- YOU'RE SO CHILDISH.

115
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,916
- AT THIS RATE-- NO!
THIS IS NO GOOD!

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,375
BAD-- THIS IS VERY BAD.

117
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,958
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

118
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,000
AT THIS RATE,
SHE'S GONNA TREAT ME LIKE A KID.

119
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,166
AM I GONNA HAVE TO JUST
LIVE WITH IT LIKE THAT?

120
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,833
BAD BAD!
THIS IS VERY BAD.

121
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,666
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T EVEN ASKED HER
WHAT HER NAME IS.

122
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,583
OH, THIS IS SO BAD,
I CAN'T STAND IT!

123
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,541
- I'M EUREKA.
- THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT!

124
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,833
HER NAME IS EUREKA.

125
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,625
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?
THAT'S A GOOD NAME.

126
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,875
HMM?
- YOU ASKED MY NAME, RIGHT?

127
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,791
MY NAME'S EUREKA.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

128
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,791
- MY-- MY NAME IS RENTON.

129
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,791
I'M RENTON THURSTON.

130
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,166
WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU HEARD ALL THAT?

131
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,375
UH, WHAT'S WRONG?

132
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,416
- YOU REALLY ARE AMUSING,
YOU KNOW THAT?

133
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,875
- HUH?

134
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,958
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE
I LAST MET SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

135
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,208
- OH.

136
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,583
- YOU REMIND ME
OF SOMEONE, RENTON--

137
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,375
A PERSON THAT I ONCE MET.

138
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,583
YOU'RE REALLY AN AWFUL LOT
LIKE THAT PERSON.

139
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,166
SHALL WE?
- HUH?

140
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,166
- IF WE DON'T HURRY,
THE WAVE WILL PASS US BY.

141
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,500
- ( wind blowing )
- Woman: WHAT?!

142
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,291
YOU'RE REALLY
GONNA DO A DROP-IN?

143
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,083
- Holland: I TOLD YOU,
DIDN'T I? THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.

144
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,125
- AW, JEEZ! THAT REALLY
MESSES UP THE CHASSIS.

145
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,250
BESIDES, IF THE AMITA DRIVE
GOES OUT OF CONTROL

146
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,750
LIKE IT DID BEFORE--

147
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,541
- LEADER? WE'RE DONE
HACKING INTO THE SYSTEM--

148
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,666
- HEY, DON'T INTERRUPT,
YOU FREAK!

149
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,250
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- HUH?

150
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,250
- UNLESS
THERE'S SOME CATASTROPHE,

151
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,083
THE AMITA DRIVE
WON'T GO OUT OF CONTROL.

152
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,041
EVEN IF IT DOES,
WE'LL SURVIVE.

153
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,958
AFTER ALL,
WE'RE GONNA BE PUTTING

154
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,666
ADROC'S SON ABOARD THE NIRVASH.

155
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,000
- HUH?
- WAIT A MINUTE!

156
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,416
ARE YOU SURE
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT?

157
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,875
- YEAH.
GOT KIND OF A HUNCH ABOUT IT.

158
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,875
- ( whirring )

159
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,875
- Holland: DON'T WORRY.
ONCE WE'RE UNDERWAY,

160
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,875
EUREKA WILL OPERATE
ALL THE CONTROLS.

161
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,916
AND I'VE TOLD HER
ALL ABOUT OUR MISSION.

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,916
- UM, OKAY.

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,833
- ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS SIT THERE

164
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,875
AND MAKE SURE
THE AMITA DRIVE'S WORKING RIGHT.

165
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,083
IF YOU SPOT SOMETHING STRANGE
IN THE AMITA DRIVE,

166
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,083
YOU'RE TO DISCONNECT IT
IMMEDIATELY.

167
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,166
GOT THAT?  YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT INSTALLED THIS THING HERE.

168
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,041
SO THIS IS YOUR MACHINE NOW.

169
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,958
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO CONTROL IT,

170
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,000
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR WHAT YOU DID,

171
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,791
RIGHT TILL THE END.
UNDERSTAND?

172
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,916
GOOD.  I'LL SEE YOU THERE.
- WAIT A MINUTE!

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,375
- HUH?
- JUST GIVE ME--

174
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,916
JUST GIVE ME THREE MINUTES,
OKAY?

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,916
- Grandfather:
I'M CURIOUS, SON.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,375
WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED?

177
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,250
PEACE FOR MANKIND?

178
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,416
AND NOW,
IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN,

179
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,416
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT VERY
PEACE AWAY FROM YOUR OWN FAMILY?

180
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,333
- ( crunching )
- HMM?

181
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,958
RENTON.
- ( chirping )

182
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,166
- GRANDPA, I'M SORRY.

183
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,625
UNTIL NOW,
I THINK I'VE BEEN RUNNING AWAY.

184
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,958
- AWAY FROM WHAT?

185
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,166
- FROM THINGS
THAT I HAVE TO DO

186
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,750
AND THINGS I THOUGHT
WERE WEIGHING ME DOWN.

187
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,666
SO I'M GONNA
STOP RUNNING AWAY NOW.

188
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,291
I'M GONNA STOP.

189
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,458
I'M NOT GONNA RUN ANYMORE.

190
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,666
I'M GONNA GO
GET SOME TRAINING.

191
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,708
I WANT TO TRAIN SO THAT SOMEDAY
I CAN BECOME A MECHANIC,

192
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,875
JUST LIKE YOU, GRANDPA.

193
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,833
- GOOD.

194
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,166
YOU'VE COME TO YOUR SENSES.

195
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,166
IT'LL BE TOUGH.

196
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,541
- I KNOW.

197
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,958
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.

198
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,083
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M YOUR GRANDSON.

199
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,333
- IDIOT.

200
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,500
IT'S NOT NICE
TO MAKE AN OLD MAN CRY.

201
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,458
- GRANDPA.

202
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,458
- Holland:
YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND?

203
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,250
- Renton: YES.
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

204
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,833
SO PLEASE LET ME--
LET ME TRAIN ABOARD THE GEKKO!

205
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,708
- I SEE.

206
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,958
- ( grunting )

207
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:19,708
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER, THEN.

208
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,166
- SEE?
HOLLAND IS VERY MYSTERIOUS.

209
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,166
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.

210
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,500
BUT THAT'S WHY
I BELIEVE IN HIM.

211
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,541
- Grandfather:
I ALWAYS HAD A STRONG FEELING

212
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,291
THAT YOU WOULD EVENTUALLY
TELL ME THAT SOMEDAY.

213
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,208
SO IN ANTICIPATION
OF THAT DAY TO COME,

214
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,708
I DECIDED THAT I WOULD
SECRETLY BUY YOU A SET OF TOOL--

215
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,750
HUH?

216
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,000
RENTON!
WHAT'S THAT FOOL DOING?

217
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,583
IMPOSSIBLE!
- ( whirring )

218
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,916
- ( straining )

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,708
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE'RE GOING AWAY FROM THE TOWER!

220
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,000
- Eureka: IT'S ALL RIGHT.

221
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- IN SEVEN MINUTES,

222
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,791
THE TRAPAR WAVE CURRENTS

223
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,958
FLOWING THROUGH
HERE WILL CHANGE.

224
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,166
IT'S FASTER TO GET TO IT
FROM THE EAST

225
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,291
RATHER THAN HEADING
DIRECTLY NORTH FROM HERE.

226
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,916
THE WAVES TOLD ME THAT.

227
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,125
- YOU MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT
THE TRAPAR WAVES ARE LIKE?

228
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,125
( grunting )

229
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,375
- AMAZING!

230
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,916
THIS IS AMAZING.

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,958
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
THE NIRVASH WAS THIS HAPPY.

232
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,333
- ( grunting )

233
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,791
WAIT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- LET'S GO!

234
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,375
- HUH?
- COME ON, NIRVASH, LET'S DANCE!

235
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,083
- Renton:
WAIT!  WAIT A MINUTE!

236
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,916
- OKAY, IT'S TIME.

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,708
ANY ANSWER FROM THE MILITARY?
- NONE, SIR.

238
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,666
- ALL RIGHT, THEN ADVANCE
THE MON-SOONO SQUADRON.

239
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,625
WE MUST GET THEM BEFORE
THEY LAUNCH THE typeZERO.

240
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,250
IT'S IMPERATIVE.
- Man: CAPTAIN!

241
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,416
- YES, PRIVATE?

242
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,958
- WE HAVE
AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

243
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,708
COMING IN FROM 5:00!
- WHAT?

244
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,291
- APPROACHING FAST
AT 135 KNOTS.

245
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,708
CONFIRMING DATA NOW.

246
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,541
CONFIRMATION COMPLETE.

247
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,875
THE UNKNOWN CHIP
IS THE typeZERO.

248
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:20,875
- WHAT?!

249
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,916
- Renton: AMAZING.

250
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,500
I'M SHOWING AN AIR-FORCE CARRIER
ALONG WITH THREE K.L.F.s.

251
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,916
IF WE GO UP AGAINST
SOMETHING LIKE THAT--

252
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,708
HEY, ISN'T ANYONE
GOING TO BACK US UP?!

253
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,000
- NO, I DON'T NEED ANY BACKUP.
THEY WOULD JUST GET IN MY WAY.

254
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,250
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

255
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,250
YOU'RE GONNA JUST DIVE IN
ALL BY YOURSELF?

256
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,250
- IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY.

257
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,541
SEE? THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
THAT I CAN REALLY BELIEVE IN,

258
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,333
OTHER THAN THE NIRVASH
AND HOLLAND.

259
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,708
- ( beeping )

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,208
- ( all screaming )

261
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,416
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE THEY THINKING?

262
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,250
ARE THEY TRYING
TO ANNIHILATE THIS AIRPORT?

263
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,750
- Man: COMMANDER!
- WHAT IS IT?

264
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,125
- COMMANDER, THE MAIN
PROCESSING UNIT HAS BEEN HACKED.

265
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,541
COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE UNIT
HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER

266
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:20,583
BY THE SHIP THAT'S HEADING
TOWARDS THE APRON FROM DOCK 23.

267
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:26,708
- ARGH! WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
SEND THE MON-SOONO TO ATTACK!

268
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,375
- BUT, CAPTAIN,
IF YOU DO THAT,

269
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,000
THE BARRICADE
AROUND THE GEKKO WILL--

270
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,708
- typeZERO COMES FIRST!
DO IT!

271
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,125
- ( alarm sounding )

272
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,916
- AH!
- AN EXPLOSION!

273
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,916
- Renton: WHAT--
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,625
DID THE ELEVATOR EXPLODE?
- Eureka: NO.

275
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,958
THAT'S JUST A SMOKESCREEN.
- A SMOKESCREEN?

276
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,208
- THAT'S RIGHT.

277
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,750
BUT I'M AFRAID
IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE.

278
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,208
I'M SORRY.
- WHAT?

279
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,875
- YOU'D BETTER HOLD ON TIGHT.

280
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,875
- Man: WE'VE LOST
VERMILLION SQUADRON!

281
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,916
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,500
- Renton: AMAZING.

283
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,416
THOSE THREE K.L.F.s WENT DOWN
IN JUST SECONDS.

284
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
- Eureka: I'M GLAD.
- HUH?

285
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,708
- IT LOOKS
LIKE IT'S ALL RIGHT--

286
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,000
THE GEKKO.

287
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,791
- THIS IS THE GEKKO?

288
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,916
THIS IS THE SHIP
HOLLAND USES.

289
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,541
THE REAL GEKKOSTATE SHIP!

290
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,375
- MAIN ELEVATOR
HAS BEEN ATTACHED

291
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,833
TO THE RUNWAY AND IS SECURE.

292
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,541
- ALL SIGNS OF K.L.F. SHIPS
AHEAD ARE CONFIRMED GONE.

293
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,041
- Man: STARTING THE FLYWHEEL.

294
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,875
- EVERYONE IS IN SYNCH.
PROCEED WITH LAUNCH SEQUENCE.

295
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,083
- ROGER THAT!
LAUNCHING NOW.

296
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,208
- OH NO,
THEY'RE TRYING TO RUSH THROUGH!

297
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,958
EVASIVE ACTION!
- NO YOU DON'T!

298
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,625
PORTSIDE BOOSTERS,
EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF.

299
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,833
GO!

300
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,916
- IT'S FALLING!
- IT'S FALLING?

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,375
- WHY IS IT FALLING?

302
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,666
- ( beeping )
- NOT YET, NOT YET.

303
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,375
NOW!

304
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,333
- HEY!  AIR FLOW ALONE
WON'T KEEP US UP!

305
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,500
- WE CAN'T HOLD UP
AGAINST THE WING PRESSURE.

306
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,708
WE HAVE TO GET THE TRAPAR
UNDER THE WING SOON!

307
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,166
- YES, I KNOW THAT,
BUT NOT UNTIL HOLLAND SAYS.

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,916
- ALL RIGHT.
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

309
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,000
- Man: THE TRAPAR COUNT
IS SKYROCKETING!

310
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,166
TALHO, WE CAN FLY!
- ALL RIGHT!

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,166
- Renton: AMAZING.
- Eureka: THIS IS THE GEKKO...

312
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,541
SO THIS IS HOW THE GEKKOSTATE
FIGHTS ITS BATTLES.

313
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,458
- ...YOU CAN COME BACK...
- THEY'RE AWESOME!

314
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,125
- WE'RE GOING NOW, RENTON.

315
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,875
- WHAT?
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

316
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,625
- BACK TO THE GEKKO.

317
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,250
- Man: IT LOOKS THEY'VE RETURNED
TO THE LEY LINE

318
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,916
USING THE WESTERLY WINDS.

319
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,916
- CAN THEY
ACTUALLY SEE THE TRAPAR?

320
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

321
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,875
- SHOULD WE GO AFTER THEM?

322
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,875
- THERE'S NO WAY FOR US
TO CATCH UP.

323
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,875
I HAVE TO REPORT THIS.

324
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,208
- INCOMING TRANSMISSION FROM THE
BELLFOREST MILITARY COMMANDER.

325
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,208
- Jurgens: THREE K.L.F.
SQUADRONS WERE TAKEN DOWN.

326
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,583
ON TOP OF THAT, THEY ALL WENT
DOWN FIGHTING JUST ONE L.F.O.

327
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,333
HOW COULD THIS BE?

328
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,541
- OH, CAPTAIN.

329
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:01,416
- I KNOW.
I'M GOING TO BE RELIEVED.

330
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,833
WELL, I HOPE THAT'S ALL
THAT THEY'LL DO TO ME.

331
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,541
- WOW!  AMAZING.

332
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,791
WHAT IS THAT?

333
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,208
- Eureka: DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
- HUH?

334
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,541
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, EUREKA?
REMEMBER WHAT?

335
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,916
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

336
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,791
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER THEN.

337
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,750
THAT'S OKAY.

338
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,833
- I GUESS MAYBE
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME TIME

339
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,625
AND GIVEN THIS WHOLE SITUATION
A LOT MORE THOUGHT.

340
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,791
AND I REALLY SHOULD HAVE TRIED
TO IMAGINE

341
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,125
EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF LIFE
I WAS GETTING MYSELF INTO

342
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,041
AND WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCES
WERE WAITING AHEAD FOR ME.

343
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:59,000
BUT, SIS, I WAS JUST SO HAPPY
ABOUT FINALLY FINDING SOMETHING

344
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,458
I COULD REALLY LIVE FOR.

345
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,541
AND I WAS SO ENGROSSED
BY THE CLEAR EYES

346
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,333
OF THE GIRL
WHO WAS NEXT TO ME.

347
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,500
I USED TO FEEL
LIKE IT WAS WRONG

348
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,125
TO EVEN BE THINKING
ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING.

349
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,833
- THERE GOES LITTLE REN
ON HIS WAY.

350
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,833
GUESS IT RUNS
IN THE FAMILY, HUH?

351
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,208
- YES, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

352
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,833
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.

353
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,291
- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

354
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,708
HE SURE TAKES AFTER
HIS PREDECESSORS.

355
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,000
HE'S GOT YOUR BLOOD,
OLD MAN.

356
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,666
- I'LL THANK YOU NOT TO DIG UP
STORIES FROM THE PAST.

357
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,958
I THOUGHT I HAD RAISED THEM
SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T

358
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,208
GO THROUGH THE HARDSHIPS
THAT I WENT THROUGH.

359
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,041
YES, ADROC, DIANE,
NOW RENTON--

360
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,541
THEY ALL LEFT.
THEY TURNED OUT LIKE ME

361
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,541
IN THE STRANGEST OF WAYS.

362
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,708
( laughs ) IT'S TOO BAD.
- HUH?

363
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,166
- ADROC AND DIANE
NEVER CAME BACK.

364
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,708
BUT I KNOW IN MY HEART
THAT RENTON WILL.

365
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,708
EVEN IF HE LOSES HIS WAY,
RENTON HAS HIS FATHER

366
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,916
LOOKING OVER HIM
RIGHT NOW.

367
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,500
AND HE WILL GUIDE HIM HOME.

368
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,500
"I WANT TO BECOME A MECHANIC
JUST LIKE YOU, GRANDPA."

369
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,375
THAT WAS WHAT YOU SAID TO ME,
RENTON.

370
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,875
WHEN YOU COME BACK,
I'M GOING TO WORK YOU VERY HARD.

371
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,625
THIS IS JUST A DETOUR
BEFORE YOUR TRAINING TO COME.

372
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,916
- ( sighs )

373
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,083
UM, I, UH...
- Girl: I SEE.

374
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,166
SO THIS IS THE KID
THAT MADE EUREKA LAUGH, HUH?

375
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,333
- HE'S REALLY NOT
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

376
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,375
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE LOOKS SO NORMAL.

377
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,500
- Boy: SAY SOMETHING FUNNY.
- HUH?

378
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,791
- JEEZ, MAN,
HE'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

379
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,791
- Man:
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH PERSONALITY.

380
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,750
- HMM.

381
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,333
YOU KNOW, YOUR CLOTHES
ARE TOTALLY OUT OF STYLE.

382
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,250
- WHAT?

383
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,375
- LET'S GO, DOGGIE.
THIS IS BORING.

384
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,583
- I WAS HOPING FOR A
GOOD SHOW. WHAT A DRAG.

385
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,166
- Girl: WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?
HE'S JUST A NORMAL KID.

386
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,708
- HERE I THOUGHT
HE'D BE SOMEBODY IMPRESSIVE.

387
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,916
- Man: I GUESS WE JUST
JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS.

388
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,666
- UH, WAIT.  I'M, UH...
HUH?

389
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,500
UH, I...

390
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,541
- ( laughs )

391
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,500
- AHHH!

392
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,625
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?!
- BYE-BYE.

393
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,708
- JEEZ, WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT?
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

394
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,750
I NEVER GET
WHAT WOMEN ARE THINKING.

395
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,750
HERE YOU GO.
THIS IS YOUR TENT.

396
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,875
- HOLLAND, DID YOU JUST GET OUT
OF THE SHOWER OR SOMETHING?

397
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,708
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A GUY

398
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,375
WALKING AROUND IN
JUST HIS UNDERWEAR

399
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,666
WHEN HE'S AT HOME, IS THERE?

400
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,375
LOOK, KID,
WE DON'T HAVE ANY EMPTY ROOMS.

401
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,583
SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND CAMP OUT AROUND HERE.

402
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,541
- HUH?

403
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,250
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

404
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,250
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA
DO ABOUT A JOB FOR YOU?

405
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,375
OH, WELL.

406
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,666
I'M SURE I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT EVENTUALLY.

407
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,041
- UM, OKAY.

408
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,958
- CAN I TALK TO YOU, RENTON?
- HUH?

409
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,458
- I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK.

410
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,416
- YOU, UH, YOU WANT ME
TO LIVE HERE?

411
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,166
- YEAH. IF YOU'RE HERE,

412
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,041
THEN YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE BY NIRVASH'S SIDE.

413
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,166
- UM, WELL, I REALLY DON'T--
- PLEASE, RENTON.

414
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,458
WON'T YOU PLEASE
STAY BY HIS SIDE?

415
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,375
YOU SEE, I--I WANT TO BE
ABLE TO BELIEVE IN YOU.

416
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,041
- I-- I UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S RIGHT.

417
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,541
- Girl: MAMA!
- YOU NEED A MECHANIC--

418
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,125
- MAMA, WHERE ARE YOU?!
- --WITH AT LEAST MY SKILLS

419
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,375
TO TAKE CARE OF NIRVASH FOR YOU
AND KEEP IT WORKING RIGHT.

420
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,541
- HEY, HERE'S MAMA!

421
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,916
- BUT IT'S NOT
BECAUSE I'M A MECHANIC.

422
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,875
IT'S BECAUSE ALONG
WITH A CUTE MAMA LIKE YOU--

423
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,041
- Eureka: I'M SO SORRY--
- --I CAN'T-- MAMA.

424
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,500
MAMA-- MAMA?!

425
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,333
( gasping )
- All: HMM!

426
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,916
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,583
- BUT THEY CALLED YOU "MAMA."

428
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,625
THAT MEANS THOSE KIDS ARE--
- MM-HMM.

429
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,083
THESE ARE MY CHILDREN.

430
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,125
- MAMA, LET'S HURRY UP
AND GO!

431
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,250
- LINCK DREW A NEAT PICTURE
OF YOU, MAMA.

432
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,375
- CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.
- HURRY, HURRY!

433
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,083
- I GOT IT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUSH.

434
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,541
- MAMA! COME ON, MAMA. LET'S GO.
- OKAY OKAY.

435
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:04,416
LINCK, CALM DOWN, PLEASE.
I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN.

436
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,583
- ( children clamoring )

437
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,583
- Renton:
SIS, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

438
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,875
- ( theme music playing )

439
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,625
- Narrator: A NEW LIFE
ABOARD THE GEKKO.

440
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,166
DREAMS AND IDEALS
COME CRUMBLING DOWN.

441
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,000
THE BOY FRETS
AS HE FACES THE REALITY

442
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,041
THAT IS THROWN
IN FRONT OF HIS EYES.

443
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:10,041
WHAT DO THE MEMBERS OF
THE GEKKOSTATE SHOW HIM?

444
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,500
NEXT EPISODE, "WATERMELON."
