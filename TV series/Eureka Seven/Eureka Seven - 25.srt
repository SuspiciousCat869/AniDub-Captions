- HOW LONG HAD IT BEEN
SINCE I LEFT CHARLES' PLACE?

11
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,666
SEEM LIKE FOREVER.

12
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,916
I KEPT WALKING FOR THE PROMISE.

13
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,916
THE PROMISE OF
GETTING TO SEE EUREKA.

14
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,583
BUT...

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,541
BUT NOW, I COULDN'T
GET MYSELF TO EVEN WALK.

16
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,458
AND I WAS BEGINNING TO
LOSE SIGHT OF THE REASON.

17
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,666
WHY I KEPT ON WALKING.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,208
( gasps )

19
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,250
( groans )

20
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,000
SIS...

21
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,708
MAYBE...

22
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,750
MAYBE I...

23
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,625
- NIRVASH...

24
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,958
DO YOU FEEL LONELY
WHEN NOBODY IS ABOARD?

25
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,791
DO YOU FEEL A GAPING HOLE
RIGHT HERE IN YOUR HEART?

26
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,125
PLEASE, SAY SOMETHING TO ME.

27
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,625
- ( gasps )

28
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,500
( groans )

29
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,916
( groans )

30
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,000
- SO, YOU'VE COME TO?

31
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,333
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

32
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,958
YOU WERE LAYING OUT
THERE UNCONSCIOUS,

33
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,833
SO I JUST BROUGHT YOU
BACK TO THE HOUSE.

34
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,875
I TELL YOU,
YOU SURPRISED ME, TOO.

35
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,833
I WAS LOOKING AT A PERSON
COLLAPSED THERE, OF ALL PLACES!

36
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,708
I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AN AREA
THAT NOBODY WOULD EVER COME.

37
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,333
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE

38
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,583
AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.

39
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,000
OR A GHOST THAT
THE TRAPPERS WERE SHOWING ME.

40
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,541
- Renton:
THE PERSON THAT SAVED ME

41
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,583
SEEMED LIKE HE WAS VERY KIND BUT

42
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,333
HE WAS ALSO VERY TALKATIVE.

43
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,875
- AM I BEING TOO TALKATIVE?

44
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:29,666
MY NAME IS WILLIAM B. BAXTER.
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME WILL.

45
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,833
OH, AND PLEASE DON'T ASK ME

46
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,375
WHAT MY MIDDLE INITIAL
"B" STANDS FOR.

47
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,333
IT'S AN EMBARRASSING NAME THAT
MY DAD PICKED WHEN HE WAS DRUNK.

48
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,708
( laughs )

49
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,833
- OH, I...

50
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,375
( coughs )

51
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,333
- OH, I'M SORRY!
NO, DON'T TRY TO SAY ANYTHING.

52
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,375
THAT WAS MY FAULT.

53
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,708
OH, NO!

54
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,500
I FORGOT THAT YOU'D PROBABLY
BE BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY

55
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,166
AFTER BEING OUT LIKE THAT!

56
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,666
I'M REALLY SORRY!

57
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,250
I'LL BRING YOU SOME SOUP
RIGHT AWAY.

58
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,083
HERE, YOU BETTER DRINK IT SLOW.
YOU DON'T WANT TO CHOKE ON IT.

59
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,500
- Renton: IT WAS ONLY
A SPOONFUL OF SOUP.

60
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,291
BUT THAT SPOONFUL
WAS MORE DELICIOUS

61
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,708
THAN ANYTHING I'D EVER
EATEN IN MY LIFE.

62
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,083
- DO YOU LIKE HOW IT TASTES?

63
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,625
- ( stomach grumbling )

64
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,916
- I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE
REALLY HUNGRY

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
AND THAT YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU COULD EAT AN ENTIRE HORSE

66
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,958
FROM HEAD TO TAIL IN ONE BITE.

67
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,000
BUT DON'T FORCE YOURSELF.

68
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,125
YOU WERE SHOWING
SIGNS OF DEHYDRATION.

69
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,666
SO, FOR NOW,
YOU BETTER EAT JUST THE SOUP.

70
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,166
- THANKS A LOT, YOU'RE KIND.

71
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,000
- NO, I'M THE ONE WHO REALLY
OUGHT TO BE THANKING YOU.

72
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,333
I'M HAPPY THAT YOU CAME HERE,

73
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,250
NO MATTER WHAT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

74
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,833
BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE
TO TALK TO AROUND THIS PLACE,

75
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,083
OTHER THAN MARTHA.

76
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,125
- HUH?

77
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,166
- OH, I HAVEN'T
INTRODUCED YOU YET.

78
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,291
MY WIFE, MARTHA.

79
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,041
- ( gasps )

80
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,500
DESPERATION DISEASE.

81
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,583
- MARTHA, THIS IS...

82
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,083
- RENTON. MY NAME'S
RENTON THURSTON.

83
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,583
- RENTON THURSTON.

84
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,916
MARTHA, WE FINALLY
HAVE A VISITOR. EXCITED?

85
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,958
MARTHA, YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME
IN FRONT OF OUR NICE GUEST!

86
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,875
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU'RE HUNGRY, DEAR,

87
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,916
BUT RENTON HERE HASN'T QUITE
FINISHED HIS MEAL YET.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,166
AND THEN OF COURSE,
I HAVE TO ENTERTAIN HIM, TOO.

89
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,708
MARTHA, PLEASE BE UNDERSTANDING.

90
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,500
- OH, LOOK,
I'LL BE JUST FINE, REALLY.

91
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,500
- I DON'T KNOW, RENTON.

92
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,375
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT
BY MYSELF NOW.

93
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,625
IF IT'S JUST SOUP.

94
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,250
- I'M SORRY.

95
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,458
IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE A VERY
DEMANDING WOMAN AS YOUR WIFE.

96
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,250
I'M KIDDING!
SO DON'T BE MAD AT ME, OKAY?

97
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,875
HEY, HOW ABOUT SOME SOUP?

98
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,000
- SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.
- SURE.

99
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,041
- IT'S PUMPKIN SOUP,
YOUR FAVORITE.

100
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:18,125
COME NOW, YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
TERRIBLE TABLE MANNERS.

101
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,041
BUT, IN A TATTERED HOUSE LIKE
THIS, MANNERS MEAN NOTHING!

102
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,083
( laughs )

103
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,541
- ( grunts )

104
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,958
THE DAMN STATE ARMY'S
BLOCKED THIS LINE AS WELL.

105
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,166
I WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY?

106
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,250
- ( exclaiming in pain )

107
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,541
( groans )

108
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,666
PAIN WAS RUNNING
THOUGH MY ENTIRE BODY.

109
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,750
BUT THANKS TO
THE LITTLE BIT OF SLEEP I GOT,

110
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,958
I WAS ABLE TO MOVE AROUND.

111
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,541
TWO BEDS.

112
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,250
TWO CUPS.

113
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,666
TWO PLATES.

114
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,958
TWO CHAIRS.

115
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,458
IT WAS A HOUSE
THAT HAD TWO OF EVERYTHING.

116
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,625
( gasps )

117
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,666
I DON'T THINK SHE'S BREATHING!

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,291
- ( inhales )

119
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,125
( exhales )

120
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,958
- ( both exhale )

121
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,333
- ( gasps )

122
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,958
( exhales )

123
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,916
IS EVERYONE WHO HAS
DESPERATION DISEASE LIKE THIS?

124
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,541
HUH?

125
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:56,875
- OH!

126
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,875
BE CAREFUL!

127
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,875
I PLANTED MY POTATOES THERE!

128
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,666
AND CARROTS OVER THERE!

129
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,583
AND THERE...
I FORGOT WHAT I PLANTED THERE.

130
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,958
ANYWAY, BE CAREFUL
NOT TO STEP ON THE CROPS.

131
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,541
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
ANYTHING IS PLANTED!

132
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,875
- WELL, YOU CAN SEE
MY FOOTSTEPS, CAN'T YOU?

133
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,000
JUST TRY AND FOLLOW THEM
OVER HERE?

134
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,208
- THE GRASS IS SO THICK
I CAN'T SEE THEM!

135
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,750
- I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE!

136
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,083
YOU THINK IT'S ALRIGHT FOR YOU
TO BE UP SO SOON?

137
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,875
- YEAH, I'M OKAY MR. WILLIAM.

138
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,791
- HEY, I SAID THAT YOU SHOULD
JUST CALL ME WILL, DIDN'T I?

139
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,416
- ( chuckles )

140
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,458
WELL THEN, WILL, I REALLY
WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH

141
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,583
FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

142
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,416
- NO THANKS REQUIRED.

143
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,041
BESIDES, IF YOU'RE
GOING TO SAY THANKS,

144
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,541
YOU SHOULD SAY IT TO MARTHA.

145
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,583
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
THAT YOU HAD COLLAPSED

146
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,458
AND EXACTLY WHERE
I WOULD FIND YOU.

147
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,500
- HUH?

148
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,166
HOW DID SHE...

149
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,208
- WELL, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY EAT SOON.

150
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,250
- WILL, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

151
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,666
- HMM?

152
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,458
- UM, I WAS WONDERING WHAT
YOU WERE DOING OVER THERE?

153
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,583
- I WAS PULLING OUT
THE PILE BUNKERS.

154
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,458
- WHAT?

155
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,500
( gasps )

156
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,708
BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
THEY ARE ALL SO GIGANTIC!

157
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,583
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.

158
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,041
YOU CAST A SMALL
HOCUS-POCUS SPELL.

159
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,458
- HUH?

160
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,458
PULLING THEM OUT CAUSES
SOMETHING SERIOUS, DOESN'T IT?

161
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,041
ISN'T THIS WHOLE AREA STABLE

162
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,875
BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM
CAN BE FOUND HERE

163
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,208
PLUNGED INTO THE GROUND?

164
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,375
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG!
IT'S THE OPPOSITE.

165
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,500
- WHAT WAS THAT?

166
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,958
- SEE? IT DOESN'T EVEN
SHAKE ONE BIT HERE.

167
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,708
- BUT HOW'S THAT?

168
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,375
I MEAN, WHEN YOU PULL THEM OUT,

169
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,791
THEY RESULT AS A HUGE
TECTONIC SHIFT,

170
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,333
AND THEN IT...

171
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,708
THAT'S RIGHT!

172
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,666
IT SWALLOWS UP AN ENTIRE TOWER
BEFORE IT'S THROUGH.

173
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,083
- TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TREE.

174
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,041
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS?

175
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,250
- HUH?

176
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,625
- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF THE WIND BLOWS?

177
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,833
- WELL, IT WOULD SWAY,
OF COURSE.

178
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,625
- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF
A STRONGER WIND WERE TO BLOW?

179
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,916
OR A WIND THAT WAS
EVEN STRONGER THAN THAT?

180
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,833
- IT WOULD SWAY MORE AND MORE,

181
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,958
AND IN THE END IT
WOULD FALL DOWN.

182
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,541
- GOOD, YOU UNDERSTAND IT WELL.

183
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,250
IT'S THE SAME THING AS THAT.

184
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,750
IF YOU FIGHT THE FORCE
OF THE WORLD WITH FORCE,

185
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,041
SOMEDAY YOU WILL FALL.

186
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,291
EVEN THE TOWERS THAT ARE STABLE
NOW THANKS TO THE PILE BUNKERS,

187
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,208
CAN'T FIGHT AGAINST
THE FORCE OF THE WORLD.

188
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,166
- THAT'S TRUE.

189
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,291
- NOW, WHEN THAT WIND
BLOWS STRONG ENOUGH

190
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,125
TO MAKE THAT BIG TREE
THERE FALL DOWN,

191
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,875
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENS TO THE GRASS?

192
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,208
- THE GRASS WILL
MOST LIKELY FALL, TOO.

193
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,708
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IT WILL FALL OVER.

194
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,375
BUT IT WILL RISE AGAIN
GIVEN A FEW DAYS.

195
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,958
I TELL YOU, THIS LAND IS
A LOT LIKE THE GRASS.

196
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,750
I WANT YOU TO BREATHE IN.

197
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,333
WHAT? YOU'VE NEVER
BREATHED IN BEFORE?

198
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,916
- OF COURSE I HAVE!

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,541
- THEN JUST BREATHE IN!

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,166
( inhales )

201
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,041
- ( exhales )

202
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,083
( inhales )

203
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,541
THE WIND THAT I
BREATHED IN WAS SWEET,

204
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,916
FULL OF THE SMELL OF THE GRASS.

205
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,958
- YOU SEE?

206
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,416
YOU KNOW, THE WIND CAN
TEACH YOU MORE THINGS

207
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,166
THAN ALL OF THE WORDS
I CAN POSSIBLY LINE UP FOR YOU.

208
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,708
- HMM?
- BUT, BE CAREFUL.

209
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,708
BREATHING IN MEANS THAT YOU'RE
THAT MUCH CLOSER TO DEATH.

210
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,958
- HMM?

211
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,208
- YOU KNOW, RENTON, I THINK

212
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,291
PEOPLE SHOULDN'T USE
UP ANY MORE ENERGY

213
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,666
THAN IS PROVIDED BY THE SUN
THAT SHINES ON US.

214
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,125
- OH?

215
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,458
- SEE, THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN
YOU TRY TO USE UP MORE THAN THAT

216
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,083
YOU END UP DIGGING FOR SCUBS

217
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,000
IN ORDER TO DRAIN
ENERGY FROM THEM,

218
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,083
OR BUILDING ENORMOUS TOWERS.

219
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,791
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

220
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,208
PEOPLE CAN SURVIVE JUST FINE

221
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,041
ON WHAT LITTLE LAND
IS GIVEN TO THEM.

222
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,291
- BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
THE CROPS DON'T GROW, RIGHT?

223
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,708
- THERE ARE.

224
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,583
BUT NOT SO BAD THAT YOU'D DIE
OF HUNGER, OR ANYTHING.

225
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,416
YOU SEE, THIS WORLD IS GIVING
US PERMISSION TO LIVE HERE.

226
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,333
- ( groans )

227
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,166
A BEAUTIFUL FOXY WOMAN AND A
GUY THAT LOOKS LIKE A RACCOON?

228
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,416
IT CAN'T BE RAY AND CHARLES,
CAN IT?

229
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,875
- COME ON, HOLLAND!

230
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,500
COME ON, HOLLAND!

231
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,583
ADROC IS CALLING
FOR YOU, HOLLAND.

232
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,666
- ( gasps )

233
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,041
DAMN IT, THE STATE ARMY
HAS GOT THIS LINE BLOCKED, TOO?

234
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,666
IF THIS LINE HERE AND THIS
ONE HERE ARE BOTH BLOCKED...

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
DAMN IT!

236
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,916
THIS IS NO TIME
TO LOOK FOR RENTON!

237
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,875
- Renton: WATCHING THEM
WAS HARD ON ME,

238
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,416
AND I WAS NOTHING MORE
THAN AN OBSERVER.

239
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,833
- HEY, WILL.
- YES, RENTON?

240
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,416
- I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS,

241
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,583
BUT MARTHA HAS
DESPERATION DISEASE.

242
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,708
- NO, SHE DOESN'T.
- BUT, WILL...

243
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,000
- RENTON, DO YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE
CALL IT DESPERATION DISEASE?

244
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,291
IT'S CALLED THAT BECAUSE
PEOPLE AROUND THE PATIENTS,

245
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,458
NOT THE PATIENTS THEMSELVES,
FALL INTO DESPAIR.

246
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,416
AND SINCE I HAVEN'T
FALLEN INTO DESPAIR,

247
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,250
THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY BE
DESPERATION DISEASE.

248
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,500
- BUT THAT'S...

249
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,375
THAT'S NOTHING MORE THAN
A SILLY PLAY ON WORDS.

250
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,625
- LISTEN TO ME, RENTON.

251
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,208
YEARS AGO,
I MADE A PROMISE TO MARTHA.

252
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,958
- ( gun firing )

253
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:29,958
- ( gasps )

254
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,416
- ( sobbing )

255
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,541
- I PROMISED THAT
I WOULD SHOW HER

256
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,541
THE PLACE WHERE I WAS BORN.

257
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,375
I TOLD HER THAT SHE SHOULD
THROW AWAY THAT THING,

258
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,041
BUT BECAUSE SHE WAS AN ENGINEER,

259
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,291
SHE COULDN'T BRING
HERSELF TO DO IT.

260
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,250
YOU KNOW, I REALLY WISH
THAT I COULD SHOW YOU

261
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,291
HOW IT WAS THAT SHE WALKED.

262
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,958
IT WAS TRULY BEAUTIFUL.

263
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,083
BUT THEN...

264
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,416
WE ARRIVED AT MY BIRTHPLACE

265
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,708
TO DISCOVER THAT IT HAD
BECOME A WASTELAND.

266
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,833
BUT MARTHA WAS
CAPTIVATED BY THE PLACE.

267
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,541
AND SO, I BUILT A HOUSE HERE.

268
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,791
AND DID EVERYTHING JUST LIKE
MARTHA TOLD ME TO.

269
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,125
I CULTIVATED, PLANTED FLOWERS
AND BUILT A LIFE.

270
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,250
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

271
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,083
- BUT ISN'T IT
DIFFICULT FOR YOU?

272
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,333
- DIFFICULT?
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

273
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,250
NOTHING IS DIFFICULT
WHEN YOU LOVE EACH OTHER.

274
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,291
SO MUCH SO THAT
THE ANGELS ARE JEALOUS.

275
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,750
SO, DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE?

276
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,375
A PERSON THAT
YOU WANT TO BE WITH,

277
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,333
EVEN IF THE WORLD
WOULD'VE CAME TO AN END.

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,958
- ( gasps )

279
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,458
( gasps )

280
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,333
- SO, DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE?

281
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,625
- I DO.

282
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,250
- GREAT! I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

283
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,625
- ALRIGHT, I REALLY
HAVE TO GO NOW.

284
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,250
- YOU SHOULD.

285
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,583
YOU HAVE A SOLEMN PROMISE TO
FULFILL AS WELL, DON'T YOU?

286
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,708
- HUH? YES.

287
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,083
IS THERE A PLACE CALLED GEARNUS
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO HERE?

288
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,583
- MMM-HMM, IT'S NOT TOO FAR,
YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEMS

289
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,916
BUT SHE WON'T NECESSARILY
BE THERE JUST WAITING FOR YOU.

290
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,708
EVEN SO, WILL YOU GO?

291
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,666
- YES!

292
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,916
- HMM, SEEMS LIKE A GOOD BOY.

293
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,416
- EUREKA, PLEASE WAIT FOR ME.

294
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,375
- RENTON...

295
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,291
- A BULLETIN FROM
THE STATE ARMY.

296
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,333
THE HUNTING DOGS
HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PLACE,

297
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,583
AND IT'S TIME TO CORNER THE FOX.

298
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,916
WE'RE DOING IT?

299
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,791
- YEAH. I MADE AN UNBREAKABLE
PROMISE TO RENTON.

300
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,916
- SOMETIME YOU'RE SO CRUEL,
CHARLES, I LOVE IT.

301
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,083
- I'M GOING TO GO
BACK TO THE GEKKO!

302
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,833
I'M GOING TO SEE EUREKA!

303
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,750
TO BE CONTINUED!
