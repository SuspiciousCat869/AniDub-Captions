1
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:31,875
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,333
- Grandfather: LOOK AT THIS.
IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN FIVE YEARS,

3
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,166
YET WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO STILL BOTHER

4
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,666
TO COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE
TO VISIT HIS GRAVE.

5
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,500
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'S A HERO

6
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,833
OR THE GRAND SPIRIT
OF OUR SOCIETY,

7
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,791
BUT THE USED HIM
AS MUCH AS THEY COULD,

8
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,458
AND THEN THEY
SIMPLY THREW HIM OUT.

9
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:01,125
THIS IS WHERE THOSE
WHO FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS END UP.

10
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,250
I CERTAINLY
DIDN'T RAISE YOUR FATHER

11
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,500
TO MAKE HIM
INTO SOMEONE LIKE THAT.

12
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,791
AND YET HERE HE IS,
LONG DEAD AND GONE.

13
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,583
HE BROUGHT SO MUCH MISFORTUNE
TO HIS PARENTS.

14
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,083
IT'S FAR BETTER
NOT TO DREAM AT ALL

15
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,458
THAN TO WORK YOURSELF
INTO THE GRAVE

16
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,041
FOR THE SAKE OF PEOPLE
WHO WON'T EVEN HELP THEMSELVES.

17
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,083
- Diane: OUR DAD--
- HUH?

18
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,083
- WHEN HE LEFT OUR HOUSE
FOR THE VERY LAST TIME,

19
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,333
HE SAID TO ME,

20
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,666
"DON'T BEG FOR THINGS.
DO IT YOURSELF

21
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,916
OR ELSE
YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING."

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,541
I KNOW WHAT GRANDPA SAYS,

23
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,333
BUT I STILL BELIEVE
IN THOSE WORDS.

24
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,750
SOMEDAY, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHAT DAD MEANT.

25
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,083
- "DON'T BEG FOR THINGS.
DO IT YOURSELF

26
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,625
OR ELSE
YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING.

27
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,416
DON'T BEG FOR THINGS.
DO IT YOURSELF

28
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,333
OR ELSE
YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING.

29
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,958
DON'T BEG FOR THINGS.
DO IT YOURSELF

30
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,458
OR ELSE
YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING."

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,916
I CAN FLY!

32
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,375
LOOK AT THE SKY FISH.

33
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,875
- ( grunting )

34
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,791
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK!
THE TRAPAR'S WAY TOO THIN HERE.

35
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,625
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE SPEED
OF THE LONGBOARDS.

36
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,708
- DAMN!
MATTHIEU, COVER ME!

37
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,000
I'M JUST GONNA
HAVE TO BREAK THROUGH!

38
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,583
- ( beeping )
- Matthieu: HOLD IT!

39
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,000
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
OF USING THE C.F.S., ARE YOU?

40
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,750
- THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA
LOSE HER IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

41
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,958
- WAIT A MINUTE, LEADER!
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

42
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,708
WHAT?
WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY?

43
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,375
- HMM?  WHAT'S WRONG?

44
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,500
( gasps )

45
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,500
( thinking )
THAT KID.

46
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,291
AND LOOK AT THE SKY FISH.

47
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,291
HMM!  VERY INTERESTING.

48
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,750
- ( thinking ) I GET IT.
I GET IT NOW, SIS.

49
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,375
YOU CAN'T JUST WAIT.
YOU CAN'T BEG FOR IT.

50
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,958
SO NOW
I'M GONNA DO IT ON MY OWN.

51
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,125
( gasps )

52
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,625
- HE JUST DID
A CUTBACK DROP TURN.

53
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,000
- WICKED!
HE TOTALLY NAILED IT.

54
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,625
- ( gunfire )

55
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,125
- ( grunting )
CAN'T SHAKE 'EM.

56
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,375
I NEED TO LOSE THEM SOMEHOW.

57
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,416
I HAVE TO TRY AND GET BACK
TO HOLLAND RIGHT AWAY.

58
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,458
- AHH!
- THAT BOY!

59
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,375
- AHHH!
- OH NO!

60
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,583
NIRVASH, HURRY!

61
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,583
- AHHH!

62
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,541
- OH, ARE YOU--
- I DID IT.

63
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,291
I ACTUALLY DID IT.

64
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,583
I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO PULL OFF
A FULL-SPEED CUTBACK DROP TURN.

65
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,458
- UH...
- IT WAS THANKS TO YOU.

66
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,666
I WAS ABLE TO DO IT
BECAUSE OF YOU!

67
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,583
YOU ARE SO AMAZING.

68
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,708
I THINK
THAT I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU!

69
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,000
- WHAT?

70
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,583
- YOU SEE,
I DID IT BECAUSE OF YOU.

71
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,250
AND I CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOU.

72
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,041
I GUESS THAT
I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH YOU!

73
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,666
- UH, LOVE?

74
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,958
- YEAH.

75
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,166
SO NOW I'M GONNA PROTECT YOU
MYSELF.

76
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,250
AND I'M NOT ONLY
GONNA PROTECT YOU,

77
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,333
BUT THIS MACHINE TOO,
WITH THIS AMITA DRIVE.

78
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,791
- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE?

79
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,916
- MY GRANDFATHER
EXPLAINED IT TO ME.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,708
WITH THIS, WE CAN OPEN
THE SATORI PROGRAM.

81
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,125
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,

82
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,750
THIS L.F.O. NIRVASH typeZERO
WILL TRULY AWAKEN!

83
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,083
SO HERE IT GOES.

84
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,958
AMITA DRIVE,

85
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,166
SET ON!

86
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,833
HUH?  WHAT THE--

87
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,000
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

88
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,500
IT'S EUREKA.
- ( sighs )

89
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,041
- WAIT A MINUTE!
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

90
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,291
AHHHH!

91
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,541
- OH, CRAP!

92
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,958
- DAMN IT!
( grunting )

93
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,375
OH NO!
WHY CAN'T I MOVE THE CONTROLS?

94
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,041
HOW COME?
WHAT DO I DO?

95
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,791
- ( alarm sounding )

96
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,208
- THOSE ARE MISSILES!
WAIT, WHY WON'T THIS MOVE?

97
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
NO WAY THIS IS HAPPENING!

98
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,208
WHY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

99
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,000
NO!  WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

100
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,041
IS THIS HOW MY LIFE
IS GONNA END?  NO WAY.

101
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,583
AT 14, IT'S ALL OVER?

102
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,333
WAIT!  WAIT A MINUTE!

103
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,250
AHHH!

104
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,375
- Matthieu: FORGET IT.

105
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,208
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT HERE.

106
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,541
EVERYWHERE I LOOK,
THERE'S JUST PILLARS OF SALT.

107
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,208
I'VE HEARD RUMORS ABOUT IT,

108
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,583
BUT WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS?!

109
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,375
- HEY, STONER!

110
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,000
ANY IDEA
WHERE OUR FEARLESS LEADER IS?

111
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,500
- OVER THERE.
OH!

112
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,750
WITH OUR PRINCESS.

113
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,458
- HOLLAND.

114
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,750
- YOU OKAY?

115
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,750
- MMM, YES, I'M FINE.

116
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,041
AND THE OTHERS?
- HMM?

117
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,875
OH, YEAH,
EVERYBODY'S JUST FINE.

118
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,750
BUT LOOK AT ALL THIS.

119
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,916
THAT WAS SOME TREMENDOUS POWER.

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,250
I DIDN'T THINK THAT THE SATORI
PROGRAM INSIDE THE AMITA DRIVE

121
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,541
WOULD BE ABLE TO
UNLEASH YOUR POWERS--

122
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,250
OR RATHER, THE NIRVASH'S
POWERS-- TO THIS EXTENT.

123
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,458
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- WHAT?

124
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,333
- NIRVASH IS SAYING THAT IT
WAS NEITHER THE AMITA DRIVE

125
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,500
NOR THE SATORI PROGRAM
THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE

126
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,833
FOR UNLEASHING
ALL THIS INCREDIBLE POWER.

127
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,500
IT'S SAYING THAT THE TRUE SOURCE
OF THIS POWER

128
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,666
WAS THIS BOY'S STRENGTH.

129
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,125
- OLD MAN!

130
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,875
HEY, OLD MAN!  RENTON!

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,500
OH NO.

132
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,916
( sobbing )

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,791
POOR OLD GUY!
- Grandfather: HEY, DIGGER.

134
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,375
- EEK!
- SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,

135
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,125
BUT CAN I GET A LIGHT HERE?

136
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,833
IT SEEMS THIS THING GOT BUSTED
IN ALL THE EXCITEMENT.

137
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,500
- ( laughs )
OLD MAN.

138
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,333
- UH, HUH?

139
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,791
WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT'S THAT L.F.O. DOING?

140
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,375
- RENTON!

141
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,875
RENTON!
- HUH?

142
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,625
- ( grunting )
WHERE IS RENTON?!

143
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,708
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

144
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,625
- Dominic: ANY FURTHER COMBAT
IS USELESS.

145
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,458
WE SHOULD RETURN TO BASE
IMMEDIATELY.

146
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,375
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
I LOST TWO K.L.F. SQUADRONS!

147
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,500
I CAN'T POSSIBLY
RETURN EMPTY-HANDED.

148
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,958
- BUT SIR, NOW THAT
WE'VE CONFIRMED THE

149
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,500
SEVEN SWELL EFFECT, WE CAN'T
FIGHT WITH WHAT WE HAVE HERE.

150
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,166
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,

151
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,958
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A MERE
OBSERVER ABOARD THIS SHIP.

152
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,791
I THINK INFORMATION OFFICERS

153
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,541
SHOULD ACT
LIKE INFORMATION OFFICERS.

154
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,875
- FINE THEN.

155
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,125
I WILL EXERCISE MY RIGHTS
AS AN INFORMATION OFFICER.

156
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,708
- HMM?

157
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,000
- IN ACCORDANCE
WITH ARTICLE 56 OF MILITARY LAW,

158
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,708
I HEREBY TAKE COMMAND
OF THE SHIP'S HIGH-SPEED CRAFT.

159
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,000
- Man: I THINK
I COULD BUY TIME WITH THIS,

160
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,875
BUT IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THE
GUYS IN THE MILITARY FIND OUT.

161
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,208
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE
SURE YOU AND RENTON STAY HIDDEN,

162
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,708
SO HURRY UP AND GET READY
SO YOU CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

163
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,833
- SORRY FOR THE TROUBLE.

164
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,916
- OKAY, I'M GONNA
GO ON AHEAD.

165
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,208
- ( grandfather laughing )
JEEZ.

166
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,916
HE'S SLEEPING LIKE HE
HASN'T GOT A CARE IN THE WORLD.

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,291
- Eureka:
WHY DOES HE LOOK SO HAPPY?

168
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,750
- WHAT?

169
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,041
- I THINK WHAT HE DID WAS
VERY RECKLESS AND FOOLHARDY.

170
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,333
- THAT MAY BE SO.

171
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,083
BUT THEN
WHO IS GOING TO COMPLIMENT HIM

172
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,083
FOR WHAT HE'S ATTEMPTED TO DO
IF NOT FOR ME?

173
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,791
IT MAY HAVE BEEN RECKLESS,
ACCORDING TO COMMON SENSE,

174
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,083
BUT I'LL PRAISE HIM
FOR WHAT HE DID

175
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,541
BECAUSE, AFTER ALL,
HE IS MY FAMILY.

176
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,375
- FAMILY?

177
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,958
- YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU HAVE

178
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,333
CHILDREN OF
YOUR OWN, YOUNG LADY.

179
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,750
- BUT, SIR, I'M--

180
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,625
- Both: HMM?

181
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,625
- I'M SORRY
I HAVEN'T KEPT IN TOUCH.

182
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,708
I HONESTLY NEVER THOUGHT

183
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,958
THAT I WOULD
EVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

184
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,833
- WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING HERE?

185
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,000
WELL, HOLLAND?

186
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,625
- Grandfather: SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN LOITERING AROUND HERE?

187
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,666
SINCE YESTERDAY, I TAKE IT?

188
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,291
AND WHERE IS THAT TERMINUS
OF YOURS?

189
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,750
- THE 909 IS TOO EASY TO SPOT.

190
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,125
THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE
ON MY BOARD.

191
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,708
- GOD DAMN IT!
THAT'S HOW YOU ALWAYS MANAGE

192
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,333
TO MAKE MY LIFE
INTO ONE BIG MESS.

193
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,458
YOU BRING ME
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

194
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,166
- ONE THING--

195
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,583
PLEASE LET ME
SAY JUST ONE THING.

196
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,916
- HMM?

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,375
- THANKS A LOT.

198
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,583
- WELL, I HAVE A GOOD IDEA

199
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:41,375
AS TO WHY YOU ARRIVED HERE
WITH A NIRVASH typeZERO,

200
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,041
ESPECIALLY
SINCE YOU PROMISED

201
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,625
THAT YOU'D NEVER
SHOW YOUR FACE HERE AGAIN.

202
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,500
YOU MADE YOUR DECISION,
DIDN'T YOU?

203
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,208
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE, RIGHT?

204
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,041
NOW THAT ALL THIS
HAS HAPPENED,

205
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,458
YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME SORT
OF RESPONSIBILITY,

206
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,000
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
TO US.

207
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,333
BUT EVEN SO,

208
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,875
I AT LEAST WANTED RENTON
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

209
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,041
TO LIVE
A NORMAL HAPPY LIFE.

210
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,000
- A NORMAL HAPPY LIFE, HUH?

211
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:11,708
ARE YOU SAYING THAT BOY
WANTS A SO-CALLED NORMAL LIFE?

212
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,208
- SOMEDAY HE'LL REALIZE
WHICH OF US IS RIGHT.

213
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,500
- THEN WHY DID YOU HAVE HIM
DELIVER THE AMITA DRIVE?

214
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,708
WHY DID YOU MAKE HIM
GO THROUGH WITH THE DELIVERY,

215
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,041
EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT HE HAD
TO DO SOMETHING DANGEROUS?

216
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,208
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, DO YOU?

217
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,541
NO, YOU'VE JUST
BEEN FOOLING YOURSELF

218
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,541
AS TO WHAT
YOU REALLY BELIEVE.

219
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,208
- NO!

220
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,541
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT I REALLY THINK!

221
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,041
WHAT COULD A VAGABOND LIKE YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW ABOUT ANY OF IT?

222
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,208
- THEN WHY DID YOU HOLD ON TO IT
AS IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT?

223
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,458
- BECAUSE, YOU IDIOT,
IT WAS MY SON WHO BUILT IT!

224
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,583
TO TELL THE TRUTH,
YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO HAVE IT.

225
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,916
THE ONLY ONE THAT SHOULD
HAVE IT, OTHER THAN MYSELF,

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,916
IS RENTON!

227
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,916
UNDERSTAND, I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF FORGIVING YOU!

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,625
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
AT THE MOMENT,

229
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,166
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE AVAILABLE

230
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,916
THAT I CAN
TRUST THE DAMN THING TO.

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,041
( growling )

232
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,708
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

233
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,458
PLEASE GO HOME.

234
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,458
- I'M VERY SORRY.

235
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:22,000
- Renton: I DON'T GET IT.
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

236
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,708
I DON'T GET IT--

237
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,583
WHY DAD CREATED SUCH A THING
IN THE FIRST PLACE

238
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,458
AND WHY GRANDPA KEPT IT HIDDEN
ALL THIS TIME

239
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,166
AND WHY ALL OF THIS HAPPENED.

240
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,833
I-- I--

241
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,958
WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING?

242
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,708
- Holland: THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE.

243
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,916
WHAT IT IS
YOU BELIEVE IN

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,208
AND WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO
WITH THAT BELIEF

245
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,208
IS ALL
YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY.

246
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,958
IT'S UP TO YOU WHETHER TO
RIDE THE WAVES OR LET THEM DIE.

247
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,250
THAT IS THE MOTTO THAT ALL
LIFTERS LIVE BY, ISN'T IT?

248
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,666
- IT'S-- IT'S REALLY HIM.

249
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,958
- Woman:
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS, SIR?

250
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,958
- Jurgens: ABOUT SECOND
LIEUTENANT DOMINIC LEAVING?

251
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,458
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

252
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,458
IT SEEMS THAT THE LIEUTENANT
NO LONGER WANTS TO MEDDLE

253
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:10,000
WITH THE GEKKOSTATE.
SO I'LL LET HIM GO

254
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,708
SINCE HE OPENED
THE INFORMATION DATABASE TO US.

255
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,000
- SIR, DATA VERIFIED.
- HOW IS IT?

256
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,833
- THERE'S A SHIP
AT THE BELLFOREST AIRPORT

257
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,500
THAT'S NOT ON ANY
OF THE CORPORATION FLEET LISTS.

258
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,458
- WHAT?  BELLFOREST?
THAT'S AWFULLY CLOSE.

259
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,166
CONTACT THE STATE ARMY.

260
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,333
ISSUE A WARNING
TO ALL SURROUNDING AREAS.

261
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,708
- SIR!

262
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,500
- LISTEN UP-- WE NEED TO GET
TO BELLFOREST AIRPORT

263
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,833
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

264
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,500
EVEN IF THE AVIATION CORPORATION
DOESN'T BUDGE,

265
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,958
I'LL JUST FORCE A LANDING.

266
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,291
PREPARE THE
MON-SOONO FOR LAUNCH!

267
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,791
- YOU KNOW ALREADY. YOU HAVE
YOUR ANSWER, DON'T YOU?

268
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,208
- ( gasps )

269
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,125
- YOU BELIEVED IN THE WAVES.

270
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,958
IF YOU DIDN'T,
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE

271
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,666
PULLED OFF A CUTBACK DROP TURN.

272
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,666
AND THAT MEANS
YOU BELIEVE IN THE WORLD.

273
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,041
AND SO THE WORLD
KINDLY ANSWERED YOUR BELIEF.

274
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,791
QUITTING RIGHT NOW
IS CERTAINLY AN OPTION,

275
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,875
AND IT MAY ALSO BE
THE BEST DECISION.

276
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,041
BUT MY TEACHER ONCE GAVE ME
SOME VERY GOOD ADVICE--

277
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,458
"DON'T BEG FOR THINGS.
DO IT YOURSELF,

278
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,541
OR ELSE
YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING."

279
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,500
- WAIT!  BUT THAT'S--

280
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,916
- LISTEN, KID-- WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN?

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,875
WHAT DID YOU BELIEVE IN WHEN
YOU WERE INSIDE THE NIRVASH?

282
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,541
- WELL, I...

283
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,625
DAMN IT! ( grunting )

284
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,083
OH NO,
WHY CAN'T I MOVE THE CONTROLS?

285
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,541
HOW COME?!  WHAT DO I DO?
- ( alarm sounding )

286
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,291
- THOSE ARE MISSILES!
WAIT, WHY WON'T THIS MOVE?

287
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,916
NO WAY THIS IS HAPPENING!

288
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,916
WHY?  WHAT'S GOING ON?

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,750
NO!  WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

290
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,208
IS THIS HOW MY LIFE
IS GONNA END?

291
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,333
NO WAY!
AT 14, IT'S ALL OVER?

292
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,083
WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE!

293
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,916
ARGH!
- ( alarm sounding )

294
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,583
- Eureka: IT'S ALL RIGHT.

295
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,666
YOU CAN BELIEVE IN ME.

296
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,958
- Renton: THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME.

297
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,708
I SAW IT BACK THEN TOO.

298
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,791
I'M SURE OF IT.

299
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,333
THE WORD "EUREKA"
WAS ON THE COMPAC DRIVE

300
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,541
AS I LOOKED AT IT
OVER MY SISTER'S SHOULDER.

301
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,708
I DON'T GET IT.

302
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,375
I DON'T GET IT, BUT--

303
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,250
BUT NOW I THINK
I KIND OF UNDERSTAND

304
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,833
WHAT MY SISTER REALLY WANTED
TO TELL ME BACK THEN

305
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,875
AND WHAT I SHOULD
REALLY BELIEVE IN RIGHT NOW.

306
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,166
- typeZERO HAS BAILED OUT!

307
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,500
- IT WAS SHOT DOWN?
- DID WE GET IT?!

308
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,500
- NO WAY.
- Holland: MATTHIEU, PULL BACK!

309
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,416
-WHY SHOULD I?
-JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE!

310
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,083
IT'S THAT KID!

311
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,291
THAT LITTLE KID WAS SOMEHOW
ABLE TO DELIVER THE AMITA DRIVE

312
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,333
TO THE NIRVASH!
IT'S COMING.

313
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,500
THE SEVEN SWELL!

314
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,208
- ( gasps )
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

315
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,000
- UNKNOWN PARTICLES
ARE APPEARING

316
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,083
FROM THE POINT OF IMPACT.

317
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,458
TRAPAR AREA
IS INCREASING IN RANGE.

318
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,583
- THEN THIS IS--

319
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,416
IMPOSSIBLE.
THEN THIS IS

320
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,375
WHAT THEY CALL
THE SEVEN SWELL EFFECT!

321
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,083
- ( all gasping )

322
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,250
- Grandfather: TO LEAVE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEHIND

323
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,500
THAT'S CAPABLE
OF CAUSING SUCH AN EVENT,

324
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,041
AND THEN GETTING YOUR SON
INVOLVED IN THIS AS WELL,

325
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,041
YOU BRING GREAT MISFORTUNE
TO YOUR PARENTS.

326
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,666
THIS IS A LIGHT
THAT DESTROYS US

327
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,166
AND THAT GUIDES US ALL
TO DEATH.

328
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,750
HOWEVER, IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

329
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,291
- Man: ELECTROMAGNETIC
RADIATION INCREASING!

330
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,833
THE TRAPAR FIELD
IS REVERSING POLARITY.

331
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,666
- OH NO! YOU GOTTA ORDER THE
MON-SOONO TO RETREAT AT ONCE.

332
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,250
IT'S IN DANGER!

333
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,583
- AMAZING.

334
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,458
- LIKE A GOD OF DESTRUCTION.

335
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,458
- Holland: HEY, DIANE,

336
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,166
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO,
ISN'T IT? IT REALLY IS.

337
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,958
RIGHT?

338
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,250
Renton:
I DON'T GET IT.  I DON'T GET IT.

339
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,750
BUT AT THAT MOMENT,

340
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,416
ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS RESCUE HER.

341
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,000
AND THEN IT WAS LIKE

342
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,041
NIRVASH TOLD ME TO TRUST IT,

343
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,375
TO TRUST THAT FEELING.

344
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,500
THAT'S WHY I FINALLY DECIDED
TO BELIEVE IN IT.

345
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,500
BY BELIEVING IT,
I THOUGHT THAT JUST MAYBE

346
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,333
I WOULD BE ABLE
TO RESCUE HER.

347
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,458
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT
IT WOULD BE

348
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,666
THE PROOF OF WHAT I BELIEVE IN.

349
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,791
BUT...
- HMM.

350
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,666
YOU WANT PROOF, HUH?

351
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,875
IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING,

352
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,583
COME WITH US.
- HUH?

353
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,041
- I'M SURE THAT'S
WHAT SHE WISHES FOR TOO.

354
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:22,416
- ( air raid alarm sounding )

355
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,083
- THE ALERT SIREN!

356
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,041
- Holland: IZUMO'S FLEET!

357
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,541
THEY GOT HERE FASTER
THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD.

358
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,833
- HOLLAND, DID YOU SEE?

359
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,041
- SORRY, I GOTTA
BORROW NIRVASH'S RADIO.

360
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,916
- SURE.
- ( alarm continues )

361
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,833
- LISTEN,
YOU SHOULD COME WITH US.

362
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,041
- WHAT?

363
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,625
- IT'S JUST,
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE.

364
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,000
IT HAS TO BE YOU.

365
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,041
- Renton: IT'S TRUE
THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME

366
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,541
A GIRL SAID SOMETHING
LIKE THAT TO ME.

367
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:04,458
BUT, SIS, THE REAL REASON
WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

368
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,166
I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS MY JOB
TO PROTECT THE AMITA DRIVE

369
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,166
IN PLACE OF GRANDPA.

370
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,750
AND I THOUGHT THAT I WANTED
TO TRUST THIS GIRL

371
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,208
ONE MORE TIME.

372
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,916
THAT'S WHY I TOOK HOLD
OF THE HAND

373
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,958
THAT REACHED OUT TO ME.

374
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,125
TO BE CONTINUED!

375
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:32,291
- ( theme music playing )

376
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,500
- Narrator: REALITY GLIMMERS
IN SEVEN COLORS.

377
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,083
ALL THE ADULTS CAN DO
IS LOOK ON IN CONFUSION.

378
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,500
AMIDST ALL THAT, THE BOY CLIMBS
ABOARD THE NIRVASH ONCE MORE

379
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:11,750
TO EMBARK ON A JOURNEY.
