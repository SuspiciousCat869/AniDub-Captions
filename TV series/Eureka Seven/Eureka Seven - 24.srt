THE MON-SOONOS
OF THE STATE ARMY

10
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,000
ARE NO MATCH FOR YOU AFTER ALL?

11
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,333
- GEKKO, COME IN.
THIS IS THE 909!

12
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,208
THE KLF SQUADRON WE
ENCOUNTERED HAS BEEN DESTROYED!

13
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:10,000
- WE'RE RETURNING NOW!
- HEY, LEADER, WAIT A MINUTE!

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,750
- THERE HE GOES, IGNORING ME.

15
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,875
- 909 AND 606 ARE RETURNING.

16
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:20,041
THE GEKKO SHOULD
TURN THE NOSE TO 270.

17
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,458
- UM...
- HEY, TALHO!

18
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,416
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
ADJUSTMENTS LIKE THAT.

19
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,583
HE ALWAYS MAKES HIS BACK
WITHOUT IT.

20
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,458
- WAIT A MINUTE, LEADER!

21
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,916
THE 909!
IT'S COMING IN TOO SHALLOW!

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,958
- ( gasps )

23
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,083
- HEY, LEADER,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

24
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,958
HOLLAND! PULL UP! PULL UP!

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,583
- SHEESH, LUCKY YOU ONLY GOT
A FEW CUTS AND BRUISES

26
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,791
FOR YOUR TROUBLE.

27
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,583
WERE YOU DISTRACTED
WHILE YOU WERE LANDING?

28
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,625
IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE YOU.
BUT THEN AGAIN IT IS.

29
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,916
- YOU CAN LAUGH.
- I CAN'T LAUGH ABOUT THIS.

30
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,583
- UM, HEY, MISCHA.
- LOOK, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

31
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,125
I DIDN'T COME ABOARD THIS SHIP
TO ACT AS YOUR COUNSELOR

32
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,166
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

33
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,916
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

34
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,458
HOW'S EUREKA DOING?

35
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,916
- SHE'S OFF LOOKING, FOR RENTON.

36
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,708
- OH, NO.

37
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,958
WE'RE OUT OF TOOTHBRUSHES

38
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,916
'CAUSE RENTON'S NOT
HERE TO STOCK THEM.

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,958
I WONDER IF THERE ARE
SOME IN THE BACK...

40
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,208
EUREKA?

41
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,708
- OH, UM, WELCOME
TO THE SHIP'S STORE.

42
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,041
WAIT, WHY ARE YOU STOCKING
THE SHELVES WITH FRESH GOODS?

43
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,875
AND WHY ARE YOU
WEARING THAT OUTFIT?

44
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,541
- WELL, BECAUSE HE'S GONE.

45
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,041
- HUH...

46
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,625
- I WONDER IF
EUREKA'S ALL RIGHT?

47
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,958
- I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS,
SHE'S NOT ALL RIGHT.

48
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,541
- SHE'S IN PAIN, I'M SURE OF IT.
I KNOW JUST HOW SHE FEELS.

49
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,708
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
DO ABOUT IT, MOONDOGGIE?

50
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,958
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HOLLAND?

51
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,166
AFTER ALL,
THE GEKKO IS HIS SHIP.

52
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,250
IT WAS HIS IDEA AS THE LEADER,
TO BRING EUREKA HERE,

53
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,666
AND THEN TO LET
RENTON ABOARD THE SHIP.

54
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,583
I'M SCARED ANOTHER CHAIR'S
GOING TO COME FLYING MY WAY,

55
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,583
IF WE TRY.

56
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,208
- WELL, YEAH.

57
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,875
- THE RAMEN'S COLD.

58
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:51,916
RENTON...

59
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,166
- WOW!

60
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,666
- SO, BOY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO
CALL RAY, MAMA? AND ME PAPA?

61
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,875
- HUH?

62
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,416
- WELL, RAY SAID
IF YOU'D LIKE...

63
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,916
I MEAN IT WAS HER IDEA!

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,666
- OH, NO, HONEY, YOU AGREED!

65
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,416
- ( laughing )

66
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,750
NOW, RENTON!

67
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:25,041
CALL US PAPA AND MAMA,
AND USE A BIG VOICE, OKAY?

68
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,791
HUH? UH, HEY, WAIT A SEC.

69
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,625
- I GUESS THIS WAS
ALL TOO SUDDEN!

70
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,291
OH, RENTON, I'M SORRY!

71
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,500
IT'S OKAY, YOU DON'T NEED TO
DO IT UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO.

72
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,708
AND YOU ONLY NEED TO DO IT,
WHILE WE'RE ABOARD THIS SHIP.

73
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:43,875
- BUT...

74
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,958
BUT, I...

75
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,500
I DID SOMETHING
STUPID IN OLPASA,

76
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,500
AND GOT IN THE WAY OF YOUR WORK!

77
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,250
( crying )

78
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,875
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED

79
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,916
IF YOU KICKED ME OUT
OF HERE, RIGHT NOW!

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,916
- DON'T BE DUMB.
YOU DID THE BEST, YOU COULD!

81
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,833
IF YOU WANT TO, YOU CAN STAY
ABOARD THIS SHIP FOREVER!

82
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,375
OKAY, RENTON?

83
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,375
- BALANCE?

84
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,250
- I WANT YOU TO
LISTEN TO THIS IDEA,

85
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,625
THOUGH IT'S NOTHING MORE
THAN A HYPOTHESIS.

86
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,500
WHAT SEEMS TO SPARK
THE AMITA DRIVE

87
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,083
TO RESPOND IS A BALANCE.

88
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,583
BETWEEN THE MENTAL SIGNS
OF EUREKA AND THOSE OF RENTON.

89
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,708
- BOTH OF THEM?
- RIGHT.

90
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,541
EUREKA ALONE CAN'T DO IT,
AND NEITHER CAN RENTON.

91
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,375
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE
BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO.

92
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,583
- HUH?

93
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,291
- ( sighs ) JUST DISBAND IT,
ALREADY!

94
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,916
DISBAND THE GEKKOSTATE!

95
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,500
IT'S USELESS TO
KEEP GOING LIKE THIS!

96
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,375
SOMEONE HERE IS
CREATING A BAD ATMOSPHERE!

97
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,916
- WAIT, A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

98
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,708
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
- WELL, I HAVEN'T!

99
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,916
- LET GO OF ME!

100
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,291
- WHY DID THINGS
END UP THIS WAY?

101
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,791
BECAUSE, ALL YOU'RE DOING RIGHT
NOW, IS BEING JEALOUS OF RENTON!

102
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,625
YOU'RE POUTING BECAUSE HE
TOOK EUREKA AWAY FROM YOU!

103
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,916
WHY, HOLLAND?

104
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,500
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME HELP YOU?

105
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,875
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
INTO YOUR HEART?

106
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:09,708
- Renton: IT WAS SWEET.
AND WARM. AND IT SMELLED GOOD.

107
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,166
BUT THE WORDS WERE
SLIGHTLY TICKLISH.

108
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,458
PAPA... MAMA...

109
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,208
( chuckling )

110
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,708
- REMEMBERING WHAT YOU DID, HUH?

111
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,291
IT'S SOMETHING THAT ONLY
YOUNG ONES CAN GET AWAY WITH.

112
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,750
- SO, WERE YOU THINKING
ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

113
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,000
- NO, I WASN'T!

114
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,708
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE IT!

115
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,416
- YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT HER?

116
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,208
- JUST STOP IT, CHARLES.
THAT'S NOT IT!

117
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,250
UH...

118
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,291
I MEAN, PAPA...

119
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,583
- ( laughing )

120
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,625
NORMALLY PEOPLE HAVE
TROUBLE SAYING THINGS,

121
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,166
WHEN THEY ARE TOLD THEY HAVE TO.

122
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,166
I KNOW, I COULDN'T DO IT.

123
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,875
- WELL, UH, CAN'T I START OUT
JUST CALLING YOU GUYS

124
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,083
MOM AND DAD FOR A WHILE?

125
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666
- HMM?

126
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,416
- YOU SEE, I WAS NEVER ABLE TO
CALL FOR MY FATHER OR MOTHER.

127
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,416
SO USING PAPA AND
MAMA IS A LITTLE

128
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,083
TOO HIGH OF A HURDLE
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

129
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,416
- ( gasping )

130
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,333
- I JUST WORKED UP
A LITTLE SWEAT AT THE GYM

131
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,916
SMELL BAD?

132
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,083
WELL RENTON,
THIS IS HOW YOUR DAD SMELLS.

133
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,833
- IT REALLY DOES SMELL GOOD.

134
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,416
- ( dings )

135
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,625
- I SEE, YOUR SKILLS ARE
AS A MECHANIC.

136
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,708
- GRANDPA POUNDED ALL
THIS KNOWLEDGE INTO ME.

137
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,958
HE WAS AN OLD MAN
WITH A HUGE MOUTH.

138
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,041
AND I THINK HIS HOBBY
WAS BEING BULLHEADED.

139
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,291
- NOW, DONT SAY THAT.
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT BAD.

140
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,041
HE DID RAISE YOU.

141
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,000
- THOUGH I GUESS, HE WASN'T
GET TO RAISE ME,

142
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,625
ALL THE WAY TO MANHOOD.

143
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:14,083
BUT HE MADE SURE THAT MY
MAINTENANCE SKILLS WERE GOOD.

144
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,041
JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
I ACCEPTED AN URGENT REQUEST,

145
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,416
TO TUNE THE LEGENDARY LFO,
IT WAS THE NIRVASH.

146
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,916
- THE NIRVASH? THE TYPE ZERO?
- YUP!

147
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,041
- WOW! THATS AMAZING.

148
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,125
I'LL HAVE TO GO SAY HELLO
TO HIM SOME TIME.

149
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,708
YOU SEE RENTON,
IF YOU'RE REALLY MY SON,

150
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,000
THEN YOUR GRANDPA
MUST BE MY PAPA!

151
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,875
- ( laughing )

152
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,458
- THE FACTORY,
IS IT FAR FROM HERE?

153
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,875
- IN BELL FOREST!

154
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,000
IT'S JUST A LITTLE PLACE
CALLED GARAGE THURSTON.

155
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,541
- THURSTON?!

156
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,000
WAIT A MINUTE, THEN THAT
MEANS YOUR DEAD FATHER WAS...

157
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,958
- YES, HIS NAME WAS
ADROC THURSTON.

158
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,000
- ( gasps )

159
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,958
- IF RENTON AND EUREKA
WERE TOGETHER,

160
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,291
SOME DAY THEY WOULD
CAUSE A TRAGEDY.

161
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,833
- YEAH? WELL, THAT WOULDN'T
HAVE CHANGED EVEN IF YOU

162
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,333
WERE THE ONE
CHOSEN BY EUREKA,

163
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,708
AND YOU DAMN WELL KNOW IT!

164
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:21,416
AND IF IT WAS YOU, YOU'D BE
PLUNGING FORWARD, RIGHT?

165
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,916
- YOU'RE RIGHT, TALHO.

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,500
I GUESS I AM GOING TO HAVE TO
ACCEPT HIM FOR WHAT HE IS.

167
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,291
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT!
WHAT YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT,

168
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,250
IS THAT, YOU WERE NOT THE ONE
CHOSEN BY EUREKA!

169
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,833
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT

170
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,333
THAT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE
IN THE TWO OF THEM!

171
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,375
- ( sighs ) YES, I KNOW THAT.

172
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,875
I REALLY DO, TALHO.

173
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,500
- IF IT'S A TEST, THEN I DONT
HAVE TO GO WITH YOU.

174
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,708
- IT'S JUST A FLIGHT
TO SEE HOW IT'S DOING.

175
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,750
BESIDES, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

176
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,041
- ( screams )

177
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,750
( gasps )

178
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,916
THAT'S AMAZING!

179
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,291
I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO THE
LFO'S THAT COULD FREELY FLY

180
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,208
AROUND THIS WONDERFUL WORLD,
LIKE A SKYFISH.

181
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,916
I LOVED THEM. BUT NOW...

182
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,458
- YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY ARE
A WONDERFUL MECHANIC!

183
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,208
IT'S AS IF YOU KNOW JUST HOW
THE MECHS FEEL!

184
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,791
HUH?

185
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,208
- THIS IS A TOOL THAT'S USED
TO MURDER PEOPLE.

186
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,416
I DON'T CARE HOW IT FEELS.

187
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,666
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
- MMM-HMM.

188
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,041
THIS WORLD IS SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE,

189
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,750
WHY DO PEOPLE
HAVE TO FIGHT EACH OTHER?

190
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,708
- THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
A BIT CURIOUS ABOUT.

191
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,916
EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF LFO
WAS THE TYPE ZERO?

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,916
IT IS A LEGENDARY SHIP.
IT WASN'T NORMAL, WAS IT?

193
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,458
- NO, IT WASN'T NORMAL...

194
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,333
THE NIRVASH DOESN'T
BOOT PROPERLY

195
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,041
WITH JUST AN ORDINARY
COMPAC DRIVE.

196
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,750
YOU NEED A SPECIAL ATTACHMENT
CALLED THE AMITA DRIVE.

197
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,750
- THE AMITA DRIVE?

198
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,583
- RIGHT. THE AMITA DRIVE,

199
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,791
WORKING IN CONJUNCTION
WITH THE COMPAC DRIVE,

200
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,166
BECOMES THE KEY TO
LAUNCH THE SATORI PROGRAM.

201
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,250
- THE SEVEN SWELL?
- YEAH.

202
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,916
HOWEVER, ONCE THEY ARE COMBINED,

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,666
THE TWO DRIVES CAN'T BE
TAKEN OFF AGAIN.

204
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,583
I DONT KNOW WHY, THOUGH.

205
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,291
- I HEARD THAT THE TYPE ZERO
HAD A STRANGE PILOT AS WELL.

206
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,250
- IS THAT TRUE?
- YEAH, VERY STRANGE.

207
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,083
BUT THEN AGAIN, THE
VERY FIRST MOMENT I SAW HER,

208
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,458
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HER
THAT REALLY STRUCK ME.

209
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,708
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY IT WAS
A CASE OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

210
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,375
BUT, THE FEELINGS I HAD
NEVER GOT THROUGH TO HER,

211
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,875
AND I FINALLY BAILED
OUT OF THE GEKKO,

212
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,583
THE FIRST CHANCE I GOT.

213
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,250
- WAIT, THE GEKKO?!

214
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:10,000
- OH, SORRY, I GUESS
I HADN'T TOLD YOU THAT YET.

215
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,541
YOU SEE, BEFORE I BOARDED
THIS SHIP WITH YOU,

216
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,333
I WAS A MEMBER OF GEKKOSTATE.

217
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,875
- ( gasps )

218
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,208
( sighs )

219
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,875
- ( beeping )

220
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,166
- DON'T BE MAD, CHARLES.

221
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,708
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HIDE IT FROM YOU!

222
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,208
BUT, I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF
TO START THIS CONVERSATION.

223
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,875
I'M SORRY.

224
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,541
- I SEE. SO, IS HOLLAND
DOING WELL NOWADAYS?

225
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,125
- HUH?

226
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,416
- ( beeping )

227
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:54,208
- MON-SOONOS? THIS IS BAD!

228
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,791
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

229
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,583
IF WE DON'T MAKE A MOVE FAST,
THEY'RE GOING TO SHOOT US DOWN.

230
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,916
CHARLES!

231
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,958
- FREEDOM IS SOMETHING THAT
YOU NEED TO ACTIVELY ACQUIRE.

232
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,333
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GIVEN
WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

233
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,708
TO BE FREE MEANS
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY,

234
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,916
AND PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR WHAT'S TO COME.

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,916
UNDERSTAND, RENTON?

236
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:39,791
- ( gasps )

237
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,958
( grunting )

238
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:02,416
- I HAVE NO INTENT TO RESIST.
PLEASE STOP THE ATTACKS NOW.

239
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,625
I'M A FREELANCER
FOR THE FEDERATION.

240
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,875
I'M CHARLES BEAMS.

241
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,625
- Milton: CODE CONFIRMED.
SORRY TO HAVE BOTHERED YOU.

242
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:15,083
I'M FIRST LIEUTENANT MILTON
OF STATE ARMY 87KSQ.

243
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,875
WE ENCOUNTERED THE GEKKO IN
THIS AREA, A FEW DAYS AGO,

244
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,291
SO WE'VE BEEN ON CLOSE ALERT.

245
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,458
WE WERE PATROLLING,
WHEN WE SPOTTED YOU.

246
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,291
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY,
I KNOW WHERE YOU GUYS STAND.

247
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,916
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

248
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,333
BUT YOU'RE A SUBCONTRACTING
COURIER, AREN'T YOU?

249
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,625
- I GUESS WE'RE EVEN, RENTON.

250
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,291
WE'RE REALLY FREELANCERS,

251
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,500
WORKING UNDER A RESERVE
UNIT OF THE FEDERATION ARMY.

252
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,458
AT THE MOMENT, WE'RE ON A
MISSION TO TAKE BACK EUREKA,

253
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,416
AS WELL AS THE TYPE ZERO.

254
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,125
- TELL ME, YOU'RE JOKING.
- I CAN'T.

255
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,166
- BUT IT'S A LIE!
- NO, IT ISN'T.

256
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,625
- IT'S A LIE!
- IT'S NOT A LIE.

257
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,250
- IT'S A LIE!
- RENTON!

258
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,875
- TELL ME, IT'S A LIE!

259
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,875
PLEASE, CHARLES!
I'M BEGGING YOU!

260
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,625
I PROMISE, I'LL PRACTICE!

261
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,625
I'LL DO MY BEST TO CALL YOU
GUYS, PAPA AND MAMA!

262
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,166
SO, PLEASE,
TELL ME IT'S NOT TRUE.

263
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,458
TELL ME, IT'S A LIE.

264
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,708
IT'S A LIE!

265
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,041
- GEEZ, I'M SO PATHETIC!

266
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,708
- YOU FINALLY CAME OUT.

267
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,625
IDIOT, MY LEGS ARE
TOTALLY NUMB ALREADY!

268
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,708
HAP SAID HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET SOME INFORMATION,

269
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,625
ON WHERE MASTER NORB IS.

270
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,166
- Charles: THE STATE AND
THE FEDERATION ARMIES

271
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,375
ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO
FORCE THE GEKKO TO A PLACE

272
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,041
WHERE IT CAN BE SHOT DOWN.

273
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,541
THE COORDINATES ARE
ON PAGE 286 ON THE JACKSON MAP.

274
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:04,208
WE BEGIN IN SEVEN DAYS.

275
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,083
I DONT CARE IF YOU
GO BACK TO THE GEKKO

276
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,208
AND TELL THEM THIS INFORMATION.

277
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,666
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT IN
THE CORNER OF YOUR HEART,

278
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,708
YOU'RE FREE TO STAY
ON THIS SHIP.

279
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,500
YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF
RUNNING AWAY FROM BOTH SIDES.

280
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,125
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

281
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,666
- ( Ray sobbing )

282
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,541
- Charles: THE ASSAULT LOCATION
AND DATE WILL NEVER CHANGE.

283
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,500
WE WILL MAKE SURE TO
TAKE THE GEKKO DOWN

284
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,083
AT THAT TIME AND PLACE.

285
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,375
SO, I WANT YOU TO PROMISE
ME SOMETHING.

286
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,375
IF WHAT YOU DECIDE
TO DO IS BASED ON

287
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,000
YOU BEING HONEST WITH YOUR
FEELINGS, WE'LL ACCEPT IT.

288
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,083
PROMISE ME, YOU'LL
SEE IT TO THE END.

289
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,250
- ( grunting )

290
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,958
- CAN I ASK YOU ONE THING?

291
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,625
DID YOU APPROACH ME, KNOWING WHO
I WAS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING?

292
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,625
- OF COURSE, WE KNEW!

293
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,875
( crying )

294
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,458
- THEN, I GUESS,
I'LL BE GOING NOW.

295
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,708
MR. CHARLES AND MRS. RAY,
I WANT TO THANK YOU.

296
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,916
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!

297
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,541
- ( sobbing )

298
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,500
- THAT BOY...

299
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,583
I WONDER IF HE WILL,
GO BACK TO THE GEKKO?

300
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,458
- I'M CERTAIN OF IT.

301
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:16,125
AFTER ALL, THAT BOY,
I MEAN RENTON, IS OUR SON.

302
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,958
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

303
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,333
- ( screaming )

304
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,375
- NO MATTER HOW HOARSE I GET,

305
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,000
IF THIS SCREAM OF MINE CAN
MELT AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS,

306
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,625
THERE'S JUST ONE THING THAT
I WANT TO TELL SOMEONE.

307
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:34,458
EUREKA, RIGHT NOW,
I REALLY NEED TO SEE YOU!

308
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,375
- PLEASE! I HAVE TO GO
WHERE RENTON IS!

309
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,833
YOU NEED HIM TOO,
