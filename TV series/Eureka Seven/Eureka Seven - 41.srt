1
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,166
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,958
- Renton:
THAT'S MISS SAKUYA?

3
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,458
WELL, UM, I--

4
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,791
I MEAN, THAT'S A--
A FLOWER BUD.

5
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,083
ISN'T IT?

6
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,583
- Norb:
DO YOU FEEL IT?

7
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,125
- MM-HMM.

8
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,458
- ( chuckles )

9
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,958
LET'S GO.

10
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,541
- UH, RIGHT.

11
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,791
- ( grunts )

12
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,666
- ALL OF YOU, I WANT YOU
TO STAY WITH NIRVASH.

13
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,000
- ( whimpering )

14
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,916
- NO, I WANNA GO WITH YOU!

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,041
- ME TOO.

16
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,625
- OH?

17
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,833
- JUST WAIT HERE.

18
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,541
- ( gunfire )

19
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,166
- Holland: MATTHIEU, DID YOU GET
IN CONTACT WITH THE GEKKO YET?

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,541
- Matthieu: NOT YET.

21
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,000
- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.
ARE ALL THREE COMMUNICATORS

22
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,500
WE BROUGHT WITH US
BROKEN?

23
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,708
- NO, THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THEM.

24
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,208
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING
ON THE AUDIBLE FREQUENCIES.

25
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,083
ALL THAT I'M GETTING IS US.

26
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,500
AND THE NOISE FROM
THE SOLDIER MONKS'

27
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,208
DIGITAL ENCRYPTION SIGNALS.

28
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,208
- Holland:
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE HERE.

29
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,083
YOU NOTICED THAT THESE
DAMN SOLDIER MONKS

30
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,833
AREN'T ATTACKING US
OVER THE WALLS?

31
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,291
- THE WALL SEEMS TO HOLD
A SECRET AFTER ALL.

32
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,458
- Hilda: IT'S NO GOOD, LEADER.
- HUH?

33
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,541
- I SHOOT AT THEM,
BUT THEY KEEP SPROUTING.

34
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,833
IT'S LIKE I'M SHOOTING
INTO A PRACTICE WALL.

35
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,291
- I KNOW THAT! YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT

36
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,166
UNTIL RENTON COMES BACK.

37
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,541
- HITTING THE WALL?

38
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,875
( chuckles )

39
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,541
MY HONEY SAYS
GOOD THINGS TO ME.

40
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,875
- YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

41
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,083
- JUST WATCH THIS.

42
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,083
I'M GONNA SEND
AN ENCRYPTED SIGNAL

43
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,541
TO THE GEKKO RIGHT NOW.

44
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,208
- ( beeping )

45
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,750
- WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

46
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,750
- I MEAN,
I'M HITTING THE WALL.

47
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,916
- YOU'RE WHAT?

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,916
- Matthieu:
ANY SIGNAL I SEND FROM HERE

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,750
IMMEDIATELY BOUNCES BACK

50
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,708
AS IF I'M HITTING
A BIG INVISIBLE WALL.

51
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,916
- Holland:
AN INVISIBLE WALL.

52
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,083
- IT IS A FLOWER BUD
AFTER ALL.

53
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,041
SO THEN IS LADY SAKUYA INSIDE?

54
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,916
( gasps )

55
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,291
- IT REALLY HAS BEEN
A LONG TIME,

56
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,625
MY LADY SAKUYA.

57
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,958
HMM.

58
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,958
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

59
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,625
THIS IS THE NIRVASH,

60
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,625
BROUGHT BY EUREKA AND RENTON.

61
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,250
RENTON, I'M CURIOUS
AS TO WHAT YOU THINK

62
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,041
IS ACTUALLY
BEYOND THE GREAT WALL.

63
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,791
- HUH?
- WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE

64
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,166
IS WAITING THERE FOR YOU

65
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,458
BEYOND THAT
MYSTERIOUS DOORWAY?

66
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,458
- I DON'T KNOW.

67
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,166
- IF THE SLEEPING SCUB CORALS
CREATED EUREKA

68
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,333
AND LADY SAKUYA
AS THEIR MAIN MEDIATORS

69
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,333
FOR CONVERSATIONS
WITH HUMANS,

70
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,958
IF THE NIRVASH
WAS A SHIP THAT APPEARED

71
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,000
SO THAT YOU TWO
COULD GO PAST THE ZONE

72
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,750
BEYOND THE GREAT WALL,

73
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,291
IF YOU HEARD ALL THAT,

74
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,666
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK?

75
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,166
- I-- I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

76
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,125
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

77
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,166
- LADY SAKUYA AND I
ONCE MADE AN ATTEMPT

78
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,666
TO SEE PAST THE ZONE
AND THE GREAT WALL.

79
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,333
BUT WE FAILED.
WE NEVER GOT THERE.

80
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,000
- EUREKA!

81
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,000
- DON'T WORRY.

82
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,000
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

83
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,041
- EUREKA!

84
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,125
- SHE BEARS A STRIKING
RESEMBLANCE

85
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,750
TO LADY SAKUYA
WHO I LOVED.

86
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:36,875
- ( gasps )

87
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,875
- ( giggles )

88
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,750
- Man: UNDERSTAND...

89
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,166
YOU MUST NOT SPEAK
EVEN A SINGLE WORD

90
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,250
IN THE PRESENCE
OF THE SAINT.

91
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,750
DO NOT TAINT HER
WITH THE REFUSE

92
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,458
OF THIS MISERABLE WORLD.

93
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,750
- Young Norb:
BUT AM I QUALIFIED

94
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,708
TO TAKE CARE OF
THE REQUIRED EVERY DAY DUTIES?

95
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,083
- IT'S NOT LIKE
THE SAINT CAN'T DO

96
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,958
ANYTHING SHE NEEDS TO
BY HERSELF, OR SHE CAN.

97
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,291
WE JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

98
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,583
AND IT WAS A UNANIMOUS DECISION
BY THE COUNCIL OF HIGH PRIESTS

99
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,916
THAT YOU WERE QUALIFIED
TO BE THAT SOMEONE.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,875
IT'LL FEEL AS NATURAL
AS HAVING TWO EYES AND A NOSE.

101
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,916
I CANNOT ENTER ANY FURTHER
THAN THIS POINT HERE.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,541
MAY EVERYTHING BE
AS THE VODARAC GUIDES US.

103
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,583
- ( door opens )

104
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,208
( door closes )

105
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,000
- ( gasps )

106
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,208
- BOO!
- ( gasps )

107
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,208
- HOW DO YOU DO,
EUREKA?

108
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,833
- PLEASED TO MEET YOU,
SAKUYA.

109
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,500
- Norb: I WASN'T TOLD THAT
THE SAINT WAS A YOUNG GIRL.

110
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,166
( chuckles )
NO.

111
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,833
NO, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE.

112
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,166
SHE WAS A GIRL
BORN FROM THE LAND.

113
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,833
AND SO WE SELFISHLY
SET HER UP AS A SAINT.

114
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,000
- Sakuya:
I'M SO HAPPY.

115
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,250
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN REALLY
WANTING TO MEET YOU FOR AWHILE.

116
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,708
YOU'RE ONLY THE SECOND PERSON
TO EVER COME VISIT ME

117
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,208
INSIDE OF MY HEART.

118
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,541
YOU'RE MY FIRST GUEST
IN 40 YEARS.

119
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,875
- I'VE WANTED
TO MEET YOU TOO.

120
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,833
- HEY, WILL YOU
LISTEN TO MY STORY?

121
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,416
I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG

122
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,166
TO HAVE SOMEONE
I COULD TELL IT TO.

123
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,708
IT'S ABOUT ME

124
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,041
AND NORB.

125
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,750
- Norb:
THE COUNCIL OF HIGH PRIESTS

126
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,500
APPOINTED ME CARETAKER.

127
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,833
BUT WHAT I WOULD BE DOING
WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE START.

128
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,375
CLEAN UP HER ROOM,

129
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,875
GET HER CLEAN CLOTHING,

130
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,875
CHANGE THE OIL
IN ALL THE LAMPS,

131
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,541
AND BRING IN HER MEALS.

132
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,541
IT WASN'T LIKE THERE
WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL

133
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,875
THAT ONLY I COULD DO.

134
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,625
AND I COULD DO NOTHING
OF MY OWN ACCORD.

135
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,541
NEVERTHELESS,

136
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,500
SHE ALWAYS WORE
A GLOOMY LOOK.

137
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,000
AND SHE WOULD ONLY EAT
ONE BITE OF HER MEALS.

138
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,958
NOW USUALLY YOU'D WANT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,458
- Sakuya:
I MEAN, REALLY.

140
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,916
IT TASTED AWFUL.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,333
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

142
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,916
I WASN'T MOVING AROUND
THAT MUCH,

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,916
SO I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
EAT IT ALL.

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,083
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
ALL DAY.

145
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,250
AND NO ONE WOULD
SPEAK A WORD TO ME.

146
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,583
IT WAS BORING.

147
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,958
THAT IS UNTIL...

148
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,541
ONE DAY, THINGS CHANGED.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,916
- HUH?

150
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,291
- Young Norb: NO, DON'T!
- ( gasps )

151
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,625
- THAT IS A LOTUS FLOWER
FROM THE LAKE, MY LADY.

152
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,208
OHH!

153
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,625
- LOTUS?

154
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,791
LOTUS?

155
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,125
- ME?  NO, MA'AM.

156
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,625
I'M NORB, YOUR SERVANT.

157
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,958
( gasps )

158
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,750
( muffled murmurs )

159
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,875
- ( chuckles )

160
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,583
THANK YOU.

161
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,875
- HMM?

162
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,666
- Norb: IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I SAW LADY SAKUYA SMILE.

163
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,458
AND AT THAT MOMENT...

164
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,666
- ( giggles )

165
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,666
I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

166
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,333
- REALLY?
- ( giggles )

167
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,458
I JUST COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

168
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,166
EVERY ONE OF THE MONKS
THAT HAD TENDED TO ME

169
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,333
BEFORE NORB GOT HERE
WERE ALL DOUR AND UPTIGHT.

170
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,875
BUT NORB REALLY
SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET.

171
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,833
NOT ONLY THAT,

172
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,583
NORB WAS THE ONE WHO
TAUGHT ME HOW TO SMILE.

173
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,041
- Hilda: YOU SURE IT'LL
BE ALL RIGHT, LEADER?

174
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,083
- Holland:
I DON'T CARE!

175
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,041
SHOOT A BEAM UP
TOWARDS THE SKY.

176
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,041
- GUESS I DON'T CARE EITHER.

177
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,541
WHAT THE--?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

178
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,291
- IS THIS WALL ACTING AS SOME
KIND OF BARRIER OR SOMETHING?

179
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,916
- Holland:
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,416
UNTIL RENTON AND THE OTHERS
MAKE THEIR WAY BACK,

181
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,208
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS TO GUARD AGAINST ATTACKS

182
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,125
FROM THAT DIRECTION.

183
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,416
- Hilda: ROGER THAT.

184
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,375
- SAKUYA NEVER SHOWED
EVEN A HINT OF A SMILE

185
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,708
TO ANYONE ELSE
IN HER LIFE.

186
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,291
HER SMILE WAS SOMETHING
THAT WAS MINE

187
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,625
AND MINE ALONE.

188
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,208
- ( gasps )

189
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,125
- ( people gasping, chattering )

190
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,291
( screaming )

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,791
- Young Norb: AAH!

192
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,125
( grunting )

193
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,750
( sighs )

194
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,333
( gasps )

195
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,791
HUH?

196
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,416
- ( gasps )

197
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,583
- THE GLIMMER OF THE COMPAC.

198
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,583
BEAUTIFUL.

199
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,208
- ( gasps )
- ( chuckles )

200
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,583
- OH, NORB.

201
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,083
NORB.

202
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,083
- ( gasps )

203
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,458
- Sakuya:
HIS HAND WAS SO WARM,

204
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,125
SO GENTLE.

205
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,458
I WISHED THAT NIGHT
COULD HAVE LASTED FOREVER.

206
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,958
I THOUGHT THAT I WOULDN'T
MIND BEING IN PRISON LIKE THAT

207
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,458
IF ONLY HE COULD BE WITH ME.

208
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,458
( sighs )
BUT THEN...

209
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,625
- THE DAY FINALLY CAME.

210
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,333
- HUH?

211
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,833
- Young Norb: I AM TO GO TO
THE GREAT WALL WITH LADY SAKUYA?

212
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,041
- Man: I HAVE BEEN INFORMED
THAT THE SAINT TO WHOM

213
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,833
WE HAVE TAUGHT
NOT ONE WORD

214
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,708
SPOKE OUT YOUR NAME,
LORD NORB.

215
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,833
- ( gasps )

216
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,833
- THE SAINT HAS MADE
HER SACRED CHOICE.

217
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,666
TO HEAD TO ETERNITY,

218
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,541
TO PREACH OUR
DEEPEST DESIRES,

219
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,500
AND TO RID THE NEGATIVE
CHAINS WE HAVE WITH THE LAND.

220
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,166
YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN,
MASTER NORB.

221
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,833
- I'M A LINK

222
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,791
BETWEEN HUMANS AND LAND?

223
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,500
SO I AM.

224
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,791
- ( cheering )

225
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,166
- YEAH!

226
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,416
MASTER NORB!

227
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,208
- Young Norb: FORGIVE ME
FOR THE PROFANITIES

228
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,291
THAT WILL ENTER YOUR EARS.

229
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,875
IF I AM ABLE TO
ACCOMPANY LADY SAKUYA,

230
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,208
GET PAST THE GATES,

231
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,875
AND LINK HUMANS
AND THE LAND,

232
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,208
IT WILL BE WONDERFUL.

233
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,083
ESPECIALLY TO BE ABLE
TO SEEK OUT

234
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,208
THE MEANING OF EXISTENCE.

235
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,375
HOWEVER,

236
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,833
IF I HAD NOT SPOKEN
MY NAME BACK THEN,

237
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,791
LADY SAKUYA WOULD NOT
HAVE CHOSEN ME.

238
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,750
( gasps )

239
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,583
- ( sighs )

240
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,583
YOU'RE WRONG.

241
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,583
- FORGIVE ME, DEAR SAINT.

242
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,916
I'M NOT WORTHY.

243
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,791
- ( crowd murmuring )

244
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,000
- THIS IS THE SACRED
LIGHT OF THE LAND.

245
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,875
TRULY A MAJESTIC SIGHT.

246
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,916
- ( shouts )

247
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,041
- Sakuya: NORB!

248
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,916
NORB!

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,916
NORB, WAIT.  COME BACK!

250
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,291
COME BACK!

251
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,458
( yelps )

252
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,833
- ( gasps )

253
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,958
LADY SAKUYA!

254
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,958
- NORB!

255
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,916
- LADY SAKUYA.

256
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,291
( whimpers )

257
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,541
LADY SAKUYA.

258
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,958
- OH, NORB.

259
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,541
I LOVE YOU.

260
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,958
- SAKUYA.

261
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,291
SAKUYA.

262
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,500
SAKUYA.

263
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,708
SAKUYA.

264
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,666
SAKUYA!

265
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,750
SAKUYA!

266
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,000
( grunts )

267
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,250
( gasps )

268
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,666
AAH.

269
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,208
SAKUYA?

270
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,666
SAKUYA.

271
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,500
( yelps )

272
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,666
( crying )

273
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,041
( screams )

274
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,750
- Norb: IF ONLY I HADN'T
PULLED THE COMPAC DRIVE

275
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,083
OUT OF HER BACK THEN.

276
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,000
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING?

277
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,666
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

278
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,375
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
LADY SAKUYA

279
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,708
TURNED HERSELF INTO
THE SHAPE OF A FLOWER BUD,

280
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,833
AND THAT A COMPAC DRIVE
WAS EMBEDDED INTO MY CHEST.

281
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,708
AND THE SAD FACT
THAT SHE AND I

282
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,375
WERE NOT ABLE TO
BREAK THROUGH THE ZONE.

283
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,708
- ( giggles )
REALLY, IT WAS A BIG FAILURE.

284
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,458
BUT LISTEN TO THIS,

285
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,458
I FOUND OUT BACK THEN...

286
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,958
- HMM?

287
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,583
- THAT YOU WOULD BE BORN,
EUREKA.

288
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,750
- HUH?

289
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,083
SAKUYA.

290
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,625
- ( stammering )

291
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,041
- Norb: I'M SURE THAT
TIME WITHIN THE ZONE

292
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,750
REMAINS STANDING STILL

293
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,291
AND IS WAITING FOR
THE COMPAC DRIVE IN MY CHEST

294
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,750
TO RETURN TO LADY SAKUYA.

295
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,416
NO.

296
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,083
NO, IT WOULDN'T BE WAITING.

297
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,958
THE LAND IS JUST EXISTING.

298
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,416
WATCHING OVER ALL OF US
WHO CALL IT HOME.

299
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,083
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN TOUGH.
- HMM?

300
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,291
- OH, BUT I HAVE
NO REGRETS AT ALL.

301
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,583
WHEN I HEARD HIM CALL OUT
MY NAME LIKE HE DID,

302
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,083
I FELT THAT HE AND I HAD
FINALLY BECOME ONE.

303
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,583
I WAS HAPPY.

304
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,500
BECAUSE HOW I FEEL
ABOUT NORB IS...

305
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,958
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

306
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,791
I MEAN, YOU AND RENTON.

307
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,125
( giggles )

308
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,125
YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M JUST
A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS OF YOU.

309
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,375
- YOU'RE JEALOUS?

310
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,666
- I MEAN, YOU HAVE
SO MANY THINGS, EUREKA.

311
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,833
I WISH I HAD THEM TOO.

312
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,791
AH, JUST KIDDING.

313
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,125
DON'T WORRY.

314
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,125
I'M SURE YOU TWO
WILL BECOME ONE.

315
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,666
- ( murmurs )

316
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,333
- IT'S NOT A SCARY THING.

317
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,833
IT'LL BE WONDERFUL.

318
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,500
YOU KNOW, HE'S HEAD OVER HEELS
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

319
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,666
- MM-HMM.

320
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,500
- I'M SURE HE'S
GONNA BE NICE TO YOU.

321
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,833
YOU HAVE TO BECOME HAPPY,
EUREKA.

322
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,916
- SO DO YOU.

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,166
- OH.

324
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,875
MM-HMM.

325
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,875
- MM.

326
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,416
- WELL, IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR THE BUS TO LEAVE.

327
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,833
SEE YOU LATER, EUREKA.

328
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,583
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
- HMM?

329
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,750
- YOU TRIED TO
GO BACK ONCE, RIGHT?

330
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,750
YOU WANT ME TO
FIX THE SCARS?

331
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,958
- THESE ARE THE OUTWARD PROOF

332
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,916
THAT I'VE LIVED TO THIS DAY.

333
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,250
- MM-HMM.

334
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,750
YOU'RE SO STRONG-WILLED,
EUREKA.

335
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,208
- WHAT IS THIS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

336
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,708
A TECTONIC SHIFT?

337
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,375
- Hilda: HOLD ON A SECOND.
LEADER!

338
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,916
LOOK, ABOVE US!
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

339
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,083
THE BARRIER.

340
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,625
IT DISAPPEARED.

341
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,750
- ( sighs )

342
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:51,750
- ( gasps )

343
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,250
EUREKA!

344
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,958
- ( sighs )

345
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,916
- EUREKA, YOU ALL RIGHT?

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,583
- YES, I'M FINE.

347
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,375
- EUREKA, WHAT DID
LADY SAKUYA SAY?

348
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,958
- SHE TOLD US
TO BECOME HAPPY.

349
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,958
- I SEE, LADY SAKUYA.

350
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,125
I SEE.

351
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,250
- Both: HUH?

352
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,625
- RADAR CONFIRMS
COMPAC INTERFERENCE WAVES.

353
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,958
BATTLESHIPS ARE APPROACHING
THE VODARA SHRINE

354
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,125
COMING IN FROM 9:00
AND MOVING FAST.

355
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,291
THREE SHIPS.

356
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,916
- WHERE'S HOLLAND
AND THE OTHERS?

357
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,125
- COM LINK RESTORED.

358
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,416
- PATCH THE LINE OVER HERE.

359
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,291
HOLLAND, WE CAN REACH
THE SKY ABOVE YOU

360
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,458
IN EIGHT MINUTES.

361
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,125
ARE YOU READY FOR PICKUP?
- Holland: NO!

362
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,791
RENTON'S GROUP
HASN'T COME BACK YET.

363
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,500
- THREE FEDERATION ARMY SHIPS
ARE APPROACHING FAST.

364
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,250
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
HOLLAND?

365
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,625
AT THIS RATE--
- Holland: WE'LL GUARD THIS SPOT

366
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,833
WITH OUR LIVES.

367
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,291
THAT'S THE PROMISE
I MADE TO RENTON.

368
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,291
- I KNOW.  BUT HOLLAND--
- BE SURE YOU MAKE

369
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,000
THE FIRST MOVE
WITH THE GEKKO

370
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,875
NO MATTER WHAT!
( gasps )

371
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,666
( grunting )

372
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,791
- HOLLAND!

373
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,000
- WE'RE ALL RIGHT.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

374
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,333
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF DYING HERE.

375
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,333
GOT THAT?
WE WON'T DIE.

376
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,291
I WON'T LET ANYONE DIE!

377
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,750
- WE'LL SURVIVE.

378
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,291
EVEN IF WE'RE ALL
SHOT TO PIECES

379
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,333
AND COUGHING UP BLOOD!

380
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,333
- TO BE CONTINUED.

381
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,666
- ( theme music playing )

382
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,416
- Narrator: THE LAND AWAKENS
FROM THE REPEATED ATTACKS.

383
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,958
THE BOY AND THE GIRL
ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK

384
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,125
TOWARDS THE FUTURE,

385
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,958
AND THE ADULTS
RISK THEIR LIVES

386
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,416
TO SUPPORT THEM.

387
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,375
