1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,875
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,500
♪ YOU GOT TO REMEMBER ♪

4
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,833
♪ WE WANT TO MAKE
THE DREAM COME TRUE ♪

5
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,375
♪ YOU GOT TO REMEMBER ♪

6
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,458
- WOW, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CLOUD.

7
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,041
- A MACKEREL SKY.
- HUH?

8
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,458
YEAH, IT'S A TYPE OF CLOUD THAT
CAN FORETELL A TECTONIC SHIFT.

9
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,083
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A REF BOARDER,

10
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,416
THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

11
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:58,791
- RIGHT.

12
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,500
- WRINKLES.

13
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,666
IF YOU KEEP THAT UP,

14
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,375
YOUR FOREHEAD WILL BE
FULL OF WRINKLES!

15
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,333
WE'RE BOTH ABOUT
TO GO OVER THE HILL.

16
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,583
- GEEZ, DON'T SURPRISE ME
LIKE THAT.

17
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,958
- ( laughs ) JUST WATCH OUT
FOR THOSE WRINKLES.

18
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,208
- HEY, SHUT UP. YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT NEEDS TO WORRY.

19
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,541
THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING YOU.

20
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,166
- WE BOTH NEED TO BE CAREFUL.
- I AM GOING NOW.

21
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,041
- LET ME REMIND YOU, YOU'RE
A YEAR OLDER THAN I AM.

22
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,750
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

23
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,250
- ALL RIGHT, KIDS, IT'S FINE
TO GO IN AND SEE HER.

24
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,458
- ( all exclaim in joy )

25
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,708
MAMA!

26
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,208
- HI, YOU GUYS.

27
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,666
- I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

28
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,625
I'M SO SORRY.

29
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,291
- HERE. THESE ARE THE INVOICES
FOR THIS MONTH.

30
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,916
- RIGHT, THANKS A LOT, MISCHA.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,083
SO, I HEARD RENTON DISAPPEARED
LAST NIGHT. IS THAT TRUE?

32
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,083
- YES, APPARENTLY HE
SNUCK HIS WAY IN HERE

33
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,083
BEFORE HE LEFT AND SAW EUREKA.

34
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,166
SHE WON'T TELL US
ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,625
- AH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT KID IS SPINELESS.

36
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,500
SO, DOES SHE KNOW
RENTON RAN AWAY?

37
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,791
SHE'D BE PRETTY UPSET.

38
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,333
- THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF NEWS
SHE SHOULD BE GETTING FROM ME.

39
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,291
- THAT'S TRUE.

40
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,500
BUT, I HEARD HE LEFT A NOTE.

41
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,833
- THE FACT THAT HE WROTE
PLEASE DON'T LOOK FOR ME,

42
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,958
MEANS HE WANTS US
TO LOOK FOR HIM.

43
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,875
IN A WAY, HE'S ENTERED
SOME SORT OF REBELLIOUS PHASE.

44
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,333
- IT'S SOMETHING TO BE EXPECTED

45
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,833
FROM A BOY WHO HAS MOVED
INTO HIS ADOLESCENCE.

46
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,416
- THOUGH IT DID COME LATE.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,708
- BUT FROM OUR VIEWPOINT,

48
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,333
GROWTH IS NOTHING
BUT A BIG HINDRANCE

49
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,333
TO THOSE GUYS WHO AREN'T
THERE WHEN WE NEED THEM.

50
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,666
- YOUR ATTITUDE IS A BIT HARSH,
ISN'T IT?

51
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,958
- I THINK THEY ARE COWARDS.

52
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,083
- LET'S FACE IT, OF ALL
THE GUYS ON THIS SHIP,

53
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,333
THE LEADER HIMSELF IS RIGHT
SMACK IN THE MIDDLE

54
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,000
OF THE INSANITY OF PUBERTY.

55
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,291
- SO, WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
LEADER IS THINKING OF DOING NOW?

56
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,708
- I'M SORRY.

57
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,458
I'M SORRY.

58
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,666
I'M SO SORRY.

59
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,750
I'M SORRY.

60
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,625
- HMM.

61
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,875
I'M THE ONE WHO
OUGHT TO BE SORRY.

62
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,208
- ( gasps ) IT'S GONE!

63
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,166
GONE! GONE! GONE!

64
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,625
( sighs )

65
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,750
- ( zipper unzips )

66
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,583
- ( urinates )

67
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,791
- ( sighs )

68
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,625
- Hap: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

69
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,333
- YOU MADE THE FLOW STOP.

70
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,166
- WE HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD
EUREKA YET.

71
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,291
- I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST CLUE.

72
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,625
- WE'RE COUNTING
ON YOU, OH, LEADER.

73
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,916
- BUT...
- HMM?

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,625
- BEING ABLE TO ANNOUNCE HIS
FEELINGS LIKE THAT IS JUST...

75
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,833
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE BOTH
YOU AND I WERE NUISANCES

76
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,666
TO OUR ELDERS AND SIBLINGS
WHEN WE WERE KIDS, TOO.

77
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,166
YOU KNOW, LIKE
HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF?

78
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,375
OH, SORRY.

79
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,333
THE BAD THING ABOUT
CHILDHOOD FRIENDS

80
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,208
IS THAT YOU DON'T
HOLD ANYTHING BACK.

81
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,666
- TRUE ENOUGH.
- HUH?

82
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,500
- THAT'S WEIRD.
IT'S UNLIKE HIM.

83
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,708
- ( toilet flushes )

84
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,208
- NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL.

85
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,875
- Renton: I DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN
OR ANYTHING.

86
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,125
I JUST WANTED TO GO
AS FAR AWAY AS I COULD.

87
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,625
BUT, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I REALIZED

88
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,708
AFTER I FOUND MYSELF ALONE.

89
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:40,541
SO MANY THINGS HAD HAPPENED,
AND I HAD NO PLACE OF MY OWN.

90
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,333
BUT THERE, ON THE GEKKO,
I WAS NEVER ALONE.

91
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,250
I'M SO TIRED NOW.

92
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,583
I CAN'T THINK ANY MORE.

93
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,250
- ( upbeat dance music playing )

94
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,458
- ( gasps )

95
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,041
- ( techno music playing )

96
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,291
- WHOO.
- ( chuckles )

97
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,208
- HEY, BOY. WHERE'D YOU
COME FROM?

98
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,916
DID SOMEONE
GIVE YOU THE FLYER?

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,833
- UH, WELL, I'M TRAVELING
WITH NOTHING BUT MY BOARD.

100
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,625
- OH, A HANDMADE ONE.

101
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,458
THAT'S A GOOD BOARD
YOU GOT THERE.

102
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,041
- OH, NO, IT REALLY
ISN'T NOT THAT GOOD.

103
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,125
- AND THE HEART WITHIN?

104
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,291
A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY PERHAPS?

105
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,541
( laughs ) ADOLESCENCE!

106
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,583
HI, KID. MY NAME
IS CHARLES BEAMS.

107
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,041
NICE TO MEET YOU.

108
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,916
- UH, HI, I'M RENTON.

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,125
- RENTON? THINK I HAVE
HEARD THAT NAME BEFORE?

110
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,416
OH, WELL, YEAH.

111
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
THAT'S A NAME YOU CAN HEAR
JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE.

112
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,875
( laughs )

113
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,583
HEY, WHAT WAS FUNNY ABOUT
ANYTHING THAT I JUST SAID.

114
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,666
YOU DO KNOW I WAS MOCKING YOU.

115
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,833
- YEAH, I KIND OF
FIGURED THAT OUT.

116
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,333
- HMM?

117
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,666
BUT, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE
ANYONE SAID ANYTHING TO ME.

118
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,291
SO, I GUESS I COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

119
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,583
- SORRY.
- I SEE.

120
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,958
- LOOK, OVER THERE.
- HUH?

121
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,125
- NOT THE DJ.
- OH.

122
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,583
- DAMN, SHE'S ONE HOT BABE.

123
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,416
- SHE'S JUST SO CHARMING,
RIGHT, RENTON, MY BOY?

124
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,250
- SURE.

125
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,875
- THE SAME SONG,
BUT A LITTLE DIFFERENT?

126
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,750
- THIS SONG
IS THIS YEAR'S BIG ANTHEM.

127
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,958
WE ALREADY GOT
A BOOTLEG REMIX OF THE TRACK.

128
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,250
- BUT THE ORIGINAL VERSION
IS REALLY THE BEST.

129
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:53,958
- RIGHT.

130
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,333
- BUT THEY ARE SLIPPING.

131
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,625
THEY ARE USING
A VERTICAL FADE MIXER.

132
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:01,083
I PREFER THE OLD ROTARIES.
THE MIXING IS SO MUCH SMOOTHER.

133
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,291
- SURE.
- HMM?

134
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,083
- ( gasps )

135
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,708
- SOME MUDDY SOUNDS HAVE
STARTED TO ENTER THE BASS TRACK,

136
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,541
DON'T YOU THINK?

137
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,750
- ( gasps )

138
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,958
- IS THIS A TECTONIC SHIFT?
- RAY!

139
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,958
- ( screams )

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,125
( panting )

141
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,791
- ( all screaming )

142
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,208
- HUH?

143
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,791
- HMM? ( gasps )

144
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,958
- AH, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, MISS.

145
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,166
- ( chuckles )

146
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,875
- WANT A DRINK?
- HUH?

147
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,666
- SO, RENTON, WE MEET AGAIN.

148
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,458
LET ME INTRODUCE
MY DARLING WIFE TO YOU.

149
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,541
- I'M RAY. NICE TO MEET YOU.

150
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,583
- YOU ARE GOING TO LIKE THIS.

151
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,375
I BOUGHT SOME SPARE LINGERIE.

152
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,958
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT
FEELING WELL,

153
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,708
AS A GIRL YOU SHOULD
CARE HOW YOU LOOK.

154
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,833
- THANK YOU.

155
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,250
- EUREKA, YOU REALLY
HAVE CHANGED.

156
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,541
- YOU THINK SO?

157
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,500
- HERE.

158
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,708
- THANKS.

159
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,500
- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE ALWAYS
SEEMED REALLY HARD TO APPROACH.

160
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,166
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ALL COLD AND
DETACHED AND INDIFFERENT AND,

161
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,500
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT WHAT WE DO.

162
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,458
- INDIFFERENT?

163
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,583
- BUT THEN, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO SIT DOWN

164
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,000
AND PROPERLY TALK IT OUT
WITH YOU, EUREKA.

165
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,500
- WHY IS THAT?

166
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,958
- WELL, YOU SEE, I REALLY
ADMIRE GIRL TO GIRL FRIENDSHIP,

167
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,375
LIKE WHAT TALHO
AND HILDA HAVE GOING.

168
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,291
IT'S SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

169
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,333
BUT, THE SAD FACT
IS THAT THOSE TWO

170
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,541
HAVE ALWAYS TREATED ME LIKE

171
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,333
I AM SOME KIND OF DUMB
LITTLE GIRL.

172
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,583
- FRIENDSHIP?
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

173
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,583
- SO, LIKE, IF YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TROUBLING YOU,

174
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,041
YOU COME AND TELL ME.
WHATEVER IT IS.

175
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,708
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT VERY BRIGHT,

176
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,375
SO, I AM SURE I WON'T
UNDERSTAND ALL THE REALLY

177
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,541
COMPLICATED STUFF,
LIKE OUR LEADERS DO.

178
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,125
AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,
I'LL BE OF NO HELP TO YOU.

179
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,833
HEY, YOU. SO, HOW ABOUT IT?

180
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,041
- HMM?
- ABOUT HIM.

181
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,958
- WHICH HIM?
- RENTON.

182
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,500
I MEAN, COME ON, THAT'S
THE ONLY POSSIBLE REASON

183
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,916
YOU'D CHANGE SO MUCH.

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,208
WHEN RENTON CAME,

185
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,583
YOU STARTED TO SMILE
A LOT MORE. I UNDERSTAND.

186
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,625
OH, IT'S NOT ABOUT
RENTON, THOUGH.

187
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,250
IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU START
SMILING JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM.

188
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,125
- START SMILING?

189
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,083
I START TO SMILE?

190
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,541
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

191
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,875
NOW AS FOR ME,

192
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,500
IT'S TRUE THAT I REALLY
LIKE DOGGIE'S PRETTY FACE,

193
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,750
BUT MORE THAN THAT,
HE'S SO PATHETIC

194
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,083
THAT WHEN I WATCH HIM,

195
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:18,083
I JUST WANT TO SCOOP HIM UP
AND HELP HIM ALONG.

196
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,958
I'M SORRY, I'M DOING
ALL OF THE TALKING HERE.

197
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,833
WELL, GOT TO GO.

198
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,833
- TO RENTON.
- HUH?

199
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:30,208
- I WANT TO TALK TO RENTON
ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

200
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,958
BUT, RIGHT NOW, I'M AFRAID
TO EVEN LOOK AT HIS FACE.

201
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,083
I WONDER WHY?

202
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,333
- (sighs )

203
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,666
- YOU KNOW WHAT, EUREKA,

204
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,750
YOU BETTER CURB
THAT NAIVETY OF YOURS

205
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,500
OR THE OTHER GIRLS
WILL HATE YOU.

206
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,208
I MEAN, IT'S ALL BECAUSE
YOU'RE IN LOVE.

207
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,916
- LOVE?
- YEAH, IN LOVE.

208
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,875
- Renton: AMAZING! YOU GUYS
REALLY KEEP IT NEAT.

209
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,291
- Ray: THANK YOU.

210
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,291
- THIS IS SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE
FROM THAT OTHER SHIP.

211
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,375
- IF IT'S A COMPLIMENT,
IT'S UNNECESSARY.

212
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,166
- NO, THAT'S ISN'T WHAT I MEANT.

213
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,000
- HEY, KIDS WILL BE KIDS.

214
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,750
DON'T WORRY ABOUT BEING
SO CONSIDERATE OF ADULTS.

215
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,750
YOU CAN ONLY BE
A KID FOR SO LONG,

216
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,958
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY IT.

217
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,541
- IN THE END, I TOOK FULL
ADVANTAGE OF WHAT HE SAID TO ME.

218
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,791
IF THAT TECTONIC SHIFT
HADN'T OCCURRED,

219
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,208
MAYBE I WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

220
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,750
AVAIL MYSELF OF THEIR OFFER.

221
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,041
- Charles: I WON'T GIVE YOU ANY.
THEY'RE ALL MINE.

222
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,250
- HUH?

223
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,875
- SORRY, I WAS STARING.

224
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,791
DID YOU START RIDING RECENTLY?

225
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,750
- HEY, I WAS BORN WITH
A BOARD ATTACHED TO MY FEET.

226
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,583
- BUT...

227
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,291
YOU CAN'T MAKE REALLY
QUICK MANEUVERS

228
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,666
WITH THE BOARD MADE LIKE THIS.

229
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,916
THE WHEEL'S PRETTY BIG,

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,250
SO, THE NUMBER OF TRICKS
YOU CAN DO IS LIMITED.

231
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,583
- I SEE.

232
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,583
SO, IT'S HIP FOR REAL BOARDERS
TO GO WHEEL LESS?

233
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,041
- WHAT?

234
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,500
- THAT'S WHAT THE MAGAZINES
MAYBE WRITING THESE DAYS,

235
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,583
BUT WHAT OTHERS THINK,

236
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,916
IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER IN LIFTING,

237
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,041
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HAVING FUN,
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

238
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,083
- ( exclaims )

239
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,375
- AT ANY GIVEN TIME
IN THIS WORLD,

240
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,416
THE ONE WHO FEELS PLEASURE
IS THE WINNER.

241
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,666
AM I WRONG?

242
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,666
- IT FELT LIKE HE WAS SAYING
THE RIGHT THING.

243
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,916
BECAUSE IT WAS IN RAY=OUT.

244
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,291
BECAUSE I LOOKED UP TO HOLLAND.

245
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,958
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVED THAT
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GEKKOSTATE

246
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,250
WAS A GOOD THING,

247
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,125
WITHOUT THINKING IT THROUGH.

248
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,625
- HEY, BOY.
- YES?

249
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,791
- HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU
SOMETHING GOOD? HMM?

250
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,041
- SO COOL!

251
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,458
- WOW.
- YOU LIKE IT?

252
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,083
- I WON'T GIVE IT TO YOU.

253
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,916
- HUH? HEY, WAIT.

254
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,416
I DON'T SEE
A BOARD ANYWHERE AROUND HERE.

255
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
- ( laughs ) HOW ABOUT IT?

256
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,750
WANT TO TAKE A RIDE?

257
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,125
- SURE!

258
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,708
THE MAIN CONSTRUCTION,
THE FRAMES, TOO,

259
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,958
IT'S NOT A MON-SOONO TYPE,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

260
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,791
OVERALL, THIS LOOKS CLOSER
TO THE TERMINUS SERIES.

261
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,625
- HEY, YOU KNOW A LOT.

262
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,583
- WELL, I LIKE THIS
KIND OF STUFF.

263
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,250
- HEY, BY THE WAY, WHERE'S
THE BOARD FOR THIS THING?

264
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,583
- THIS GUY DOESN'T NEED
ANYTHING OF THE SORT.

265
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,666
- IT DOESN'T?

266
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,083
- THEN HOW DO YOU
RIDE THE TRAPARS?

267
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,625
- ACTUALLY...

268
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,958
- ( beeps )

269
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,500
- WHOOPS. EXCUSE ME.

270
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,500
- Ray: CHARLES, I HAVE
A DISTRESS CALL.

271
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,708
A REQUEST FOR TRANSPORT
FROM A CARRIER SHIP

272
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,000
THAT GOT STRANDED
IN THE EARLIER TECTONIC SHIFT.

273
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,416
THEIR REFRIGERATION UNIT BROKE,
SO THEIR CARGO IS GOING TO MELT.

274
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,458
- THEY CAN TAKE
CARE OF IT THEMSELVES.

275
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,541
- THE CLIENT IS LLOYD RIGHT.

276
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,041
- YOU MEAN, THE PUSHER?

277
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,125
THAT MEANS THE CARGO IS
SOMETHING LIKE FROZEN CHOCOLATE.

278
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,083
THEY DON'T WANT
THE ARMY FINDING IT.

279
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,000
- WHAT DO WE DO? WE OWE LLOYD
RIGHT A FAVOR, YOU KNOW.

280
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,291
- HEY, BOY.
- HUH?

281
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,750
- YOU WERE JUST ASKING ABOUT
HOW THIS RIDES THE TRAPARS

282
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,333
WITHOUT A BOARD, WEREN'T YOU?

283
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,958
HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU?

284
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,875
- Ray: WAIT A MINUTE, CHARLES.

285
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,666
YOU'RE GOING TO HANG OUT
THERE BY YOURSELF?

286
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,250
- Charles: IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

287
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,750
DON'T WORRY, BOY.

288
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,583
WE'RE JUST GOING TO
DELIVER THE CARGO.

289
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:36,208
- WOW, THE BOARD IS ATTACHED
TO THE BODY OF THE SHIP.

290
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,416
- SEE?

291
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,666
YOU DANCE TO MUSIC,
SOMETHING YOU CAN'T SEE,

292
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,166
BUT YOU FEEL IT ON YOUR SKIN.

293
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,666
AND YOU LIFT BY FEELING
TRAPARS WITH YOUR HEART,

294
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,083
ALSO, SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T SEE.

295
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,708
IT'S THE SAME THING.

296
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,125
IN THE CASE OF LFOS,

297
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,208
IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU HAVE
A BOARD THAT'S THE ISSUE,

298
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,250
THE ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT,
YOU CAN RIDE THE WAVES.

299
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,500
- HEY, THAT A BATTLE.

300
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,791
- YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD EYE.

301
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,125
- Man on radio: MAYDAY, MAYDAY!

302
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,291
EMERGENCY! PIRATES ARE
ATTACKING OUR SHIP!

303
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,666
THE CARGO IS IN DANGER. CHARLES!

304
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,250
- GEEZ, THIEVES TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A DISASTER

305
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,333
LIKE A TECTONIC SHIFT.

306
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,041
- THEY USE THE CHAOS
OF THE DISASTER?

307
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,208
- YEAH, IT'S UNFAIR.

308
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,416
BUT IT'S ALSO A BATTLE
TO PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLE

309
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,916
FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE CONFLICT.

310
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
- ( gasps )

311
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,500
- HEY, KID,
BETTER HANG ON TIGHT.

312
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,916
- YOU ARE GOING AGAINST THREE?

313
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,333
- OH, THIS IS NOTHING.

314
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,416

YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

323
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,250
- YES.

324
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,708
A BATTLE TO PUT FOOD
ON THE TABLE.

325
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,833
- WOW, LOOKS GREAT.

329
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:06,541
IT'S TRUE. I REALLY
DID THINK IT WAS STRANGE.

IT ACTUALLY MADE ME CRY.

336
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,833
NATURE AND HUMANS CAN CHANGE
IN A BLINK OF AN EYE.

337
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,125
THAT WAS A SURPRISE TO ME.
