1
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,708
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,750
- Man: HEY, ARE YOU LISTENING?
- Man #2: DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

3
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,458
- I WAS SAYING THAT IF YOU THINK
ABOUT MUSIC AND MOVIES,

4
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,500
INSTEAD OF REMEMBERING
WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT,

5
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,833
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY
TO BE REMINDED OF THE MEMORIES

6
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,458
YOU HAVE OF THAT TIME
AND THE PEOPLE YOU KNEW THEN.

7
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:58,375
- COULD YOU JUST SHUT UP FOR
A WHILE? I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

8
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,000
- AW, COME ON, I WAS JUST
GETTING TO THE GOOD PART.

9
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,375
- YEAH?  WELL, YOU COULD TRY
CONCENTRATING ON YOUR JOB.

10
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,708
HEY, FEARLESS LEADER,
CAN'T WE GET OUT OF HERE YET?

11
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,708
- Man over radio: SHUT UP!
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

12
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,541
THERE'S A HUGE WAVE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

13
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,041
25 SECONDS TO ENGAGEMENT.

14
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,375
- WOW.

15
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,875
THEY'RE REALLY GOING AT IT.

16
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,625
HEY, STONER,
IT'S ALMOST TIME.

17
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,791
- THAT'S RIGHT. IN OTHER WORDS,
THAT WHICH WE CALL MEMORY

18
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,875
IN NO WAY EXISTS
ALL ON ITS OWN,

19
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,208
WHICH MEANS
IT IS INEXORABLY CONNECTED

20
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,041
TO THE ENVIRONMENT
SURROUNDING IT.

21
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,750
DO YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS
WHO SAID THAT, MATTHIEU?

22
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,208
- I HAVE NO CLUE.

23
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,250
- MAN,
YOU ARE REALLY UNEDUCATED.

24
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,250
I SAID IT.

25
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,583
- ( grunting )

26
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,083
THEY'RE HERE!

27
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,666
NOW WE'RE GOING
TO SEE SOMETHING REALLY GOOD.

28
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,791
- ( gunfire )

29
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,250
- Matthieu: HA!
YOU'RE ON FIRE TODAY.

30
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,791
- Stoner: HOLLAND,
IF YOU SHOW OFF TOO MUCH,

31
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,708
THE L.F.O.'s BATTERIES
ARE GOING TO CUT OUT.

32
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,791
- HUH?
WILL THE TWO OF YOU BE QUIET?

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,458
I ALREADY KNOW ALL THAT.

34
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,916
- THAT WAS SWEET.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,125
- A FULL CUTBACK DROP TURN.
HUH.

36
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,625
- THIS IS MATTHIEU 606.

37
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,458
CONFIRMED,
ENEMY UNIT WITHDRAWN.

38
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,125
- Woman: THIS IS THE GEKKO.
ROGER THAT.

39
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,791
THE NIRVASH HAS PASSED
THROUGH POINT E62,

40
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,291
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.
CONTINUING WITH THE MISSION.

41
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,291
- Matthieu: 606, ROGER THAT.

42
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,791
- Woman: 909.
HOLLAND, DID YOU COPY THAT?

43
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,208
- I DON'T WANT TO GO.

44
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,750
- WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT? YOU'RE THE ONE

45
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,916
WHO SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED
YOU WERE GOING TO BELLFOREST.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
THAT'S WHY
EVERYONE TAGGED ALONG.

47
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,291
- YEAH YEAH, FINE.

48
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,625
FINE, I'LL GO ALREADY!

49
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,041
JEEZ.

50
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,125
WHAT A MONDAY.

51
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,583
- Newscaster: WEST BELLFOREST,
SOUTHERN WINDS,

52
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,875
WIND FORCE THREE,

53
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,083
TRANSPARENCE LIGHT PARTICLES,
36,

54
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,791
LATER INCREASING TO 56.

55
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,875
NORTH BELLFOREST,
SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS,

56
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,666
WIND FORCE ONE,

57
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,583
TRANSPARENCE LIGHT PARTICLES,
11,

58
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,125
LATER INCREASING--
- YEAH!

59
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,125
Boy: 14 YEARS HAVE PASSED
SINCE I WAS BORN.

60
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,500
IT'S ALREADY BEEN 14 YEARS.

61
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,000
IT'S BEEN 14 YEARS
SINCE I WAS BORN

62
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,500
AND NOTHING EXCITING
HAS HAPPENED TO ME.

63
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,583
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I DON'T GET THE FEELING

64
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,250
THAT ANYTHING EVER WILL HAPPEN.

65
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,416
MY LIFE JUST SUCKS.

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,708
- Man: LISTEN, I'M TELLING YOU,
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN DO IT.

67
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,541
- HEY, DON'T SAY THAT TO ME.

68
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,166
I'M A SMART YOUNG MAN
WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE, YOU KNOW?

69
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,916
- IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SAID IT, RENTON.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,250
YOU REALLY DON'T BELIEVE
IN THE WAVES, DO YOU?

71
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,375
AND BECAUSE
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM,

72
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,208
YOU CAN'T RIDE THEM WELL.
AND SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE--

73
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,625
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO DO A CUTBACK DROP TURN.

74
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,833
- YEAH, BUT THEY SAY
THAT HOLLAND WAS ABLE

75
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,958
TO PULL OFF A FULL-SPEED
CUTBACK DROP TURN

76
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,708
WHEN HE WAS 14 YEARS OLD.
I'M SURE I CAN TOO.

77
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,833
- OH, HOLLAND, HUH?

78
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,916
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
I MEAN, HE'S A GENIUS, YOU KNOW?

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,916
HE'S NOT THE SAME AS US.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,791
AND DON'T FORGET, HE WAS BORN
UP IN THE NORTH SHORE.

81
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,958
HE GREW UP IN
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT.

82
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,208
- HMM!  YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT HOLLAND SAYS ABOUT THAT?

83
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,541
WHERE YOU WERE BORN
DOESN'T MATTER MUCH.

84
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,375
THE SPOT
A PERSON REALLY NEEDS

85
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,791
IS ALWAYS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES.

86
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,625
I'M GONNA GET BIG,
RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT.

87
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,458
YOU SEE, I'M GONNA
EARN MYSELF A REALLY BIG NAME,

88
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,500
AND THEN I'LL PULL OFF
A CUTBACK DROP TURN ON AN L.F.O.

89
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,541
JUST LIKE HOLLAND.
- HERE, TAKE THIS.

90
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,875
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

91
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,375
- WHAT?  NO WAY!
YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

92
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,916
- IT'S A GOING-AWAY PRESENT.
- YOU'RE GOING AWAY?

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,916
- YEP, I'M GETTING OUT
OF THIS PLACE.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,583
- WHAT? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

95
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,916
- OUT TO A BIGGER CITY
THAT GETS MORE WAVES.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,916
LET'S FACE IT--I'M NOT DOING
ANY BUSINESS HERE AT ALL.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,166
YOU ARE MY ONLY CUSTOMER.

98
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,916
AND YOU JUST LOOK AT THE STUFF.
YOU DON'T BUY ANYTHING.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,041
- THIS TOTALLY SUCKS.

100
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,458
HE'S RIGHT.
THIS CITY COMPLETELY SUCKS.

101
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,916
IT'S A HOPELESS CITY.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,250
IT'S LIKE THE DEFINITION
OF "SUCKS."

103
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,833
EVEN IF I WANT A LIFT,

104
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,166
WE DON'T GET
ANY DECENT WAVES HERE.

105
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,750
IF YOU WANT ANY KIND OF LIFE,
YOU GOTTA JOIN THE MILITARY.

106
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,833
BUT THEN I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS

107
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,541
I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET OUT OF THIS CITY.

108
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,750
I'M TOO YOUNG TO KNOW THAT.

109
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,791
I MEAN, I'VE ONLY BEEN ALIVE
FOR 14 YEARS.

110
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,166
SO I'LL I CAN DO
IS STAY HERE

111
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,208
IN A CITY THAT TOTALLY SUCKS.

112
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,458
- Teacher: AND SO THE SUDDEN
AND UNEXPECTED EMERGENCE

113
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,666
OF NUMEROUS
TRANSPARENCE LIGHT PARTICLES,

114
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,333
TRAPARS FOR SHORT,

115
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,791
CAUSED THE COMPAC DRIVES
TO GO OUT OF CONTROL,

116
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,791
PLUNGING THE WORLD
INTO CHAOS

117
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,125
AS A RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL
DESTRUCTION THAT FOLLOWED,

118
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,625
AN EVENT NAMED
"THE NEW ERA SUMMER OF LOVE."

119
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,625
AND THE MAN WHO STOPPED
THIS CATASTROPHE

120
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,708
BY SACRIFICING HIS OWN LIFE

121
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,958
WAS THE LEGENDARY HERO
OF OUR COUNTRY, ADROC THURSTON.

122
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,500
AND OF COURSE,
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

123
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,666
THE SON OF ADROC THE HERO
IS ONE OF OUR CLASSMATES,

124
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,791
RENTON THURSTON.
- ( all laughing )

125
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,166
- ( thinking )
THIS REALLY SUCKS.

126
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,291
- ( explosion )
- ( all scream )

127
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,958
- ( all clamoring )
- Teacher: UH, QUIET STUDY!

128
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,791
THE TEACHERS
WILL DEAL WITH THE SCUBS.

129
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,500
ALL OF YOU SHOULD STAY INSIDE.

130
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,500
- COME ON,
TELL US ALL ABOUT IT.

131
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,500
WE'RE REALLY CURIOUS
TO KNOW--

132
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,500
DID ANYONE ACTUALLY SEE
YOUR DAD SAVE THE WORLD?

133
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,916
- AND YOUR SISTER--
SHE RAN AWAY FROM HOME

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,458
TO TRY TO PROVE IT, DIDN'T SHE?

135
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,833
SAYING SHE GOT A MESSAGE ON
HER COMPAC DRIVE OR SOMETHING.

136
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,000
- ( both laughing )

137
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,208
- AH!

138
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,125
- Girl: HEY, DID YOU SEE IT?

139
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,125
DID YOU SEE
THIS MONTH'S "ray=out"?

140
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,375
- Girl #2: OF COURSE!
ISSUE 17, RIGHT?

141
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,625
MISS TALHO WAS SO PRETTY!

142
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,375
- YEAH, BUT ISN'T
THE GEKKO STATE REALLY

143
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,500
JUST A BUNCH OF CRIMINALS?

144
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,666
- MY MOM TOLD ME
THAT ALL THEY REALLY ARE

145
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,666
IS A GANG OF KILLERS
AND GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGS.

146
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,916
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
TRUST ANYTHING THAT THEY SAY.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,375
- WHAT, REALLY?
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

148
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:55,375
- Diane Thurston:
REMEMBER THIS, RENTON.

149
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,791
AS LONG AS YOU BELIEVE,
WE WILL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

150
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,333
- Young Renton: REALLY?
- YES.

151
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,875
IF YOU CAN
TRULY BELIEVE IN SOMETHING,

152
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,375
THEN THE POWER OF YOUR BELIEF
WILL MAKE IT REAL.

153
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,541
THEN I KNOW YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO FLY INTO THE SKY,

154
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,083
HELP THE PEOPLE DEAR TO YOU,

155
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,416
AND SEE ME
AT ANY TIME YOU WANT.

156
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,625
SO PLEASE
JUST BELIEVE IN ME.

157
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,000
BELIEVE IN ME
AND BE A GOOD BOY.

158
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,875
- SURE.  I WILL, SIS.

159
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,166
- ( girl chuckling )
- HUH?

160
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,666
- DON'T YOU THINK RENTON
IS A BIT DISGUSTING?

161
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,625
- HE'S, LIKE, TOTALLY GRINNING,
STARING AT HIS COMPAC DRIVE.

162
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,833
- YEAH!

163
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,625
- ( Renton thinking )
THIS TOTALLY SUCKS.

164
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,625
HUH?

165
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,250
- AND WHERE
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

166
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,083
- GRANDPA?

167
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,833
- Teacher: I'M SORRY TO
SAY THIS, BUT WITH HIS GRADES,

168
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,500
NOT ONLY WILL HE NOT MAKE IT
INTO THE MILITARY ACADEMY,

169
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,458
HE MIGHT NOT PASS AT ALL.
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER!

170
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,458
- HOWEVER, HE IS THE SON
OF MR. ADROC,

171
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,458
THE RENOWNED HERO
OF THE MILITARY--

172
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,125
- IT DOESN'T MATTER!

173
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,250
THIS BOY IS GOING TO TAKE OVER
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

174
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,666
NO MORE MILITARY PERSONNEL
WILL BE CREATED IN MY HOUSEHOLD.

175
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,666
- Renton: AWESOME!

176
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,458
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS,
GRANDPA?

177
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,625
TIME TO EAT!  EH?

178
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,791
- ( sighs )

179
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,375
WHY DID IT HAVE TO END UP
THIS WAY?

180
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,791
OH, RENTON,
HOW AM I EVER GOING TO BE ABLE

181
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,958
TO EXPLAIN ANY OF THIS
TO YOUR LATE MOTHER?

182
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,333
- IT ALL SUCKS.

183
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,333
THIS TOWN SUCKS.
MY LIFE SUCKS.

184
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,500
BUT AS LONG AS I GOT WAVES,
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

185
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,541
AS LONG AS I CAN LIFT,
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

186
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,333
SO YOU SEE?
I'M OKAY, SIS.

187
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,208
GOT MY LIFTING, AND AS LONG
AS I CAN KEEP LIFTING,

188
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,458
NO MATTER WHERE I AM,
EVERYTHING'S GREAT!

189
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,416
- ( exploding )
- AH!

190
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,708
NO WAY.
THAT'S MY FAVORITE SPOT.

191
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,291
A MILITARY L.F.O.

192
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,500
DAMN IT!

193
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,333
THIS JUST-- THIS JUST--

194
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:10,708
THIS CITY JUST SUCKS!

195
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,708
EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT BE TRUE
THAT HOLLAND IS A CRIMINAL,

196
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,208
I'M REALLY JEALOUS
OF A GUY LIKE HIM.

197
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,875
HOLLAND GOES
ALL OVER THE WORLD,

198
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,708
ANYWHERE HE WANTS,
JUST LOOKING FOR WAVES.

199
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,291
I WANT TO DO
WHATEVER I WANT TOO,

200
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,750
DO WHATEVER I WANT

201
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,625
AND BECOME A PROFESSIONAL
LIFTER, JUST LIKE HOLLAND.

202
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,916
AND THEN--
AND THEN SOMEDAY

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,416
I'M GONNA BECOME A MEMBER
OF THE GEKKOSTATE.

204
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,083
- ( Compac beeping )
- HUH?

205
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:50,291
MAN, WHAT'S WITH THIS?
IT SAYS "EUREKA" AGAIN.

206
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,333
THAT'S GOT TO BE
THE THIRD TIME THIS MONTH.

207
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,208
( sighs )

208
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,666
( laughing )

209
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,458
I WONDER WHAT THIS COULD BE.

210
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,166
HEY, WAIT,
AM I THE ONLY ONE IT COMES TO?

211
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,750
I WONDER IF IT'S SOME SECRET
MILITARY CODE OR SOMETHING.

212
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,541
OR MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, IT'S A
MESSAGE FROM THE GEKKOSTATE.

213
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,750
THAT WOULD BE SO COOL,

214
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,708
IF THE PERSON WHO RECEIVES
THIS TRANSMISSION

215
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,708
COULD BECOME A MEMBER OF
THE GEKKOSTATE. I WISH! HMM?

216
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,708
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

217
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,916
- AW, MAN! HOW MANY TIMES
DO I GOTTA TELL YOU

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,833
NOT TO BARGE IN HERE
WITHOUT ASKING.

219
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,750
- FOR GOODNESS' SAKE,

220
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,916
ALL YOU DO IS COLLECT
USELESS JUNK UP HERE.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,750
- WHO CARES?
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

222
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,291
- YES IT DOES!

223
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,541
SOMEONE WHO CANNOT
EVEN DO SIMPLE ORGANIZING

224
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,666
WILL NEVER BECOME
A GOOD MECHANIC.

225
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,083
- WAIT JUST A MINUTE!

226
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,125
WHEN DID I SAY THAT I WAS GOING
TO BECOME A MECHANIC?

227
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,875
- IT WAS DECIDED FOR YOU.

228
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,458
- DON'T I GET TO DECIDE?

229
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,583
- WHAT OTHER OPTIONS
DO YOU HAVE?

230
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,666
LISTEN TO ME, RENTON.

231
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,458
I DON'T CARE
WHAT FASCINATES YOU.

232
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,916
YOU CAN EVEN RIDE THOSE BOARDS
IF YOU WANT TO.

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
BUT YOU HAVE TO FACE REALITY.

234
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,750
EVEN THOUGH YOUR FATHER DIED
AND BECAME A HERO,

235
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,791
AND EVEN THOUGH
DIANE LEFT THIS HOUSE

236
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,541
IN SEARCH
OF HER IMPOSSIBLE DREAMS,

237
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,791
NOTHING AT ALL HAS CHANGED
IN THIS WORLD.

238
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,041
THOSE WHO BELIEVE
IN THEIR DREAMS AND IDEALS

239
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,791
ARE ALL IDIOTS!

240
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,000
- I UNDERSTAND.
- HUH?

241
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,041
- YOU'RE A LOT MORE WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO YOU

242
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,250
AFTER YOU RETIRE
THAN YOU ARE ABOUT

243
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,291
WHAT I WANT TO DO
WITH MY LIFE, GRANDPA.

244
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,708
WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT!
I'M GONNA MAKE TONS OF MONEY

245
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,916
AND MAKE SURE TO PUT YOU
IN A NICE RETIREMENT HOME!

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,791
- ( grunting )

247
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,500
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

248
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,500
- ( alarm sounding )

249
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,500
- ( grunts )

250
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,333
- ARGH!

251
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,666
THIS THING!
I'M SICK OF IT.

252
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,416
IT'S GOT YOU LIVING
IN A DREAM WORLD!

253
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,416
- NO!  COME BACK!

254
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,833
CRAZY OLD MAN!

255
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,333
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

256
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,916
THAT'S A REPLICA
OF THE ONE HOLLAND USES.

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,541
YOU CAN'T GET 'EM ANYMORE!
WHAAA!

258
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,041
AN L.F.O.?

259
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,166
A CUTBACK DROP TURN?

260
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,208
NO WAY!
IS THAT HOLLAND?  HUH?

261
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,458
WHAT'S HE DOING?

262
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,000
- Both: AHHH!

263
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,500
- WHAA!  OH NO.

264
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,000
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THAT?

265
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,708
WHAT KIND OF L.F.O. IS THIS?

266
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,125
I'VE NEVER
SEEN ONE LIKE IT BEFORE.

267
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,708
- IT'S THE NIRVASH TYPE ZERO.

268
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,208
- YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?
- OF COURSE.

269
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,083
THIS IS THE OLDEST-EXISTING
L.F.O. IN THE WORLD.

270
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,416
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT
I'D GET TO SEE THE REAL THING.

271
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,791
- SO THIS IS THE NIRVASH?

272
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,875
- HEY!
- Both: HMM?

273
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,541
- THIS LITTLE ONE
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE FEELING WELL.

274
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,666
CAN YOU PLEASE
TAKE A LOOK AT IT FOR ME?

275
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,791
- ( gulps )

276
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,791
SHE'S SO CUTE.

277
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,750
- Grandfather: SORRY TO
BOTHER YOU LIKE THIS AGAIN.

278
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,833
- Man over radio:
AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

279
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,458
WE DIGGERS
COULDN'T DO OUR JOBS

280
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,750
IF IT WEREN'T FOR MECHANICS
LIKE YOU, OLD MAN.

281
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,291
- LOOK, ABOUT THE STATE ARMY--

282
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,166
- OH, THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

283
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,625
I TOLD THEM THAT I UNEARTHED
A SCUB AND BROKE IT.

284
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,791
THEY WERE ALL LAUGHING
ABOUT THAT.

285
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,791
LISTEN, UH, ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO COME?

286
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,291
- YEAH.

287
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,375
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

288
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,208
- ( phone hangs up )

289
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,708
- ( sighs )

290
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,458
WHAT A PAIN.

291
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:01,000
IF ONLY YOU HADN'T FOUND
THIS STUPID THING.

292
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,333
- ( thinking ) SO THIS--

293
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,458
THIS IS THE NIRVASH, HUH?

294
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,458
THE MYSTERIOUS CRAFT THAT
WAS THE FIRST TO BE DISCOVERED.

295
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,916
THE ONE THAT BECAME THE BASIS
OF ALL THE L.F.O.s EVER MADE.

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,625
THAT'S WHY IT'S TYPE ZERO,

297
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,875
THE ORIGINAL
OF ALL THE ORIGINALS.

298
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,000
WAIT, THEN THAT MEANS--

299
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,000
( thinking )
I AM SO SMART!

300
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,125
IF THIS
WAS THE ORIGINAL L.F.O.,

301
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,833
THEN IT MUST HAVE
THE ORIGINAL COMPAC DRIVE IN IT.

302
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,833
AND THAT WOULD HAVE
THE ORIGINAL DATA

303
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,000
FOR ALL THE L.F.O.s
THAT FOLLOWED.

304
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,458
WHAT?

305
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,458
HUH?  HUH? HUH?

306
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,458
THE COMPAC DRIVE IS MISSING.

307
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:41,458
THAT'S WEIRD. IT'S GOT A TWO-DIN
UNIT-TYPE ATTACHMENT SOCKET.

308
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,500
AND IT'S THE NEWEST MODEL TOO.

309
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,833
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
THERE'S NO COMPAC DRIVE IN HERE.

310
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,875
HUH?  GRANDPA?
THIS L.F.O. IS KIND OF--

311
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,041
- EXCUSE ME, I NEED A FAVOR.

312
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,666
CAN YOU PLEASE LEND ME
THAT FLAMETHROWER

313
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,666
THAT'S SITTING BACK
BEHIND THE FACTORY?

314
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,666
THE ONE THAT'S USED ON
ALL THE SCUBS? - ( grunting )

315
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,166
WHAT-- WHAT'S WRONG?

316
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,833
- OH, THIS?

317
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,875
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY THAT
I BROKE YOUR ROOM ALL TO PIECES.

318
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,000
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

319
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,875
IT WAS A VERY HURTFUL THING
TO DO.

320
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,958
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

321
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,708
- AMAZING!
SHE IS SO NICE.

322
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,208
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- UH, OH YEAH!

323
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,750
IT'S THIS L.F.O.
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE

324
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,875
A COMPAC DRIVE INSTALLED IN IT.

325
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,875
SEE? THE ONLY THING HERE
IS THIS EMPTY SOCKET.

326
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,833
- OH. THERE WAS NEVER ONE THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

327
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,833
I DON'T NEED IT
BECAUSE IT'S USELESS.

328
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,208
- WELL, YOU SEE--
YOU KNOW, YOU--

329
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,208
YOU'RE WRONG.
IN ORDER TO MAKE AN L.F.O. MOVE,

330
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,625
YOU NEED A COMPAC DRIVE,
A DEVICE THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE

331
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,375
TO COMMUNICATE WITH MACHINES.

332
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,208
WITHOUT IT,
PEOPLE CAN'T CONTROL THEM.

333
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,208
YOU DID KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
- HUH?

334
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,791
- THIS IS SO GREAT!

335
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,250
ALL RIGHT THEN, I'VE GOT IT.
HOW ABOUT WE TRY PUTTING MINE IN

336
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,666
AS AN EXPERIMENT?

337
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,250
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

338
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,041
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I MAY NOT LOOK IT,

339
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,416
BUT I'M
A PROFESSIONAL MECHANIC.

340
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,083
SEE, WHEN YOU BECOME
A MECHANIC OF MY CALIBER,

341
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:08,208
YOU CAN SENSE THAT MACHINES
HAVE FEELINGS TOO.

342
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,875
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

343
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,458
THAT'S JUST PLAIN COMMON SENSE,
ISN'T IT?

344
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,666
WELL, I'LL GO BORROW
THAT FLAMETHROWER NOW.

345
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,958
- ( thinking )
SIS, THIS IS AMAZING.

346
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,958
SHE'S THE IDEAL GIRL
THAT DOESN'T THINK

347
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,083
THE THINGS THAT I SAY
ARE STRANGE.

348
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,708
SURE, SHE'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

349
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,375
BUT SHE'S SO WORRIED
ABOUT HAVING TRASHED MY ROOM,

350
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,958
SHE WANTS TO USE A FLAMETHROWER
TO BURN-- BURN--

351
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,791
BURN?!
- ( exploding )

352
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,708
- ( panting ) AHHH!

353
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,333
WHAT-- WHAT--

354
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,375
WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

355
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,000
- A FUNERAL.
- A FUNERAL?!

356
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,583
BUT NOBODY AROUND HERE
HAS DIED.

357
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,375
WAIT A MINUTE. THERE ARE STILL
THINGS I CAN USE IN THERE!

358
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,958
( gasping )

359
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,833
HOT! OH, NO, MY CLEAS
ARE BEING SENT TO HEAVEN.

360
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:01,541
MY CLEAS! MY CLEAS!
( sobbing )

361
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:08,541
- NOW HOLD ON.
SHE'S LAUGHING.

362
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,250
- Matthieu: YOU KNOW, HOLLAND?
- HMM?

363
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,666
- WHY DO WE HAVE TO GO
THROUGH ALL THIS TROUBLE?

364
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,500
WHY CAN'T WE JUST GO FACE-UP
TO THE OLD GUY

365
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,666
AND ASK HIM TO FIX THE NIRVASH
BECAUSE IT ISN'T WORKING RIGHT?

366
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,500
YOU KNOW HIM, DON'T YOU?

367
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,833
- Stoner: WELL,
I WOULDN'T MIND DOING THAT,

368
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,000
BUT IT SEEMS
WE'VE GOT SOMEONE HERE

369
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,333
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO MEET HIM
FACE TO FACE.

370
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,875
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

371
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,875
- YEAH, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT,
HOLLAND?

372
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,166
IS THAT YOUR WEAKNESS?

373
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,208
IGNORING ME, EH?

374
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,916
- ( Holland yawns )

375
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,583
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

376
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,750
HE'S REALLY
STARTING TO LOOK LIKE HER.

377
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,208
HUH?  DON'T LIKE THE LOOK
OF THE CURRENT.

378
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,708
- ( beeping )
- Renton: HUH?

379
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,541
WOW, THAT'S REALLY STRANGE.

380
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,708
- ON SECOND THOUGHT,
TAKE IT OFF.

381
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,083
- WHAT?  BUT WHY?

382
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,291
- IT WORKED ALL RIGHT
ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT IT.

383
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,083
BESIDES,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IN THINGS

384
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,833
THAT I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.

385
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,375
- YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

386
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,958
DON'T SAY THAT.

387
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,375
- ANYWAY, JUST BECAUSE
YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING,

388
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,458
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT ANYTHING WILL COME OF IT.

389
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,666
SOMETIMES YOU SUFFER
GREAT MISFORTUNE

390
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,000
FOR BELIEVING IN SOMETHING
TOO MUCH.

391
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,333
THERE ARE TIMES THAT IT'S TOUGH
TO BELIEVE IN ANYTHING AT ALL.

392
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,416
- BUT--

393
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,625
BUT DON'T YOU--

394
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,250
- Grandfather: YOU'RE ONE OF
HOLLAND'S FRIENDS, AREN'T YOU?

395
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,666
- GRANDPA?

396
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,083
NEVER MIND.
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER NOW.

397
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,000
I PLANNED TO HAND THIS OVER
NO MATTER WHO CAME.

398
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,916
- HEY, GRANDPA,
WEREN'T YOU GOING TO

399
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,500
GO DOWN TO CITY HALL
OR SOMETHING?

400
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,583
- THIS IS IT, RIGHT? TAKE IT--
THIS IS WHAT YOU CAME HERE FOR.

401
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,416
MY FAMILY WAS TORN TO PIECES
BECAUSE OF THIS DAMNABLE THING.

402
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,416
IF YOU WANT IT, TAKE IT.

403
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,166
AND THEN--AND THEN DO ME THE
COURTESY OF NEVER COMING BACK!

404
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,083
- GRANDPA!  DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE BIT HARSH?

405
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,708
WHAT'S WITH YOU ANYWAY,
BUTTING IN LIKE THAT?

406
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,583
- ( gasps )

407
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,625
YOU'D BETTER HANG ON!
- WHY?  WHAT'S WRONG?

408
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,125
- ( both grunting )

409
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,041
- Renton: WHAAA!

410
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:09,458
- HUH?
- ( grandfather grunting )

411
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,583
- ( grunting ) OH!

412
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,208
- GRANDPA!

413
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,208
- WHY DO THEY HAVE TO COME HERE
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

414
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,000
- Man: WHY DID YOU FIRE?!

415
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,583
- Man #2: WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHY DID I FIRE?

416
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,625
I DON'T THINK WE WERE ORDERED
TO PROTECT TYPE ZERO, WERE WE?

417
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,291
- AS A MEMBER
OF THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU,

418
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,875
I CANNOT LET THIS PASS.

419
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,958
- ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD BRING
EVEN MORE SHAME UPON OURSELVES?

420
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,958
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I--
- WATCH YOUR MOUTH,

421
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,958
INFORMATION OFFICER DOMINIC!

422
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,791
UP IN THE SKY, ORDERS FROM
AIR FORCE OFFICERS

423
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,083
ARE GIVEN HIGHER PRIORITY.

424
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:47,750
DIDN'T YOU LEARN THAT
IN CADET SCHOOL?

425
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,875
- IMBECILE.
- ( beeping )

426
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,000
- ( grunting )

427
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,625
RENTON!
- GRANDPA!

428
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,541
- ( grunts )
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NIRVASH?

429
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,791
RENTON?

430
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,500
I NEED YOU TO TAKE THIS
TO THAT GIRL NOW.

431
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,208
IT'S AN EXPANSION PART
FOR THE COMPAC DRIVE--

432
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,708
THE AMITA DRIVE.

433
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,333
- DID YOU SAY THE AMITA DRIVE?

434
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,250
- WHEN YOU ATTACH THIS
TO THE COMPAC DRIVE,

435
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,500
THE L.F.O. WILL REALIZE
ITS FULL POTENTIAL

436
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,875
AND TRULY AWAKEN.

437
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,958
THAT IS WHAT YOUR FATHER
TOLD ME.

438
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,250
- WHAT?  MY FATHER?

439
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,083
- RENTON, GET GOING!

440
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,416
USE THIS THING
TO MAKE THEM ALL GO AWAY!

441
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,708
- Renton: I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING, SIS.

442
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,041
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING
TO PULL OFF THIS CRAZY STUNT

443
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,125
JUST BECAUSE GRANDPA TOLD ME TO.

444
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,291
IT'S JUST-- IT'S JUST
THAT I HAVE TO TELL THAT GIRL

445
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,708
WHAT I WASN'T ABLE
TO SAY TO HER BEFORE--

446
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,083
THE THINGS YOU TOLD ME
WAY BACK THEN

447
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,750
AND THE THINGS I HAVE COME
TO BELIEVE IN NOW.

448
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,000
SO LET'S GO, RENTON!

449
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,000
COME ON, LET'S GO!
I'M TAKING OFF AFTER THAT GIRL!

450
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,458
AHHH!

451
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,083
WAIT--
WAS THIS REALLY A GOOD IDEA?

452
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,250
AM I GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

453
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,791
AREN'T I A LITTLE TOO HIGH?

454
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,916
AM I REALLY ALL RIGHT?

455
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
TO BE CONTINUED.

456
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:32,625
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

457
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,791
- Narrator: RENTON,
WITH AMITA DRIVE IN HAND,

458
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,208
FLIES THE SKIES
TOWARDS THE NIRVASH.

459
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:06,416
THE MOMENT HE ARRIVES,
THE SATORI PROGRAM STARTS UP.

460
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,333
WHAT RENTON SAW
