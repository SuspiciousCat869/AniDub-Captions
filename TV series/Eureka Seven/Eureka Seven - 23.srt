1
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,291
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,333
- ♪ YOU GOT TO REMEMBER ♪

3
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,291
♪ YOU GOT TO REMEMBER ♪

4
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,583
- ( humming )

5
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,500
OH, WHAT IS IT?

6
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,875
- I WAS JUST ADMIRING WHAT
A HARD WORKER YOU ARE, BOY.

7
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,708
- WELL, I GOT TO CARRY
MY WEIGHT.

8
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,583
HUMANS ARE TRULY AMUSING BEINGS.

9
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,375
I'M DOING THE SAME THINGS,

10
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,708
BUT THE REACTIONS I GET
ARE SO DIFFERENT.

11
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,958
OVER THERE, THEY YELLED AT ME
AND TOLD ME I WAS BEING SLOW.

12
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,375
BUT OVER HERE,
THEY ASK IF I'M DONE,

13
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,041
AND ARE SURPRISED AT THE SPEED.

14
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,666
THERE I WAS TOLD
THAT I WAS INCONSIDERATE,

15
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,083
HERE THEY LAUGH AT ME AND SAY
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO DO SO MUCH.

16
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,250
HONESTLY, THIS PLACE
IS VERY COMFORTABLE.

17
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,416
I MEAN, WHEN I WAS
WITH THE GEKKOSTATE,

18
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,833
I WAS JUST A...

19
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,875
- HOMESICK?
- HUH?

20
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,708
- NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT!

21
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,583
- OH, DO YOU MISS
YOUR MOTHER THEN?

22
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,000
- HUH?

23
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,083
( gasps ) WELL...

24
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,041
- ( laughs ) I'M JUST KIDDING!

25
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,833
I CAME HERE TO CALL YOU
WE'LL BE LANDING SOON.

26
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,500
GO ON, TAKE A LOOK.

27
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,250
YOU REALLY CAN'T TELL
THAT MUCH FROM UP HERE.

28
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,750
- IT'S A JOB, ISN'T IT?

29
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,083
- YES. WE WANT YOU TO COME.

30
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,708
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
WE'RE GOING TO BE

31
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,666
SPENDING TONIGHT IN THE CITY.

32
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,916
OH, AND YOU CAN JUST TOSS ALL
OF THE LAUNDRY INTO THE DRYER.

33
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,333
I GUESS THERE'S
A BOY AROUND NOW,

34
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,875
I'LL HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

35
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,916
SORRY!

36
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,375
- ( sighs )

37
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,541
THIS PLACE IS SO COMFORTABLE!

38
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,333
- PURPOSE OF YOUR VISIT?
- WORK.

39
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,125
I'M A COURIER,
HERE TO PICK UP CARGO.

40
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,125
- WE HAVE AN ANTI-TERRORIST
ALERT, IN EFFECT RIGHT NOW.

41
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,958
WHEN YOU STEP OUT,
MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP

42
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,041
YOUR PASSPORT WITH
YOU AT ALL TIMES.

43
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,250
IT'S ALMOST CURFEW,

44
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,291
SO YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF TIME LEFT.

45
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,416
- YOU SHOULD HURRY.
- THEN LET'S GO.

46
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,291
- HEY, YOU.
- UH, YES?

47
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,708
- YOUR PARENTS WENT ON AHEAD.
- OH...

48
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,666
SOMEHOW, IT MADE ME HAPPY.

49
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,291
- ( siren wailing )

50
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,708
- ( gasps )

51
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,875
WHAT'S THAT?

52
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,250
- THIS IS IT.
- THIS PLACE?

53
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,041
- ( people groaning )

54
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,041
- IS IT THE WAR?
- NO. TERRORISM.

55
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,666
- TERRORISM?
- DO YOU WANT TO WAIT HERE?

56
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,208
- NO, I'LL GO!

57
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,375
- ( knock on door )

58
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,583
- HUH?
- I'M BEAMS.

59
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,166
I RECEIVED A COURIER REQUEST.

60
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,666
- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.
PLEASE, COME IN.

61
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,291
- SHE'S THE ONE?

62
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,083
- MAY WE ASK YOU A QUESTION?

63
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,500
- I GIVE NO GUARANTEES

64
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,125
ON WHETHER OR NOT I CAN
GET YOUR DAUGHTER

65
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,875
TO THE VODARAC SANCTUARY
BEFORE SHE PASSES AWAY.

66
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,916
- IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,625
RATHER THAN DYING HERE,

68
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,500
I'M SURE THAT MY
DAUGHTER WOULD PREFER

69
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,708
TO BECOME ONE WITH THE VODARAC,
BY HEADING TO THE SANCTUARY

70
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,750
OF HER OWN WILL,
TO GAIN AN ETERNAL LIFE.

71
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:51,666
BESIDES, WE CAN'T EVEN PRAY,
AS LONG AS WE STAY HERE.

72
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,250
- ( alarm sounding )

73
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,833
- Ray: IT'S AN ALARM,
WARNING PEOPLE TO STAY INSIDE.

74
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,875
- WHAT ARE YOUR WISHES?
IT WOULD BE TOUGH GOING BUT

75
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,625
THERE IS A WAY TO
TRANSPORT HER RIGHT NOW.

76
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,000
- NO, I DON'T WANT
MY DAUGHTER TO FACE

77
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,625
ANY MORE HARDSHIPS OR DANGER.

78
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,541
TAKE HER IN THE EARLY MORNING
WHEN THE BAN LIFTS,

79
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,750
WHEN SHE WON'T CATCH
ANYONE'S EYE.

80
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,125
- Renton: SO, IT'S NOT THAT
HER LIFE CAN'T BE SAVED?

81
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,958
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

82
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,041
I DID SAY SHE WON'T
BE ABLE TO STAY ALIVE

83
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,250
WITHOUT LIFE SUPPORT.

84
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,041
- SO, IF SHE HAD
A LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM,

85
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,458
SHE'D BE ABLE TO STAY ALIVE?

86
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,958
- WELL, YEAH.

87
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,291
IF THIS HOSPITAL DOESN'T
HAVE SUCH A SYSTEM,

88
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,541
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WE DON'T

89
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,250
TAKE HER TO A HOSPITAL THAT DOES

90
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,750
INSTEAD OF TAKING HER
TO THE SANCTUARY?

91
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,666
- IT'S NOT THAT THEY DON'T
HAVE A SYSTEM HERE,

92
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,958
THEY JUST CAN'T USE IT.

93
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,458
- WHY?

94
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,250
- BECAUSE THEY ARE
WITH THE VODARAC.

95
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,916
- ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT,

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,500
THE TERRORIST ACT WAS CAUSED
BY A GROUP OF RADICAL VODARAC.

97
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,416
THE VICTIMS FAMILIES FIERCELY
OPPOSED THE CONTINUATION

98
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,833
OF TREATMENTS FOR SOMEONE

99
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,958
OF THE SAME BELIEFS
AS THE TERRORISTS.

100
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,375
- Renton: BUT, IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE WAS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE

101
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,708
FOR THE TERRORIST ACT!

102
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,500
- JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S A VODARAC--

103
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,083
- LOOK, I FEEL THE SAME WAY!

104
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,708
BUT, HER PARENTS DECIDED THEY
WOULD ACCEPT THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

105
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,500
- Renton: THAT THE GIRL
IS GOING TO DIE?

106
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,000
- Charles: PERHAPS
FOR THE VODARAC,

107
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,416
IT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
FROM DEATH, AS WE SEE IT.

108
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,958
- Renton: THERE IS NO SUCH
THING AS AN ETERNAL LIFE!

109
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,166
IF YOU DESTROY A HUMAN BEING,
THEN HE WILL NEVER COME BACK!

110
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,916
THAT'S WHY...
THAT'S WHY...

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,458
EVERYTHING IS OVER
WHEN SOMEONE DIES!

112
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,000
I'M CERTAIN THAT SHE...

113
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,875
- THAT'S SOMETHING THE VODARAC
CAN DECIDE ON THEIR OWN!

114
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,291
IT'S NOT FOR US
TO BE MEDDLING IN.

115
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:39,000
- CHARLES, YOU'RE MUCH MORE
COLD-HEARTED THAN I THOUGHT.

116
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,791
- WOW, I GUESS IT'S NOT
THAT EASY TO RAISE

117
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,625
AN ADOLESCENT SON.

118
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,791
- THAT GIRL'S PRIMARY PHYSICIAN?
I THINK HE'S IN THE WEST WING.

119
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,250
- DOCTOR!

120
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,666
- UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

121
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,166
- WELL, WHY IS THAT?

122
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,916
- THANKS TO HER
PARENTS KINDNESS,

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,333
THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM HAS
BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THAT BOY.

124
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,666
- YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE OF THOSE?

125
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,916
- NO. NOT HERE.

126
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,541
IF WE HAD MORE, THEN MAYBE.

127
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,416
- WE NO LONGER HAVE TO ALLOW HER
ANY MORE HARDSHIPS IN HER LIFE.

128
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,958
- YES.

129
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,666
I'M GOING TO GO FIND THE DOCTOR

130
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,625
AND THANK HIM FOR
EVERYTHING HE'S DONE.

131
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,583
- ( gasps )

132
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,875
- WHAT? IS SOMETHING WRONG?

133
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,916
- MMM-MMM.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,291
- GOOD. YOUR BRAIN WAVES
ARE NORMAL.

135
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,208
STARTING TOMORROW,
I'LL LET YOU LEAVE THE ROOM,

136
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,791
BUT YOU HAVE TO
STAY ABOARD SHIP.

137
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,916
HOWEVER, THE HANGAR
IS OFF LIMITS.

138
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,625
- HEY, MISCHA...
- HMM?

139
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,666
- I'M CURIOUS. HOW IS RENTON?

140
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,625
- I'M PRETTY SURE,
HE'S DOING FINE.

141
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,208
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
TODAY, THOUGH.

142
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,083
WHY DO YOU ASK?

143
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,666
- WHAT IS LOVE?

144
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:24,958
MISCHA?

145
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:29,000
- OH, SORRY.
I DIDN'T HEAR WHAT YOU SAID.

146
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,000
COULD YOU TELL ME AGAIN, DEAR?

147
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,833
- All: LOVE?
- LOVE, LIKE IN ROMANCE?

148
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,208
- THAT'S RIGHT.

149
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,291
- WHOA, THIS IS A BIGGER SHOCK
THAN WHEN SHE SAID,

150
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,041
SHE WAS GOING TO BE
THE MOTHER OF THOSE KIDS.

151
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,250
- WELL, SHE JUST
ASKED WHAT LOVE WAS,

152
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,625
SO THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY
MEAN THAT SHE'S IN LOVE.

153
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,958
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

154
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,583
BUT I'VE GOT TO ADMIT,
I WAS SURPRISED.

155
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,333
- NO WAY!
- YES, WAY.

156
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,458
CAN'T YOU SEE,
IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

157
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,541
- IS THE GUY WHO I THINK IT IS?

158
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,666
- AS I SAID,
WE CAN'T BE SURE OF ANYTHING.

159
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,291
- BUT SHE DID ASK WHAT LOVE
WAS, RIGHT AFTER SHE ASKED

160
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,791
HOW RENTON WAS
DOING, DIDN'T SHE?

161
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,625
THE POSSIBILITY IS HIGH

162
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,833
THAT RENTON IS THE ONE
AND NOT HOLLAND.

163
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,875
- THAT'S NONSENSE.

164
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,458
- IN ANY CASE, ONCE EUREKA
STARTS WALKING AROUND SHIP,

165
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,458
SHE'LL REALIZE IN AN INSTANT
THAT RENTON IS NO LONGER HERE.

166
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,250
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE
BETTER TO HURRY UP

167
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,125
AND TELL HER THE
TRUTH, RIGHT NOW.

168
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,541
- HOLLAND WILL.
- HEY, WHY ME?

169
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,041
- WELL, WHO ELSE SHOULD DO IT?
- HUH?

170
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,416
- MR. BEAMS!
- HUH?

171
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,750
- WHAT?
- IT'S MY DAUGHTER.

172
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,125
MY DAUGHTER IS MISSING!
SOMEBODY TOOK HER.

173
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,500
- ( both gasp )

174
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,166
- CAN SOMEONE HAVE TAKEN HER
BECAUSE SHE'S A VODARAC?

175
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,208
- ( gasps )

176
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,541
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
I THINK IT'S OUR YOUNG GUEST.

177
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,583
- IT COULDN'T BE!

178
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,916
- ( gasps )

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,583
- JEEZ! DAMMIT!

180
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,208
HAVING AN ADOLESCENT
AROUND IS A REAL PAIN!

181
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,916
- I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO TELL HER.

182
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,375
( gasps )

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,416
- OH, HOLLAND.

184
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,375
- OH, WELL, EUREKA,
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

185
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,750
- I'M DOING MUCH BETTER.

186
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,916
- I SEE. WELL, SEE YA.

187
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,916
- HOLLAND, WAIT.

188
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,083
RENTON, IS HE IN HIS ROOM?

189
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,500
DO YOU THINK HE'D MIND
IF I VISITED HIM RIGHT NOW?

190
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,666
- HE'S...

191
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,208
OUT SHOPPING RIGHT NOW
WITH TALHO AND HILDA!

192
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,791
HE'LL BE GONE FOR DAYS.

193
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,791
- I SEE. THANK YOU, HOLLAND.

194
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,916
- IDIOT.

195
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,541
- IF I HEAD IN THE DIRECTION
THAT THE CAR WENT THEN...

196
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,583
IT'S COLD!

197
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,416
- ♪ I'M SO HAPPY
I'M WITH MAMA! ♪

198
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,916
♪ I'M SO HAPPY!
I'M SO HAPPY! ♪

199
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,166
- WOW, LINCK!
THAT'S A NICE SONG.

200
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,125
- HEY, MAMA, I CAN SING A SONG
LIKE THAT, TOO YOU KNOW!

201
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,916
- ♪ I'M SO HAPPY
I'M WITH MAMA! ♪

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,833
- Both: ♪ I'M SO HAPPY!

♪ I'M SO HAPPY!

00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,791

00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,333
- HEY, GUYS.
WHAT'S THAT SONG YOU'RE SINGING?

210
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,583
- IT'S MY SONG. I MADE IT!
- NUH-UH, I DID!

211
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,958
- HEY, HAP. HAS HILDA'S
GROUP COME BACK YET?

212
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,291
- NO, NOT YET.
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

213
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,750
- NO, IT'S OKAY. LET'S GO.

214

- WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

216
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,958
- WHAT? HE HASN'T TOLD HER YET?
I DON'T GET IT.

217
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,583
- HE JUST KEEPS CHICKENING
OUT EVERY TIME.

218
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,208
- BUT THE REASONS
WHY RENTON LEFT,

219
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,958
AREN'T EXACTLY HOLLAND'S
RESPONSIBILITY, ARE THEY?

220
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,791
- HE'S TOO AFRAID OF HOW
EUREKA WOULD FEEL TO TELL HER.

221
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,208
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I THINK WE SHOULD SIT BACK,

222
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,791
AND WAIT UNTIL HOLLAND
TELLS HER ON HIS OWN.

223
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,791
- ( alarm wailing )

224
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,250
- IT'S ONLY
A LITTLE WAYS FARTHER.

225
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,958
- ( all murmuring )

226
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,958
- ( gasps )

227
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,583
HEY, YOU WORK HERE, RIGHT?

228
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,458
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU!

229
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,875
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

230
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,541
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF ALL THIS?

231
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,458
WHY DID YOU BRING A VODARAC GIRL
IN DEATH GEAR TO THIS PLACE?

232
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,458
- WHAT THE HELL IS DEATH GEAR?

233
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,125
- LOOK, KID, BEFORE
IT CAUSES A PROBLEM...

234
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,166
- Man: WHY THE HELL DID
YOU COME HERE?

235
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,416
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PLAY DEAD, VODARAC!

236
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,958
- DON'T JUST SIT THERE!
SAY SOMETHING!

237
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,833
- STOP IT! LEAVE HER ALONE!
SHE'S SICK AND...

238
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,250
( grunts )

239
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,083
- GIVE MY BABY BACK TO ME!

240
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,458
HE WAS SO INNOCENT!
GIVE HIM BACK TO ME!

241
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,833
GIVE HIM BACK TO ME!

242
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,333
- ( gasps )

243
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

244
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,958
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE WAS THE ONE
THAT WAS BEHIND THE TERRORISM!

245
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,125
WHAT ARE YOU
ACCUSING HER OF DOING?

246
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,291
- WHAT AM I ACCUSING
HER OF, YOU ASK?

247
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,583
WELL, I'LL ASK YOU IN RETURN.

248
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,500
WHAT DID THE TWO OF YOU
COME HERE FOR?!

249
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,500
DID YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT THE FEELINGS,

250
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,208
OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR FAMILY
MEMBERS TO THESE TERRORISTS?

251
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,375
- ( overlapping chatter )

252
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,333
- OH MAN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW WE GOT TO THE POINT

253
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,625
WHERE I HAVE TO SNEAK
AROUND MY OWN HOME.

254
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,750
( sighs in relief )

255
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,291
UH...

256
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,875
- WELL, WELCOME BACK, HILDA.

257
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,250
- I GUESS I'M BACK.

258
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,875
- Charles: HAVE YOU
FOUND RENTON?

259
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,791
- Ray: NOT YET.
THE GIRL'S WITH HIM,

260
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,708
SO I REALLY DON'T THINK
HE CAN GO TOO AWFULLY FAR.

261
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,291
HOW ABOUT YOU?

262
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,708
- Charles: I DIDN'T SEE ANY
COUPLES THAT LOOKED LIKE THEM,

263
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,041
INSIDE VEHICLES OR BOATS
THAT WERE LEAVING THE TOWER.

264
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,916
- Ray: IF THEY MADE THEIR
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL,

265
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,708
I'M SURE THAT THE GIRL'S PARENTS
WOULD HAVE CONTACTED US ALREADY.

266
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,583
- HEY, SAM!

267
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,833
LOOKS LIKE MITCH AND THE GANG
CORNERED THAT KID FROM EARLIER.

268
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,291
THE VODARAC CHICK
IS STILL WITH HIM.

269
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,291
- Charles: WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT?
- I THINK I FOUND HIM.

270
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,791
- ( car engine starts )

271
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,625
- DAMN YOU.
IS IT FUN FOR YOU TO DO THIS?

272
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,125
- IS IT FUN?

273
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,125
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHETHER OR NOT

274
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,416
ANY OF IT IS FUN.

275
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,416
- THEN, WHY DO YOU DO IT?
- THIS IS REVENGE.

276
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,166
REVENGE FOR THE MASSACRE
OF OUR FAMILIES!

277
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,041
- I'M SORRY,
BUT CAN YOU CALL IT A DAY?

278
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,750
I DON'T WANT
ANY MORE PEOPLE INJURED.

279
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,000
- HMM...

280
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,916
THE STATE ARMY HAS CAUGHT ON!

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,958
- ( all gasping )

282
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,791
- SO?

283
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,416
- RELEASE THIS MAN'S
RESTRAINTS IMMEDIATELY.

284
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,041
- SEE, I WASN'T LYING TO YOU.
WELL, I'LL BE GOING NOW.

285
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,000
- HEY! SIT DOWN.

286
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,166
- SORRY FOR THE TROUBLE, SIR.

287
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,708
- WHAT'S THE STORY HERE?

288
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,833
- I ASKED HEADQUARTERS
FOR IDENTIFICATION,

289
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,333
JUST LIKE HE TOLD ME TO,

290
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,208
AND I WAS CONNECTED
TO CAPTAIN DOMINIC.

291
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,833
FROM MISSION HEADQUARTERS
INTELLIGENCE PRECINCT SEVEN.

292
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,375
I WAS TOLD TO ACT AS THOUGH
NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.

293
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,333
- I WON'T CONDEMN YOU FOR
THE ACTIONS THAT YOU TOOK.

294
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,500
IN FACT, I BELIEVE WHAT YOU DID,

295
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,875
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO
DO AS A HUMAN BEING.

296
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,083
BUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT GIRL,

297
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,458
REALLY WISHED FOR SUCH A THING

298
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,125
IS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT MATTER.

299
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,125
MOREOVER,
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW,

300
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,208
AS WE NEVER SPOKE
A SINGLE WORD TO HER.

301
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,500
- JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO,
SHE PASSED WAY.

302
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,875
- ( gasps )

303
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,250
- WHAT TO DO NOW?

304
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,791
WE WILL TAKE HER TO THE
DESTINATION OF YOUR CHOICE.

305
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,208
OF COURSE, I WON'T
ASK FOR ANY MONEY.

306
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,666
- SANCTUARY.

307
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,875
I'M SURE THAT IT IS WHAT SHE
WOULD HAVE WISHED FOR AS WELL.

308
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,083
- ( gasps )

309
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,916
- NO, WAIT.

310
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,208
FOR WHAT YOU DID, THANK YOU.

311
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,916
- ( crying )

312
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,708
- WE'RE GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING.

313
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,500
I MEAN, HOW LONG ARE WE GOING
TO KEEP IT A SECRET FROM EUREKA?

314
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,541
- THERE ARE LIMITATIONS
TO HOW MANY LIES WE CAN PILE UP.

315
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,875
- AH, YEAH MAN, EVEN I'M
STARTING TO AVOID EUREKA.

316
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,625
- SO, WHAT'S THE REASON
BEHIND OUR LEADER

317
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,875
NOT BEING ABLE TO TELL
HER WHAT'S GOING ON?

318
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,666
- BECAUSE OF ROMANCE.
- WHAT ROMANCE?

319
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,708
- THE STORY ABOUT HOW EUREKA
IS IN LOVE WITH RENTON.

320
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,208
- WHAT? IS THAT FOR REAL?

321
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,708
- I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!
I'M LONELY!

322
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,708
- HEY GIDGET, YOU TOLD?

323
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,208
- I DIDN'T TELL ALL OF THEM.
JUST YOU, DOGGIE.

324
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,291
- I'M WONDERING IF RENTON
KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

325
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,541
- IF HE HAD KNOWN,
HE WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT.

326
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,958
- LET'S GO LOOK FOR HIM.

327
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,541
- I'M SOUNDING LIKE
A BROKEN RECORD,

328
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,208
BUT THE FACT HE LEFT A NOTE
ASKING US NOT TO LOOK FOR HIM...

329
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,500
- MEANS HE WANTS US
TO LOOK FOR HIM,

330
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,583
AS WELL AS WORRY ABOUT HIM.

331
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,708
- SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE, MATTHEW?

332
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:50,791
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

333
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,083
I CONTACTED SOME
OF MY DJ FRIENDS,

334
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,458
AND THERE HAVE BEEN
A COUPLE OF SIGHTINGS

335
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,583
OF SOMEONE THAT
RESEMBLES RENTON.

336
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,958
- HOW DID THEY KNOW IT WAS HIM?

337
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,458
- THE WHEEL, MAN, THE WHEEL!
- I SEE.

338
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,208
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
GO PICK HIM UP.

339
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,541
- YOU'RE LIKE HIS OLDER
BROTHER RIGHT?

340
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,958
- I'M NOT HIS BROTHER.

341
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,583
- THE METHOD BY WHICH
WE PICK HIM UP

342
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,041
NEEDS SOME CONSIDERATION.

343
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,333
- THAT'S RIGHT. THE FIRST
WORDS WE THROW AT HIM,

344
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,291
CAN BE A KEY POINT WHEN DEALING
WITH AN ADOLESCENT FUGITIVE!

345
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,833
- SPEAKING FROM
EXPERIENCE, AGAIN?

346
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,625
- SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH,
ALL OF YOU!

347
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,541
RENTON DIDN'T LEAVE
THE GEKKO IN ORDER TO

348
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,958
MASK HIS STUPID WHIMS
OR HIS LONELINESS!

349
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,875
HE JUST WANTED TO LEAVE!

350
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,250
- ( all gasp )

351
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,166
- OW! WHY DID HE DO THAT?

352
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,041
- WE SCREWED UP.

353
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,666
HE WAS SERIOUSLY THINKING
ABOUT RENTON'S WELL-BEING.

354
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,875
- Holland: I THOUGHT
THAT I UNDERSTOOD

355
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,500
ALMOST ALL OF WHAT GOES
ON INSIDE HIS HEAD.

356
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,541
I'M SO PATHETIC.

357
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,000
- I'VE HEARD THAT A LOT LATELY.

358
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:52,000
- BUT WHY? WHY DID RENTON
DECIDE TO LEAVE THE GEKKO?

359
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,666
IS IT BECAUSE I DID AWFUL
THINGS TO HIM THAT RENTON LEFT?

360
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,500
- EUREKA...

361
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,958
- COME ON, HOLLAND! IS IT TRUE?
AM I THE REASON HE LEFT?

362
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,875
ANSWER ME!

363
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,500
- Renton: I'M SURE SHE'S HOLDING
A GRUDGE AGAINST ME.

364
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,041
I DIDN'T THINK ONE BIT
ABOUT HER FEELINGS,

365
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,875
AND THOUGHT SELFISHLY
THAT I HAD TO PROTECT HER.

366
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,208
I DIDN'T EVEN PAUSE
TO THINK WHETHER OR NOT

367
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,833
IT WAS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO FOR HER.

368
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,541
IN THE END, WHAT I DID
DIDN'T PROTECT ANYONE.

369
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,541
IN FACT, WHAT I DID
WAS HURT THEIR FEELINGS.

370
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,666
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T
NEED TO GET HURT.

371
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,166
PEOPLE WHO HAVE
ALREADY BEEN HURT ENOUGH.

372
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,375
I ONLY MADE THEIR WOUNDS
EVEN WORSE THAN BEFORE.

373
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:47,833
AND I'M SURE THAT MY PAST WAS...

374
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,250
( crying ) I'M SO SORRY!

375
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,416
- WHERE IS HE?

376
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,916
- HIS ROOM. YOU KNOW,
RAISING AN ADOLESCENT SON...

377
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,958
- IT'S NOT TOO BAD.
- YEAH.

378
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,375
NOT BAD AT ALL.

379
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,625
- OH, RENTON...
I WANT TO SEE YOU.

380
