1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,625
- Man:
ATTENTION, CITIZENS!

4
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,458
THIS IS FEDERATION AIR FORCE
PUBLIC RELATIONS.

5
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:50,125
NOW THERE'S AN ABNORMAL FLOW
OF TRAPAR AROUND SOUTH AILESS,

6
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,333
CREATING A LARGE
CUMULONIMBUS CLOUD

7
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,958
IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

8
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,000
THE TRAPAR COUNT
IS INCALCULABLE.

9
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,916
PLEASE FOLLOW ALL
AIR FORCE INSTRUCTIONS

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,916
TO EVACUATE THE AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,875
LARGE-SCALE DESTRUCTION
IS EXPECTED.

12
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,375
THIS IS FEDERATION AIR FORCE
PUBLIC RELATIONS.

13
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,958
- ANEMONE,
IT'S TIME TO GO.

14
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,416
- IS THE END COMING TOO?
- YES.

15
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:57,041
- SO I GUESS EUREKA STILL
ISN'T FEELING VERY WELL.

16
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,083
- ( sighs )
IT MUST BE SNOWING IN HELL.

17
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,791
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE
ACTUALLY WORRIED ABOUT EUREKA.

18
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,750
- I'M NOT THE ONE WHO'S WORRIED.

19
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,750
HOLLAND IS THE ONE
WHO'S WORRYING ABOUT IT.

20
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,250
- HMM.

21
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,875
WELL, I CAN FIND NOTHING
WRONG WITH HER PHYSICALLY.

22
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,875
ALL TESTS SHOW STABLE FIGURES,

23
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,041
SO IT MUST BE PSYCHOLOGICAL.

24
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,750
- OH, I GET IT.
SO BASICALLY,

25
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,791
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT
SHE'S LOST HER NERVE, RIGHT?

26
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,083
- IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH NERVE.

27
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,875
SOMETIMES,
WHEN YOU CATCH A COLD,

28
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,291
YOUR MIND CAN GET SO TIRED
IT CAN'T FUNCTION.

29
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,083
- IT SOUNDS PRETTY COMPLICATED.

30
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,083
- APPARENTLY, THE PROBLEMS
SHE'S HAVING WITH HER LINK

31
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,750
TO THE NIRVASH ARE CREATING
MENTAL STRESS FOR HER.

32
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,750
- SO IS IT A PROBLEM
WITH EUREKA?

33
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,333
OR MAYBE IT'S A PROBLEM
WITH THE NIRVASH?

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,625
- MOST LIKELY
IT'S EUREKA'S PROBLEM.

35
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,333
- Matthieu:
HEY, SORRY, MOONDOGGIE,

36
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,333
BUT CAN YOU HAND ME THE MAYO?
- ( Moondoggie chewing )

37
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,583
HERE.
- THANK YOU.

38
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,125
OKAY, SO JUST WHEN I WAS
ABOUT TO GIVE UP,

39
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,958
I HEAR MY HONEY'S VOICE
CALLING OUT TO ME.

40
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,458
THAT'S WHEN I REALLY
CUT LOOSE.

41
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,791
I WENT AFTER THOSE PIRATES

42
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,125
AND TOOK 'EM DOWN
ONE AT A TIME.

43
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,125
- WHAT A STUPID DREAM.

44
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,125
AND YOU'RE USING TOO MUCH.
- OH!

45
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,125
- HEY, I HAD A GOOD DREAM
LAST NIGHT, TOO.

46
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,125
- YEAH, WHAT KIND?

47
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,125
- I DREAMED I WAS ON A DATE
WITH MOONDOGGIE.

48
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,125
- SO THAT'S IT.
- WHAT?

49
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,625
- I WAS PARALYZED IN MY SLEEP
AND WOKE UP COVERED IN SWEAT.

50
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,125
- RIGHT.  WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE KIDDING?

51
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,333
- HEY, I DREAMT I WAS RIDING
TRAPAR WAVES.

52
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,500
READING THE WIND,
RIDING THIS HUGE WAVE.

53
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,541
IT WAS AWESOME
BEYOND BELIEF.

54
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,125
- TOO NORMAL.
IT JUST SOUNDS LAME.

55
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,125
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

56
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,416
- HEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

57
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,625
- HUH?

58
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,833
- EUREKA, WHAT KIND OF DREAMS
HAVE YOU HAD LATELY?

59
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:44,208
- WELL, I'VE NEVER HAD
A DREAM IN MY LIFE.

60
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,208
- WHAT?

61
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,000
- GREAT.  LOOKS LIKE WE
GOT EVERYBODY HERE.

62
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,083
- HMM?

63
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,208
- YOU CAN KEEP EATING,
BUT LISTEN UP.

64
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,041
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT.

65
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,583
HEY, WAIT.
EUREKA, WHERE YOU GOING?

66
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,208
- ( sighs ) LET HER GO.

67
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,166
I'LL TELL HER ABOUT IT LATER.

68
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,958
- EVERYONE,
WE'VE GOT A CORALIAN.

69
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,166
- WHOA!  ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- ONE FINALLY SHOWED?

70
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,166
- WOW!  THIS IS REALLY BIG.
- WILL YOU PLEASE CALM DOWN?

71
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,416
- Renton: UM...

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,166
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS A CORALIAN?

73
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,208
- All: HUH?

74
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,875
- EARLY THIS MORNING,
NEAR SOUTH AILESS,

75
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,000
AN AREA A HUNDRED
KILOMETERS IN RADIUS

76
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,208
WAS DESIGNATED
A NO-FLY ZONE.

77
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,708
FURTHER, THE FLOW OF TRAPAR
IS HEADED TOWARDS ITS CENTER.

78
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:38,750
THE FLOW IS SO STRONG WE CAN
OBSERVE IT HERE FROM THE GEKKO.

79
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,208
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

80
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,208
- THERE'S A CORALIAN
IN THE CENTER OF IT ALL.

81
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,208
- SOUTH AILESS?  WE'RE ALMOST
THERE.  IT'S REALLY CLOSE.

82
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,208
- RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA START
BY CAREFULLY APPROACHING IT

83
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:52,083
TO CONFIRM ITS EXISTENCE.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

84
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,875
- SURE AM.
WELL, AT LEAST FOR NOW.

85
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,833
- I WASN'T ASKING YOU.
- HMM?

86
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,208
- SO WHAT ABOUT IT?

87
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,375
- IF WE LET THIS CHANCE GO BY,
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S

88
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,250
GOING TO APPEAR AGAIN.
- SO YOU'RE GONNA DO IT?

89
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,625
- YEAH.

90
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,708
- EVEN THOUGH THE TIMING
ISN'T REALLY THAT BAD?

91
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,208
WITH EUREKA IN THE CONDITION
SHE'S IN NOW,

92
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,083
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED.

93
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,916
- LOOK, AT WORST, WE'LL HAVE TO
DO IT BY OURSELVES.

94
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,208
- UM... EXCUSE ME,

95
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,458
BUT WHAT IS A CORALIAN?

96
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,250
- MAMA.

97
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:36,250
- YOU CAN'T GO IN RIGHT NOW.
- BUT WHY NOT?

98
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,791
- MAMA ISN'T FEELING VERY WELL,
SO WE CAN'T.

99
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,583
- ( crying )
- OH, NO.  NO, DON'T CRY.

100
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,666
- DID THE RELEASE OF TYPE ZERO'S
POWERS TRIGGER THIS EVENT?

101
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,291
- THAT IS MOST LIKELY THE CASE.

102
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,625
- BUT TO THINK IT WOULD
APPEAR RIGHT ABOVE THE TOWER.

103
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,958
- WE MUST ALSO THINK
ABOUT HOUSING THE EVACUEES

104
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,833
UNDER SUCH DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.

105
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,291
- IT IS A KUTE-CLASS
MANIFESTATION.

106
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,583
HOW MANY YEARS
SINCE THE LAST ONE?

107
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,291
IT SEEMS THE SITUATION
HAS REACHED A NEW PHASE.

108
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:08,083
ISN'T THAT SO, DEWEY?
- VERY TRUE.

109
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,166
HOWEVER, A CHANCE LIKE
THIS WILL NOT COME AGAIN.

110
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,916
- WHAT?  A CHANCE?

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,291
- IT WILL BE PROBLEMATIC
IF THEY DO NOT APPEAR.

112
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,000
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD
WITH THE ANNIHILATION.

113
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,500
- CORALIAN.  I TRIED ASKING
EVERYBODY ABOUT IT,

114
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,375
BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS.

115
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,000
- YOU SEE, IT'S LIKE A GOD.

116
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,291
AND I'M THE ONE MAN WHO'S
GOTTEN CLOSEST TO THAT GOD.

117
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,208
- IT'S NOTHING YOU NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT.

118
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,125
YOU JUST NEED TO GO
AND PICK UP THE LAUNDRY.

119
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,958
- ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT IT, EITHER.

120
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,500
BUT I HEARD IT'S AMAZING.

121
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,166
- YOU KNOW, IT'S A REALLY BIG
WAVE, DUDE.

122
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,833
IT CRASHES DOWN
AND THEN HITS WITH A BOOM,

123
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,666
AND THEN IT'S SLASH-SLASH,
BAM-BAM-BAM!

124
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,333
THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD
IT'S LIKE.

125
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,541
- IT'S A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY.

126
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,333
- GOD'S PEDESTAL, THE NEXT
LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

127
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,583
THE STAIRWAY OF EVOLUTION
YOU MUST CLIMB.

128
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,000
- ( camera shutter clicks )
- YOU UNDERSTAND?

129
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,708
- ( yawns )

130
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,791
- A CORALIAN?

131
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,291
- MM-HMM.  EVERYONE'S MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL,

132
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,791
"IT'S HERE!"  AND STUFF.

133
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,375
- WHAT IS A CORALIAN?
I DON'T KNOW.

134
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,458
- REALLY?  BUT--

135
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,125
- SO HE ALREADY
TOLD YOU ABOUT IT?

136
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,166
WELL, THEN YOU KNOW
THE SITUATION.

137
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,375
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

138
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,041
- TO LOOK AT THE NIRVASH.
- NO WAY.

139
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,416
YOU'RE STAYING
ON THE SHIP THIS TIME.

140
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,625
- HOW COME?
- BECAUSE I KNOW THAT PHYSICALLY

141
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,333
YOU STILL AREN'T
COMPLETELY WELL.

142
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,416
WE'LL BE FINE ALL BY OURSELVES.

143
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,291
- LIAR.  WHO'S GONNA ENTER
THE ZONE IF I'M NOT OUT THERE?

144
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,166
- EUREKA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON, BUT YOU'RE STILL NOT--

145
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,541
- I'LL LET YOU GO
ON ONE CONDITION.

146
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,291
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE KID
WITH YOU.

147
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,291
BUT IF ANYTHING BAD SHOULD
HAPPEN TO HER, I'LL KILL YOU.

148
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,458
YOU UNDERSTAND?

149
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,458
- HEY, WAIT.
HOLD ON A SECOND, HOLLAND.

150
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,750
YOU JUST SAID YOU WOULDN'T
TAKE HER ALONG.

151
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,416
- SORRY.

152
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,458
- IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT, RENTON.

153
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,458
- BUT WHY?

154
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,500
WHY ARE YOU GONNA GO
WHEN YOU AREN'T FEELING WELL?

155
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,458
- WELL, BECAUSE HOLLAND
WANTS ME TO.

156
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,541
YOU ARE GOING TO COME
WITH ME, AREN'T YOU?

157
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,458
- YEAH.

158
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:51,458
PATHETIC, I KNOW, BUT ALL I
COULD DO WAS NOD IN AGREEMENT.

159
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,500
AFTER LISTENING
TO THEIR CONVERSATION,

160
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,458
IT SOUNDED LIKE THE TWO OF THEM
HAD DONE SOMETHING BEFORE,

161
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,458
TO THIS THING CALLED A CORALIAN.

162
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,458
- Man: I WANT YOU TO DEPART
FOR SOUTH AILESS IMMEDIATELY.

163
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,625
- Man #2: I UNDERSTAND, BUT--
- THERE IS NO TIME TO DEBATE.

164
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:10,125
THOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT
TECHNICALLY YOU OUTRANK ME,

165
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,750
I AM AN ADVISOR FROM THE UNITED
FEDERATION FORCE.

166
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,500
- ( grumbles )
- DON'T FORGET THAT.

167
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,875
- Anemone:
HEY, MISTER, WHAT IS THAT?

168
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,500
- HUH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

169
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,500
- THAT SWITCH THERE
WHAT DO YOU USE IT FOR?

170
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,500
- OH, THIS IS SOMETHING WE
ONLY USE IN EMERGENCIES.

171
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,250
- REALLY?
- ORDINARILY, WE'RE ABLE

172
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,916
TO COMMUNICATE BY ADJUSTING
THIS DIAL OVER HERE.

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,500
- AMAZING.
- IT'S NOTHING.

174
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,166
- ANEMONE, WE'RE GOING.
- OKAY.

175
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,500
- ( alarm blaring )

176
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,750
- WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
DOING?  STOP THAT IMMEDIATELY.

177
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,333
- ( laughing )

178
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,833
- DAMN IT, SHE'S
TREATING US LIKE FOOLS.

179
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,000
- OH, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
VACATE YOUR SLEEPING QUARTERS.

180
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,250
- WHAT?

181
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,875
- IT WILL NOW BE ANEMONE'S ROOM.

182
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,500
IT'S ONLY NATURAL, RIGHT?

183
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,125
- WHAT?

184
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,583
- THIS LITTLE GUY HERE'S
NAME'S GULLIVER.

185
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,083
GIVE HIM A NICE TOUR
OF THE SHIP.  THAT'S AN ORDER.

186
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,083
- MY FIRST JOB BACK
IN THE MILITARY IS

187
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,041
TO BABYSIT
A THING LIKE THIS?

188
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,541
( grunting ) WEIGHS A TON.

189
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,541
- CAPTAIN, DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?

190
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,541
- NO, THANKS.

191
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,833
I WON'T LET THEM BEAT ME.
- ( squealing )

192
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,541
- HEY, MAMA.
IS YOUR HEAD STILL HURTING?

193
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,958
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
MAMA IS JUST FINE.

194
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,000
- MAMA, ARE YOU GOING AWAY?

195
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,666
- WHY DO YOU ASK?
- FEELS LIKE IT.

196
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,666
- THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

197
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,291
- ( alarm blaring )
- ( gasping )

198
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,250
- GUESS IT'S HERE.

199
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,583
- WELL, I HAVE TO GO.

200
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,916
IT'LL BE FINE.

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,333
- All: MAMA!

202
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,750
- I PROMISE.

203
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,333
NO MATTER WHAT,
I'M GOING TO COME BACK.

204
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,583
- WOW, IT'S HUGE.
- ( camera shutter clicks )

205
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,208
- THAT CLOUD?  WHAT IS IT?

206
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,583
- THAT CLOUD IS CALLED
A CORALIAN.

207
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,583
- SO THAT'S IT.

208
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,625
- THE CONDITION IS STABLE.
MATTHIEU, DON'T BE AFRAID OF IT.

209
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,625
- WHAT?  WHO, ME?
HEY, I'M NOT AFRAID AT ALL.

210
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,666
I'M NOT SCARED.
- ALL RIGHT,

211
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,625
WE'RE GONNA TRY AND BREAK
THROUGH TO THE INSIDE.

212
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,916
MATTHIEU AND STONER IN THE 606
WILL WITH MEET HILDA IN THE 808.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,458
YOU ARE GOING TO USE THE TRAPAR
SLIPSTREAM TO GUIDE THE NIRVASH.

214
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,625
- I ASSUME THAT'S SO EUREKA
CAN SAVE HER STRENGTH, RIGHT?

215
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,166
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- ( scoffs )

216
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,333
- THEN WHEN YOU'RE AT
YOUR CLOSEST TO THE ZONE,

217
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,291
THE NIRVASH WILL
BREAK THROUGH

218
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,208
AND THE REST OF YOU GUYS
WILL JUST FOLLOW IN AFTER IT.

219
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,791
- WHERE'S EUREKA?
- SHE'S WAITING IN THE NIRVASH.

220
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,291
- SO YOU JUST DECIDED NOT
TO INFORM ME ABOUT IT?

221
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,791
- YOU KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.
SHE'S JUST THAT KIND OF KID.

222
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,958
- YEAH, YEAH.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,250
- Man: YOU COULD JUST STAY
IN YOUR ROOM.

224
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,666
- NO WAY.  IT SMELLS LIKE
AN OLD GUY'S ROOM.

225
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,500
JUST BEING IN THERE
IS MAKING MY HEAD HURT.

226
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,000
- I'M SORRY.

227
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,875
- KUTE 102
NO CHANGE IN POSITION.

228
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,375
THE INCOMING FLOW
OF TRAPAR IS INCREASING.

229
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,375
- Anemone:
THAT'S IT, RIGHT?

230
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,666
AND THEY GO GIVE IT
BY A BORING NAME LIKE "KUTE."

231
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,166
ARE MILITARY PEOPLE STUPID
OR SOMETHING?

232
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,416
- ATTENTION!
I WANT KLF THIRD SQUADRON

233
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
TO BEGIN LAUNCH PREPARATIONS
IMMEDIATELY.

234
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,541
- ISN'T THAT RATHER POINTLESS?
- HUH?

235
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,375
- YOU RECONFIRM THE TARGET

236
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,791
AND CONSERVE YOUR MILITARY
ASSETS.

237
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,708
DIDN'T YOU LEARN THAT
IN OFFICERS SCHOOL?

238
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,583
- GRR!  I'M GONNA HAVE THAT
WRITTEN DOWN IN THE RECORDS,

239
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,083
AS AN OPINION
FROM THE STAFF OFFICER.

240
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,291
- WHATEVER YOU LIKE, SIR.

241
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,791
- HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

242
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,291
WHAT IS IT THAT'S
MAKING YOU UPSET?

243
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,291
PLEASE, TELL ME.

244
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,625
- HEY.  SORRY I'M LATE.

245
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,625
HUH?

246
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,000
EUREKA, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

247
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,708
YOU'RE STILL NOT FEELING
VERY WELL, ARE YOU?

248
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,708
I'M FINE.  IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S REALLY NOTHING.

249
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,208
MY HEAD JUST HURTS A LITTLE BIT.

250
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,750
- Man: TRAPAR DENSITY IS UP
BY 30%.

251
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,583
WHILE SUSTAINING CURRENT
ALTITUDE AND SPEED,

252
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,708
WE'RE GOING TO ATTEMPT
TO CONTACT KUTE 102.

253
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,291
- ROGER THAT.  KEEP AN EYE
ON YOUR POSITION CONTROLS.

254
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,500
- ROGER THAT.

255
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,750
- HEY, ARE YOU GETTING SCARED?
- HEY, DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

256
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,750
- SO WHY'S YOUR
VOICE SHAKING?

257
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,250
- I'M SHAKING IN ANTICIPATION.
- ( laughing )

258
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,875
- Holland: MATTHIEU.
- YEAH, HOLLAND.

259
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,875
- IT'S SHOW TIME.
- GOT IT.

260
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,708
- ( horn wails )
- NEXT UP THE 808.

261
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,041
- ROGER.
- Holland: NIRVASH, HEAD OUT.

262
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,750
- HEY, LITTLE SHRIMP.
- YES.

263
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,041
- YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?
- YES, OF COURSE, MR. HOLLAND.

264
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,333
I UNDERSTAND.

265
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:16,000
- THE TRAPAR DENSITY IS MUCH
HIGHER THAN EXPECTED.

266
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,833
THE WAVES UP HERE ARE
AS HARD AS BOULDERS.

267
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,166
- RIDE 'EM OUT.  IF YOU DON'T,
YOU'LL JUST GET KNOCKED AROUND.

268
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,708
- FORCE IT THEN.

269
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,750
- HEY, MATTHIEU.  CAN YOU LOWER
YOUR ALTITUDE A LITTLE BIT?

270
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,791
I THINK I CAN GET A GOOD PICTURE
WITH THE LIGHT SHINING IN.

271
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,458
-  GET SERIOUS.  I'M HAVING
ENOUGH TROUBLE JUST TRYING

272
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,041
TO KEEP THIS THING LIFTED.
- YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

273
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,875
FINE ART IS SOMETHING PEOPLE
GLADLY RISK THEIR LIVES FOR.

274
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:45,791
- TRAPAR DENSITY IS UP BY 20%.
WE CAN'T CONTROL OUR POSITION.

275
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,458
- DON'T LET THEM
OVER-ACCELERATE.

276
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,875
COMMUNICATIONS,
YOU NEED TO BROADCAST

277
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,708
THE MEASURED VALUES
TO THEM EVERY 30 SECONDS.

278
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:00,041
- ANEMONE, IT'S ALMOST TIME.

279
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,250
SHALL WE GO?

280
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,166
- 25, 30...

281
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,500
40, 50.

282
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,500
TRAPAR DENSITY
CONTINUING TO INCREASE.

283
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,458
- ( grunts )

284
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,500
- 01, 02, BOTH LOST.

285
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,916
WE LOST 03.  THE THIRD SQUADRON
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED.

286
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,875
- GOD'S PEDESTAL,
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.

287
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,166
LIKE SLASH-SLASH,
BUH-BAM, BUH-BAM!

288
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,875
THE NEXT LEVEL
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

289
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,375
- RENTON, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
YOU KEEP QUIET FOR A WHILE?

290
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,875
- OH, I'M SORRY.

291
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,583
- MY HEAD HURTS, AND IT'S HARD
FOR ME TO CONCENTRATE.

292
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,916
- OKAY.

293
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,041
- Anemone:
I WON'T!  I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

294
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,416
MY HEAD HURTS TOO MUCH.
I DON'T WANT TO GO ON A MISSION.

295
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,541
I CAN'T.
I JUST CAN'T DO IT!

296
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,583
- ANEMONE, TRY TO BE STRONG.
- NO, I CAN'T BE STRONG.

297
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,833
- ( sighs )
- ( sobbing )

298
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,291
OH, NO.

299
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,250
NO, NO, I DON'T WANT IT.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

300
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:31,000
MY HEAD HURTS TOO MUCH!

301
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,000
- ( needle plunges )
- ( gasping )

302
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,958
- NOW THEN.
- I'M READY TO GO.

303
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,125
- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

304
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,458
- ( beeping )

305
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,333
- ENEMY VESSEL HAS BEEN
DETECTED BEHIND KUTE 102.

306
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,666
- WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT TYPE IS IT?

307
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,666
- WITH A PROBABILITY OF 82%,

308
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,833
IT'S AN SE-1200 TYPE B.

309
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,833
I BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE GEKKO.

310
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,083
- NOT GOOD.

311
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,541
ALL HANDS, REPORT
TO BATTLE STATIONS.

312
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,541
- ( alarm blaring )

313
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,166
- Holland:
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

314
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,958
- THERE'S A MILITARY AIRSHIP
MANEUVERING ON THE OTHER SIDE

315
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,166
OF THE CORALIAN.
- OF ALL TIMES FOR THIS.

316
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,833
- AND EUREKA STILL HASN'T--
- YES, I KNOW THAT.

317
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,375
I CAN'T LET THEM GET IN THE WAY
UNTIL SHE GETS TO THE ZONE.

318
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,500
ALL HANDS,
REPORT TO BATTLE STATIONS.

319
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,791
- MY, MY, ISN'T THIS UNUSUAL?
- HUH?

320
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,875
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO RUN AWAY AGAIN.

321
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,458
- WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO.
- ROGER THAT.

322
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,666
- I WANT YOU TO KEEP CALCULATING
THE TRAPAR DENSITY.

323
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,708
- YEAH, AND THE DISTANCE
TO THE CORALIAN.

324
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,083
- THE END IS
DESCENDING RAPIDLY.

325
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,583
- THAT LITTLE BRAT.
WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING?

326
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,833
- IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
A GOOD WAVE OVER THERE.

327
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,541
- THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DOING.
- WHAT?

328
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,791
- Gidget: 606, 808,
30 KILOMETERS TO ZONE.

329
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,875
- Matthieu: I'M STARTING
TO GET GOOSE BUMPS, HONEY.

330
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,541
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP
AND CONCENTRATE?

331
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,083
- Renton:
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, EUREKA?

332
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,750
YOU LOOK REALLY PALE.

333
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,875
MAYBE IT'D BE BETTER
IF WE JUST WENT BACK.

334
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,791
- NO, I'M ALL RIGHT.
RENTON, LOOK.

335
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,291
- ( gasps )

336
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,791
THIS IS--
- RIGHT.

337
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,416
IT'S THE ZONE.

338
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,416
- EUREKA, TAKE THE LEAD.
- ROGER.

339
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,750
- MATTHIEU, WE ALL HAVE TO
STAY TOGETHER.

340
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,458
- OKAY, HONEY.
- OH, WHERE DID IT GO?

341
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,916
DAMN IT ALL.

342
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,208
- ( screaming )
- MATTHIEU!

343
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,083
- Gidget: THE 606 HAS BEEN
KNOCKED OFF COURSE.

344
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,750
AN UNKNOWN SHIP IS FLYING ABOVE,
MOVING AT HIGH SPEED.

345
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,250
- HURRY UP
AND RECOVER THE 606.

346
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,083
GIDGET, CONTACT THE NIRVASH
RIGHT AWAY.

347
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,791
- THE TRAPAR IS WAY TOO DENSE.
I CAN'T MAKE CONTACT.

348
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,000
- OH, YEAH, SWEETHEART,
THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE!

349
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,083
- IT'S FAR FROM SWEET,
YOU IDIOT!

350
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,125
NIRVASH, I'VE GOTTA
HEAD BACK TO THE GEKKO.

351
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,125
- Renton:
MISS HILDA, WHAT WAS THAT?

352
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,541
- I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

353
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,458
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
TO GIVE YOU SUPPORT.

354
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,541
- PLEASE DO.
- HUH?

355
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,541
AN LFO?

356
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,750
- WOW, WHAT GREAT REACTIONS.

357
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,666
I JUST LOVE STUFF LIKE THAT.

358
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,625
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M GONNA HAVE TO KILL YOU.

359
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,125
- OH, NO!

360
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,875
- ( grunting )

361
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,250
WHAT IS THIS KLF?

362
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,125
IT LOOKS LIKE THE NIRVASH.

363
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,166
- Anemone: INTERESTING.

364
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,166
YOU REALLY LOOK A LOT
LIKE THE END.

365
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,166
COME ON, INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

366
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,666
HELLO THERE,
MY CUTE LITTLE LOOK-ALIKE.

367
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,875
DIE FOR ME, OKAY?

368
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,083
COMMENCE BASCUDE CRISIS!

369
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,791
- ( screaming )

370
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,458
- MELT AWAY.  MELT AWAY.
YOUR BRAIN'S GONNA MELT AWAY!

371
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,583
- STOP IT!

372
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,750
AND WITH THAT,

373
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:21,083
WE DEPARTED
ON A TRIP TO THE AFTERLIFE.

374
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,791
TO BE CONTINUED.

375
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,708
- ( theme music playing )

376
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

377
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,500
- BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS
OF THE CORALIAN,

378
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:05,000
THE GEKKO WAS FORCED INTO
A BATTLE WITH THE MILITARY.

379
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,333
MEANWHILE, THE BOY
MEETS A CERTAIN GIRL,

380
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,916
WHILE WANDERING AROUND
IN A WORLD OF NIGHTMARES.

381
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,875
