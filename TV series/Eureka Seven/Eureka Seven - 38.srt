1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,875
- Renton: EUREKA,
WHAT'S BEYOND THE GREAT WALL?

4
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,083
- Eureka:
I DON'T KNOW.

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,166
BUT THERE IS ONE WORD
I KNOW OF TO DESCRIBE IT.

6
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,166
- WHAT IS IT?

7
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,166
- FUTURE.

8
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,166
THAT IS WHAT IS BEYOND
THE GREAT WALL, RENTON.

9
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,166
ADROC SAID THAT TO ME.

10
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,666
- MY DAD DID?!

11
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,958
- MM-HMM.

12
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,291
- WAIT, YOU MEAN YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT MY DAD?!

13
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,250
- WHAT'S WRONG?

14
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,375
- YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME
THAT YOU KNEW.

15
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,375
- ABOUT WHAT?

16
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,416
- ABOUT MY DAD!

17
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,041
- Eureka: WELL, I DIDN'T
THINK THAT YOU WOULD WANT

18
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,625
TO HEAR ABOUT HIM THAT MUCH.
WAS I WRONG?

19
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,041
- HE'S MY FAMILY!

20
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,958
JEEZ, ANYONE WOULD WANNA HEAR
ABOUT THEIR FAMILY,

21
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,041
WOULDN'T THEY?

22
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,041
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT, RENTON.

23
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,708
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?

24
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,416
IT'S THE NATURAL WAY
FOR PEOPLE TO THINK.

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,416
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

26
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,125
- WHAT'S WRONG,
IS THAT I'M NOT HUMAN.

27
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,791
- ( sneeze )

28
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,833
- News Reporter: AND NOW THE
LATEST NEWS FROM CAPITOL HILL,

29
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,708
WHICH HAS ONCE AGAIN
SEVERED ALL COMMUNICATIONS.

30
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,041
OUR CAPITAL CITY IS EXPERIENCING

31
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,833
THE GREATEST CRISIS
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD.

32
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,833
SIX HOURS AFTER THE BEGINNING
OF THE FIERCE BATTLE

33
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,708
BETWEEN THE CORALIANS AND
THE UNITED FEDERATIONS FORCES...

34
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,875
- HE'S MAKING THE CORALIANS
APPEAR, AND THEN PRETENDING

35
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,375
TO BE THE MESSIAH.
HIS PLAN IS WORKING PERFECTLY.

36
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,041
LOOK, HOLLAND,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

37
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,083
BUT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

38
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,958
AND ABOUT WHAT WE
SHOULD BE DOING.

39
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:23,958
- DAMN!

40
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,666
- YEAH, WHAT WE CAN DO
RIGHT NOW... RIGHT.

41
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
- Master Norb:
DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS

42
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,750
HAPPEN OFTEN BETWEEN YOU?

43
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,375
- Renton: WELL, I CAN'T SAY
THAT IT NEVER HAPPENS.

44
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,666
- HMM...

45
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,625
- "HMM," THAT'S ALL
YOU'VE GOT TO SAY?

46
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,083
- YOU WANNA HEAR SOMETHING ELSE?

47
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,458
- I MEAN, EUREKA AND I
ARE GONNA GET PAST

48
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,708
THE GREAT WALL, AREN'T WE?

49
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,125
- YOU AND EUREKA, HUH?

50
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,875
- IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME
SOME ADVICE OR SOMETHING--

51
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,291
- WHAT, EXACTLY,
DO YOU WANT TO DO?

52
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,541
HOW DO YOU WANT THINGS
TO END UP WITH HER?

53
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,000
- Hilda:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

54
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,416
- I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING AT ALL, REALLY.

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,791
- SUSPICIOUS, VERY SUSPICIOUS.

56
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,375
- OKAY...

57
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,416
- Renton: NO!

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,416
I WASN'T READING THAT.
IT-- IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING!

59
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,500
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

60
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,458
- ( lighter flicking )

61
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,875
- Stoner:
WHAT CAN I BE DOING RIGHT NOW?

62
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,375
WHAT CAN I DO,
CONSIDERING I CAN'T OPERATE

63
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,333
AN LFO NOR THE SHIP.

64
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,083
THE ONLY THING I CAN DO
IS TELL WHAT TO US,

65
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,833
IS THE OBVIOUS TRUTH.

66
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,000
HOWEVER RIGHT NOW,
THE INFORMATION

67
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,000
FROM THE MASS MEDIA
IS FLOWING PAST EVERYONE'S EYES.

68
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,083
AND THAT'S WHAT'S SINKING
INTO PEOPLE'S HEARTS,

69
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,750
IS THE TRUTH.
IT'S POSSIBLE TO SET UP

70
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,375
A COUNTERATTACK AGAINST IT,

71
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,250
BUT IT WOULD BE
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT.

72
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,458
ON TOP OF THAT, DEWEY HAS
ALREADY LAUNCHED AN ATTACK

73
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:43,083
AGAINST THE OLD REGIME,
THE SAGE COUNCIL.

74
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,916
I'VE MISSED MY CHANCE.
FROM HERE ON I NEED TO COME UP

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,916
WITH A DIFFERENT WAY TO FIGHT.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,916
THE UNSWAYING TRUTH,
SOMETHING THAT SURPASSES

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,958
ALL OTHER ATTACKS.

78
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,333
EUREKA, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

79
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,708
- IT'S ADROC.

80
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,083
- News Reporter: WE ARE ALL
NOW STANDING IN A TIME

81
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,708
OF MOMENTOUS DECISION.

82
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,416
DO WE GO ALONG WITH THE COURAGE
THAT OUR HERO, ADROC THURSTON,

83
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,583
HAS SHOWN US AND STAND UP
WITH COLONEL DEWEY

84
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,333
TO FIGHT THE CORALIANS?

85
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:16,208
OR DO WE NOT FIGHT AT ALL?
THAT IS THE DECISION TO BE MADE.

86
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,041
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

87
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,750
- WHAT DO WE THINK OF THAT?
I, UH...

88
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,541
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

89
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,041
BUT I'M REALLY STARTING
TO FEEL SORRY FOR RENTON.

90
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,875
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

91
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,916
GUYS, YOU KNOW WE'RE
JUST ABOUT TO HAVE THEM

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,625
TRY AND GET PAST
THE GREAT WALL.

93
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,791
IF SOMETHING BAD
WERE TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THEM--

94
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,291
- WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE?

95
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,083
- YEAH, I AGREE WITH HIM.
ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT

96
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,125
RENTON IS JUST AN ORDINARY BOY.

97
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,625
SO IT'D BE STRANGE FOR HIM
NOT TO THINK OF THAT STUFF.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,041
- I THINK THE THING
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE

99
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,875
IS HOW EUREKA
FEELS ABOUT IT ALL.

100
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,500
- RIGHT, GIDGET.
OF COURSE, THAT'S A GIVEN.

101
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,958
- UM, GUYS?

102
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,708
I HAVE A QUESTION THAT WE
SHOULD KEEP JUST BETWEEN US.

103
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,416
- WHAT IS IT?

104
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,791
- UH... WELL, NEVER MIND.
IT WAS JUST A STUPID THOUGHT.

105
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,291
- COME ON, MOONDOGGIE.

106
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,916
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT
AND THEN DROP IT.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,416
IT'S GONNA DRIVE ME CRAZY.

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,708
- OH, WELL ALL RIGHT.

109
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:13,166
ARE THOSE TWO ABLE... TO DO IT?

110
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,208
- YOU'RE SUCH A JERK,
MOONDOGGIE!

111
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,458
- YOU CAN JUST GET OUT OF HERE,
RIGHT NOW!

112
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,666
- HEY NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD ON HERE.

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,250
THIS IS A QUESTION THAT COULD BE
IMPORTANT FOR RENTON.

114
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,708
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH!

115
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,541
I WAS A FOOL TO COME
AND ASK YOU GUYS FOR ADVICE.

116
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,958
LET'S GO, GIDGET.

117
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,500
- Stoner: A FAMILY, HUH?
I SEE, THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION.

118
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,916
- Eureka:
WHY IS IT TOUGH?

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,708
- BECAUSE THERE'S
NO RIGHT ANSWER.

120
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,875
BESIDES, I'M LIKE RENTON,
I DON'T REMEMBER

121
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,125
MY DAD'S FACE ALL TOO WELL,
IF AT ALL.

122
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,458
I'M ONE OF THOSE
SO-CALLED WAR ORPHANS.

123
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,958
- A WAR ORPHAN?

124
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,916
- YEAH, SO I CAN UNDERSTAND

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,125
HOW RENTON WOULD GET
ALL WORKED UP ABOUT IT.

126
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,625
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
I CAN APPRECIATE HOW YOU FEEL

127
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,625
ABOUT NOT UNDERSTANDING
WHY HE'S UPSET.

128
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,250
- STONER, IS IT ALL RIGHT
FOR ME TO STAY BY RENTON'S SIDE?

129
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,458
IS IT ALL RIGHT FOR ME TO KEEP
STAYING ABOARD THIS SHIP?

130
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,208
- ( door opens )

131
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,166
- EUREKA?

132
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,250
- Gidget:
WHAT'S THE MATTER, EUREKA?

133
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,416
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,166
- ALL RIGHT NOW,
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

135
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,916
- SHE'S HAVING
TROUBLE ESTABLISHING

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,250
A LINE OF COMMUNICATION
WITH RENTON.

137
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,416
- YOU MEAN THEY'RE NOT...
COMMUNICATING?

138
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,291
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

139
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,875
- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT,

140
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,000
IT'S ALL RIGHT
FOR YOU TO SAY NO.

141
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,833
- IF HE'S PERSISTENT ABOUT IT,
YOU CAN JUST PUNCH HIM!

142
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,416
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, GIDGET?

143
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,541
- UM... WHY DON'T WE GO BACK
TO MY ROOM AND TALK, OKAY?

144
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,958
- BUT, GIDGET--

145
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,500
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, THINGS
LIKE THIS SHOULD BE TALKED OUT

146
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,500
BETWEEN JUST US GIRLS.

147
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,125
- ( door closes )

148
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,750
- WHOA, WHAT WAS
ALL THAT ABOUT?

149
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,500
- I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT HOW I'D LIKE THINGS

150
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,208
TO END UP WITH EUREKA.

151
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,583
I WONDER, HOW DID
DAD AND MOM HIT IT OFF?

152
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,166
I MEAN, IF THEY DIDN'T
GO OUT AND GET MARRIED

153
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,875
AND DO STUFF LIKE THAT,
I WOULDN'T HAVE EVER BEEN BORN.

154
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,625
THAT'S RIGHT, NEVER BORN.

155
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,750
- ( door opens )

156
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,250
- MISTER MATTHIEU,
BROTHER DOGGIE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

157
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,791
- ( gasps )

158
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,000
- REALLY, IT'S NOT HOW IT LOOKS!

159
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,625
- REST ASSURED.

160
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,375
BOTH OF US ARE ON YOUR SIDE.

161
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,458
- Talho:
THIS IS THE SHORTEST ROUTE

162
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,500
TO THE LOCATION THAT NORB
GAVE US OF THE VODARAC SHRINE.

163
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,500
- OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM IS

164
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,208
STOPPING ALONG THE WAY
TO REFUEL.

165
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,750
- IN A PINCH, I KNOW
SOME PLACES WE CAN STOP.

166
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,208
BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT HOW
THE ARMY'S MOVING AROUND

167
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,041
IN THAT AREA.

168
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,541
- IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME

169
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,000
BEFORE HE TAKES OVER
THE CAPITAL,

170
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,166
USING THIS RIOT
AS A JUSTIFICATION.

171
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,708
- Man: MAYBE, BUT NOT EVERYONE
IN THE ARMY'S GOING TO AGREE

172
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,250
TO GO ALONG
WITH A COUP D'ETAT.

173
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,416
- BUT ANYONE OPPOSING HIM
WILL BE PUT AWAY IN A HURRY.

174
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,541
THAT'S OBVIOUS, CONSIDERING
HOW FAR HE'S GONE

175
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,875
TO ENGINEER THIS COUP.

176
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,583
- I'D SAY TWO WEEKS,
AT THE MOST,

177
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,708
FOR HIM TO REPLACE EVERYONE.
ALL THE WAY OUT TO

178
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,958
THE RURAL STATE ARMY
COMMANDERS IN THE FIELD.

179
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,291
- SO THEN WE NEED
TO ARRIVE THERE

180
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,500
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

181
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,250
- Mischa ( intercom ):
TALHO, COULD YOU COME

182
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,833
TO MY OFFICE
WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE.

183
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,958
- ROGER THAT,
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

184
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,083
- Mischa ( intercom ):
YOU TOO, HOLLAND.

185
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,750
- WHY DO I HAVE TO GO?

186
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,291
- YOU'RE THE FATHER, AREN'T YOU?

187
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,416
- ( laughing )

188
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,541
- HEY, HOLLAND!

189
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,083
- EUREKA, WHAT'S WRONG?

190
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,750
HOLLAND, IS IT TRUE
YOU WERE A DAD?

191
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,416
NO, BUT PRETTY SOON
I'M GONNA BECOME ONE.

192
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,833
- OH REALLY, HOW?

193
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,166
- WAIT, YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW?

194
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,416
YEAH, HOW?

195
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,250
- DO HUMANS REALLY NEED
TO HAVE A DAD AROUND?

196
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,875
DADS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT,
AREN'T THEY?  AREN'T THEY?

197
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,333
- WELL, I WON'T KNOW
UNTIL I BECOME ONE.

198
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:33,250
- OH, SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY
RENTON WAS SO AGGRESSIVE.

199
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,500
- WHAT?

200
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:39,000
- MAYBE RENTON WANTS
TO BECOME A DAD HIMSELF.

201
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,625
- RENTON!

202
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,541
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!

203
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,000
- Stoner: EVERY WAVE STARTS
FROM THE MOST PETTY OF THINGS.

204
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,000
- HOT!

205
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,083
- Renton:
UM... HEY GUYS?

206
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,041
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU DOING?

207
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,416
- YOU JUST LEAVE IT TO US.

208
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.

209
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,125
- DAMN YOU!

210
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,000
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO TO EUREKA?!

211
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,333
- Stoner: AND WHEN THEY
FINALLY GET TOGETHER,

212
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,750
PERHAPS THEY WILL
BECOME A GIANT WAVE

213
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,833
THAT TURNS OVER THE WORLD.

214
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,500
I GUESS.

215
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,375
- SO THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.

216
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,875
- Renton:
YOU SEE...

217
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,958
MY SISTER AND MY GRANDFATHER
ARE THE ONLY FAMILY MEMBERS

218
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,333
THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN.

219
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,666
AND I NEVER THOUGHT THAT EUREKA
WOULD KNOW DAD,

220
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,291
SO I GUESS I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

221
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:49,166
MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE ALWAYS
THOUGHT THAT I HATED MY DAD.

222
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,791
HE JUST TOOK OFF

223
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,625
AND ABANDONED HIS FAMILY.

224
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,541
AND SPENT ALL HIS TIME
DOING RESEARCH.

225
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,125
I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN HIS FACE.

226
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,625
BUT SUDDENLY,

227
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,041
SUDDENLY I REALIZED HOW MUCH
I WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT HIM.

228
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,125
HOW MUCH I LONGED FOR HIM.

229
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,875
- THEN YOU HAVE TO GO
AND TALK TO HER ABOUT HIM.

230
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,666
YOU SHOULD HEAR IT
FROM HER DIRECTLY.

231
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,125
ALL ABOUT YOUR DAD--

232
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,708
THE HERO, ADROC THURSTON.

233
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,625
- IT'S GOING WELL.

234
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,000
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE FREE
TO GET UP NOW.

235
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,416
- HOW STRANGE.

236
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,500
- YES, BUT THAT'S FAMILY.

237
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,250
EVERYONE STARTS WITH THE FEELING

238
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,083
OF DEEP AFFECTION.

239
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,375
- AFFECTION.

240
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,208
- YEP, AND THEN WHEN IT
TURNS INTO TRUE LOVE,

241
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,500
A BRAND NEW LIFE
COMES INTO BEING.

242
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,875
- AMAZING.

243
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,583
HUMANS ARE SO AMAZING.

244
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,083
- ( door opens )

245
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,041
- EUREKA...

246
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,375
- I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

247
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,125
- THEY HAVEN'T STARTED
TALKING YET.

248
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,125
- I'M SORRY.
- I'M SORRY.

249
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,291
- SORRY.
- SORRY.

250
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,041
- SORRY ABOUT YELLING
AT YOU EARLIER.

251
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,083
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, RENTON.

252
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,041
- BUT IT IS
ALL MY FAULT, EUREKA.

253
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,291
- IT'S NOT.

254
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,458
I'M THE ONE TO BLAME.

255
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,458
- EUREKA...

256
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,166
- IT'S BECAUSE-- IT'S BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

257
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,875
FAMILIES, FATHERS,
BROTHERS, SISTERS.

258
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,750
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT.

259
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,666
THAT'S WHY
I DIDN'T REALIZE

260
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,333
THAT ADROC WAS SUCH
AN IMPORTANT PERSON TO YOU.

261
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,625
I SWEAR I DIDN'T KNOW!

262
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,708
AND SO--

263
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,000
- I SUCK.

264
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,250
- WHAT?

265
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,833
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE

266
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,583
AN UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS
LIKE PARENTS AND FAMILIES.

267
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,666
I'M SO SORRY,
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE

268
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,291
YOU FEEL BAD LIKE THIS.

269
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,500
- RENTON?

270
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,500
- I ACTED SO HIGH AND MIGHTY.

271
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:31,625
AND SAID I WOULD
ALWAYS PROTECT YOU.

272
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,625
BUT I FAILED.

273
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,166
I DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

274
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,791
TO SIT NEXT TO YOU
IN THE NIRVASH.

275
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,833
- MANY YEARS AGO, ADROC
SAID THE SAME THING TO ME.

276
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,375
- MY DAD DID?

277
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,541
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IT WAS BEFORE I WAS ASSIGNED

278
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,041
TO WORK WITH THE S.O.F.

279
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,250
ADROC WAS THE LEAD RESEARCHER
IN THE PROJECT

280
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,125
THAT WAS ASSIGNED TO ANALYZE
ME AND THE NIRVASH.

281
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,250
HE WAS ALWAYS AT MY SIDE.

282
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:06,250
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYTHING.

283
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,250
SO HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO TALK,
HOW TO ACT,

284
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:12,250
HOW TO CONTROL THE NIRVASH,
AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS.

285
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,833
RENTON, HE TAUGHT ME SO MUCH.

286
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,875
AND HE-- HE WOULD SAY TO ME,

287
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,875
"I'LL ALWAYS
PROTECT YOU, EUREKA.."

288
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,791
- DAD SAID THAT?

289
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,083
- BUT THEN ONE DAY,
ADROC SAID TO ME,

290
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,291
"I'VE FAILED, EUREKA."

291
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,583
- WAS THAT THE SUMMER OF LOVE?

292
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,083
- MM-HMM.

293
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,375
- Eureka: BACK THEN,
I DIDN'T REALIZE THE MEANING

294
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,125
OF THE WORDS THAT ADROC SAID.

295
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:55,916
BUT EVEN NOW, I REMEMBER
IT CLEARLY.  HE SAID,

296
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,125
"I DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO SIT NEXT TO YOU.

297
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,125
I HAVE CHILDREN, AND I NEED
TO PROTECT THEM

298
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,125
AND THEIR FUTURES.

299
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,583
AND SO, I CAN'T STAND BY AND LET
THIS WORLD COME TO AN END.

300
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,375
I'M SORRY."

301
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,708
THAT WAS THE LAST DAY
I SPENT WITH ADROC.

302
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,291
BEFORE I REALIZED IT,

303
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,166
IT WAS ALL OVER.

304
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,208
SO YOU SEE, RENTON?

305
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,125
ADROC PROTECTED EVERYONE.

306
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,333
HE PROTECTED THE WHOLE WORLD
THAT DAY.

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
AND I'M SURE THAT I
WAS A PART OF IT.

308
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,250
- WHY ARE THE TWO
OF THEM CRYING?

309
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,000
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

310
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,666
- WOULD YOU KEEP STILL?

311
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,000
- HEY, LEADER?

312
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,333
- JEEZ, SHUT UP.

313
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,583
- MY DAD HAD BEEN
THINKING ABOUT US AFTER ALL.

314
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:24,500
DAD DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT ME
OR SIS, OR GRAMPS,

315
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,583
OR ANYONE ELSE.

316
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,083
- NO HE DIDN'T.

317
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,000
- DAD REALLY DID IT!

318
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,458
HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF
AND SAVED US ALL!

319
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,041
- I'M CERTAIN THAT I WAS
ABLE TO MEET YOU

320
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,083
BECAUSE MY DAD DID WHAT HE DID
AND PROTECTED YOU.

321
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,416
BECAUSE MY DAD WAS THERE,
I MET YOU.

322
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,708
- RENTON, I JUST NOW
FIGURED IT OUT.

323
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,791
TO PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN,
EVEN IF IT MEANS

324
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,291
SACRIFICING YOUR LIFE,

325
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,833
THAT'S WHAT BEING
A DAD IS ABOUT.

326
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,000
AND THAT'S WHAT A FAMILY IS.

327
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,291
- EUREKA...

328
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,583
- IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
ADROC IS--

329
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,958
IT'S LIKE HE WAS MY DAD!

330
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,041
- ( laughing )

331
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,750
- WAIT A MINUTE,
NOW THEY'RE LAUGHING.

332
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,666
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

333
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,208
- Stoner:
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

334
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,625
- LEADER, I HAVE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

335
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,791
ACTUALLY, I WANT TO USE
THIS AS THE COVER SHOT

336
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,708
FOR THE FIRST RENEWAL ISSUE
OF ray=out MAGAZINE.

337
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:40,000
I BELIEVE THAT IN THIS PHOTO,
IS WHERE THE TRUTH LIES.

338
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,416
EUREKA AND RENTON,
A CORALIAN AND A HUMAN,

339
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,750
RIDE TOGETHER, SHARING THE JOY
OF THE EXPERIENCE.

340
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,708
I BELIEVE THAT THIS
IS THE TRUTH

341
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,750
THAT MAY BECOME HOPE
FOR THE PEOPLE.

342
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,708
A TRUTH THAT IS
NEITHER THE HARD-LINE

343
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,125
NOR THE RESISTANCE.

344
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,875
HOWEVER, I DON'T WANT TO HURT
EITHER OF YOUR FEELINGS

345
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,125
BY USING THIS
AS THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE

346
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,875
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO.

347
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,250
- NO, IT'S FINE.

348
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,333
I'M ALL RIGHT WITH IT.
I'M HAPPY.

349
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,125
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, RENTON?

350
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,083
- YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT
WITH IT, TOO.

351
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,666
PLEASE, GO AHEAD AND USE IT.

352
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,583
- GOOD, THEN IT'S DECIDED.

353
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,666
- SO, YOU'RE FINE
WITH IT TOO, LEADER?

354
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,916
- FINE OR NOT, YOU'RE THE ONE
IN CHARGE OF ray=out.

355
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,875
AREN'T YOU?

356
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,458
Linck:
WHAT'S GOING ON? WHATCHA DOING?

357
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,958
- OH, HI MOMMA!
THERE YOU ARE.

358
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,625
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT PICTURE?

359
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,458
- LET ME SEE, LET ME SEE!

360
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,875
- Linck:
NO, LET ME SEE!

361
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,875
- FAMILY, HUH.

362
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,291
- I HAVE AN URGENT REPORT.

363
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,000
THE REBEL FORCES LED
BY DEWEY NOVAK

364
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,791
HAVE DEPLOYED POISONOUS GAS

365
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,750
ON THE LOWER FLOORS.

366
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,916
REGARDING THE THREE OF YOU,
WE FEEL IT'S ESSENTIAL

367
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
THAT YOU EVACUATE
FROM HERE IMMEDIATELY!

368
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,875
- TO THINK THAT HE'D EVEN USE
THE CORALIANS LIKE THAT.

369
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,625
- HE NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED

370
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,541
WHETHER A BLOODLESS REVOLUTION
WAS POSSIBLE.

371
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,000
- THIS IS ALL HAPPENING
BECAUSE YOU DECIDED

372
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,166
TO KEEP THE SECRET
HIDDEN FROM ALL OF US.

373
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,833
- Braya: TO EXPLOIT THE TRUTH
IS NOT THE ONLY WAY

374
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:11,166
FOR ONE TO GAIN HAPPINESS.
THE REVERSE CAN ALSO HAPPEN.

375
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,583
- Kuzemi:
THE INFORMATION CAME TOO LATE.

376
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,166
WHEN THE AGEHA REPORT
FINALLY CAME IN FOR US TO SEE,

377
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,625
THERE WERE ALREADY
TOO MANY PEOPLE ON THIS LAND.

378
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,208
- SO MANY, THAT WE COULD NOT
ALL FIT ABOARD THE GIANT ARK

379
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,083
THAT HAD GUIDED US
TO THIS PLANET.

380
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,958
ARE YOU GOING TO RELEASE US
FROM THE ENDURING PAIN

381
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,750
OF HAVING HIDDEN THE WHOLE TRUTH
ABOUT THIS LIVING PLANET

382
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,875
FROM THE TEEMING MASSES?

383
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,666
- IF YOU MANAGE
TO DEFEAT US,

384
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,125
YOU WILL CARRY THAT BURDEN
WITH YOU FOREVER.

385
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,208
- IF THAT IS YOUR POSITION--

386
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,208
- ( gunshots )

387
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,416
- FROM THE MOMENT I LET YOU
OUT OF YOUR CELL,

388
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,333
I KNEW THAT THINGS
WOULD HAPPEN AS THEY DID.

389
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,833
DEWEY NOVAK.

390
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,541
- Eureka and Renton:
TO BE CONTINUED.

391
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,500
- ( theme music playing )

392
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

393
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,875
- Talho:
THE STORY MOVES ON

394
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,583
WITH THE ENTIRE WORLD
NOW INVOLVED.

395
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,208
WHAT DID GEKKOSTATE ACQUIRE

396
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,708
IN THE HARSH PATH
OF THEIR JOURNEY

397
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,000
TOWARDS THE GREAT WALL?

398
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,416
NEXT EPISODE--
"JOIN THE FUTURE."
