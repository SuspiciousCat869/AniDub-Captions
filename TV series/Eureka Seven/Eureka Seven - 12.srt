1
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,291
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,625
- ( grunts )

4
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,458
- ( laughs )
WOW, WHAT GREAT REACTION!

5
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,708
I JUST LOVE STUFF LIKE THAT.

6
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,666
AND THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA
HAVE TO KILL YOU.

7
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,625
- ( grunts )

8
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,125
- WHAT IS THIS KLF?

9
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,958
IT LOOKS LIKE THE NIRVASH!

10
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,750
- INTERESTING.  YOU REALLY
LOOK A LOT LIKE THE END.

11
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,750
COME ON, INTRODUCE YOURSELF!

12
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,916
HELLO THERE,
MY CUTE LITTLE LOOK-ALIKE.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,750
DIE FOR ME, OKAY?
- ( gasps )

14
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,958
- COMMENCE BASCUDE CRISIS!

15
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,625
- ( screaming )

16
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,875
- ( grunting )

17
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,291
- MELT AWAY.  MELT AWAY.
YOUR BRAIN'S GONNA MELT AWAY!

18
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:05,208
- ( grunts )
STOP IT!

19
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:14,250
- HELP ME.  HELP ME.
HELP ME!

20
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:22,541
HELP ME, SIS, HELP ME!

21
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,500
- RENTON.
- ( laughing maniacally )

22
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,541
- NO, DON'T.
DON'T LEAVE ME!

23
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,666
- WHAT?

24
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,708
- ( gasps )

25
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,291
I WAS TERRIFIED.

26
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,291
SO TERRIFIED,
I COULDN'T STAND IT.

27
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,791
EVEN SO, IT FELT AS IF THE SCENE
THAT STRETCHED OUT BEFORE ME

28
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,791
WAS SOMETHING
THAT I'D SEEN BEFORE.

29
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,666
BUT AT THE TIME, THE ONLY THING
I WAS CAPABLE OF DOING WAS

30
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,833
TO KEEP ON WATCHING IT.

31
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,875
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE ONCE AGAIN
THE NIRVASH

32
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,750
WAS THE ONLY ONE
TO MAKE IT THROUGH.

33
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,833
MATTHIEU.
MATTHIEU, DO YOU COPY?

34
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,166
MATTHIEU, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
- ( groans )

35
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,500
- HEY, MATTHIEU!

36
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,250
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT
TAKEN OUT, BOARD AND ALL,

37
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,416
HOW PATHETIC! ( sighs )

38
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,833
- GET IT TOGETHER.

39
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,333
I MANAGED TO GRAB
SOME GREAT SHOTS.

40
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,291
HURRY, I WANNA GET
THESE DEVELOPED.

41
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,125
- ( alarm blaring )
- HUH?

42
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,958
- MATTHIEU, BEHIND YOU!

43
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,333
- Man: TREMORS
FROM EXPLOSIONS DETECTED.

44
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,125
STARBOARD HEADING 0810,
DISTANCE 18.

45
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,208
ALL MISSILES HAVE BEEN LOST.
- WHERE ARE THE LFO TARGETS?

46
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,333
- WE LOST THEM.
THE TRAPAR INTERFERENCE WAVES

47
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,791
ARE CONFUSING THE MISSILE
GUIDANCE SYSTEMS.

48
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,875
- CAPTAIN JURGENS.

49
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,250
- VISUAL CONFIRMATION
OF THE ENEMY.

50
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,416
- PREPARE TO FIRE THE LASERS.

51
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,791
FOCUS ALL CANNONS TOWARDS
THE CENTER OF THE TARGET.

52
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:30,583
- TARGET HEADING 0400,
RANGE IS 8,000.  DEPLOY.

53
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,833
- NOW FIRE.

54
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,000
- WE DIDN'T HIT IT, SIR.

55
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,958
THE TRAJECTORY TO LASERS
IS BEING DISTORTED.

56
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,958
- HMM.

57
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,916
THINK IT'LL ANGLE
IN THE SAME DIRECTION?

58
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,958
- PRECURSOR WAVES ARE
DEAD AHEAD.

59
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,291
TRACKING ANTI-SHIP LASERS.

60
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,500
- WHAT?

61
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,583
- WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

62
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,750
- IT CAME CURVING AROUND THE
OUTSIDE OF THE CORALIAN CLOUD.

63
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,000
- NO WAY!
A LASER CAN'T CURVE LIKE THAT.

64
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,375
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

65
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,708
DO WE ATTACK THE ENEMY SHIP
OR ARE WE GONNA DIVE IN?

66
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,291
I'VE GOT MY HANDS FULL JUST
KEEPING THIS THING FLYING.

67
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,291
- WE'VE LOST CONTACT
WITH THE NIRVASH.

68
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,958
MENTAL AND VITAL DATA
IS OFFLINE.

69
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,541
- WOZ.
- GIVE ME A SECOND.

70
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,208
THE COMPACT INTERFERENCER
WON'T STABILIZE.

71
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,666
- HEY, GIDGET.
WHERE'S THE NIRVASH NOW?

72
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,666
- ( whimpers )
I CAN'T CONFIRM ITS LOCATION.

73
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,916
- AT THIS RATE, WE WON'T
BE ABLE TO RESCUE THEM,

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,875
LET ALONE GET IN OURSELVES.

75
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,333
- ( grumbles )

76
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,791
- CALCULATING LASER
DISTORTION RATE.

77
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,000
- WE'LL RESUME OUR ATTACKS
WHEN THE ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE.

78
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,458
- WE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECEIVE
THE ID CODE FROM THE END.

79
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:54,875
WE SHOULD PULL BACK NOW.
WE NEED TO REGROUP AND REASSESS.

80
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,500
- AT THIS POINT, WE'VE LOST
EVERY ONE OF OUR KLF UNITS.

81
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,541
WINNING A SHIP-TO-SHIP BATTLE
IS OUR ONLY CHANCE.

82
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,541
- THE PRIORITY SHOULD BE
RETRIEVING THE END.

83
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,333
THE PRIMARY MISSION OBJECTIVE
IS THE MONITORING

84
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,125
OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
THE CORALIAN AND ANEMONE.

85
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,291
A BATTLE WITH THAT GROUP IS NOT
SOMETHING WE WANT RIGHT NOW.

86
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,166
- WILL YOU CALM DOWN,
SECOND LIEUTENANT?

87
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,458
- IF WE'RE DEFEATED BEFORE WE
CAN ACT, IT'LL BE THAT GROUP

88
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,916
WHO RETRIEVES THE END, NOT US.
- ( grumbles )

89
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,500
- ( static crackling )
- Anemone: WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?

90
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,541
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

91
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,041
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE?

92
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,833
ANEMONE.

93
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,791
- HEY, GIDGET, WHAT ABOUT
HILDA AND MATTHIEU?

94
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,875
- UM... LET'S SEE,
THE 606 IS HALF WRECKED.

95
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,166
OH, BUT WAIT A MINUTE, IT LOOKS
LIKE THE 808 IS RECOVERING.

96
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,041
- WE DON'T NEED
"UMS" OR "BUTS."

97
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,041
- YEAH, BUT WOZ IS HELPING
MISCHA RIGHT NOW,

98
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,625
SO I'M DOING COMMUNICATIONS
AND RADAR.

99
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,583
I CAN'T DO BOTH AT ONCE.
- ( machine beeps )

100
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,208
- OH, CURRENTLY THEY'RE HEADED
BACK THIS WAY.

101
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,541
HEADING IS 0812.
- RIGHT.  LET'S GO PICK 'EM UP.

102
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,875
HEY, KEN-GOH.

103
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,416
ONCE THE LFOs ARE ABOARD,
TAKE US TO DEFCON-1.

104
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,083
I'M COUNTING ON YOU, MAESTRO.
- ROGER THAT.

105
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,750
- HOLLAND, WATCH THIS.
LOOK.

106
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,625
- WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

107
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,625
TWO SIGNALS FROM THE NIRVASH?

108
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,041
- ONE IS THE UNKNOWN SHIP
WE SAW EARLIER.

109
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,583
THERE IS SOMETHING THERE
INSIDE THE ZONE.

110
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,625
- Man: THE SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY
IS ABLE TO SEE ULTRAVIOLET RAYS,

111
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,625
SOMETHING WE HUMANS CANNOT.

112
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,625
AND BASED ON THE COLOR CHANGES
CAUSED BY ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT,

113
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,916
THE SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLIES
CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,625
THE MALES AND FEMALES.

115
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,625
IN A WORLD
THAT HUMAN BEINGS CANNOT SEE,

116
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,708
BUTTERFLIES ARE ABLE TO PROPERLY
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GENDERS.

117
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:50,416
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
- SO THEY CAN MAKE CHILDREN.

118
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,250
- ( students laughing )

119
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,000
- THAT'S CORRECT.

120
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,250
IT IS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION
THAT ALLOWS THE MALES

121
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,666
TO FIND THE FEMALES
AND LEAVE BEHIND OFFSPRING.

122
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,666
SUCH DIFFERENCES IN THE BASIC
FRAMEWORK OF THE SENSES

123
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,750
EXIST INHERENTLY
IN ALL LIVING THINGS.

124
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,208
FOR EXAMPLE,
EVEN THOUGH TRAPAR WINGS

125
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,125
ARE SOMETHING WE CAN'T SEE
WITH THE NAKED EYE,

126
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,208
SKYFISH ARE ABLE TO SEE THEM
AND MAKE USE OF THEM.

127
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,041
- ( gasping )

128
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,375
( panting )

129
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,708
- RECEIVING ID CODE
FROM THE NIRVASH.

130
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,125
LOCATION CONFIRMED.

131
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,041
- WHAT ABOUT EUREKA
AND RENTON?

132
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,708
- ALL VITAL AND MENTAL
SIGNALS ARE NORMAL.

133
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,875
WHAT? RENTON'S SHOWING
SIGNS OF--

134
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HE'S EXHIBITING A REM PATTERN.

135
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,583
- A REM PATTERN?

136
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,916
EVEN THOUGH HIS BODY
IS SLEEPING,

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,875
HIS BRAIN IS ONLY
IN A LIGHT SLUMBER.

138
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,416
IT COULD BE A SIGN THAT RENTON
IS HAVING SOME SORT OF A DREAM.

139
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,083
- HUH.
- TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

140
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:34,250
IT'S AS IF EUREKA IS CHASING
AFTER RENTON'S MENTAL SIGNALS.

141
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,583
HER SIGNALS ARE
SYNCHRONIZING WITH HIS.

142
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,500
- YOU MEAN
SHE'S CHASING AFTER HIM?

143
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,750
- HERE, LISTEN TO THIS.
- ( static crackling )

144
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,208
- Eureka:
DO YOU KNOW WHO RENTON IS?

145
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,083
WHY DO YOU HAVE
THE SAME FACE?

146
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,375
- OH, EUREKA.

147
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,458
- 808 AND 606 ARE APPROACHING
FROM THE FRONT.

148
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,083
- I'M OPENING THE HATCHES NOW.

149
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,791
- PRECURSOR WAVE COMING IN
FROM THE STARBOARD

150
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,500
AND SOME ANTI-SHIP LASERS.

151
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,541
- IS IT COMING FROM THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE CORALIAN CLOUD?

152
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,541
- THAT WAS CLOSER THAN
LAST TIME.

153
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,416
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE FACTORING
IN THE EFFECT OF THE CORALIAN.

154
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,916
- ALL RIGHT, HA,
GO TO DEFCON-1.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,375
- GOING TO DEFCON-1.

156
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,041
- SAFETY LOCKS ON ALL WEAPONS
HAVE BEEN DEACTIVATED.

157
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,375
AUTO RAPID-FIRE MODE.

158
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,000
- 606 AND 808 ARE IN.
RETRIEVAL COMPLETE.

159
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,791
- ALL RIGHT.
HEADING 0300, SPEED LEVEL 2.

160
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,208
- ROGER THAT.

161
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,833
- HUGE TRAPAR WAVE INCOMING.

162
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,666
- DON'T LET US GET SWEPT AWAY!

163
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,666
- ( grunting )
- ( screams )

164
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,708
- LOOK, THERE THEY ARE.

165
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,791
- PREPARE TO FIRE
LASER CANNON.

166
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,041
FIRE!

167
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,791
- EVASIVE MANEUVERS.
- THERE'S NO TIME!

168
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,333
- DAMN IT!

169
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,708
- WE'RE IN LUCK.
KEN-GOH, FIRE THE MAIN CANNONS.

170
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:36,375
- RIGHT.  CHARGING ENERGY PODS
AND CANNONS ONE AND TWO.

171
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,250
ADJUSTING FIRING ANGLE 3.6
TO PORT.

172
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,333
FIRING NOW.

173
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,875
- UGH, WE MISSED IT

174
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,375
- I ASSURE YOU IT'S THE FAULT
OF THAT MISERABLE CORALIAN.

175
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,208
IT'S NOT AS IF I LOST MY TOUCH.
- I GET IT, KEN-GOH, RELAX.

176
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,750
- HOLD IT!
HOLD IT!  HOLD IT!

177
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,833
IF WE STAY ON THIS COURSE,
WE'LL COLLIDE.

178
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,375
- YOU'RE NOT RAMMING THEM,
ARE YOU?

179
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,250
IF WE ATTACK FROM CLOSE RANGE,
THE CORALIAN'S EFFECT...

180
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,166
- SHOULD BE MINIMIZED.
- Both: AS WE PASS EACH OTHER,

181
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,000
FIRE EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT.

182
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,750
- I CANNOT AGREE
WITH YOUR ACTIONS HERE.

183
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,250
ARE YOU TRYING TO TAKE
US DOWN WITH THEM?

184
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,291
- THE ENEMY IS THINKING
THE SAME THING.

185
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,250
WE GET THEM OR THEY GET US.

186
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,666
DEPLOY ALL MISSILE
LAUNCHERS NOW.

187
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,875
- ALL MISSILES ARMED
AND READY FOR LAUNCH.

188
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,250
- DISTANCE IS 200, 150,

189
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,125
100, 50
- Both: FIRE ALL MISSILES!

190
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,375
- ( panting )

191
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,958
( sighs )

192
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,916
- ( toilet flushes )

193
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,958
- UGH!

194
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,291
- Girl: OCCUPIED.

195
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,333
- Girl #2: IT'S OCCUPIED.

196
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,333
- Boy: THIS ONE'S OCCUPIED.

197
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,333
- Girl #3: CURRENTLY OCCUPIED.

198
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,958
- Girl #4:
OCCUPIED, MEOW.

199
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,458
- OH!

200
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,416
UGH! ( screams )

201
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,958
WHO-- WHO IS THAT?

202
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,250
- RENTON?

203
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,541
- WE JUST LOST
NUMBER TWO RIGHT VRF.

204
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,541
LIFT POWER DOWN BY 25%.

205
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,083
- TALHO, TRY TO MAINTAIN
HORIZONTAL BALANCE.

206
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,666
- THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

207
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,166
- I HAVE A FEELING

208
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,125
THAT SOMEONE WAS
CALLING FOR ME.  HUH?

209
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:49,000
- PERVERT!
- ( screams ) I'M SO SORRY.

210
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,125
- PERVERT!
- ( gasps )

211
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,208
- WE DID IT.

212
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,333
- Anemone: WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?  PERVERT.  SICKO.

213
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,500
- Renton: THAT'S NOT IT.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

214
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,375
- WHO IS IT YOU'RE WITH AND
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  ANEMONE.

215
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,666
- RENTON,

216
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,875
WHERE ARE YOU?

217
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,791
RENTON.

218
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,666
- Holland:
AT THE MOMENT, WE'RE HERE.

219
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,250
AS LONG AS THEY HAVE
NO INTENTION

220
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,791
OF LEAVING THIS AIRSPACE,

221
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,708
WE'LL CIRCLE AROUND AND COME
IN CONTACT WITH THEM AGAIN.

222
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,166
THAT'S WHEN WE'LL TAKE THEM ON.
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU, KEN-GOH.

223
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,625
- RIGHT.
I WON'T MISS AGAIN.

224
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,125
- THAT'S THE--

225
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,750
OW, THAT HURTS, YOU KNOW?

226
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,875
- HEY, DID YOU KNOW THIS?
THERE'S TONS OF HATRED

227
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,541
IN THE WORLD AND THERE ISN'T
EVEN ANY REASON FOR IT.

228
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,333
SINCE IT'S SOMETHING
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND,

229
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,125
THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU COULD
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND IT.

230
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,708
BUT EVEN SO,
IT'S DEFINITELY THERE.

231
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,500
LOOK, THERE'S A BUNCH OF IT
SCATTERED ALL OVER THE PLACE.

232
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:38,250
A HATRED WITHOUT ANY NAME.

233
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,750
I GOTCHA.

234
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,208
NOW HURRY UP
AND CALL FOR ME.

235
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,166
JUST CALL MY NAME.

236
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,083
- CAPTAIN JURGENS, SIR.

237
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,250
- WHAT IS IT?

238
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,416
- I REALIZE
THAT YOU ARE DISSATISFIED

239
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,083
WITH THE WAY IN WHICH I'VE BEEN
COMMANDING THE TROOPS.

240
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,750
I'M SURE THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE
IN LIGHT OF PAST EVENTS.

241
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,708
- YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT
A STUPID THING LIKE THAT?

242
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,750
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
MUCH OF ME, DO YOU?

243
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,750
- HOWEVER, THIS ONCE
TO PROTECT ANEMONE

244
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:09,000
AND ALSO TO PROTECT THE END.
OBEY MY ORDER.

245
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,125
- YOU'RE JOKING?

246
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,250
- IN AN AREA WHERE THE TRAPAR
DENSITY HAS THINNED OUT,

247
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,750
WE'LL BE ABLE
TO RETRIEVE THE END.

248
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,125
- WE CAN'T RIGHT NOW.
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN HIT,

249
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,458
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE GEKKO IS UP TO.

250
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,250
WE CAN'T BE CARELESS.
- ( groans )

251
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,875
- I'M SORRY,

252
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,583
BUT I REALLY
DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

253
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,916
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

254
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,750
I CAME BECAUSE YOU CALLED
TO ME.

255
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,083
- NO, I DIDN'T.

256
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,958
YOU AREN'T THE PERSON
THAT I WAS CALLING FOR.

257
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,791
- OH, SO YOU WEREN'T
CALLING FOR ME.

258
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,666
WELL, FINE THEN.
WHO CARES ABOUT YOU?

259
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,708
- ( gasps )
- YOU CAN DIE!

260
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,166
- ( screaming )

261
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,791
- THERE THEY ARE
- WE'VE SPOTTED THE GEKKO.

262
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,750
- HUH!
SO THEY'RE STILL FLYING, HUH?

263
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,083
WELL, THIS TIME I'LL
PUT AN END TO THIS.

264
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,333
- GOOD, HERE THEY COME.

265
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,333
GOOD, GOOD.

266
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,333
NOW FIRE.

267
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,000
- ( screaming )

268
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,958
- FROM THAT DISTANCE,
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'LL HIT--

269
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,708
WHAT?
- WE GOT 'EM.

270
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,833
- AWESOME!
- GREAT AS ALWAYS, KEN-GOH.

271
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,833
- ( laughs )
IT'S NOTHING

272
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,625
- ( gasps )

273
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:57,083
WAIT, THAT'S MY SISTER.

274
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,833
- RENTON.

275
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,875
- EUREKA.

276
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,833
- LET'S GO BACK TOGETHER.

277
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,208
- YEAH, LET'S GO BACK...

278
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,916
TOGETHER.

279
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,083
- THE TRAPAR IN THIS AIRSPACE
IS STARTING

280
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,333
TO DISAPPEAR RAPIDLY.

281
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,166
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
WITHDRAW NOW!

282
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,375
- HUH?

283
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,708
Renton: TO BE CONTINUED.

284
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,791
- ( theme music playing )

285
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

286
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,541
- TWO BOYS HAVE A CHANCE
ENCOUNTER AT THE PLACE

287
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,416
WHERE THE CORALIAN
DISAPPEARED.

288
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,083
WITHOUT REALIZING
WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE,

289
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:10,125
THEY BOTH FIGHT FOR THE SAKE
OF THE ONE THEY WANT TO PROTECT.

290
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,125
NEXT EPISODE-- "THE BEGINNING."
