1
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,791
- Female Aide:
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

4
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,541
THINKING TOO MUCH
ABOUT THINGS

5
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:52,083
WILL RESULT IN YOU LOSING
YOUR GOOD HEALTH, LADY CODA.

6
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,833
- IF MY HEALTH IS GOING TO FAIL,

7
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,916
I WOULD LIKE ALL OF YOU
TO BE KINDER TO ME.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,208
- ARE YOU GOING TO MEET
WITH COLONEL DEWEY?

9
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,708
- I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND
WHY THE OTHER SAGES,

10
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,833
KUZEMI AND BRAYA, FEAR HIM
WITH SUCH INTENSITY.

11
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,833
AT TIMES, EVEN I
DON'T UNDERSTAND

12
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,500
WHAT IS GOING THROUGH HIS HEAD.

13
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,416
- A SQUADRON LED BY SUCH A MAN--

14
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,166
- YOU MEAN AGEHA?
IT'S SUCH AN IRONIC NAME.

15
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,666
I ADMIT THAT RIGHT NOW,
I'M SIDING WITH DEWEY.

16
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,125
BUT WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MAN
HAVE IN MIND FOR THE FUTURE?

17
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,583
I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE REASON

18
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,416
BEHIND THAT MAN WANTING
TO SEE THE PLANET

19
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,041
CONTROLLED BY SOMETHING SO EVIL
AND OLD AS THE SAGE COUNCIL.

20
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,708
WHAT IS HE ATTEMPTING
TO BRING TO THIS PLANET

21
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,625
AND THE HUMANS LIVING ON IT?

22
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,875
BEINGS WHO ARE TIED DOWN
BY THEIR SINS TO SUCH AN EXTENT,

23
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,916
THEY CAN'T EVEN MOVE
FREELY ANYMORE.

24
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,791
- ( royal music playing )

25
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,666
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
I NEEDED NO ONE TO GREET ME.

26
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,666
- BUT THIS IS
A SPECIAL OCCASION.

27
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,166
THE SAGES ON THE MOVE
HASN'T HAPPENED IN A DECADE.

28
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,666
WE CANNOT TAKE
YOUR VISIT LIGHTLY.

29
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,416
I KNOW THAT YOU MUST BE
TERRIBLY BUSY, LADY CODA.

30
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,583
BUT IF YOU COULD GRANT US
A COUPLE OF KIND WORDS

31
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,958
AT THE COUNCIL MEETING,

32
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,625
WE WOULD ALL BE HONORED
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

33
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:25,166
- ARE YOU ACTUALLY DARING
TO GIVE ME, A SAGE, AN ORDER?

34
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,041
- OF COURSE NOT!

35
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,041
- I HAVE NO TIME.
BRING COLONEL DEWEY

36
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,875
HERE TO ME IMMEDIATELY.

37
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,833
- RIGHT AWAY!

38
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,583
- ( door opens )

39
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,791
- HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN HOLLAND?

40
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,708
- HE WAS ON THE BRIDGE EARLIER.

41
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,208
- IDIOT.

42
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,291
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S
IN ANY CONDITION

43
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,166
TO FREELY MOVE AROUND.

44
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,666
- SHE CHANGED HER HAIRDO.

45
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,833
- PUT STRAIGHT-- SHE GOT DUMPED.

46
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,916
- EVEN HER OUTFIT IS DIFFERENT.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,458
- OH, PUT STRAIGHT--
SHE JUST REALIZED HER REAL AGE.

48
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,375
- ( wrench turning )

49
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,083
- Talho:
AM I SOME STRANGE BEAST?

50
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,708
EVERYWHERE I GO,
PEOPLE LOOK AT ME

51
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,291
LIKE I'M SOME STRANGE CREATURE.

52
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,750
- PEOPLE CAN'T HELP IT,
WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE THAT.

53
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:37,708
- IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE MADE
A DRAMATIC CHANGE OR ANYTHING.

54
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,416
- YOU HAVE CHANGED.

55
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:45,041
- YEAH?  YOU TOO.
- YOU TOO.

56
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,375
SO WHY DID YOU TELL HIM?

57
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,500
IF HE REALIZES
THAT EUREKA IS A CORALIAN--

58
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,750
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

59
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,416
THOSE TWO WILL BE FINE.

60
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,166
- EUREKA, DID YOU MAKE
THE SCRAMBLED EGGS

61
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,500
FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING?

62
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,500
- YEAH.

63
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,458
- THEY WERE DELICIOUS.

64
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:07,166
- THANK YOU, RENTON.

65
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,958
- RIGHT NOW, ALL OF MY NERVES
ARE CONCENTRATED ON MY ARM.

66
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,708
NO, NO, MY ARM
IS MY ENTIRE SELF!

67
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,791
- I REALLY LIKE BEING WITH YOU
THIS WAY, RENTON.

68
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,666
- REALLY?

69
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,125
- WHEN I'M WITH YOU, RENTON,
I CAN ALMOST FORGET

70
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:59,291
THAT THESE HANDS OF MINE
ARE STAINED WITH INNOCENT BLOOD.

71
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,291
- EUREKA...

72
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,333
- ( crying )

73
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,958
- Eureka: ARE YOU HAPPY
WHEN WE'RE LIKE THIS?

74
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,708
- YEAH.
- ME TOO.

75
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,375
THAT'S WHY I CAN FORGET
ABOUT THE PAST

76
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,666
AND THE HORRIBLE THINGS
I DID BACK THEN.

77
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,875
- EUREKA--

78
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,333
- AND NOW I'VE SOILED
YOUR HANDS AS WELL.

79
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:36,916
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,916
- IT IS NOT!

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
IT IS NOT ENOUGH.

82
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,083
NIRVASH IS REALLY ANGRY.

83
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,333
I'VE GOT TO GO.
- WAIT!

84
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,875
- ( shouting )

85
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,375
- Eureka: STOP IT!

86
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,041
NIRVASH DOESN'T LIKE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

87
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,041
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE WAY HE WAS BEFORE.

88
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,541
- YOU REALIZE THAT OUR OBJECTIVE
THIS TIME IS RESTORATION, RIGHT?

89
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,041
- EUREKA.

90
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:49,041
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

91
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,041
- Eureka:
HE DOESN'T LIKE IT.

92
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:57,208
HE WANTS YOU TO ACCEPT HIM
FOR WHAT HE IS RIGHT NOW.

93
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,041
- AND SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY RECONSIDER

94
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,916
THE FUNDAMENTAL SHELL DESIGN.

95
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,875
- YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT?

96
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:10,916
- WE'D HAVE TO ASK GREG EGAN
TO HELP US OUT ON THIS ONE.

97
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,416
- DR. BEAR!

98
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,083
- All: HUH?

99
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,666
- WHO'S THAT?

100
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,791
- THE PREEMINENT MAN
IN THE RESEARCH OF ARCHETYPES?

101
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,083
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM?!

102
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,583
- SORRY, BUT I'VE
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

103
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,583
- GREG EGAN, WHOSE NICKNAME
IS DR. BEAR,

104
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,791
NEVER STEPS OUTSIDE OF HIS LAB
AND ONLY RESEARCHES THINGS

105
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,458
THAT SPARK HIS INTEREST.

106
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,416
HOWEVER, EVERY PAPER
THAT HE PUBLISHES

107
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,458
IS ALWAYS TOP-NOTCH,
OR RATHER HE GOES FAR BEYOND

108
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,416
CURRENT THINKING, AND NOT MANY
PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND HIM.

109
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,833
- IN OTHER WORDS, A LOONEY.

110
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,625
- Jobs:
W-WHAT WAS THAT?!

111
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,791
YOU'LL GET CURSED
FOR SAYING THAT.

112
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,375
- THERE'S A-- THERE'S
SOME BIG GUY I DON'T KNOW

113
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,541
SITTING OVER THERE
DRINKING TEA WITH GONZY.

114
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,333
- ( gasps )

115
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,166
- Mischa: IT'S GREG!

116
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,000
- DR. EGAN!

117
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,750
I'M SO HONORED TO MEET YOU,

118
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,625
I'VE READ EVERY PAPER
THAT YOU'VE PUBLISHED, SIR.

119
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,791
- HERE.

120
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,791
- MY LITTLE CUB!

121
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,041
GIVE ME A HUG.

122
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,666
- YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED, HAVE YOU?

123
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,541
WE DIVORCED A LONG TIME AGO.

124
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,791
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

125
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,833
- WHAT?!
- MISCHA, YOU WERE--

126
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,833
- YOU AND HE WERE MARRIED?

127
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,166
- ( camera snaps )

128
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,875
- YOU'RE STILL
AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER.

129
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:43,958
BUT YOU--

130
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,666
YOU HAVE CHANGED
QUITE A BIT, YOUNG LADY.

131
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,458
WHY DON'T YOU
COME OVER TO MY LAB

132
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,750
AND WE'LL GET STARTED, HM?

133
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,333
- Eureka: BE CAREFUL.

134
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,416
- HUH?

135
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,458
- RIGHT.

136
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:04,041
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

137
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,291
- Holland:
COME ON, LET'S GO.

138
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,916
- Dr. Egan:
YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,458
IT'S THE FIRST MESSAGE
SENT INTO OUTER SPACE

140
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,958
BY THE PEOPLE
OF OUR ANCESTOR PLANET, EARTH.

141
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,250
IT'S A REPLICA OF WHAT WAS
ABOARD WHAT THEY CALL VOYAGER.

142
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,875
IT'S SO PRIMAL.
BUT AT THE TIME,

143
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,791
IT WAS STATE-OF-THE-ART
TECHNOLOGY.

144
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,625
- YEAH, WELL WE DIDN'T COME HERE
TO GET A LECTURE ON HISTORY.

145
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,125
- WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
MAYBE EUREKA IS A VOYAGER.

146
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,375
- WHAT?

147
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,541
- PERHAPS SHE IS
SOME SORT OF A MESSAGE

148
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,416
FROM THE SCUB CORAL.

149
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,416
- THAT THEORY ABOUT
THE INTELLIGENCE

150
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,666
OF SCUB CORAL, AGAIN?
LOOK, GREG--

151
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,500
I'VE SAID THIS
MANY TIMES BEFORE,

152
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,250
FOR IT TO BE
AN INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORM

153
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,333
IS JUST TOO
LOGICALLY INCONSISTENT.

154
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:07,750
- LET'S LEAVE THAT ASIDE,
WE'LL JUST END UP ARGUING.

155
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,583
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ALL THIS?

156
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,833
- NOT A THING.

157
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:15,208
- THAT'S RIGHT, YOU WERE
PROBABLY SENT OUT HERE

158
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,583
NOT KNOWING ANYTHING AT ALL
ABOUT YOUR PAST.

159
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,791
NO, THE FACT
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW,

160
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,375
ITSELF IS THE MESSAGE.

161
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,416
THAT THEY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT US,

162
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,375
THAT THEY KNOW NOTHING.

163
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,625
- SO THE MESSAGE
IS A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER?

164
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:31,541
- THAT'S RIGHT, AND WE'RE FREE
TO WRITE WHATEVER WE WANT ON IT.

165
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,583
WHAT DID YOU WRITE ABOUT?

166
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,833
TRUE LOVE?  UGLY HATRED?

167
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,375
THE QUESTION IS, CAN
SO MANY INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORMS

168
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,333
EXIST ON A SINGLE PLANET?
OF COURSE, I'M REFERRING

169
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,916
TO HUMANS AND THE SCUB CORAL.

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,333
- SO WHAT COULD HAPPEN?

171
00:11:55,416 --> 00:12:00,333
- THE WORLD COULD BE
COMPLETELY ERADICATED.

172
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,833
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS.

173
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,625
THERE IS JUST
FAR TOO LITTLE DATA HERE.

174
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,333
IF ONLY I COULD
ACCESS THE SERVER

175
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,833
AT THE INFORMATION DEPARTMENT,

176
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,875
I WOULD BE ABLE
TO LEARN A LITTLE MORE.

177
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,166
- YOU CALLED US OVER HERE,
AND <i>THAT'S</i> YOUR REPORT?

178
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,166
- WELL, YEAH.
BUT I THINK WE NEED

179
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,791
TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE INTEREST
IN THE CHANGES HAPPENING

180
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,833
TO THE ARCHETYPE
AND TO THE GIRL.

181
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,333
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD
TAKE THIS AS SCUB CORAL

182
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,750
TRYING TO SEND US A MESSAGE.
- HUH?

183
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,000
- IN OTHER WORDS,
THE CURRENT RESTORATION PROJECT

184
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,208
IS NO GOOD.

185
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,875
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?
WELL THEN--

186
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,000
THE SHAPE THAT IS
MOST BEFITTING

187
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,166
THE CURRENT MEASUREMENT DATA

188
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,916
SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,750
I SUPPOSE YOU
COULD CALL IT

190
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,250
A SORT OF HIGH-SPEED
FLIGHT CONFIGURATION.

191
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,791
IT SEEMS TO ME
THE ARCHETYPE WANTS TO FLY.

192
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:03,041
THE ARCHETYPE WANTS TO FLY...

193
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,583
...AND SO DO YOU.

194
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,125
- Lady Coda:
WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE

195
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,000
- THE AGEHA SQUAD.

196
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,875
- AH, THE AGEHA SQUAD.

197
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,000
THEY ARE ALL
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, COLONEL.

198
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,875
THIS LOCATION IS UNSUITABLE
FOR OUR TALK.

199
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,708
SOMEONE IS SURE TO LISTEN.

200
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,458
- DON'T WORRY, LADY.

201
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,083
- ( whistling )

202
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,000
- ( screaming )

203
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,583
- Dewey: I BELIEVE
THAT WAS SOMEONE

204
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,250
THAT BRAYA HAD CONTROL OF.

205
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,916
- YOU ASSERT THAT THE JAMMING
SIGNALS ARE IN ORDER?

206
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,166
INGENIOUS TECHNIQUE,
AND COLD-HEARTED ENOUGH

207
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,875
TO KILL SOMEONE WITHOUT
ANY CHANGES IN EMOTION.

208
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,708
YOU BREED BUTTERFLIES OF POISON.

209
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,375
THERE IS NO OTHER REASON
WHY I'VE CHOSEN

210
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,916
TO COME DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,458
THE SITUATION CALLS FOR SPEED.

212
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,458
BEAR CHILDREN, MULTIPLY,
FILL THE LAND,

213
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,833
THIS WORLD HAS BEEN POPULATED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE WORDS.

214
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,958
NOW THAT THE LAND ITSELF IS
BEGINNING TO REVOLT AGAINST US,

215
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,708
RETURNING TO OUR SPACESHIPS
IS NO LONGER AN OPTION.

216
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,333
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO
WITH THE SITUATION?

217
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,791
- WHAT TO DO?
TOTAL ANNIHILATION

218
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,625
IS THE ONLY WAY LEFT
FOR US TO TRULY SURVIVE.

219
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,000
WE MUST DESTROY THE CORALIAN.

220
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,416
THE KUTE-CLASS
IS NOTHING BUT A GATE.

221
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,958
SOON, I'M SURE, WE WILL SEE

222
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,375
BEINGS CALLED ANTIBODIES
APPEARING HERE.

223
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,250
AND THE ANNIHILATION
OF HUMANS WILL BEGIN.

224
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,416
WE NEED TO CRUSH THEM FIRST.

225
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,625
IF WE DON'T, HUMANS WILL NOT
BE ABLE TO SURVIVE LONG.

226
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,375
THIS IS A WAR, THAT PUTS
AT STAKE TOTAL CONTROL

227
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,000
OF THE ENTIRE PLANET!

228
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,958
- THOSE WHO HAVE NO POWER, CAN
NEVER ASSERT CONTROL, COLONEL.

229
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,333
- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I AM POWERLESS?

230
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,625
ARE YOU SAYING I AM POWERLESS?

231
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,333
- Renton: HE LOOKS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

232
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,666
FROM HOW HE WAS BEFORE.

233
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,375
- Eureka: YES, BUT NIRVASH
IS STILL NIRVASH.

234
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,250
- THE COCKPIT IS BEING
REDESIGNED AROUND

235
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,416
A COMPLETELY NEW CONCEPT, RIGHT?

236
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,291
- NIRVASH IS VERY HAPPY
ABOUT IT.

237
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:58,458
- Renton: I SEE.

238
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,416
MR. MORITA!

239
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,666
- YES, WHAT IS IT?

240
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,625
- THERE'S NO REF BOARD.

241
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,666
- I KNOW THAT, IT'S UNFORTUNATE
BUT WE WERE UNABLE TO DESIGN

242
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,208
AND MAKE ONE IN THE TIME WE HAD.

243
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,875
- HUH?
- BUT DON'T WORRY.

244
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,708
I'VE ALREADY ASKED
AN INGENIOUS MECHANIC

245
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,291
TO WORK ON IT, EVEN THOUGH
HE'S AS GOOD AS RETIRED.

246
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,458
HE'S A MEAN, OLD MAN.

247
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,875
YOU KNOW WHO, RIGHT?

248
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,541
- GRAMPS!

249
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,666
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT DEWEY
IS DOING RIGHT ABOUT NOW?

250
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,416
HE'S SEEING THAT MEAN,
OLD LADY NAMED CODA.

251
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,250
I CAN TELL
THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW.

252
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,958
♪ NO ONE KNOWS NOTHING
KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ME ♪

253
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,791

JUST WATCHING A LIE. ♪

YOU'D BE STUCK

257
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,041
BABYSITTING ALL OF THOSE KIDS.

258
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,000
- WHAT A GROUP THIS IS.

259
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,750
WHAT IS THE COLONEL
PLANNING ON DOING NOW?

260
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,583
- DID YOU SAY, "WHAT A GROUP?"

261
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,750
WHAT?! DID YOU GET
KICKED OUT OF THE BRIDGE, TOO?

262
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,500
ARE YOU STUPID OR SOMETHING?

CHANGE FOR THE REDESIGN

- Ageha Member #3:
YEAH, GOOD IDEA.

268
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,916
THEY'RE NOT TOTALLY UP
ON HOW WE'RE USING IT,

269
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,291
SO WE'LL HAVE
TO CHECK EVERYTHING OUT.

COMMUNICATION
FROM HEADQUARTERS--

LESS THAN 0.5!

285

- Ageha Member #3:
THAT'S JUST AMAZING.

286
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,041
- CONFIRM SEVERANCE
OF THE STREAM.

- HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

288

- IT'S COMING.

289

- THE WEAK CORAL SIGNALS
ARE CONFIRMED.

290
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,333
- ITS LOCATION?

291

- IT CAN'T BE DETERMINED YET.

292
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,791
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEIR LOSSES WERE?

293
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,541
- SEVERAL THOUSAND, I THINK.

294
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,791
I JUST HOPE THAT THIS FITS
INTO OUR PROJECTED RANGE.

295

- PLEASE, ANEMONE.
CALM DOWN, ALRIGHT?

- EUREKA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

298
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,625
EUREKA, TALK TO ME!

299

- SIR, A KUTE-CLASS CORALIAN
HAS BEEN CONFIRMED.

- WHERE'S IT LOCATED?  HOW FAR?

DISTANCE 720 KILOMETERS.

IT'S FERES CITY!

- I DON'T KNOW.

- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
GET OVER TO FERES?

- ANOTHER SQUADRON HAS
ALREADY BEEN CALLED OUT.

BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU
TO MAKE A GOOD SHOWING AS WELL.

00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,041
IT'S ALL HAPPENING
AS I EXPECTED.

314
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,708
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S FERES.

315
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,958
- 200 KILOMETERS NORTH
OF WHERE WE EXPECTED.

316
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,333
- WE'LL HAVE TO CHANGE
THE PARAMETERS

317
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,583
AND RECALCULATE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

318
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,625
- Dewey:
THAT'S ALL.

319
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,541
- COLONEL!
- WHAT IS IT?

320
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,916
- ANEMONE'S CONDITION
IS NOT VERY GOOD, SIR.

321
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,166
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

322
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,458
THERE SHOULD BE
SUFFICIENT MEDICATION THERE.

323
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,875
- SIR!

324
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,250
- I'M TRUSTING YOU WITH
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER, DOMINIC.

325
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,750
BE SURE YOU DON'T LET ME DOWN.

326
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,083
- UNDERSTOOD, SIR.

327
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,583
- Eureka: EVERYONE,
EVERYTHING--THEY'RE CRYING.

328
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,666
- SO HAS IT BEGUN?
IS THIS THE AWAKENING?

329
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,625
- I DON'T KNOW,
THERE'S TOO LITTLE DATA.

330
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,458
WE HAVE TO GET THE SPECS
UP ON THE NIRVASH PRETTY FAST.

331
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,750
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

332
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,541
- IF THE TRUE AWAKENING
IS APPROACHING,

333
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,166
GETTING THE SPECS
UP ON THE NIRVASH HAS PRIORITY.

334
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,916
LET'S HEAD TO BELLFOREST.

335
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,791
WE'RE GETTING THE BOARD.

336
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,000
- Gidget:
BUT HOLLAND, THERE ARE PEOPLE

337
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,833
ASKING FOR HELP
OVER THERE, RIGHT?

338
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,791
- Talho: DON'T TALK LIKE
YOU KNOW ANYTHING.

339
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,375
THERE ARE THINGS
THAT WE CAN DO,

340
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,000
AND THINGS
THAT WE CAN'T, GIDGET.

341
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,208
THERE ARE TIMES WE'RE FORCED

342
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,666
TO MAKE DECISIONS
WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE.

343
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,041
- HOLLAND, WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING TO DO

344
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,791
ABOUT THE RESTORATION
OF THE NIRVASH?

345
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,166
- I'LL HAVE YOU FINISH IT
ABOARD THE GEKKO.

346
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,625
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

347
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,750
- HURRY UP, WE'RE DEPARTING NOW!

348
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,791
- Eureka and Renton:
TO BE CONTINUED.

349
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,833
- ( theme music playing )

350
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

351
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,458
- Talho: THE BOY AND
THE GIRL REACH FOR THE SKY,

352
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,375
WITH BELIEFS IN THEIR HEARTS.

353
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,166
THE NIRVASH, ACCEPTING
DEAR EMOTIONS,

354
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,958
EMITS TRUE RADIANCE
IN THE FAR REACHES OF THE SKIES.

355
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,250
NEXT EPISODE, "START IT UP."
