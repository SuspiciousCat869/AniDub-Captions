1
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,916
- Eureka: I HAVE PEOPLE
THAT ARE DEAR TO ME.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,583
LINCK, MAETER,

3
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:18,750
MAURICE,

4
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,583
AND RENTON.

5
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,875
I LIKE THEM A LOT.

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,791
I LOVE THEM.

7
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,250
PEOPLE DEAR TO ME,

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,166
MY FAMILY.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,458
THEY TAUGHT ME
ALL SORTS OF THINGS

10
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,250
WHEN I REALLY DIDN'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

11
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,791
THEY ACCEPTED
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME

12
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,833
BEFORE EVEN I DID.

13
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,291
THEY LET ME BE
WHO I AM.

14
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,375
I WANT TO BE WITH
THOSE THAT I LOVE,

15
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,416
THAT I WANT TO PROTECT.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,583
I WANT TO BE WITH LINCK.

17
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,625
I WANT TO BE WITH MAETER.

18
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,583
I WANT TO BE WITH MAURICE.

19
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,958
AND OF COURSE,
WITH RENTON.

20
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,291
BUT IF WISHING SO

21
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,958
CAUSES THOSE THAT ARE
DEAR TO ME TO BE LOST,

22
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:01,291
IF WISHING SO MAKES THE PLANET
WHERE THEY ALL LIVE DISAPPEAR,

23
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,291
I WILL STOP WISHING.

24
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,791
BUT IF IT CAN BE ALLOWED,

25
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,291
I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE THEM ONE MORE TIME.

26
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,625
I WANT TO SEE YOU.

27
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,000
I WANT TO SEE YOU,
RENTON.

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,500
- HERE YOU ARE.
- HMM?

29
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,083
- YOU THINK IT'S GOOD
FOR THE LEADER TO BE

30
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,333
SITTING AROUND,
WASTING TIME LIKE THIS?

31
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,666
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

32
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,333
A PILOT WITHOUT HIS L.F.O.

33
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,625
IS KIND OF LIKE
A FISH OUT OF WATER.

34
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,666
- I SEE.

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,500
- I APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING

36
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,666
THE SUPER IZUMO'S
FUEL LIKE THIS.

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,083
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

38
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,333
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
THINGS THE BEST I CAN.

39
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,625
I'M A MILITARY MAN.
- THANKS.

40
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,041
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO YOUR HAND?

41
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,208
- HMM?
OH, THIS?

42
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,208
DEWEY'S KIDS GOT AT ME.

43
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,041
- THE COLONEL TOLD US
THAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE

44
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,708
AND BECOME THE FOUNDATION
FOR THE ORDER OF THE NEW WORLD.

45
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,041
HE WASN'T LIKE
ANY OF YOU GUYS.

46
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,916
THE COLONEL WAS
REALLY NICE TO US.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,916
EVEN THOUGH ALL OF US
HAVE SUCH FILTHY BODIES,

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,041
THE COLONEL SAID
WE WERE ALL BEAUTIFUL!

49
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,875
- THOSE CHILDREN WERE
PICKED UP AT RANDOM

50
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,708
FROM THE REFUGEE CAMP
IN WARSAW.

51
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,541
- THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT
CAME OUT OF ETHNIC CLEANSING

52
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,125
ALMOST DON'T SEEM REAL.

53
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,916
- HUMANS ARE SUCH THAT IF THEY
DON'T SEE SOMETHING ON THE NEWS,

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,708
THEN THEIR MINDS AT LEAST
HAD NEVER REALLY EXISTED.

55
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,750
- SO I'VE NOTICED.

56
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,416
- HE WAS BORN INTO
THE WORLD CURSING IT.

57
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,625
- HUH?

58
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,625
- THE ONE WHO SAVED
THOSE UNWANTED CHILDREN

59
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,416
FROM DESPERATION
WAS A MAN WHO, LIKE THEM,

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,416
CURSED THE WORLD
AROUND HIM.

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,791
- I WONDER...

62
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,750
WHY DID MY BROTHER GO SO FAR
AS TO CURSE THE WORLD?

63
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,041
- WHO KNOWS?

64
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,416
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY ASK
A THERAPIST ABOUT THAT.

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,750
- ( chuckles )
TRUE ENOUGH.

66
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,291
- I'M THINKING ABOUT
ADOPTING THOSE CHILDREN.

67
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,750
- HUH?

68
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,083
- ATONEMENT FOR THOSE
WHO CREATED THIS WORLD,

69
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,541
AND THE ONES WHO
DESERVE TO BE CURSED.

70
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,541
- HMM.

71
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,916
ATONEMENT, HUH?

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,583
WELL, GOOD OLD DEWEY SURE
LEFT A LOT TO ATONE FOR.

73
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,250
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

74
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,458
- A LOT MORE THAN I THINK
ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL CAN HANDLE.

75
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,916
- GUESS I'LL HAVE TO
CARRY IT ON MY SHOULDERS.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,791
- HMM?
- I'LL CARRY THE WEIGHT.

77
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,500
EVEN IF I HAVE TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE DOING IT.

78
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,500
- HOLLAND!

79
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,125
YOU'VE GOT SOME GUESTS.

80
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,125
- THE COLORS ON EUREKA
AND ANEMONE

81
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,000
WERE IN SOME UNKNOWN WAY
FULLY LINKED

82
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,625
TO THE CARDIO PULMONARY
FUNCTIONS OF COLONEL DEWEY.

83
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,750
- I'M AFRAID THAT IT'S
A CLEVER ADAPTATION

84
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,000
OF THE C.F.S. SYSTEM.

85
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,791
A SYSTEM THAT REVERSE TRANSFERS
TRAPAR WAVES.

86
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,791
HE SET THE WHOLE THING UP
SO THAT HIS OWN DEATH

87
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,875
WOULD FUNCTION
AS THE TRIGGER.

88
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,750
- THE COLONEL WISHED THAT
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS

89
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,625
NOT BE REACHED AFTER HIS PLAN
TO BREAK THROUGH THE ZONE

90
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,791
AND DESTROY THE CONTROL CLUSTER
WAS FULFILLED.

91
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,375
- EVEN IF THE PEOPLE PANICKED
AND THERE WAS A BRIEF MOMENT

92
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,583
WHERE THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
SEEM TO HAVE NO MEANING,

93
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,875
EVERYTHING WOULD CALM DOWN
RELATIVELY QUICKLY.

94
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,166
- BECAUSE THE SCUB CORALS
ALL WANT TO SURVIVE AS WELL.

95
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,833
- AND SO THE COLONEL
SET IN MOTION

96
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,166
A COMPLEX PLAN TO SET UP
EUREKA ABOARD THE NIRVASH,

97
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,875
OR MYSELF ABOARD THE END

98
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,208
AS A SUBSTITUTE
CONTROL CLUSTER.

99
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,458
- HE THEN PLUGGED IN AN
AUTOMATIC SELF-DESTRUCTION

100
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,666
PROTOCOL WHICH WAS
PROGRAMMED INTO THE COLLARS

101
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,708
THAT THE TWO OF THEM
WORE ALL THE TIME.

102
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,458
- SO IT TURNS OUT ALL OF US

103
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,000
WERE WRAPPED AROUND
HIS LITTLE FINGER

104
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,125
FROM THE BEGINNING.

105
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,000
- DAMN.
WHAT A BASTARD.

106
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,333
- WAIT A MINUTE.

107
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,500
THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY
DESPITE EVERYTHING

108
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,041
WE STILL HAVEN'T REACHED
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS.

109
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,666
- I THINK IT'S
THANKS TO EUREKA.

110
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,833
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

111
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,875
- I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
EUREKA IS REFUSING

112
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,916
TO BE THE SUBSTITUTE
CONTROL CLUSTER.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,666
AND SO...

114
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,583
- THAT MUST BE WHAT'S BEHIND
THE GLIMMER OF THIS COMPAC.

115
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,083
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

116
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,875
THE INTERVAL BETWEEN
ITS GLIMMERS,

117
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,416
AND THE INTERVAL
BETWEEN THE SIGNS

118
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,958
FROM THE SPHERE LOCATED
ABOVE THE TENSION MOUNTAINS

119
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,541
ARE AN EXACT MATCH.

120
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,375
- IN OTHER WORDS,
EUREKA IS...

121
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,500
- MM.

122
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,083
STILL ALIVE.

123
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,333
- ( door opens )
- Kids: HUH?

124
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,875
- TALHO.

125
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,875
- Kids: TALHO!

126
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,583
- WELCOME BACK, KIDS.

127
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,083
YOU ALL DID GREAT.

128
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,250
YOUR MAMA WOULD BE
SO PROUD.

129
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,541
OH.

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,291
- ( door opens )

131
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,291
- HEY, HOLLAND?

132
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,333
- STAND UP.

133
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,000
I JUST TOLD YOU
TO STAND UP!

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,250
- HOLLAND,

135
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,250
I COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO STOP IT.

136
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,833
I TRIED, BUT THERE WAS
NOTHING THAT I COULD DO!

137
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,041
( grunts )

138
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,916
- HOLLAND, HASN'T HE
GONE THROUGH ENOUGH?

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,750
- PLEASE, PUNCH ME.

140
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,916
PLEASE, PUNCH ME.

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,250
I COULDN'T SAVE MY FATHER.

142
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,916
I COULDN'T SAVE MY SISTER.

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,625
AND I COULDN'T PROTECT
EUREKA WHEN IT MATTERED.

144
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,166
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
JUST A BRAT

145
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,958
WHO COULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING RIGHT.

146
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,791
I'M JUST THE VERY
WORST KIND OF LOSER.

147
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,750
ONE THAT TALKS BIG
BUT CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

148
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,791
- ARE YOU THROUGH?
- HUH?

149
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,625
- THEN GET YOURSELF
READY TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

150
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,916
WE'RE GOING.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"WE'RE GOING"?

152
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,791
WHERE?

153
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,166
- THAT SHOULD BE
FAIRLY OBVIOUS.

154
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,833
TO WHERE EUREKA IS.
- ( gasps )

155
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,125
- ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE ONLY ONE OBJECTIVE NOW.

156
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,375
TO CONTACT EUREKA WHO HAS
BECOME THE CONTROL CLUSTER,

157
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,458
AND CONDUCT AN ARBITRATION
BETWEEN HUMANS AND SCUB CORALS

158
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,125
ONE MORE TIME.

159
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,833
HOWEVER,
THERE IS A PROBLEM.

160
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,000
THE SIGNALS COMING FROM
EUREKA'S LOCATION

161
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,333
ARE GRADUALLY WEAKENING
AS TIME GOES ON.

162
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,208
YOU HAVE TO KEEP
CALLING OUT TO EUREKA

163
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,833
SO THAT SHE CAN STAY CONSCIOUS
UNTIL WE CAN GET THERE.

164
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,291
IT'S SOMETHING THAT
ONLY YOU CAN DO.

165
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,708
ARE WE READY?

166
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,000
- EVERYTHING IS READY
ON THIS END.

167
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,541
WE CAN LAUNCH ANYTIME.

168
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,541
WOW, RENTON.

169
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,666
YOU'VE TURNED OUT TO BE
AN ATTRACTIVE GUY.

170
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,208
- YEAH.

171
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,500
- Holland: GOT IT?

172
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,500
THIS COMPAC DRIVE
IS USING A SPECIAL SYSTEM

173
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,291
TO DISPLAY ALL
THE TRAPAR INTERFERENCE

174
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,333
CAUGHT ON THE GEKKO'S
TRAPAR RADARS.

175
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,291
LOOK HERE.
USING THIS SYSTEM,

176
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,208
WE'RE GOING TO ATTEMPT TO START
COMMUNICATING FROM OUR END.

177
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,000
I BELIEVE THAT IF
SHE REPLIES TO ANYONE,

178
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,541
IT'LL BE YOU GUYS,
EUREKA'S FAMILY,

179
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,875
AND NOBODY ELSE.

180
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,250
- HOLLAND,
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS

181
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,666
WHEN WE FINALLY
REACH THE PLACE

182
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,916
AND FIND EUREKA,

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,708
WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO THEN?

184
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,458
- UHH-- SORRY, BUT I REALLY
DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA.

185
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,375
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
- HUH?

186
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,958
- NEVER BEG.

187
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,375
AND EARN BY WINNING.

188
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,000
OR ELSE YOU WON'T
GET ANYTHING.

189
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

190
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,375
ISN'T IT, HOLLAND?

191
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,000
- UH-- HMM.

192
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,041
I DON'T THINK THOSE WORDS
WERE AIMED AT ME.

193
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,708
- HUH?
- I'M SURE IT WAS A GIFT TO YOU.

194
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,125
IT JUST HAPPENED TO
COME THROUGH ME.

195
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,791
FROM ADROC THURSTON
TO RENTON THURSTON.

196
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,083
- RIGHT.

197
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,041
- I'M JEALOUS OF EUREKA.

198
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,083
SHE HAS SO MANY PEOPLE THAT
WOULD RISK THEIR LIVES FOR HER.

199
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,333
- DON'T BE UNGRATEFUL.
YOU HAVE SOMEONE THERE FOR YOU.

200
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,291
A MAN NAMED DOMINIC.

201
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,750
- ( gasps )

202
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,083
CAPTAIN!

203
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,416
- ( giggles )

204
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,541
YOU'RE RIGHT.

205
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,625
- HUH?

206
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,416
- I DO HAVE
DOMINIC AT MY SIDE.

207
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,833
- SOMEONE WHO'S
MUCH MORE HANDSOME

208
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,416
THAN EUREKA'S BOYFRIEND.

209
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,083
- HMM.

210
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,166
WELL, I SUPPOSE THIS TIME

211
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,458
I'LL HAVE TO LET
RENTON THURSTON

212
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,125
PLAY THE ROLE
OF THE HERO.

213
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,125
- APPROACHING TARGET.

214
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,791
THERE ARE ONLY 250 METERS
IN THE SMALLEST GAP.

215
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,541
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
DOGGIE, TAKE US UP!

216
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,791
- Moondoggie:
ROGER THAT!

217
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,750
- RETURNING THE GEKKO TO
STANDARD PARALLEL FLIGHT.

218
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,041
- CHECKING WHICH TRAJECTORY
FLIGHTS ARE POSSIBLE.

219
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,625
IF WE USE CORRIDOR 999,

220
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,500
WE CAN REACH IT
IN FOUR HOURS.

221
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,041
IT'S SIX HOURS TO
THE BIAS POINT.

222
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,250
- IT'LL TAKE SIX HOURS?
THAT'S REALLY PUSHING IT.

223
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,041
- I JUST HOPE THAT SHE CAN
KEEP IT UP FOR THAT LONG.

224
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,375
- NOT GOOD.

225
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,000
CONFIRMED ANTIBODY CORALIANS.

226
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,333
THEY'RE AT OH-100
AND OH-140.

227
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,708
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF CORRIDOR 999.

228
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,958
- BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?

229
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,000
IMPOSSIBLE.

230
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,375
IT'S OUR SHORTEST ROUTE.

231
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,125
- WE'VE GOT TO
GO THROUGH ANYWAY.

232
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,541
- YOU DON'T THINK
I KNOW THAT?

233
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,666
EVERYONE,
RIG THE SHIP FOR COMBAT.

234
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,541
AFTER FIRING THE MAIN CANNONS
AND THE A.A.M'S,

235
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,291
WE'LL USE OUR BOOSTERS
TO BREAK RIGHT THROUGH

236
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:08,916
THE MIDDLE OF THEM.

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,833
- All: ROGER THAT!

238
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,916
- DIRECT HIT ON
THE STARBOARD REAR.

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,666
- REAR BOOSTER PRESSURE
IS FALLING.

240
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,541
NO GOOD. WE WON'T MAKE ESCAPE
VELOCITY IF THIS KEEPS UP.

241
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,833
- ( groans )

242
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,375
- I'LL FIGHT THEM WITH YOU.
- ( gasps )

243
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,875
- DON'T WORRY, RENTON.

244
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,875
YOU JUST LEAVE
ALL THE FIGHTING TO US.

245
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,041
- BUT HOLLAND--

246
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,375
- THE ONLY THING
YOU NEED TO DO NOW

247
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,166
IS TO KEEP YOUR MIND
ON EUREKA.

248
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,375
YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST US.
OKAY?

249
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,083
- ALL RIGHT, HOLLAND.

250
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,541
- Kids: MAMA!

251
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,250
MAMA!  ANSWER US.

252
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,625
MAMA!  MAMA, PLEASE.
WE'RE SCARED.

253
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,458
- Maeter:
IT'S NO GOOD.

254
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,750
SHE WON'T ANSWER US
NO MATTER WHAT.

255
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,125
- DON'T WORRY, MAETER.

256
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,250
I'M POSITIVE
MAMA'S LISTENING TO US.

257
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,083
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

258
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,708
- MAURICE.
- HUH?

259
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,208
- I WANT YOU TO HOLD
ONTO THIS FOR AWHILE.

260
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,208
IT'S SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO ME.

261
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,666
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

262
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,666
- I'M GONNA GO DOWN
AND WORK ON THE NIRVASH.

263
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,750
- HUH?

264
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,583
- MAYBE IF I USE
NIRVASH'S AMITA DRIVE

265
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,250
I CAN MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

266
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,125
MAYBE IT WILL START TO MOVE.

267
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,791
AND IF SO...

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,583
ALL RIGHT, MAURICE,
LISTEN UP.

269
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,458
YOU'RE THE BIG BROTHER
IN THIS FAMILY.

270
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,916
SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF MAETER AND LINCK.

271
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,541
- MM.
- GOOD.

272
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,750
THEN I'LL HEAD OUT.

273
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,916
- Maurice: OH, WAIT.
- HUH?

274
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,333
- RENTON, TAKE THIS.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

275
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,333
A GOOD LUCK CHARM.

276
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,500
- HEY, WAIT.
ISN'T THIS EUREKA'S?

277
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,458
- YOU'RE GOING, RIGHT?

278
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,291
BECAUSE THE NIRVASH WON'T
MOVE WITHOUT OUR MAMA.

279
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,958
- ( sighs )

280
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,291
THAT'S RIGHT.

281
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,708
ZERO AMMO LEFT
IN THE A.A.M.

282
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,500
- THAT MEANS ALL WE HAVE LEFT
ARE THE HOMING LASERS.

283
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,041
DOGGIE, MAKE THE HIGH SPEED
EVASION EVEN FASTER!

284
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,625
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HALF OUR ENGINES ARE DEAD.

285
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,500
- Holland:
DON'T GIVE UP!

286
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,125
IF WE LET OURSELVES
GET DISCOURAGED, IT'S OVER.

287
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,625
THE ANSWER'S OUT THERE.

288
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,708
THERE'S AN ANSWER
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE!

289
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,625
- Renton: NIRVASH,

290
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,083
LISTEN TO ME.

291
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,000
YOU AND I,
WE'VE BEEN TRAVELING TOGETHER.

292
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,000
EVER SINCE YOU FELL DOWN
ONTO MY HOUSE.

293
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,166
WE'VE MET ALL
SORTS OF PEOPLE,

294
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,875
AND THEN PARTED
WITH THEM.

295
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,666
THEY'RE ALL VERY SPECIAL
MEMORIES TO ME.

296
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,333
BUT THROUGH ALL THIS JOURNEY,

297
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,000
EUREKA HAS ALWAYS
BEEN AT MY SIDE.

298
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,000
WE'VE BEEN TRAVELING TOGETHER
ALL THIS TIME,

299
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,666
AND I WOULDN'T TRADE
A SINGLE MINUTE OF IT.

300
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,333
OH, PLEASE, NIRVASH!

301
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,666
I DON'T WANT EVERYTHING
TO END LIKE THIS!

302
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,333
I REALLY NEED EUREKA
AT MY SIDE!

303
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,041
- ( shouting )

304
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,291
- A DIRECT HIT?

305
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,833
- NO, THIS EXPLOSION
CAME FROM INSIDE.

306
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,666
FROM INSIDE!
- NO WAY.

307
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,708
- HOLLAND, TALHO,

308
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,208
I'VE GOT AN UNKNOWN TRAPAR
SIGNAL FROM THE UPPER DECK.

309
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,166
- WHAT?!

310
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,416
- Kids: WHOA.

311
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,500
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

312
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,916
- IT'S THE NIRVASH.

313
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,375
- BUT HOW DID IT
GET THAT WAY?

314
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,041
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

315
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,458
- Maurice: IT'S RENTON.
- HUH?

316
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,333
- HE'S THE ONE
MAKING IT ALL HAPPEN.

317
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,500
WE KNOW IT FOR SURE.

318
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,583
RENTON AND NIRVASH
ARE GONNA SAVE MAMA.

319
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,000
IT'S RENTON.

320
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,416
- WE GOT A CONNECTION.

321
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,250
RENTON, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

322
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,750
- THE AMITA DRIVE
IS RESPONDING TO ME.

323
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,500
- WHAT?!
- I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW

324
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,458
WHAT'S GOING ON,
BUT IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

325
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,750
I CAN MAKE IT.
- YOU MEAN BY YOURSELF?

326
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,541
- NIRVASH FINALLY ANSWERED
YOUR CALLS, DIDN'T HE?

327
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,958
- THAT'S RIGHT, MAURICE.

328
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,541
- PLEASE, YOU GOTTA
GO AND SAVE MAMA.

329
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,791
OUR PAPA'S THE ONLY ONE
IN THE WORLD

330
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,708
THAT CAN SAVE OUR MAMA!

331
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,083
- ( exhales )

332
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,416
YEAH, I THINK SO TOO.

333
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,083
- Holland:
YOU'D BETTER GO, RENTON.

334
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,083
- HUH?
- IF SHE'S THE ONE YOU LOVE,

335
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,625
GO GET HER BACK.

336
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,791
YOU'RE A MAN, RIGHT?

337
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:28,833
- ( grunts )

338
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,833
I...!

339
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,833
CAN...!

340
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,500
FLY!

341
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,875
I'M SORRY, EUREKA.

342
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,416
I HAVE DEFEAT SOME OF
YOUR FELLOW CORALIANS.

343
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,333
AND IF YOU TELL ME
THAT'S A SIN,

344
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,750
THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO CARRY
ITS WEIGHT ON MY SHOULDERS.

345
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,125
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT,

346
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,125
I HAVE TO GO WHERE YOU ARE,
EUREKA!

347
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,375
( shouts )

348
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,000
- AND THERE HE GOES.

349
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,666
- YEAH, THERE HE GOES,
ALL RIGHT.

350
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,833
- AW, DRAT.
- HMM?

351
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,000
- JEEZ, IT WENT BY TOO FAST.

352
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,833
IT WAS MY LAST CHANCE, TOO.

353
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,666
- THAT'S TOO BAD.
- HUH?

354
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,500
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
PLENTY OF TIME

355
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,416
WHEN HE GETS BACK.

356
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,166
- YOU GUYS DON'T GET IT.
- WHAT?

357
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,666
- BEFORE ALL THIS,
HE WAS SOMEONE WHO COULD

358
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,583
NEVER REALLY FIT
WITHIN A FRAME.

359
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,166
BUT HE FINALLY GREW UP ENOUGH TO
JUMP OVER THE FRAME CALLED US.

360
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,916
- THERE'S NO WAY THAT RENTON
WILL BE RETURNING.

361
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,250
RENTON HAS FLOWN
OUT OF THE NEST.

362
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,833
THE NEST CALLED
GEKKOSTATE.

363
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,166
ALL OF US NEED TO
LET HIM GO.

364
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,875
OUR SON.

365
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,875
- IT'S JUST LIKE HIM
TO GRADUATE WITHOUT CONSENT.

366
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,375
I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF
THE LITTLE ONES FOR YOU.

367
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,041
JUST MAKE SURE TO WIN
EUREKA BACK, RENTON.

368
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,041
- ( gasps )

369
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,541
EUREKA.

370
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,625
PLEASE WAIT FOR ME,
EUREKA.

371
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,750
I'M COMING!

372
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,583
( shouts )

373
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,791
( gasps, shouts )

374
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,583
( grunting )

375
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,791
- Eureka: RENTON.

376
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,541
- ( grunting )

377
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,041
- RENTON.

378
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,583
- ( grunting )

379
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,416
- RENTON.

380
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,666
- ( gasps )

381
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,708
EUREKA!

382
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,625
( screams )

383
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,333
( gasps )

384
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,958
DON'T JUST SAY BYE-BYE.

385
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,958
DON'T TRY TO GO
BY YOURSELF, EUREKA.

386
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,291
- YOU CAME, RENTON.

387
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,458
( crying )
YOU REALLY CAME.

388
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,416
- I PROMISED YOU,
DIDN'T I?

389
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,833
THAT I WOULD MAKE SURE TO
ALWAYS PROTECT YOU, EUREKA.

390
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,791
AND THAT I WOULD ALWAYS
BE TOGETHER WITH YOU.

391
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,291
- BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

392
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,958
I CAN'T GO BACK ANYMORE.

393
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,583
- IF YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE THE CHOICE

394
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,958
TO NO LONGER BE A CORALIAN

395
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,625
IN ORDER TO
SAVE THIS PLANET,

396
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,958
THEN I CHOOSE TO
NO LONGER BE A HUMAN.

397
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,041
- ( gasps )

398
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,958
- I TRULY
CHERISH THIS PLANET

399
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,000
WHERE I WAS ABLE
TO FIND YOU.

400
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,000
AND EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE
ON THIS PLANET ARE DEAR TO ME.

401
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,666
BUT I'M JUST NOT WILLING
TO LOSE YOU FOR THEIR SAKE.

402
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,000
- ( gasps )

403
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,000
- LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

404
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,125
- RENTON.

405
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,000
- EUREKA,
LET'S BECOME ONE.

406
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:20,333
BECAUSE I WON'T LET YOU
BE ALL BY YOURSELF.

407
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,958
- IF I'M TOGETHER
WITH YOU, RENTON,

408
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,666
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

409
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,000
- MAMA.

410
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,375
- All: AND RENTON!

411
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,166
- Nirvash: THANK YOU.

412
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,708
- NIRVASH?

413
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,750
- RENTON, EUREKA,

414
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,916
YOUR EMOTIONS HAVE BEEN
ENGRAVED FOREVER

415
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,708
INTO MY COMPAC.

416
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,916
FINALLY, I WILL BE ABLE
TO OBTAIN ENLIGHTENMENT.

417
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,916
NOW LIVE ON THIS PLANET.
- Both: HUH?

418
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,916
- GO AND LIVE TOGETHER,

419
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,583
AND SHOW THE WAY TO ALL

420
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,416
THAT LIVE ON THIS
PRECIOUS WORLD,

421
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,125
USING THE BRILLIANT LIGHT
NAMED HOPE.

422
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,958
- NIRVASH.

423
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,125
( grunts )

424
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,166
- NOT ALL OF THE BEINGS

425
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,083
CAN REMAIN ON THIS LAND.

426
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,083
HALF WILL DEPART
TOGETHER WITH US.

427
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,083
HOWEVER, RENTON,
EUREKA,

428
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,916
IF ON THIS PLANET
AN EVOLUTION TAKES PLACE

429
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,166
FOR THE BETTER,

430
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,750
AND THE TWO ARE ABLE
TO BECOME ONE,

431
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,125
WE WILL RETURN
AND SHOW OURSELVES

432
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,125
IN FRONT OF YOU ONCE AGAIN.

433
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,625
I BELIEVE THAT SUCH A DAY
WILL SOME DAY COME.

434
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,458
- Eureka:
THANK YOU, NIRVASH.

435
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,541
- THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

436
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,125
- RENTON,

437
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,333
LET'S GO HOME.

438
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,666
- YEAH,
HOME TO OUR PLANET.

439
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,125
- Holland:
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

440
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,083
- CAN IT BE THAT THIS IS--

441
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,125
- THIS IS THE SECOND
SUMMER OF LOVE.

442
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,666
- All: HUH?
- FROM HERE ON,

443
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,125
YOU WILL USE THIS UNIVERSE,

444
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,791
AND WE WILL USE
A SEPARATE UNIVERSE

445
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,166
TO SEEK OUT A WAY THAT
SCUB CORALS AND HUMANS

446
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,333
CAN COEXIST SIDE BY SIDE.

447
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,166
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

448
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,708
- THERE REALLY IS NO REASON

449
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,375
WHY THERE CANNOT BE MORE THAN
ONE PATH OF EVOLUTION.

450
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,708
IT WAS FUN BEING WITH YOU
ALL THIS TIME.

451
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,166
YOU HAVE MY THANKS.

452
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,500
- BUT GONZY, IT CAN'T BE
THAT YOU'RE A--

453
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,500
( gasps )

454
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,166
OH, BROTHER.

455
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,041
TO THINK THAT A CORALIAN
HAS BEEN WATCHING OVER US

456
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,375
THE ENTIRE TIME.

457
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,458
- HEY, HOLLAND?

458
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,166
DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE...

459
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,583
- I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS.

460
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,833
RENTON CHOSE TO BECOME
ONE OF THEM.

461
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,500
A TRUE HERO.

462
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,500
MORE SO THAN HIS OWN FATHER.

463
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,541
- Kids: WOW!

464
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,041
- THANKS FOR THE FOOD.

465
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,708
- HEY, WIPE YOUR HANDS
BEFORE YOU EAT.

466
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,708
- Linck: IT'S OKAY.
- Maeter: NO, IT'S NOT.

467
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,291
- Linck: HEY, DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

468
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,250
- Maeter: THAT'S NASTY.
COME ON, LINCK.

469
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,541
- HMM.

470
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,708
- Maurice: GRANDPA?
- HUH?

471
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,541
- AREN'T YOU GONNA EAT?

472
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,875
YOUR FOOD'S
GONNA GET COLD.

473
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,541
- OH, YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

474
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,875
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO
EAT IT QUICKLY.

475
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,875
- WAS IT A LOT OF
TROUBLE FOR YOU?

476
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,375
I MEAN,
THE FACT THAT WE CAME HERE?

477
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,416
- TO EAT A BIG BURG.

478
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,416
- HUH?
- IT HAS LONG BEEN

479
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,916
THE TRADITION OF THE
THURSTONS TO HAVE A BIG BURG

480
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,250
WHEN WE HAVE CONFIRMED
OUR FAMILY TIES.

481
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,708
NOW, LET'S EAT.

482
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,083
YOU'D BETTER HURRY UP.

483
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,250
IF WE DON'T,
THE MOON WILL RISE.

484
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,208
- MM!

485
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,375
- Grandpa:
EVERY MEMBER OF MY FAMILY

486
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,083
LEAVES THIS TOWN.
BUT YOUR PAPA, RENTON,

487
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,500
WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT
ACTUALLY CAME BACK.

488
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,875
- Maurice: REALLY?

489
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,041
- I NOW HAVE THREE INCOMPARABLE
GREAT GRANDCHILDREN,

490
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:31,583
AND THAT IS PROOF
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

491
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,958
- Maeter:
HEY, GRANDPA!

492
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,041
OH, NO, LOOK!
THE TRAIN IS PULLING UP.

493
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,666
- OH, LET'S HURRY.

494
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,250
- ( kids giggle )

495
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,083
- COME ON NOW, CHILDREN.
YOU GOTTA SLOW DOWN.

496
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,666
YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE
AN OLD MAN RUN SO MUCH.

497
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,666
HUH?

498
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,291
- MAETER, WHY DO YOU HAVE
YOUR HANDS LIKE THAT?

499
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,708
- I'M WISHING ON A STAR
AS HARD AS I CAN

500
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,708
FOR MAMA AND RENTON
TO COME BACK

501
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,458
AND FINALLY
BE WITH US AGAIN.

502
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,375
- YEAH, ME TOO.
- AND ME.

503
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,291
- YES, HURRY AND COME BACK

504
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,625
WITH THAT YOUNG LADY
OF YOURS, RENTON.

505
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,625
YOUR LOVELY CHILDREN

506
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,333
ARE WAITING FOR YOU.

507
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,458
- Renton and Eureka:
THE END.
