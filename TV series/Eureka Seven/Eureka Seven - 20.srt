1
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,666
- ( theme song playing )

2
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,500
♪ YOU GOTTA REMEMBER ♪

4
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,375
♪ YOU GOTTA REMEMBER ♪

5
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,958
- MAMA IS GOING TO BE
OKAY, RIGHT?

6
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,041
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING BAD.

7
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,416
HOLLAND SAID SO, DIDN'T HE?

8
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,166
- YEAH.

9
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,458
- SLOWLY, TALHO.

10
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,041
TAKE HER TO THE REAR EXAM TABLE.

11
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,166
- GOT IT.

12
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,125
- ( grunts ) HEY! WAIT A MINUTE!
WHAT YOU DO THAT FOR?

13
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,250
- NO IFS, ANDS OR BUTS.

14
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,916
- YOU'RE STAYING OUTSIDE!

15
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,125
- ( sobbing )

16
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,958
- ( beeping )

17
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,541
- SO CAN YOU HELP HER, MISCHA?

18
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,750
- NO, I CAN'T.

19
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,875
RATHER, MODERN MEDICINE
CAN'T PEEL THIS SCUB OFF HER

20
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,625
WITHOUT CAUSING DAMAGE.

21
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,583
HOWEVER, HER CARDIOVASCULAR
FUNCTIONS SEEM TO BE STABLE,

22
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,166
AND HER VITAL SIGNS ARE GOOD.

23
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,333
I SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
IN SUSTAINING HER LIFE.

24
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,458
- BUT I...
- FINE! I GOT IT!

25
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,541
FOR THE TIME BEING,
WHAT HAPPENED TO EUREKA

26
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,708
STAYS BETWEEN US.
GOT THAT?

27
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,791
- ALL RIGHT.

28
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,250
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT RENTON?
- HMM?

29
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,541
- WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO TELL RENTON ABOUT THIS?

30
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,291
- ( kids gasping )

31
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,166
HOLLAND!

32
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,375
- HOW'S EUREKA?

33
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,958
- HOW IS SHE?
- HOW'S MAMA?

34
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,583
- MAMA'S OKAY, RIGHT?

35
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,250
- All: RIGHT?

36
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,875
- SHE'S JUST FINE!
NOTHING SHE CAN'T HANDLE.

37
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,291
- I'M SO GLAD.

38
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,208
- SEE, GUYS, IT'S JUST
LIKE I TOLD YA.

39
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,458
MAMA'S GOING TO BE FINE.

40
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,625
- YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR!

41
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,500
YOU WERE ALL
TEARY EYED, LIKE US.

42
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,833
HEY! THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I WAS NOT.

43
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,291
- UH-HUH, I SAW YOU!

44
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,000
- YOU'RE A TADDLE TALE!

45
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,000
- IS SHE REALLY ALL RIGHT?

46
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,458
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE
HER TO A PROPER HOSPITAL!

47
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,958
THE CITY OF LIEVELVILLE
HAS A BIG HOSPITAL.

48
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,291
- YOU NEED TO SHUT YOU MOUTH!

49
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,375
I'M TELLING YOU,
EUREKA IS JUST FINE!

50
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,583
ARE YOU DISSATISFIED
WITH WHAT I AM TELLING YOU?

51
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,208
- IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU!
IT'S ABOUT EUREKA'S WELL BEING!

52
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,125
- STOP IT! BOTH OF YOU.
- DAMN YOU!

53
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,458
- Man on Loudspeaker:
HOLLAND! TALHO!

54
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,833
COME TO THE BRIDGE.

55
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,333
WE HAVE A CALL FROM
MASTER DELGEL OF THE VODARAC.

56
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,500
THERE'S SOMETHING URGENT
HE WANTS TO ASK YOU.

57
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,458
WE GOT A MESSAGE
FROM THE VODARAC

58
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,250
VIA CODE JIG
AT 12:30 TODAY.

59
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,250
IT WAS A REQUEST TO RESCUE
A CERTAIN HIGH PRIEST X.

60
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,541
- HIGH PRIEST X?

61
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,291
- THAT JUST MEANS THEY CAN'T
DISCLOSE HIS NAME.

62
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

63
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,666
RIGHT NOW, HIGH PRIEST X
IS LOCKED UP

64
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,791
IN A DOVE GRAVE PRISON
ACCUSED OF A POLITICAL CRIME.

65
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,333
IT'S APPARENTLY A FALSE CHARGE,

66
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,416
BUT X HAS BEEN UNABLE
TO GET A PROPER TRIAL,

67
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,375
AND IS ABOUT TO BE EXECUTED.

68
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,416
- AND THEY WANT US TO
GO IN AND SAVE HIM?

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,583
- YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

70
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,333
HOW LONG BEFORE
THEY EXECUTE HIM?

71
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,125
- WELL, JUST TWO HOURS.

72
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,833
- OH, MAN! ALL THINGS
CONSIDERED, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

73
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,708
- BUT IN RETURN,
THEY'LL PAY US 50 MILLION.

74
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,708
- HUH? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

75
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,583
- IT MEANS NOBODY
WOULD ACCEPT THE JOB

76
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,083
IF THEY DIDN'T OFFER THAT MUCH.

77
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,875
IF I RECALL, THERE'S A STATE
ARMY BASE RIGHT NEAR THERE?

78
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,125
- YEAH, A HARD PLACE
TO GET PAST.

79
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,041
- ALL LFOS OTHER THAN THE
NIRVASH ARE DISCHARGED,

80
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,875
AND ONLY ONE OF THE BATTERIES
HAS COMPLETED RECHARGING.

81
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,333
OUR LACK OF MONEY IS SERIOUS,

82
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,208
BUT WE HAVE TO LET
THIS ONE PASS.

83
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,333
- WAIT. I'LL GO.

84
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,958
IN ANY CASE, THIS IS
A COVERT OPERATION.

85
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,708
A SINGLE BATTERY
SHOULD BE ENOUGH.

86
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,541
AND IF I GO IN VEHICLE MODE,
I WON'T SHOW UP ON THEIR...

87
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,375
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!

88
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,416
YOU CARE MORE ABOUT
MONEY THAN ABOUT EUREKA?

89
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,166
ISN'T TAKING HER TO A HOSPITAL
MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW?

90
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,791
- MONEY IS IMPORTANT.

91
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,041
SO IS WATER, FUEL AND FOOD.

92
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,291
AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT FREE
TO GO SEE A DOCTOR.

93
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,666
- BUT, EVEN SO!

94
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,666
- I'M THE LEADER HERE.

95
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,250
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE KID.

96
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,291
YOU WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE THANKS
TO THIS LITTLE KID, WEREN'T YOU?

97
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,916
IF IT WASN'T FOR MY NIRVASH,
THAT OPERATION...

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,791
- OH, RIGHT.
I NEARLY FORGOT.

99
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,625
THANKS FOR ALL
THE HARD WORK, KID.

100
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,458
- YOU SURE SAVED US,
DIDN'T YOU?

101
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,208
- ( slams )

102
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,875
- OH, AND ANOTHER THING.

103
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,958
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF
CALLING THE NIRVASH YOURS,

104
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,166
- YOU LITTLE TWERP?

105
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,083
- EUREKA TOLD ME
THAT IT WAS MINE!

106
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,583
SHE SAID THAT IT WAS
BETTER FOR ME

107
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,750
TO BE PILOTING THE
NIRVASH RIGHT NOW!

108
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,958
( grunts )

109
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,083
- ALL RIGHT, HOLLAND.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

110
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,666
- STAY OUT OF IT, HAP!
HE'S GOTTEN FULL OF HIMSELF!

111
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,083
- I SAID, THAT'S ENOUGH!

112
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,791
YOU'RE THE LEADER OF THE
GEKKOSTATE, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD!

113
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,875
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD BE

114
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,708
VENTING YOUR FRUSTRATIONS
ON RENTON?

115
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,541
GEEZ, HE'S AN UNRESISTING CHILD.

116
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,041
IT'S EMBARRASSING!

117
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,625
- I'M GOING TO PROTECT HER.

118
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,916
I'M GOING TO PROTECT EUREKA.

119
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,125
SINCE YOU WON'T DO IT,

120
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:27,291
I'M GOING TO TAKE EUREKA TO A
HOSPITAL TO GET HER SOME HELP!

121
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,291
DAMMIT, DAMMIT, DAMMIT!

122
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,166
JUST BECAUSE YOUR BODY
IS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN MINE

123
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,708
DOESN'T MAKE YOU BETTER
THAN ME.

124
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,291
- I DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE.

125
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,708
- PRETENDING YOUR SOME KIND
OF KNIGHT OR SOMETHING.

126
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,041
- I'M NOT PRETENDING!

127
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,333
- SOMEDAY, I'LL BECOME
A REAL KNIGHT, YOU'LL SEE!

128
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,791
I'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU OUT.

129
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,500
DO THE RESCUE MISSION YOURSELF.

130
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,375
I'LL NEVER HELP YOU
AS LONG AS I LIVE!

131
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,916
- YOU ARE SO FULL OF IT!

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,958
I DON'T NEED YOU, YOU JERK!
I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT BY MYSELF!

133
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,166
( groans )

134
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:05,083
I CAN DO THIS THING,
ALL BY MYSELF.

135
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,666
- HEY! ARE YOU ALIVE?

136
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,333
- Holland: I'LL HAVE ONE CHANCE
FROM 15:00 to 15:20.

137
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,458
EVEN IF I GO THROUGH
THE DRY VALLEY OVER HERE,

138
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,666
I SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.

139
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,500
- YOU'RE IMMATURE.
- HUH?

140
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,041
- BEING SO SERIOUS GOING
AGAINST A LITTLE KID.

141
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,416
- I WASN'T DOING THAT.
- YOU WERE TOO.

142
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,291
- I WAS NOT!
I'M AN ADULT!

143
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,916
- THE FACT THAT YOU
SAY YOU'RE AN ADULT

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,708
JUST PROVES THAT
YOU'RE STILL IMMATURE.

145
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,708
- DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE, HOLLAND?

146
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,916
I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANT TO ASK YOU?

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,791
- YEAH? RENTON IS MORE THAN
ENOUGH FOR THAT KIND OF STUFF.

148
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,291
- DON'T BE SUCH AN IDIOT.

149
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,333
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT.

150
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,958
- I'M BUSY RIGHT NOW.

151
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,583
I HAVE TO FINISH DISCUSSING
MY PLANS WITH HAP.

152
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,750
THE VODARAC'S REQUEST.
WHY DID YOU ACCEPT?

153
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,875
A HIGH PRIEST OF THE VODARAC
MIGHT BE ABLE TO CURE EUREKA?

154
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,083
- IS THAT IT?
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

155
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,583
WE'LL DISCUSS IT
WHEN I GET BACK.

156
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,083
- ( metallic clanging )

157
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,750
- STOP RUNNING AWAY LIKE THAT.

158
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:21,208
YOU USED EUREKA AS A MEANS
TO GET AWAY FROM THE ARMY

159
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,250
AND THEN TO GET AWAY
FROM YOU KNOW WHO.

160
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,416
- NOT TRUE.
- OH, YEAH? WHAT PART?!

161
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,416
WHEN IT COMES DOWN RIGHT
TO IT, YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING

162
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,208
WITHOUT PUTTING THE
BLAME ON SOMEONE ELSE!

163
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,333
- THAT'S NOT TRUE!

164
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,625
I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

165
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,416
I'M REALLY NOT
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

166
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,708
- ( water splashes )

167
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,458
- HEY RENTON, ARE YOU OKAY?

168
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,250
- I'M SURE HOLLAND JUST
GOT TO HIM AGAIN.

169
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,458
- YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- HOLLAND?

170
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,541
- HEY, RENTON, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

171
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,125
- Linck: ARE YOU GOING
TO GO FIGHT BACK?

172
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,166
- Maeter: DON'T DO IT.

173
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,708
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'D WIN, YOU KNOW.

174
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,291
- AREN'T YOU GUYS EVEN A LITTLE
BIT WORRIED ABOUT EUREKA?

175
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,583
- NO WAY! CAUSE HOLLAND TOLD US
THAT OUR MAMA WAS ALL RIGHT.

176
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,708
- YOU SEE, RENTON, HOLLAND
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ONE

177
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,291
WHO PROTECTED MAMA FOR US.

178
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,625
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. FROM WAY,
WAY BEFORE SHE BECAME OUR MAMA.

179
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,916
- GET OUT!

180
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,791
- Renton: NIRVASH.

181
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,375
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU?

182
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,166
IT'S NOT THE SAME
AS WITH EUREKA.

183
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,541
NO MATTER HOW I TRY
I CAN'T HEAR YOUR VOICE.

184
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,875
- I'M GOING TO TAKE
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE.

185
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,291
YOU'VE BEEN PROHIBITED FROM
PILOTING THE NIRVASH,

186
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,375
HAVEN'T YOU?

187
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,041
- YEAH, SO WHAT?
I'M JUST SITTING HERE!

188
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,750
DO YOU THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT?

189
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,750
- YOU KNOW...
- THE SEVEN SWELL?

190
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,416
- YEAH. EVEN THOUGH WE
WERE SAVED BECAUSE OF IT,

191
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,875
IT'S STILL TOO DANGEROUS.

192
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,458
BESIDES, I CAN'T REALLY
PUT IT TO WORDS BUT...

193
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,041
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T FIT IN
THE CAMERA FRAME TOO WELL.

194
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,958
- Holland: I'VE JUST PASSED
POINT I 509.

195
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,000
NO SIGNS OF THE ENEMY.

196
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,708
EVERYTHING IS GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

197
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,583
- Hap: HEY, HOLLAND.

198
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,208
IF YOU GET IN A BIND,
YOU HIGH TAIL IT BACK HERE.

199
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,541
- TRUST ME, HAP.
MISSIONS LIKE THESE ARE NO...

200
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,458
- NO BIG DEAL.
YOU'VE DONE IT A LOT, RIGHT?

201
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,791
- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STUFF
THAT HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO

202
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,333
WHEN YOU WERE STILL AN
ACE PILOT WITH THE SOF.

203
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,958
- I'M ALMOST THROUGH THE FOREST.

204
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,916
I'LL BE SEVERING
COMMUNICATIONS SOON.

205
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,666
BELIEVE IT.

206
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,250
I CAN STILL PULL THIS OFF.

207
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,500
- ENJOY IT.

208
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,875
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
YOU GET TO LOOK AT THE SKY.

209
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,625
- Prisoner: I GUESS
HE REALLY IS A PRIEST.

210
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,250
HE DOESN'T SEEM WORRIED AT ALL.

211
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,791
TOO BAD BELIEVING ALONE
WON'T SAVE YOU HERE.

212
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,166
- HEY, LOOK AT THAT.
- ( yawns )

213
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,291
- HEY WHAT'S HE DOING?
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

214
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,416
WHEN YOU PRAY LIKE THAT,

215
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,250
GOD WILL COME DOWN
TO WHERE YOU ARE.

216
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,833
- THAT'S AN LFO.
- SHOOT IT! NOW!

217
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,333
DAMMIT! THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!

218
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,083
- Holland: GET IN THE BACK SEAT!

219
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,958
I WAS SENT HERE BY
MASTER DELGEL OF THE VODARAC!

220
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,375
- EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS,

221
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,500
HAPPENS AS GUIDED
BY THE VODARAC.

222
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,166
- I HAVE A GIRL THAT I WANT
YOU TO SAVE SOMEHOW,

223
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,458
USING THAT GUIDANCE
THAT YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT.

224
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,791
- A SCUB...
- ( beeping )

225
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,291
- KLFS?

226
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,458
I GUESS I HAVE BEEN
FORCED INTO A RUT HERE.

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,083
- ( instrument beeping )

228
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,583
- MISS TALHO.

229
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:21,916
- DAMN!

230
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,750
HEY, MISTER PRIEST!

231
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,833
CAN YOU USE THAT
TO TIE MY HEAD UP?

232
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,416
BLOOD'S GETTING IN MY EYES!
HURRY UP!

233
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,583
- YES, OF COURSE.

234
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,291
- Talho: WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

235
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,916
- I JUST THOUGHT I'D TAKE
A GLIMPSE OF HER FACE.

236
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,708
- HMM. YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
DOING LEWD THINGS

237
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,291
TO HER WHILE SHE
WAS SLEEPING, RIGHT?

238
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,000
- AND WHAT WERE YOU
DOING HERE, MISS TALHO?

239
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,083
- I WAS THINKING
ABOUT KILLING HER.

240
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,500
- ( gasps )
- IT'S A JOKE.

241
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,291
- EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF YOU PISSES ME OFF.

242
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,750
EVERY GUY OPENS THEIR MOUTH

243
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,083
AND IT'S EUREKA THIS,
AND EUREKA THAT.

244
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,583
I COULD COMPETE IF SHE
WAS A NORMAL GIRL.

245
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,125
BUT I'M...
I'M GOING AGAINST THE WORLD.

246
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,083
- HMM? THE WORLD?

247
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,625
- ( beeping )

248
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,583
- Hap on loudspeaker: EVERYONE!
GET TO YOUR STATIONS!

249
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,375
HOLLAND IS IN TROUBLE!

250
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,250
- COME ON, HOLLAND!

251
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,000
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE FACED THIS MANY KLFS!

252
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,041
- ARE WE UNABLE TO
MAKE OUR ESCAPE?

253
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,583
- YOU STAY QUIET!

254
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,875
- WE'RE GOING TO
TAKE A NOSEDIVE!

255
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,625
- MAKE SURE YOU HOLD ON TIGHT!
- OH, RIGHT!

256
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,083
- OKAY, WHAT DO I DO?

257
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,666
WHAT DO MY INSTINCTS SAY?

258
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,291
DO I GO LEFT?
OR TURN RIGHT?

259
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,041
GO LEFT?
OR GO RIGHT?

260
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,833
LEFT!

261
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,791
- ALL RIGHT, I'VE
DESTROYED HIS BOARD!

262
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,250
NOW ALL HE CAN DO IS CRAWL
AROUND ON THE GROUND!

263
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,083
I'LL TAKE HIM DOWN AND SLOWLY.

264
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,833
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN NOW.

265
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,166
- Renton: IT SERVES HIM RIGHT.

266
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,000
IT'S BECAUSE HIS EYES WENT
STRAIGHT FOR THE MONEY.

267
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,791
HE CURSED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE
DIDN'T TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL.

268
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,416
HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT EUREKA!

269
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,875
- DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT
HE WOULD DO SOMETHING

270
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,166
JUST FOR THE MONEY?

271
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,375
HE'D NEVER DO THAT!

272
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,666
HE... HE...

273
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,125
HE WENT SO HE CAN
TRY AND SAVE EUREKA!

274
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:30,583
BECAUSE THAT THING ON EUREKA
CAN'T BE FIXED BY ANY DOCTOR!

275
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,958
BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY BE FIXED
BY A VODARAC PRIEST!

276
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,958
FOR MONEY? THAT COULD
NEVER BE THE CASE.

277
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:43,041
THAT IDIOT ALWAYS TAKES CARE OF
EUREKA MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

278
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,000
MORE THAN ANY WAVE.
MORE THAN ME!

279
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,708
MAYBE EVEN, MORE THAN HIMSELF!

280
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,625
- ( grunting )

281
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,666
- Ken-Goh: JOBS! I DON'T CARE
WHICH LFO, GET IT MOVING ASAP!

282
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,041
IT'S GOING TO BE
DAMNED DANGEROUS,

283
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,208
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO SHOW OURSELVES
IN FRONT OF THE ENEMY.

284
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,416
- KEN-GOH.
- TAHLO, DON'T JUST STAND THERE!

285
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,125
IT'S YOUR JOB TO BE
STEERING THIS SHIP,

286
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,500
SO HURRY UP AND GET TO IT!

287
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,458
- Hap: FLY WHEELS, TO GO.

288
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,958
READY FOR CATAPULT RELEASE.

289
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,416
WHOA, GIDGET, GET UP
TO THE BRIDGE.

290
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,250
- HAP, ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION
WITH THE VODARAC.

291
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,916
DON'T USE NORMAL CONNECTIONS.

292
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,583
- BEARING IS 1-2-0-6!

293
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,875
PREPARE TO LIGHT
UP BOTH BOOSTERS.

294
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,166
- I...

295
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,250
- IF ANYTHING BAD SHOULD
HAPPEN TO HER,

296
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,833
I'LL KILL YOU,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

297
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,291
- I...

298
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,250
- SEE THERE IS NOTHING ELSE
THAT I CAN REALLY BELIEVE IN.

299
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,416
OTHER THAN THE NIRVASH
AND HOLLAND.

300
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,208
- Renton: HOLLAND HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THE ONE TO PROTECT EUREKA.

301
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,416
- YOU SEE, RENTON, HOLLAND
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ONE

302
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,916
WHO PROTECTED MAMA FOR US.

303
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,625
- BUT... BUT, I...

304
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,791
I'M SUCH A KID.

305
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,500
I'M JUST AN IMMATURE KID,

306
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,125
WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING!

307
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,250
( breathing deeply )

308
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,208
- ( breathing heavily )

309
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,000
- ( screaming )

310
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,875
THE FORMER ACE PILOT OF THE
SOF FIRST MOBILE SQUADRON

311
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,916
ENDS UP LIKE THIS?

312
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,125
IT'S JUST LIKE HAP SAID.

313
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,583
GEEZ, WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?

314
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,458
I REALLY AM PATHETIC.

315
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,166
- Ken-Goh: CAPTAIN! DON'T PANIC!
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!

316
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,708
AS LONG AS WE SURROUND HIM
THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR.

317
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,208
WAIT A MINUTE! THAT'S...

318
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,875
THE TYPE ZERO!

319
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,708
ZERO THREE!

320
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,333
- THAT KID.

321
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,958
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE'D
BUST THROUGH ALL BY HIMSELF?

322
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,916
YEAH, WELL...
HE'S STILL JUST A KID.

323
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,625
- Ken-Goh: THE SKULL KLF
SQUADRON HAS BEEN ANNIHILATED.

324
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,958
- Hap: HOW MANY ENEMY SHIPS?

325
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,083
- I BELIEVE IT IS ONE LFO.

326
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,208
- WELL DONE.
YOU GOT THEM, RENTON!

327
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,416
TALHO, LOOKS LIKE HE
MADE IT IN TIME.

328
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,291
- I'M A KID. THAT'S ALL.

329
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:04,208
I'M JUST A LITTLE KID THAT
CAN'T DO A DAMN THING. BUT I...

330
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,666
- ZERO THREE TO ZERO ONE.
WE HAVE ONE LFO COMING IN FAST!

331
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,416
- I... I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

332
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,833
NOTHING ABOUT HOLLAND.
NOTHING ABOUT EUREKA.

333
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,958
NOTHING AT ALL!
NOTHING AT ALL!

334
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,416
- ALL SHIPS, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

335
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,958
ZERO-TWO TO ZERO-ONE!

336
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,500
THE SQUADRON CASUALTIES
WILL INCREASE

337
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,583
IF WE ENTER CLOSE RANGE
COMBAT RIGHT NOW!

338
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,166
- WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARS,
WE'LL ALL FIRE AT ONCE!

339
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,250
- ROGER!

340
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,458
- DAMN IT!

341
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,458
( panting )

342
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,916
- Holland: THANKS FOR PICKING
ALONG FOR ME.

343
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,291
RENTON, THAT'S ENOUGH.

344
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,250
- DAMN IT.

345
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,166

DAMN!

347
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,333
- Holland: RENTON,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

348
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,958
ENOUGH! WE NEED TO GET BACK.

349
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,166
HEY, RENTON!

350
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,375
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

351
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,625
RENTON! RENTON!
ANSWER ME!

352
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,458
RENTON!

353
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,916
- OM MANI DARAM,

354
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,500
- RENTON, YOU GOTTA CALM DOWN.

355
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,416
YOU'RE GOING TOO FAR.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

356
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,666
- IT'S ALL OVER!

NO, HE'S GONE WAY BEYOND THAT.

364
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,333
IF RENTON IS REALLY
PILOTING THAT THING,

365
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,125
THE NIRVASH IS...

THE BOY, LOSING SIGHT OF
WHAT HE SHOULD BELIEVE IN,
