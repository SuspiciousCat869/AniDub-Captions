1
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

2
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,166
- ♪ I WANT TO FLY AWAY ♪

3
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,958
♪ I CAN FLY AWAY ♪

4
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,625
♪ I CAN FLY AWAY ♪

5
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:48,916
- RAY.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,958
- ( gasps )

7
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,875
- YOU HEARD, RIGHT?
- HMM.

8
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,041
- IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

9
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:01,000
THEY TOLD ME THAT
I CAN'T HAVE YOUR CHILD.

10
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,833
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

11
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,708
- THEY SAID IT WAS
BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT

12
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,875
THAT SHINED ON ME
DURING THAT PHENOMENON!

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,416
( crying ) I'M SORRY, CHARLES.
I'M SORRY

14
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,250
( grunting )

15
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,833
ARE YOU STUPID?
SOMEONE COULD SEE YOU.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,708
- LET'S GET MARRIED,
MY HONEY-BUNNY.

17
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,875
- YOU WANT TO MARRY ME?

18
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,458
- I COULDN'T MARRY ANYONE ELSE.

19
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,375
THEY MATCH.

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,291
- ( buzzing )

21
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,541
- ( footsteps approaching )

22
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,208
- Renton: I COULDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

23
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,166
CHARLES DIED.

24
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,916
HOLLAND KILLED HIM.

25
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,708
- RENTON...
- IS IT ALL MY FAULT?

26
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,041
IF I HADN'T TALKED
TO HIM ABOUT YOU

27
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,625
OR ABOUT THE NIRVASH
WHEN I WAS STAYING WITH HIM.

28
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,333
THEN MAYBE I WOULD
HAVE STILL BEEN

29
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,375
LIVING WITH CHARLES
AND RAY RIGHT NOW.

30
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,333
THEN CHARLES MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD
TO DIE THE WAY HE DID.

31
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,625
- HUH!

32
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,916
- ( Renton crying )

33
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,500
- RENTON.

34
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,666
LET'S GO SEE NIRVASH.

35
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,083
- Jobs: I'M AFRAID THE REASON
WHY THE OUTER HULL CAME OFF

36
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,458
ISN'T JUST BECAUSE
OF ATTACKS FROM OUTSIDE.

37
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,833
- Woz: YOU BELIEVE WHAT EUREKA
AND RENTON ARE SAYING?

38
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,166
THAT NIRVASH ITSELF
WANTS TO EVOLVE?

39
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,875
- TO PUT IT MORE SUCCINCTLY,
THE ARCHETYPE OF NIRVASH DOES.

40
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,541
- WHICH MEANS
ONE PART OF THE THEORY,

41
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,041
THE ONE THAT MISCHA PROPOSED,

42
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,458
THAT THE AMITA DRIVE TIES
THE WILL OF THE ARCHETYPE

43
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,958
TO THE PEOPLE IT'S
CONNECTED TO, HAS BEEN PROVEN.

44
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,041
- SO, AS RENTON AND
EUREKA'S WILLS

45
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,791
BEGIN TO RESONATE
WITH EACH OTHER.

46
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,833
IT WORKS UPON THE TYPE ZERO'S
WILL THROUGH THE AMITA DRIVE?

47
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,583
IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN WE'LL
NEED TO REFINE THE OVERALL SPECS

48
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,416
INCLUDING A NEWER VERSION
OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM.

49
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,208
- WELL, AT LEAST,
WE HAVE PLENTY OF

50
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,458
CONVINCING DATA ON OUR SIDE.

51
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:06,791
- TRUE, BUT THAT KIND OF WORK
CAN'T BE DONE ABOARD THE GEKKO.

52
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,791
I'LL HAVE TO GO TO A FACTORY
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

53
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,416
- HELLO NIRVASH.

54
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,083
- IT'S SHAKING.

55
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,291
- I'M SURE THAT HE WAS SCARED.

56
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,875
- WHAT'S WRONG?

57
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,791
RENTON.

58
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,208
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
GOING TO BE THE END OF IT.

59
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,625
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

60
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,791
RENTON, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD BE DOING?

61
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,375
- IT MIGHT BE BEST
FOR YOU TO SLEEP.

62
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,750
- HUH?

63
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,208
- RIGHT NOW, BOTH YOU
AND NIRVASH ARE TIRED.

64
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,375
SO, YOU SHOULD TRY TO
GET SOME SLEEP AND REST.

65
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,000
- BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO SLEEP FOR A WHILE.

66
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,500
AND I'D BEEN SO SLEEPY BEFORE.

67
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,625
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY SINCE

68
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,208
I STOPPED HEARING
EVERYONE'S VOICES.

69
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,166
I COULDN'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT

70
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,208
TILL NOW.

71
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,000
- SAME HERE.
- HUH?

72
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,416
- A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING
AROUND INSIDE MY HEAD.

73
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,083
- YOU TOO?
- YEAH.

74
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,208
HEY, WHY DON'T WE ASK HILDA
TO MAKE SOME POTAGE SOUP FOR US.

75
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,166
OH, BUT YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OFF
GETTING SOME OF THE MEDICINE

76
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,208
THAT MISCHA PRESCRIBED
FOR YOU INSTEAD.

77
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,833
- UH, OKAY.

78
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,416
RENTON, YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME.

79
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,250
- Mischa: AT THE VERY LEAST,
WE NEED TO REPLENISH

80
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,250
OUR BLOOD SUPPLY WHEN WE
REACH THE NEXT REST STOP.

81
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,250
- IS HOLLAND'S
RIGHT LEG THAT BAD?

82
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,291
- YES, BUT HE WAS FORTUNATE

83
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,166
THAT THE BULLET PASSED
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

84
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,125
I SAW NO ABNORMALITIES
IN HIS BONE OR NERVES.

85
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,583
- BUT HE NEEDS REST.
- I SEE.

86
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,500
- BUT IF SOMEBODY ELSE HERE ENDS
UP WITH AN INJURY LIKE THIS,

87
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,833
WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH
BLOOD PACKETS

88
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,250
TO PERFORM A TRANSFUSION.

89
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,833
- WHAT IF THAT HAPPENS?

90
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,791
- WELL, I'VE DONE A BLOOD TYPE
SCREENING ON EVERYONE ABOARD.

91
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,958
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WING IT
IF THAT COMES UP.

92
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,583
- TALHO, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

93
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,458
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

94
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,916
- MISCHA, NEITHER RENTON NOR I
ARE ABLE TO GET TO SLEEP.

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,208
- YOU NEED MEDICINE.
WAIT THERE A MOMENT.

96
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,583
- WHERE'S RENTON?

97
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,541
- HE WALKED WITH ME
TO YOUR DOOR,

98
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,500
BUT NOW HE'S HEADED
TO HOLLAND'S ROOM.

99
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,916
- I SEE.

100
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,041
- ( techno music playing )

101
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,833
- NOW, WHAT'S UP?

102
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,916
- WHY DID YOU
DO THAT TO CHARLES?

103
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,958
DON'T JUST STAND THERE, RENTON.

104
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,250
COME ON IN.

105
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,666
- HEY, HILDA.

106
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,583
LATER ON, COULD YOU MAYBE TEACH
ME HOW TO MAKE POTAGE SOUP?

107
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,166
UNUSUAL REQUEST. NO PROBLEM.
ASK ME ANY TIME.

108
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,750
- ( door closes )

109
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,041
- ( door opens )

110
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,916
- Hilda: YOU CAN GO IN NOW.
- RENTON?

111
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,833
- MAMA.

112
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,208
- ( crying ) MAMA!

113
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,458
- COME HERE.

114
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,416
PLEASE.

115
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,083
- MAMA!
- MAMA!

116
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,500
- ( giggling )

117
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,083
- MAURICE?

118
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,208
- SHE MADE HIM A BOMB?
I KNOW HE WAS DEAD BUT STILL.

119
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,041
RIGHT, DOGGIE?

120
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,375
- I DON'T KNOW.

121
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,625
I REALLY HAVE NO CLUE
ABOUT ANYTHING.

122
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,541
- YOU KNOW, WE WON'T
BE ABLE TO TURN BACK.

123
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,666
- WE SHOULD TELL
EVERYONE ABOUT THAT.

124
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- WHERE ARE RENTON AND EUREKA?

125
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,875
- I LEFT EUREKA
IN MISCHA'S OFFICE.

126
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,916
AND RENTON'S
IN HOLLAND'S QUARTERS.

127
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,333
- I SEE.

128
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,083
- Holland: SIT DOWN.

129
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,291
- I WANT TO KNOW.

130
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,666
WASN'T THERE A WAY FOR YOU
NOT TO HAVE TO KILL HIM?

131
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,958
- CHARLES WAS,
A MEMBER OF THE SOF,

132
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,750
JUST LIKE EUREKA AND I.

133
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,250
- ( gasps )

134
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,916
AND RAY TOO.

135
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,875
- WHY DOES RAY HATE
EUREKA SO MUCH?

136
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,875
- CHARLES AND RAY ALWAYS
WANTED TO START A FAMILY.

137
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,000
BUT RAY IS UNABLE
TO BEAR CHILDREN.

138
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,500
- HUH?

139
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,416
- AND RAY BELIEVES THAT
THE REASON WHY SHE CAN'T,

140
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,125
LIES WITH EUREKA.

141
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,916
EVEN IF IT COSTS ME MY LIFE.

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,916
I'M GOING TO PROTECT
THE TWO OF YOU.

143
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,333
BUT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME
I'M TRUSTING YOU WITH EUREKA.

144
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,791
YOU WERE THE ONE SHE CHOSE.

145
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,041
EARLIER, YOU ASKED WHY IT WAS
I KILLED CHARLES.

146
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,333
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH
THE TYPE OF PEOPLE

147
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,458
THAT DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY.

148
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,166
THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR RAY.

149
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,500
I'M SURE THAT SHE'LL...

150
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,625
- Hap over p.a:
HOLLAND! IT'S THAT SONG!

151
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,750
IT'S EVERYWHERE!
IT'S ON EVERY SINGLE CHANNEL

152
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,291
IN THE AREA,
BOTH PUBLIC AND MILITARY!

153
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,750
- LET ME HEAR IT!

154
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,416
- ( techno music
playing over p.a )

155
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,958
- I'VE HEARD THIS.

156
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,958
- IT'S CALLED,
"GET IT BY YOUR HANDS"

157
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,708
THAT SONG WAS
CHARLES' FAVORITE.

158
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,875
- IT'S RAY.

159
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,583
- Gidget: I READ TWO COMPAC
RESPONSES BEARING 340!

160
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,833
- THEY'RE KLFS!

161
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,583
- I THOUGHT THERE WAS
ONLY ONE OF THEM LEFT.

162
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,000
- ONE IS REMOTE-OPERATED.

163
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,708
- TRACE THE FREQUENCY
AND JAM IT!

164
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,041
- ROGER!

165
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,791
- I'M TRYING, BUT IT'S ON
EVERY SINGLE WAVELENGTH

166
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,000
THAT CAN POSSIBLY CARRY
REMOTE SIGNALS!

167
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,041
- WHICH MEANS IT'S
GOING TO TAKE A WHILE

168
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,833
TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE
OF THE TRANSMISSION.

169
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,291
- Holland: I'M HEADING OUT.

170
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,666
- ( horn blaring )

171
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,291
- GOT TO STOP HER!
- RENTON.

172
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,083
- DOES THIS MEAN?
- YEAH. RAY IS BACK.

173
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,666
- Gidget: THE KLFS HAVE
CHANGED COURSE AND SPLIT UP!

174
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,500
TARGET ALPHA IS AT FOUR O'CLOCK!

175
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,583
TARGET BRAVO IS APPROACHING
FROM TEN O'CLOCK!

176
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,833
- PLEASE, MOVE!
I HAVE TO STOP THIS!

177
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,375
- I JUST HAVE TO.
- RENTON, I'LL GO TOO.

178
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,125
- I'M GOING TO CALL OUT TO EVERY
WAVELENGTH THAT WE'RE CATCHING.

179
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,083
- YOU SET UP THE COMM CODE.
- RIGHT, I GOT IT!

180
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,166
- GO!
- MISS RAY!

181
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,416
MISS RAY! IT'S ME, RENTON!

182
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,208
- NOBODY CAN STOP THE SOF.

183
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,791
- Gidget: INCOMING!

184
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,625
- ( grunts )

185
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,583
- Hap: LOWER LEFT VENTRAL FIN
HAS BEEN DESTROYED!

186
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,625
THE RUDDER'S DAMAGED!

187
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,750
MANEUVERABILITY
IS DOWN 20 PERCENT!

188
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,333
- Talho: WE'LL HIDE
BEHIND THAT CLOUD!

189
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,666
I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT WE'RE AT A DISADVANTAGE

190
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,125
IF WE'RE THIS VISIBLE TO A KLF!

191
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,416
- PLEASE, LISTEN TO ME,
MISS RAY!

192
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,916
DAMMIT!

193
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,166
IF YOU WON'T STOP...

194
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,041
MISS RAY, THIS TIME
I WILL FIGHT.

195
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:37,291
I'VE DECIDED THAT I'M
GOING TO PROTECT EUREKA.

196
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,791
CHARLES WAS THE ONE
WHO TAUGHT ME

197
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,083
TO SEE THINGS THROUGH
NO MATTER WHAT!

198
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,208
SO, I'll FIGHT.

199
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,291
EVEN IF IT'S AGAINST YOU!

200
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,166
- ( gasps )

201
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,125
- HURRY UP WITH THE JAMMING!

202
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,625
- Hap: I'M TRYING! I'M SEARCHING
EVERY CONCEIVABLE RANGE

203
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,125
AT MAXIMUM OUTPUT!

204
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,875
- BOTH OF THEM ARE
STILL UP AND OPERATING!

205
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,875
- Matthieu: HEY, I'VE BEEN
NOTICING FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES

206
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,958
THAT THIS SONG HAS
DIGITAL NOISE MIXED INTO IT.

207
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,375
AND THE NOISE REPEATS ITSELF
AT REGULAR INTERVALS.

208
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,000
- HUH?
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

209
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,416
- I GOT IT!

210
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,875
CUT OFF ALL MIDRANGE AND
BASS SOUNDS WITH THE EQUALIZER!

211
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,000
HURRY!

212
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,166
- THAT'S RIGHT!
IN THE TREBLE RANGE!

213
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,041
- HEY, MATTHIEU, GOOD EAR.
- DAMN STRAIGHT!

214
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,416
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

215
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,333
- 909 HAS SHOT ALPHA DOWN!

216
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,416
- AND THE OTHER ONE?

217
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,541
- BRAVO IS STILL
FIGHTING THE 909!

218
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,583
- IS THAT YOU, RAY?

219
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,250
- MISS RAY...

220
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,583
IF I HADN'T LEFT
THE SWAN WHEN I DID,

221
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,166
IF I HAD BECOME YOUR SON
LIKE YOU WANTED,

222
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,750
WOULD ANY OF THIS
EVER HAVE HAPPENED?

223
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,208
IF I HAD STAYED
WOULD I HAVE BEEN ABLE

224
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,416
TO MAKE BOTH YOU AND
MR. CHARLES HAPPY, MISS RAY?

225
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,291
PLEASE! ANSWER ME!

226
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,916
ANSWER ME, MISS RAY!

227
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,208
- CHARLES, I'M SORRY.

228
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:22,875
MISS RAY!

229
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,750
( screaming ) MISS RAY!

230
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,416
- IT'S STILL GOING.

231
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,291
- I'VE FIGURED OUT
THE SOURCE OF THE NOISE.

232
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,916
- YES!

233
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,541
- HOLLAND!
- NO WAY.

234
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,166
- UH!

235
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,541
- IT CAN'T BE.
- Talho: THE SWAN!

236
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,166
- TALHO, EVADE!
- THE HELM ISN'T ANSWERING!

237
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,833
- TURN THE PORT SIDE CANNONS!

238
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,625
- IT'S FAR TOO LATE,
FOR EVERYTHING.

239
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,208
- PLEASE, MISS RAY.

240
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,375
- Ray: RENTON.

241
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,166
EUREKA, THE ONE
YOU'RE THERE TO PROTECT,

242
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,541
TOOK EVERY HAPPY FUTURE
AWAY FROM YOUR MAMA.

243
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,916
NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO TAKE EVERYTHING AWAY,

244
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,916
FROM YOUR FUTURE, EUREKA.

245
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,416
RENTON, YOU HAVE BEEN POSSESSED

246
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,791
BY A HORRIBLE AND
DANGEROUS MONSTER.

247
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,583
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.
MAMA WILL SAVE YOU.

248
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,916
AND WE'LL ALL GO TOGETHER TO
WHERE CHARLES IS WAITING FOR US!

249
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:35,875
- HOLD ON TIGHT!

250
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,833
- ( grunts )

251
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,250
- ( screaming )

252
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,291
- ( groans in pain )

253
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,708
- ( screaming ) NO!

254
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,166
- HOLLAND!

255
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,541
- WHERE...
WHERE IS IT?

256
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,583
- Charles: THE OPERATION WAS
A SUCCESS, SO THEY SAY

257
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,791
THAT IS, EVERYTHING BESIDES
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF

258
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,791
TECHNICAL CAPTAIN,
ADROC THURSTON

259
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,125
AND THE SEVEN SWELL EFFECT,

260
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,583
THAT RESULTED FROM
THE COMBINATION OF

261
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,125
THE TYPE ZERO AND
THE AMITA DRIVE.

262
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,291
THAT LIGHT MAY HAVE
BEEN THE THING

263
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,291
THAT ROBBED US OF OUR
FAMILY AND FUTURE.

264
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,541
BUT, IF I'M WITH YOU, RAY

265
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,041
I THINK I CAN FORESEE
A DIFFERENT KIND OF FUTURE.

266
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,166
LET'S ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.

267
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,666
RAY.

268
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,000
- ( groaning )

269
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,041
( grunting )

270
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,791
- Talho: HOLLAND! HOLLAND!
HOLLAND, NO!

271
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,041
- Mischa: HE NEEDS
A BLOOD TRANSFUSION.

272
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,791
HURRY, GET RENTON IN HERE!

273
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,666
- RENTON? WHY?

274
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,583
- HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN
PROVIDE US WITH BLOOD

275
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,916
THAT'S THE RIGHT TYPE TO
BE SAFE TO USE WITH HIM.

276
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,041
- YOU CAN'T!

277
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,625
HE'S GOT...

278
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,666
HE'S GOT THE SAME BLOOD AS HER
RUNNING THROUGH HIS BODY.

279
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,750
- TALHO, YOU HAVE TO SAVE HIM.

280
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,083
OKAY? YOU SAID THAT WE'D
HAVE TO WING IT, IF IT CAME UP?

281
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,333
- RENTON.

282
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,125
I KNOW YOU HAVE ISSUES
WITH HOLLAND

283
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,583
BECAUSE HE TREATED YOU BADLY

284
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,958
AND BECAUSE HE KILLED
CHARLES AND RAY.

285
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,625
BUT PLEASE...
PLEASE, RENTON...

286
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,833
YOU'VE GOT TO SAVE HIM!

287
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:13,916
- RENTON.

288
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,541
- EVERYONE'S SO SELFISH.

289
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,208
THEY ALL SAY
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO SAY.

290
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,375
AND NOBODY EVER
TELLS ME THE TRUTH.

291
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,166
THEY'RE JUST SELFISH.

292
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,083
IF YOU TALK TO ME,
I CAN BE OF HELP.

293
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,958
IF YOU TALK TO ME,
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU.

294
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,708
BUT IN THE END,
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

295
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,708
AND I'M NOT ABLE TO ACT
FOR ANYONE'S SAKE.

296
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,916
BESIDES, EVEN IF I DID
SOMETHING, I JUST...

297
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,500
- Eureka: IT'S ALL RIGHT.

298
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,000
YOU SEE, I BELIEVE
IN YOU, RENTON.

299
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,791
I BELIEVE IN YOU WITH ALL MY
HEART NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

300
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,500
SO PLEASE, RENTON.

301
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,375
TALK TO ME ABOUT EVERYTHING.

302
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,916
I WANT TO KNOW,
ALL THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOU

303
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,500
- ME TOO.

304
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,375
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU, EUREKA.

305
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,291
I WANT TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT YOUR LIFE!

306
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,041
- Both: TO BE CONTINUED.
