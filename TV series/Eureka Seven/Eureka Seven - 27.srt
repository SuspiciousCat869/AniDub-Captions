1
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

2
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,916
- ♪ I WANNA FLY AWAY! ♪

3
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:30,458
♪ I CAN FLY AWAY! ♪

4
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:34,291
♪ I CAN FLY AWAY! ♪

5
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,166
- I KNOW I'D BEEN LOOKING
AT HER ALL THIS TIME.

6
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,958
AND I'D BEEN THINKING
ABOUT HER ALL THIS TIME.

7
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,500
BUT I THINK THAT WAS
THE FIRST TIME

8
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,083
THAT I TOOK A GOOD,
HARD LOOK AT EUREKA.

9
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:03,041
MAYBE I HAD BEFORE, AND JUST
DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE IT OR

10
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,708
DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT IT TO MYSELF.

11
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,375
MAYBE IT WAS ALL BECAUSE
I DIDN'T REALIZE ANYTHING,

12
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,250
UNTIL EUREKA GOT BEAT UP.

13
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,708
EUREKA...

14
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,541
WHAT WAITED FOR US ONCE WE
GOT BACK TO THE GEKKO,

15
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,708
WAS A TRIP TO THE
DETENTION CELL.

16
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,041
THE LEADER OF GEKKOSTATE WAS

17
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,250
PUNISHING US
FOR ABANDONING SHIP.

18
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,333
STRIKING OUT
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

19
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,708
BUT WHY DID HE PUT THE KIDS
WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO

20
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,541
WITH ALL OF THIS
IN HERE WITH US?

21
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,916
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,708
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS HOLLAND THINKING?

23
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,250
- ( door unlocking )

24
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,791
- SORRY I'M LATE. THERE WERE
THINGS I HAD TO PREPARE

25
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,791
OTHER THAN THE MEALS
FOR THE FIVE OF YOU.

26
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MOONDOGGIE?

27
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,083
- Moondoggie: I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

28
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,916
LIVE OFF THIS FOR A WHILE.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,666
AND MAKE SURE EVERYONE
WEARS ONE OF THESE.

30
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,041
I MADE SURE THERE WAS ONE
FOR EACH OF YOU.

31
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,125
- BUT, BROTHER DOGGIE,
THESE ARE...

32
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,583
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
BULLETPROOF VESTS.

33
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,541
THERE'S ALSO GAS MASKS
IN THERE. READ THE USER MANUAL.

34
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,625
- WAIT, BROTHER DOGGIE!
WHAT'S GOING ON!

35
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,625
- OH, YEAH. LEADER SAID THAT
YOU SHOULD HOLD ON TO THIS.

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,041
EUREKA KNOWS HOW TO USE IT.

37
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,375
- BROTHER...

38
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,541
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON MYSELF.

39
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,500
EVERYONE'S IN A
REALLY UPTIGHT MOOD.

40
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,541
IN ANY CASE, YOU GUYS
SHOULD JUST EAT AND SLEEP.

41
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,333
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, WE'LL
COME DOWN AND LET YOU KNOW.

42
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,500
FOR NOW, JUST STAY AT
EUREKA'S SIDE.

43
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,416
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WERE GONE,
EUREKA WAS REALLY LONELY.

44
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,625
- ENEMY SCOUTING COMPLETE.
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE.

45
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,958
IT LOOKS LIKE THE STATE ARMY
ISN'T PURSUING US.

46
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,208
- SEEMS LIKE EACH TIME
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS

47
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,458
WE'RE SAVED BY A
STATE ARMY MISTAKE.

48
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,708
- AND THE TWO
RIDING THE NIRVASH.

49
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,125
- WHERE'S HOLLAND?

50
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,125
- WE SHOULD PROTECT
THOSE TWO WITH OUR LIVES

51
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,833
FROM THIS HORRIBLE
BLOODSTAINED WORLD.

52
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,625
- CAN YOU PUT THAT
ASIDE, PLEASE?

53
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,250
IT'S GETTING IN THE WAY
OF MY CHECKUP.

54
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,208
- OKAY.

55
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,375
SO FULL OF STORIES
THAT DRAG ME DOWN.

56
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,833
BECAUSE OF THE GROWING FREQUENCY

57
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,625
OF LARGE TECTONIC SHIFTS
ALL OVER THE WORLD,

58
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,791
THE HOPES FOR SOMETHING
TO REPLACE THE CURRENT REGIME

59
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,208
IS GETTING STRONGER.

60
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,625
- YEAH, AND THE WAY
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN

61
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,791
TRYING TO MANAGE
THE RURAL AREAS IN ONE WAY

62
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,708
AND THE CENTRAL AREAS
IN ANOTHER IS MESSED UP.

63
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,208
- AT TIMES LIKE THIS, THE
MASSES LONG FOR A LEADER

64
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,375
WITH A STRONG WILL
AND A FIRM HAND

65
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,583
SOMEONE WHO CAN BE THEIR HERO.

66
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,916
- A HERO? LIKE WHO?

67
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,833
- WELL, HOW ABOUT HOLLAND?

68
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,750
- KIND OF SEEMS WRONG.
- YEAH, JUST DOESN'T RING TRUE.

69
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,541
- CHARLES BEAMS. DEWEY NOVAC.

70
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,500
ADROC THURSTON.

71
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,208
- IT'S BEEN ABOUT
60 YEARS SINCE THE TOWERS

72
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,083
STARTED TO GOVERN THEMSELVES.

73
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,041
NOW EVERY FESTERING WOUND
THAT HAS PILED UP

74
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,958
OVER THE YEARS IS SPEWING OUT.

75
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,541
- MMM, THEY ALL WANT
SOMETHING TO BREAK THROUGH

76
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,250
THE FEELING OF BEING CLOSED IN.

77
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,000
A REFLECTION OF
THE TIMES, I GUESS?

78
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,250
- SOMETHING THAT CAN BE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

79
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,041
- THEY INVENT
A HIDDEN ENEMY TO BLAME

80
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,666
AND USE IT TO FOOL
THE EYES OF THE MASSES.

81
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,916
- THE VODARAC. AND THE CORALIAN.

82
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,708
- WE FEAR WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.

83
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,625
THE FOUNDATIONS OF THAT
HAVE ALREADY BEEN WOVEN IN,

84
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,875
TO THE FABRIC OF THIS WORLD.

85
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,541
- I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL
THAT TIGHT PINCH

86
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,291
IN THE BOTTOM
OF MY STOMACH.

87
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,041
I HAVEN'T HAD
THIS FEELING IN A WHILE.

88
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,666
"THE TENSION
ONE FEELS BEFORE DEATH

89
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,833
IS THE FEELING OF BEING ALIVE."

90
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,125
THAT'S FROM AN INTERVIEW
DONE RIGHT BEFORE THE FINALS

91
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,125
OF THE 67TH INTERNATIONAL
LIFT COMPETITION.

92
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,625
- "YOU HAVE TO PUSH THINGS TO
THE LIMIT IF YOU WANT YOUR LIFE

93
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,750
"TO GLIMMER BRIGHT
LIKE A SHOOTING STAR."

94
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,375
THE FORMER SQUADRON LEADERS
OF THE SOF FACE OFF.

95
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,250
A PERFECT WAY TO SETTLE
THE FINAL SCORE.

96
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,083
IT'S A LITTLE BELATED,
BUT I'D LIKE TO THANK DEWEY,

97
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,125
FOR SETTING ALL THIS UP.

98
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,916
- I'VE TURNED MY EYES AWAY
AS MUCH AS I COULD TURN THEM.

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,416
I'VE RUN AWAY AS MUCH AS
I COULD.

100
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,375
BUT IN THE END...

101
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,083
THIS IS THE ONLY THING
LEFT FOR ME.

102
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,541
- HMM.

103
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,250
THEY'RE LEAKING INFORMATION
CONCERNING THE CORALION.

104
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,875
WE'VE GOTTEN INTO A
FULL-ON INTELLIGENCE BATTLE.

105
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,375
IS IT ABOUT TIME
WE CALL IT QUITS FOR RAY OUT?

106
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,875
- LOOKS LIKE IT.
THIS ISN'T THE KIND OF MEDIA

107
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,708
THAT WE CAN COUNTER WITH
A LITTLE SELF-PUBLISHED RAG.

108
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,833
- I THOUGHT WE'D BE ABLE TO
PLAY AROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE.

109
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,875
- YOU KNOW, THE TIME HAS PASSED
FOR YOU TO BE FOOLING AROUND!

110
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,541
- THAT MAY BE.

111
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,958
BUT EVEN WITHOUT RAY OUT,

112
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,833
I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO
DOCUMENT ALL OF YOUR ACTIONS.

113
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,750
SORRY, HAP, BUT THAT'S
THE LINE I'VE DRAWN FOR MYSELF

114
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,000
FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T ENGAGE
IN VIOLENT BATTLES.

115
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,041
- DO AS YOU LIKE, BUT I WON'T
GUARANTEE YOUR SURVIVAL.

116
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,833
- WELL, THAT'S THE PLAN FOR NOW.

117
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,583
I'LL DECIDE LATER
WHEN THE TIME FOR ME

118
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,166
TO PULL OUT HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

119
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,208
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

120
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,791
ONE LAST CONFIRMATION.
'CAUSE THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

121
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,291
YOU REALLY HAVE
NO OBLIGATION TO DO THIS.

122
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,166
- YEAH, WELL,
HOW ABOUT YOU, RAY?

123
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,000
NO BACKUP, SOME MISSION
THAT THE TWO OF US

124
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,708
ARE DOING ON OUR OWN.

125
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,791
IT'S SO RECKLESS.
WHY ARE YOU TAGGING ALONG

126
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,666
WITH NO ATTEMPTS
TO STOP ME?

127
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,583
- IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH DEWEY OR HOLLAND.

128
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,125
I'M HERE BECAUSE OF THAT BOY.

129
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,833
- YOU MEAN, RENTON, RIGHT?

130
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,541
WHAT'RE PLANNING TO DO?
ADOPT HIM AS YOUR SON?

131
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,458
- HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING YET.
THERE'S STILL TIME.

132
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,458
WE CAN'T LET THAT
MONSTER HAVE HIM!

133
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,875
- RAY, WHAT'S REGULATION
NUMBER SEVEN OF THE SOF?

134
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,166
DO YOU REMEMBER?

135
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,416
- "DON'T HESITATE TO THINK
OF THE IMPOSSIBLE."

136
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,875
- IT'S RATHER NOSTALGIC,
ISN'T IT?

137
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,750
- WORST CASE SCENARIO,
I'LL TAKE BOTH OF THEM DOWN.

138
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,208
BEFORE ANY MORE WOMEN LIKE ME

139
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,375
ARE BROUGHT OUT
INTO THIS AWFUL WORLD.

140
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,333
REMEMBER REGULATION NUMBER FIVE?

141
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,750
- WAIT, WHAT WAS IT?

142
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,208
- "LEAVE BEHIND NO TRACE
OF YOUR PRESENCE." RIGHT?

143
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,833
- I'M COUNTIN' ON YA, PARTNER.

144
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,916
- ROGER THAT, COMMANDER.

145
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,125
- Gidget: BUT STILL,
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS

146
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,125
WHY THINGS ENDED UP
COMPLICATED ALL OF A SUDDEN.

147
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,041
HEY, JOBS, ARE YOU LISTENING?

148
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,375
- YES.
- WELL?

149
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,375
- I'M SORRY, I WAS LOST
IN THOUGHT.

150
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,083
BUT HOW I SEE IT
IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

151
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,583
IN THE FIRST PLACE, THIS WORLD
HAS OPENLY SHOWN

152
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,291
ALL ITS COMPLEXITY.

153
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,083
HOWEVER, EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENING NOW

154
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,833
IS THE RESULT OF
SOMEONE MAKING US

155
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,708
PRETEND AS THOUGH WE SAW
NONE OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY SAW.

156
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,625
WHAT YOU REFER TO AS
ALL THE "COMPLICATED THINGS."

157
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,958
- OH, I GET IT NOW THAT
YOU PUT IT THAT WAY.

158
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,708
EVERYONE COULD GET TIRED
OF SHOWING EFFORT.

159
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:58,166
- (chuckles) HOWEVER,
THERE ARE SITUATIONS

160
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,750
THAT WON'T ALLOW FOR THAT.

161
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,500
AND TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY
THE TAB

162
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,458
THAT YOU'RE RUN UP. YOU SEE.

163
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,666
- THAT'S KIND OF SCARY.

164
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,458
- YOU GUYS SHOULDN'T
BE BLABBING ABOUT THIS.

165
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,625
THERE'S WORK TO DO.

166
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,708
- HEY, DON'T SNEAK UP
ON ME LIKE THAT!

167
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,000
I ASKED DOGGIE ABOUT EUREKA
AND EVERYTHING ELSE,

168
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,000
BUT ALL HE SAYS IS THAT
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

169
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,541
- WHAT ABOUT THE
SECURITY CHECKS?

170
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,833
- THEY'RE ALL DONE!

171
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,625
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
AND GET SOME REST.

172
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,458
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO SLEEP LATELY.

173
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,833
- THEN JUST WAIT
IN YOUR QUARTERS.

174
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,291
DOGGIE SHOULD DO THAT TOO.

175
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,125
YOU REST WHENEVER
YOU'RE ABLE TO, OKAY?

176
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,791
- OKAY.
- BYE, JOBS. SEE YOU LATER.

177
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,583
- GOOD NIGHT, GIDGET.
SWEET DREAMS.

178
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,375
- Holland: Status?

179
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,708
- ON BOARD CHECK IS COMPLETE.

180
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,208
HEY, HOLLAND.

181
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,208
YOU KNOW, IF NOTHING HAPPENS

182
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,875
AFTER ALL OF THIS
I'M CRACKING UP.

183
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,041
- COME ON, DIDN'T WORKING IN
INTELLIGENCE TEACH YOU ANYTHING?

184
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,625
IF I WERE HIM,
I'D RUSH IN WITHOUT MERCY.

185
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,875
EVEN IF I HAD TO DO IT ALONE.

186
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,666
IT'S WHAT THE SOF WAS ALL ABOUT.

187
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,291
- IT'S TIME.

188
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,083
- WE'VE CONFIRMED
A SMALL COMPAC RESPONSE

189
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,666
BEYOND THE CLOUD
AHEAD TO PORT.

190
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,958
- THERE'S A SHIP THERE!
- KEN-GOH!

191
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,333
- ATTEMPTING TO LOCK
ON TO TARGET.

192
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,333
- THERE'S NO TIME!
- EVASIVE MANEUVER!

193
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,083
(screaming)

194
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,166
- WE GOT A HULL BREACH!
DAMAGE UNKNOWN!

195
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,000
ENGAGE ALL EMERGENCY HATCHES.

196
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,541
- THE SEVENTH
UPPER HATCH IS BLOWN OUT.

197
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,875
- AN INTRUDER?

198
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,333
- INTRUDER ALERT! PREPARE
FOR HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT!

199
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,958
RENTON! EUREKA!

200
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,416
PUT ON THE EMERGENCY MASKS! MAKE
SURE THE KIDS PUT THEM ON TOO!

201
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,916
AND STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,875
- WHAT IN THE WORLD'S
GOING ON OUT THERE.

203
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,416
- Hap: A KAMIKAZE ATTACK?
- Talho: NO, I'M SURE IT WASN'T.

204
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,125
- Ken-Goh: YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY PRETENDED TO BLOW UP

205
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,458
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GEKKO
AND SCATTERED SOME EXPLOSIVES

206
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,541
THEY HAD PREPARED.

207
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,583
USING THE CHAOS
OF THE EXPLOSIONS

208
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,500
THEY BLEW AWAY THE HATCH
AND ENTERED THE GEKKO.

209
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,000
THEY WERE ALREADY ON THE SHIP'S
HULL BEFORE IT ALL STARTED.

210
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,416
A CALCULATED MOVE
TO BREACH OUR SECURITY.

211
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,625
- REGARDLESS,
THINGS ARE TURNING OUT

212
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,166
JUST LIKE HOLLAND SAID.
JOBS, REPORT.

213
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,291
- CONFIRMING ALL COMMAND
AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS

214
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,083
HAVE BEEN SHIFTED
TO THE SUB-BRIDGE.

215
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,250
- Hap: ARE YOU
CHANGING THE CODES

216
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,625
FOR THE CRACKING
TRAP EVERY SECOND?

217
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,333
- YES. IF YOU'RE THAT WORRIED

218
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,708
CRAWL HERE THROUGH THE DUCTS
AND DO IT YOURSELF.

219
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,291
THE INTRUDERS HAVE ENTERED
ENGINE CONTROL!

220
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,875
HERE THEY COME...

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,416
- IT'S EMPTY.
AND THE POWER'S ALL OUT HERE.

222
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,666
I SEE. HE FIGURED OUT
WE WERE COMING.

223
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,416
A VERY GOOD CALL, HOLLAND!

224
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,583
BUT THIS IS ALL
JUST THE BEGINNING!

225
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,083
THIS IS A PARTY
THROWN BY THE LEADER

226
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,000
OF THE SOF FIRST SQUADRON.

227
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,583
I'LL BE SURE TO HAVE
A REAL GOOD TIME!

228
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,041
- ISN'T THAT...
- THE INFAMOUS

229
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,041
- CHARLES BEAMS. JOBS!

230
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,041
AFTER YOU CONFIRM CLOSURE
OF THE DUCT VALVES,

231
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,916
ARM THE ANTI-PERSONNEL LASERS
WE SET UP ALL AROUND THE SHIP.

232
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,541
RAY WILL BE COMING.

233
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,916
- ANTI-PERSONNEL LASERS.

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,083
HOLLAND'S VERY GOOD.
HE ANTICIPATED EVERYTHING.

235
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,000
- Renton: EUREKA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

236
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,083
- Eureka: I'M FINE, RENTON.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

237
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,208
- I'M...

238
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,000
- UNEASY?
- OF COURSE.

239
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,416
- WELL, I'M NOT.
- HMM?

240
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,083
- BECAUSE I'M HERE TOGETHER
WITH YOU, RENTON.

241
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,083
I FEEL LIKE I CAN OVERCOME
ANYTHING THAT COMES AT ME

242
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,958
AS LONG AS I'M
TOGETHER WITH YOU.

243
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,500
- WHERE ARE THEY?

244
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,583
- THE ANTI-PERSONNEL LASERS

245
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,583
ON THE BRIDGE
APPROACH JUST FIRED.

246
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,583
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE SPLIT
INTO TWO FORCES.

247
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,250
- AND WHERE'S HOLLAND?

248
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,916
HE SEVERED COMMUNICATION
RIGHT AFTER HE CALLED HERE

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,125
FROM THE HANGAR SIX MINUTES AGO.

250
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,375
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

251
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,083
THERE ARE STILL
NO SIGNS OF BATTLE.

252
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,500
- Hap: AND TALHO?

253
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,375
- SHE'S CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH
CENTRAL DUCT NUMBER TWO.

254
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,916
IN THREE MINUTES,
SHE SHOULD REACH WHERE

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
RENTON, EUREKA
AND THE KIDS ARE.

256
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,583
- EVERYTHING IS GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

257
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,458
- Ray: THE OS HASN'T BEEN
REWRITTEN AFTER ALL.

258
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,083
VERSION 10 IS SAME
AS ON THE SWAN.

259
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,291
LOOKS LIKE HOLLAND IS
HAVING A TOUGH TIME.

260
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,166
BUT THAT FACT WILL
TURN OUT TO BE FATAL

261
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,125
FOR HIM BEFORE WE'RE THROUGH.

262
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,875
- ( all gasping )

263
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,000
- WHAT'S HAPPENING

264
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,791
- WAIT, I'LL GET THINGS BACK UP.

265
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,625
I CAN' BELIEVE THAT A TRAP
THAT'S CHANGING SECOND BY SECOND

266
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,875
CAN BE BROKEN
THROUGH SO EASILY.

267
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,916
WE'RE UP AGAINST SOMEONE
AS SKILLED AS THE WIZARDS.

268
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,666
- IT'S GOT TO BE RAY.

269
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,416
- SHUTTING DOWN ALL POWER OTHER
THAN WHAT'S NEEDED FOR FLIGHT.

270
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,166
I'D EXPECT NOTHING LESS
FROM MY PARTNER.

271
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,166
HEY, HOLLAND! WHERE ARE YOU?

272
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,500
WHY DON'T YOU QUIT HIDING
AND COME OUT HERE?

273
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,875
THAT'S PRETTY POOR SHOOTING
FOR HOLLAND.

274
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,875
SKILLS COULDN'T HAVE
GONE DOWN, COULD THEY?

275
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:43,208
I SEE. SO THAT'S WHERE OUR
LITTLE SHOWDOWN WILL TAKE PLACE.

276
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,416
( grunts )

277
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,166
HE DOESN'T SHOW UP ON
THE NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES?

278
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,166
OPTICAL CAMOUFLAGE?
NO, STEALTH PAINT?

279
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,958
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

280
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,916
OH, I SEE. SO THAT'S WHAT
IT REALLY MEANT AFTER ALL.

281
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,916
HOLLAND.

282
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,750
- JUST AS I THOUGHT.
PERCEPTION IS EVERYTHING.

283
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,875
I'M TOTALLY INVISIBLE TO HIM.

284
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,250
I'M STARTING TO BE REMINDED
WHAT THIS SMELL IS ABOUT.

285
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,250
- MISS TALHO.
- IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT?

286
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,791
WE'VE GOT TO HEAD TOWARDS
THE SUB-BRIDGE

287
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,250
VIA THE DUCTS RIGHT AWAY.

288
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,250
- MISS TALHO, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I'LL EXPLAIN LATER!

289
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,666
THE ENEMY'S INFILTRATED
THE GEKKO! SOON, THIS AREA...

290
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,833
- ( gun clicks )

291
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:48,958
- DON'T MOVE

292
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,583
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, RAY.

293
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,041
- TALHO YUKI FROM
INTELLIGENCE, HUH?

294
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,375
THE OFFICE-WORKING SPY
WHO WAS DATING HER BOSS

295
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,041
AND THEN GOT DEMOTED.

296
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,708
NOW, ALL OF YOU INSIDE,
RAISE YOUR HANDS AND COME OUT.

297
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,500
- MISS RAY!

298
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,250
- SO, YOU WERE ABLE TO
KEEP YOUR PROMISE.

299
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,625
WHY ARE THEIR KIDS HERE?

300
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,458
- MAMA...
- MAMA?

301
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,875
( gasps )

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,083
MAMA? HOW COULD THAT BE?

303
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,541
- ( grunts )

304
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,958
- TALHO, YOU TRY ANYTHING AND
I'LL KILL YOUR DEAR PRINCESS.

305
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,208
- STOP IT, MISS RAY!

306
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,625
- RENTON, PLEASE!
DROP THE GUN NOW!

307
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,750
- I DON'T WANT TO!
I WON'T DO IT!

308
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,791
- LISTEN, RENTON, YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

309
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,125
ABOUT WHO THEY CALL MAMA.

310
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,958
WHO THAT GIRL SITTING
THERE REALLY IS!

311
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,875
- MISS RAY!

312
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,708
I, UH, I MEAN IT. LET US GO.

313
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,666
PLEASE, MISS RAY! STOP IT.

314
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,541
- HEY, CONTROLS ARE BACK UP!

315
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,833
- ( screams )

316
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,375
- THEY GOT CONTROL BACK.

317
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,833
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A GOOD CREW.

318
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:11,916
- Holland: CHARLES!

319
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,916
IT'S MOVING ALL BY ITSELF!
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

320
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,000
- BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

321
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,916
- QUICK, CHECK THE DATA!
- ALL RIGHT.

322
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,125
- WHY DID IT START MOVING?

323
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,875
WHAT THE HELL
IS IT RESPONDING TO?

324
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,208
- IT'S OVER, RAY?

325
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,000
YOU REALIZE THAT IT'S USELESS
TO RESIST, RIGHT?

326
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,166
SO JUST STAY QUIET,
AND I WON'T HURT YOU.

327
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,458
( over p.a ) HOLLAND!
WE'VE CAPTURED RAY!

328
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,750
- ( screaming )

329
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,708
- ( panting )

330
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,708
- CHARLES.
- Charles: I'M REAL TOUCHED!

331
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,708
YOUR SOFT HEART IS THE REASON
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA WIN.

332
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,250
YOU SHOULD HAVE
ALREADY REALIZED IT.

333
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,916
I KNEW IT FROM THE MOMENT
THAT I MET HIM.

334
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,875
THE ONE WHO INHERITED
THE QUALIFICATIONS

335
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,750
TO BE THE KING AND WILL
INHERIT THE GOLDEN BOUGH

336
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,083
LEFT BEHIND BY THE LAST KING.

337
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,541
OLD FRIEND, IT'S TRULY A PITY
THAT IT WASN'T YOU.

338
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,750
- ( gun fires )

339
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,416
- ( gasping )

340
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,791
- HOLLAND!

341
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,750
- A FEW MINUTES AGO, I ENDED
THE LIFE OF CHARLES BEAMS.

342
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,583
- ( gasps )

343
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,916
- I SEE.

344
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,666
COULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HIM.

345
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,125
I WON'T ACCEPT IT.
HER, A MOTHER?

346
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,416
I WILL NEVER ACCEPT IT.

347
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,000
- A BODY THAT WAS ALIVE
UNTIL MOMENTS AGO.

348
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,000
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

349
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,916
THE FIRST CORPSE
OF SOMEONE I KNEW.

350
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,291
THAT WAS CHARLES.

351
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,375
BUT I COULDN'T ACCEPT THE DEATH
THAT WAS THERE BEFORE MY EYES.

352
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,458
OR FEEL ANYTHING
ABOUT IT IN MY HEART.

353
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,166
- RAY, I'M REALLY SORRY,

354
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,583
BUT I CAN'T LEAVE
THE TWO OF YOU ALONE.

355
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,708
- I CAN AT LEAST KISS HIM
GOODBYE, RIGHT?

356
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,083
- ALL RIGHT.

357
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,750
- RENTON! MAKE SURE YOU WATCH!

358
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,750
IT'S THE END OF THE FORMER SOF!

359
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,083
THE END FOR THOSE
WITH SINS IN THEIR HEARTS!

360
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,208
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE
WHO HAVE WON THEIR FREEDOM!

361
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,333
OH, CHARLES, HAVE YOU
HAD ENOUGH?

362
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,083
( crying )

363
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,833
THANK YOU, CHARLES.
I LOVE YOU.

364
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,750
- OH, NO. TALHO!

365
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,458
RENTON! GET DOWN!

366
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,208
- MISS RAY?

367
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,875
RAY HAD SET A TIME-BOMB
INSIDE OF CHARLES' CORPSE

368
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,583
AND THEN ESCAPED FROM THE GEKKO

369
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,166
CATCHING US ALL OFF GUARD
WITH THE EXPLOSION.

370
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,625
AT THAT MOMENT,
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

371
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:22,000
WHY RAY WOULD DO SUCH A THING.

372
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,833
AND EVEN WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER

373
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,375
HOLLAND NEVER EXPLAINED
TO ME WHAT IT MEANT.

374
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,708
BUT I WAS, AT THE TIME,

375
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,333
RELIEVED THAT RAY
WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE.

376
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,333
I'D NOT YET FULLY REALIZED

377
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,375
THAT THIS BATTLE WAS
FAR FROM TRULY OVER.

378
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,166
- Both: TO BE CONTINUED.

00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,083
AND A MAN PROTECTING THE FUTURE.
