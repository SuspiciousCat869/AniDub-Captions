1
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:17,083
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,583
- Mischa: ALL RIGHT.

4
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,833
NEXT I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME THE
UNBALANCED FEEDBACK RESPONSE.

5
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,541
I'LL LEAVE THE PROGRAM
UP TO YOU.

6
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,416
FOR NOW, MANEUVER
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO

7
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,958
UNTIL YOU REACH YOUR LIMITS.

8
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,583
- Eureka: ROGER.

9
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,500
- Renton: THE DATA IS RECORDED
ON A SEPARATE TRACK?

10
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,458
- Mischa: I DON'T MIND
IF YOU HAVEN'T CONNECTED.

11
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,541
JUST KEEP ENTERING THE CODES.

12
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,208
- ALL RIGHT.
- ( scanning sounds )

13
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,500
- Eureka: I'LL START WITH A
ROLL-IN INTO A CURVING TURN.

14
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,500
IF I DON'T LOSE SPEED, I'LL GO
ON FROM THERE INTO AN AERIAL.

15
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,833
- VERY GOOD, EUREKA.
THANKS.

16
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,291
- RIGHT, HERE GOES.

17
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,666
- WAIT A MINUTE!
THE CODES AREN'T-- AH!

18
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,083
AHHH!

19
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,333
AHHHH!

20
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,875
- Mischa: I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT IT,

21
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,000
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD BE SO OBVIOUS.

22
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,708
EUREKA'S CONDITION
HASN'T FULLY NORMALIZED YET.

23
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,458
THESE NUMBERS
COMING FROM THE typeZERO ARE--

24
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:04,083
IS THE AMITA DRIVE
REALLY SPEAKING TO THE typeZERO?

25
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,333
OR COULD IT BE--

26
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,250
- Renton: DR. MISCHA?
I'VE REACHED MY LIMIT.

27
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,083
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT IS IT?

28
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,250
ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE?
- Eureka: DOCTOR?

29
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,583
RENTON IS WIGGLING AROUND
IN HIS SEAT.

30
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,250
- WIGGLING?

31
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:19,458
- ( thinking )
SIS, I'M GONNA LET IT GO.

32
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,458
( vomiting )

33
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,916
- EW.
- ( Renton grunting )

34
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,125
- Renton:
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID IT AGAIN.

35
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,208
THE OTHER DAY I OVERTURNED
ALL THE BOXES IN THE WAREHOUSE.

36
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,583
YESTERDAY I ACCIDENTALLY
ERASED ALL THE DATA

37
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,416
ON MR. HAP'S COMPUTER.

38
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,416
AND TODAY--

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,291
AHHH!

40
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,000
OF ALL THE PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD,

41
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,041
WHY DID I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
SO GROSS IN FRONT OF HER?

42
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,208
I'M SURE SHE THINKS
I'M JUST A STUPID,

43
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,708
WORTHLESS GOOD-FOR-NOTHING.

44
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,333
( sighs )

45
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,875
- HE'S SLACKING AGAIN.

46
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,541
- WHAAA!  HEY, NO WAY,
I'M NOT SLACKING AT ALL!

47
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,666
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO GET STARTED.

48
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,208
- HEY, MAMA?
- WHAT IS IT?

49
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,125
- MAMA, WHO IS IT
YOU LIKE BETTER,

50
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,208
GUYS THAT THROW UP
OR GUYS THAT DON'T?

51
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,916
- ( bucket clanging )

52
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,166
- YEAH, MAMA, 'CAUSE SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T SMELL LIKE THROW UP

53
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,916
IS BETTER THAN SOMEONE
THAT DOES.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,500
- THAT'S TRUE. SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T SMELL IS BETTER.

55
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,583
- ( bucket clanging )

56
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,875
- YEAH.  WELL, YOU KNOW,
LISTEN, ABOUT THAT--

57
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,000
SEE, THE REASON
I THREW UP

58
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,333
IS I'M STILL NOT USED TO
RIDING IN THE L.F.O. JUST YET.

59
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,833
AND BESIDES, YOUR TIMING FOR THE
CUTBACKS AND OTHER MANEUVERS

60
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,125
IS KIND OF DIFFERENT
FROM THE TIMING I USE MYSELF.

61
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,875
SO I CAN'T QUITE GET IN SYNCH
WITH THE L.F.O.'s MOVEMENTS.

62
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:45,041
- IN OTHER WORDS, YOU JUST DON'T
GET ALONG WITH MAMA VERY WELL.

63
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,250
- IS THAT SO?

64
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,083
RENTON AND I AREN'T COMPATIBLE?

65
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,416
- NO, WAIT A MINUTE!

66
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,916
- OF COURSE IT IS, MAMA.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,625
IF HE GOT ALONG WITH YOU,
THERE'S NO WAY

68
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,708
THAT HE'D THROW UP
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

69
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:58,708
- HMM?  RENTON, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE DON'T GET ALONG VERY WELL.

70
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,625
- ( bucket clamoring )

71
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,625
- NOW HOLD ON!

72
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,291
WHETHER OR NOT WE GET ALONG
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

73
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,458
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES

74
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,375
I'VE EVER LIFTED IN AN L.F.O.

75
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,208
BESIDES THAT, EVERY PERSON
HAS THEIR OWN TIMING

76
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,583
FOR LIFTING MOVES.

77
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,083
AND IT'S NOT THAT EASY
TO SYNCH UP WITH THE RHYTHM

78
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,458
OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S TIMING.

79
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,083
RIGHT?!
ISN'T THAT TRUE?

80
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,208
- ISN'T THAT WHAT GETTING ALONG
IS ABOUT?

81
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,875
- ( grunting )

82
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,541
- Girl: MAMA, LET'S GO!

83
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,583
IF YOU STAY CLOSE
TO A THROW-UPPER,

84
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,583
YOU'LL BECOME
A THROW-UPPER TOO, MAMA.

85
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,416
- YEAH, LET'S GO, MAMA.
- MAMA, CAN WE EAT?

86
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
I'M HUNGRY.

87
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,500
- WHOEVER SAID
THAT YOUR FIRST LOVE

88
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,583
IS SWEET AS WELL AS SOUR

89
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,583
IS A BIG LIAR.

90
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,625
ALL IT IS IS BITTER.

91
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,750
- Talho: OH, IS THIS A TRIAL
THAT GOD HAS GIVEN ME

92
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,916
BECAUSE I FELL IN LOVE
WITH AN ANGEL?

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,125
THIS BIT OF DOWN
THAT FLOATS AWAY IF I CHASE IT

94
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,291
WEIGHS HEAVILY
UPON MY HEART.

95
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,583
- HUH?!

96
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,125
- AHA!

97
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,291
- MISS TALHO!  WAIT A MINUTE.
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE.

98
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,625
PLEASE, MISS TALHO!
- "IT'S JUST A BIG LIE!

99
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,875
ALL IT IS IS BITTER!"

100
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,000
( giggling )

101
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,500
- YOU'RE GONNA
TELL THEM, AREN'T YOU?

102
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,625
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL THEM
ABOUT MY SWEET LITTLE ROMANCE?

103
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,458
- ( laughing )

104
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,375
- YOU'RE GONNA USE IT
AS SOMETHING TO LAUGH ABOUT

105
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,916
WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING TONIGHT!

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,625
- ( laughing )

107
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,083
- MISS TALHO, PLEASE,
I'M BEGGING YOU!

108
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,083
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS TO THEM.

109
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,416
COME ON, I PROMISE
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY.

110
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,916
- OH?

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,625
SO YOU'RE GOING TO DO
ANYTHING I SAY?

112
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,125
- HUH?

113
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,291
- Holland: OTHER THAN THAT,

114
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,458
A LIFT TETHER AND
A COUPLING CARTRIDGE.

115
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,666
- 500.
OR MAYBE EVEN 550.

116
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,375
THAT'S IT FOR THE NIRVASH.

117
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,833
WHAT ABOUT EVERYDAY ITEMS?

118
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,916
- WE NEED FOOD,
MEDICINE AND GROCERIES.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,333
- 200 TOTAL.

120
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,000
- GIDGET'S REQUEST IS
FIVE DOZEN SPARE TOOTHBRUSHES.

121
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,083
- Talho: JOHN HENRY'S
REISSUED SILVER.

122
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,166
- DENIED.

123
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,666
- OH, COME ON.
WE MADE A LITTLE MONEY

124
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,708
FROM THE DELIVERY
TO STROHOLM, DIDN'T WE?

125
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,291
I NEED IT FOR THE PHOTO SHOOT
WE'RE DOING FOR "ray=out."

126
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,125
- THE PARTS FOR
THE NIRVASH ARE GOING TO

127
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,500
TAKE A BIG CHUNK OF IT.

128
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,333
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT
NEXT TIME WE MAKE SOME MONEY.

129
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,916
- BUT IT'S A LIMITED EDITION.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,833
I WANT THE SERIAL NUMBER
TO BE ONE DIGIT.

131
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,250
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

132
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,583
STUFF CONCERNING EUREKA
HAS TOP PRIORITY.

133
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,166
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

134
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

135
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,041
- I'M NOT DOING THIS
BECAUSE I WANT TO!

136
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,666
- YOUR FIRST LOVE...
- AH!

137
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,500
- ...IS SWEET AND YET SOUR.
- WHOA WHOA WHOA!

138
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,916
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,083
TALHO, YOU HEAD DOWN
IN MATTHIEU'S 606 WITH HILDA.

140
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,000
I'LL HEAD DOWN WITH EUREKA
IN THE NIRVASH.

141
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,541
- WAIT A MINUTE!
HOLLAND, I'D LIKE TO KNOW

142
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,000
WHY EUREKA HAS TO BE THE ONE
YOU GO DOWN THERE WITH!

143
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,208
- SINCE THEY'RE GOING TO TRY
AND FIND PARTS FOR THE NIRVASH,

144
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,208
HE'S GONNA NEED HER INPUT,
RIGHT?

145
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,208
- YEAH YEAH.

146
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,875
IT'S ALL ABOUT EUREKA.

147
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,958
COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, RENTON.

148
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,250
- WHAT?! WHY ME?

149
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,000
- WHO'S GONNA
HOLD ALL THE STUFF I GET

150
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,791
IF YOU DON'T COME WITH ME?

151
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,583
- ( laughs nervously )

152
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,875
( sighs )

153
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,750
- HMM.

154
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,333
- THE GEKKO SHOULD JUST HANG OUT
ON TOP OF THE LEY LINE

155
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,125
AND CIRCLE WHILE WE'RE GONE.
- HEY.

156
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,458
THINK WE SHOULD
LEAVE THEM ALONE?

157
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,833
- HMM?

158
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,166
I'M SURE RENTON WILL
FIGURE IT OUT SOONER OR LATER,

159
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,583
THAT THEY'RE JUST FOOLING AROUND
WITH HIM TO HAVE SOME FUN.

160
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,291
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

161
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,625
I MEAN TALHO.
- HMM?

162
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,833
- ( whirring )

163
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,375
- ( beeping )

164
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,250
- I THINK YOU KNOW BY NOW,

165
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,583
BUT DON'T TOUCH ANY OF
THE WEAPONS CONTROLS, OKAY?

166
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,041
- UH, YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

167
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,375
- COME ON,
SCOOT OVER A LITTLE MORE.

168
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,375
- THIS IS AS FAR
AS I CAN GET.

169
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,375
- I THINK YOU JUST WANT
TO PRESS YOURSELF UP AGAINST ME.

170
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,750
YOU ARE SO PERVERTED.
- HUH?  WHAT?  I AM NOT!

171
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,833
- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I'M NOT ATTRACTIVE?

172
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,166
- JEEZ.  I CAN'T WIN TODAY.

173
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,208
HOW ABOUT LETTING ME FLY,
MISS HILDA?

174
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,208
AFTER ALL,
YOU AND MISS TALHO GET ALONG,

175
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,875
AND YOU'RE BOTH
THE SAME GENDER.

176
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,125
- NO, THANKS, RENTON.
MATTHIEU WILL BE IN TEARS

177
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,125
IF SOMEONE THROWS UP
ON THE FRONT SEAT.

178
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,083
- ( grumbles )
- WAIT, HE'S ALREADY IN TEARS.

179
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,750
- HMM.

180
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,750
YOU SERIOUSLY WANT A BATTLE
REPORT ABOUT BELLFOREST?

181
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,791
I DON'T REMEMBER
THAT FAR BACK.

182
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,250
- 606 HEADING OUT.

183
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,666
- ( panting )

184
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,666
( grunting )

185
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,541
MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE.

186
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,041
- Hilda: I'LL GO GET THE TOILET
PAPER AND THE TOOTHBRUSHES.

187
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,291
- Talho: OKAY,
THEN I'LL JUST TAKE OUR

188
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,666
TRUSTY BAGGAGE HOLDER WITH ME.

189
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,875
- ( grunts )

190
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,875
OOH!

191
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,666
MISS HILDA!

192
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,625
- LET'S MEET BACK
AT THIS RESTAURANT

193
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,875
AFTER WE'RE DONE SHOPPING!

194
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,875
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

195
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,708
IT'S THE THIRD WEDNESDAY
OF THE MONTH,

196
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,291
AND THAT MEANS THAT MY FAVORITE
MARKET IS HAVING A SALE.

197
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,041
- I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S NOT EASY
TO GET AN INERTIA PUMP

198
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,875
THAT'S AS GOOD
AS THIS ONE HERE.

199
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,666
- WELL?
- NO GOOD.

200
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,208
THAT ONE HAS ALREADY DIED.

201
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,708
YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD.

202
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,041
NOW YOU CAN REST.

203
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,250
- YOU HEARD HER.
- HUH?

204
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,541
OH, MAN!
FIVE OR SIX BLADES ARE BUSTED.

205
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,083
SORRY, MAN.

206
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,708
BUT HOW THE HELL
DID YOU FIGURE THAT OUT?

207
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,916
DID THE PARTS TALK TO YOU?

208
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,250
- ( music playing )

209
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,416
- UH, MAYBE I SHOULD JUST WAIT
FOR YOU OUTSIDE?

210
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,708
- HEY, RENTON?
- YES?

211
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,291
- WHICH ONE IS BETTER?

212
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,458
- OH!  EITHER ONE IS FINE.
- ( laughs )

213
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,333
COME ON, WHICH ONE?

214
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,583
- WELL, I CAN'T REALLY SAY
IF ONE OR THE OTHER IS BETTER.

215
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,583
THEY BOTH LOOK
SO WONDERFUL. AND, UM--

216
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,166
- COME ON NOW,
LOOK OVER HERE.

217
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,916
- YES?  OH!
STOP IT!

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,750
- ( laughing )

219
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,708
EXCUSE ME?
I'D LIKE TO TRY THIS ON.

220
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,458
- Woman: GO RIGHT AHEAD.

221
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,166
- ( thinking )
IT'S TRUE THAT I WAS SO NERVOUS,

222
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,750
I THOUGHT MY HEART WAS GONNA
BURST OPEN RIGHT THERE.

223
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,166
BUT, SIS, THAT ISN'T
THE ONLY REASON

224
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,958
MY HEART IS RACING LIKE THIS.

225
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,083
YOU SEE,
THE EXPRESSION THAT

226
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,875
WAS ON MISS TALHO'S
FACE JUST NOW--

227
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,375
FOR SOME REASON, IT LOOKED
JUST LIKE YOUR FACE, SIS.

228
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,166
- LOOK, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS,

229
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,875
I CAN ALWAYS GO OUT
TO LOOK FOR

230
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,166
THE PARTS YOU NEED
ALL BY MYSELF NEXT TIME.

231
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,375
- NO, I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.
- HMM?

232
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,958
- THE LITTLE ONE--

233
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,250
I MEAN NIRVASH--
I WANT TO MAKE SURE

234
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,125
I TAKE PROPER CARE OF HIM.

235
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,083
- HMM.

236
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,833
- RENTON SAYS HE UNDERSTANDS.
- HOW MACHINES FEEL?

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,125
HA! WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.
HE IS THURSTON'S KID.

238
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,083
HUH?

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,083
HEY, I FORGOT SOMETHING.
SORRY.

240
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,208
- BUT WE'VE GOT
ALL THE PARTS WE NEED.

241
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,750
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

242
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,750
- ( all screaming )

243
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,416
- ( grunting )

244
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,333
- UM, MISS TALHO,

245
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,666
COULD YOU MAYBE THINK
ABOUT LETTING ME OFF THE HOOK?

246
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,375
- OH!

247
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,458
JOHN HENRY'S REISSUED SILVER,
WITH A ONE-DIGIT SERIAL NUMBER.

248
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,500
- BUT HOLLAND TOLD YOU
WE COULDN'T GET IT.

249
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,708
- I'M JUST LOOKING!

250
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,458
- ( sighs )

251
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,333
- Man: I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, MISS.

252
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,333
BUT THE LAST ONE OF THOSE
WE HAD IN STOCK

253
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,250
WAS JUST PURCHASED BY ANOTHER
CUSTOMER A FEW MINUTES AGO.

254
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,333
- OH.  OH, I SEE.

255
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,458
- I'M REALLY VERY SORRY.

256
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,000
- MISS TALHO,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

257
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,625
- ( sighs )

258
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,625
WE'RE GONNA
BUY SOMETHING HEAVY!

259
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,000
WE'RE GONNA PUSH YOUR MUSCLES

260
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,333
ALL THE WAY
TO THEIR LIMIT, RENTON.

261
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,791
- EEK!

262
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,541
- ( all shouting, clamoring )

263
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,750
- ( grunting )

264
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,416
- ( music blaring )

265
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,083
- Talho ( slurring ):
I CANNOT BELIEVE

266
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,750
THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN
LIFT ONE OR TWO REFRIGERATORS.

267
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,416
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
- MISS TALHO?

268
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,041
ARE YOU HAVING A LOT OF FUN
HARASSING ME?

269
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,416
- ( laughing )

270
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,208
OH, I'M NOT HARASSING YOU,
RENTON,

271
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,875
JUST MAKING FUN OF YOU.

272
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,583
- ARE YOU ENJOYING
MAKING FUN OF ME?

273
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,916
- I DO NOT ENJOY IT AT ALL!

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,166
BUT IT IS AMUSING.

275
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,583
- YOU THINK IT'S AMUSING

276
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,250
MAKING FUN
OF SOMEBODY LIKE ME?

277
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,083
- IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

278
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,041
HOLLAND AND THE OTHER GUYS,
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.

279
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,375
RENTON, YOU PROMISED
THAT YOU WOULD DO ANYTHING

280
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,958
THAT I TOLD YOU TO, RIGHT?

281
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,500
THAT'S WHY...

282
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:16,000
- BUT I LIKE EUREKA.

283
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,166
WELL, I SUPPOSE
THAT EVEN SOMETHING LIKE LOVE

284
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,791
NEEDS SOME SORT OF A LESSON.

285
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,458
SO PLEASE JUST BE GENTLE
WITH ME, OKAY?

286
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,750
( grunting )

287
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,041
THAT HURTS.

288
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,041
- ( laughing )
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

289
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,791
DID YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
I WAS GONNA KISS YOU?

290
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,458
ANYWAY, A KID LIKE YOU

291
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,750
WHOSE HAIR
HASN'T EVEN ALL GROWN IN

292
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,291
HAS NO BUSINESS
TALKING ABOUT LOVE.

293
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,000
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAIR YOU MEAN,

294
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,458
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW IT MATTERS.

295
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,458
- I'M TALKING
ABOUT HAIR DOWN THERE!

296
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,250
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS

297
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,458
WHO I FALL IN LOVE WITH
OR ANYTHING ELSE, MISS TALHO.

298
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,666
- YES, IT IS MY BUSINESS,

299
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,958
EVEN IF IT ISN'T YOURS,

300
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,750
EVEN IF YOUR HAIR
HASN'T ALL GROWN IN.

301
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,291
- HMM?

302
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,125
- WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
COME ABOARD THE GEKKO?

303
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,333
I MEAN, YOU'RE...

304
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,583
HOLLAND...

305
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,333
- HMM?  MISS TALHO?

306
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,041
HEY?

307
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,875
- ( music blaring )

308
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,666
- ( music continuing )
- HEY, YOU PUNKS!

309
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,250
ALL THAT NOISE
IS REALLY PISSING ME OFF.

310
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,708
- HUH?
- HEY, ISN'T THAT TALHO?

311
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,666
- THAT CHICK IN ""ray=out"?
REALLY?

312
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,041
- MAN, DID WE TOTALLY LUCK OUT
OR WHAT?

313
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,416
- HUH? YOU THERE--YOU JUST
TOOK A PICTURE, DIDN'T YOU?

314
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,541
- WAIT!  I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

315
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:52,000
- WAIT!  SIR, YOUR BILL?
- HUH?

316
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,208
- YOU TOOK A PICTURE
OF ME LOOKING BAD.

317
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,208
AND YOU USED A FLASH TOO!

318
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,666
- SHE'S THE REAL THING.

319
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,333
- HA!

320
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,708
- AH!

321
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,708
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

322
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,875
- ( all grunting )
- WHA-- LET GO OF ME.

323
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,875
- HEY, YOU JERKS
LEAVE MISS TALHO ALONE.

324
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,375
- RENTON!

325
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,250
- ( grunting )
- AH!

326
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,083
- RENTON!  RENTON!

327
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,750
- WELL, I THINK MISS TALHO

328
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,625
WILL HAVE TO PAY
FOR THAT CAMERA.

329
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,750
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH HER!

330
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,208
( thinking )
CAN I REALLY DO THIS?

331
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,625
I HAVE TO
TO HELP MISS TALHO.

332
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,708
- ( laughing )
- RENTON!

333
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,375
- HERE GOES!

334
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,958
- AH NO!

335
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,125
- WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT'D YOU JUST SAY?

336
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,375
- ( grunting )

337
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,416
- WAIT!  LET ME GO!
STOP IT!

338
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,416
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'LL BE FINE.

339
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,041
I'M REALLY PRETTY GOOD
AT THIS KIND OF THING.

340
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,541
AH!

341
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,541
( crying out )

342
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,625
- LISTEN, PUNK,
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU THINK

343
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,625
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
TO OUR GIRL HERE?

344
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,458
- IT'S HOLLAND!

345
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,916
- AHH!

346
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,833
- IF YOU WANT TO GET
TO MISS TALHO,

347
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,708
YOU'VE GOT TO GO
THROUGH ME FIRST!

348
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,458
AND THAT'S
A REALLY LAME-ASS PUNCH.

349
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,625
- ( laughing )
THAT'S IT FOR YOU!

350
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
- AH!  HUH?

351
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,500
HUH?  HUH?

352
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,166
AHH!

353
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:11,375
- NO, THAT'S SOMETHING
ONLY BAD CHILDREN DO.

354
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,291
- SO IS THIS AN ANGEL
COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN...

355
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,875
FOR ME?

356
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,458
- AHHH!

357
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,875
- DAMN IT.  WHY ARE YOU
PUSHING YOUR LUCK AGAIN?

358
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,958
- ( grunting )
JERK.

359
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,291
- ( whimpering )

360
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,458
- OH MAN.

361
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,000
HMM.  HUH?
- ( whirring )

362
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,416
- ( grunts )
- AH!

363
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,083
THAT HURT. ( gasps )

364
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,166
( grunts )

365
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,583
AHHH!

366
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,125
AHHH!

367
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,875
NOT EVEN IN 100 MILLION YEARS

368
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,458
COULD YOU GET
ANYWHERE WITH TALHO!

369
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,083
- AH!

370
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,125
( man screaming )

371
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,083
- YOU AWAKE?

372
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,125
- MISS TALHO?

373
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,208
OH JEEZ!  I'M SORRY.

374
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,666
- WHAT ARE YOU APOLOGIZING FOR?
- HUH?

375
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,916
- MAN, YOU'RE SO STUPID,
YOU KNOW THAT?

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'VE NEVER SEEN A KID
ACT SO RECKLESS BEFORE.

377
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,500
BUT THANKS.

378
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,125
- WHERE IS EVERYONE?
- Hilda: EVERYONE'S OKAY.

379
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,333
NIRVASH SPED OVER TO HELP
AND IT'S FINE.

380
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,833
WE'RE ALL MAKING OUR WAY
BACK TO THE GEKKO NOW.

381
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,291
- THAT'S GOOD.

382
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,750
- HUH?  HEY, TALHO,

383
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,208
DON'T SUDDENLY SWITCH OVER
TO CLEAR MODE LIKE THAT.

384
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,625
- OH, IT'S FINE.

385
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,625
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'VE GOT ENEMY
COMING THIS WAY.

386
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,416
BESIDES, DON'T YOU WANT
TO SEE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET

387
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,166
WITH YOUR OWN EYES?
BECAUSE OTHERWISE,

388
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,416
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
START FEELING SUFFOCATED

389
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,916
IF YOU'RE ONLY WATCHING
THROUGH A MONITOR.

390
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,958
- MMM.

391
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,541
- IN ANY CASE, RENTON,
YOU DID A REALLY GOOD JOB TODAY.

392
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,375
YOU DIDN'T EVEN THROW UP.

393
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,541
- OH, COME ON,
I DON'T FEEL ANY MOTION SICKNESS

394
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,916
WHEN I LIFT BY MYSELF.
- AH.

395
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,291
- ( Renton gagging )
- ( women screaming )

396
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,833
- AH?  ( chuckles )

397
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,291
- HMM.

398
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,333
( sighs )

399
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,541
- AND SO YOU SCRATCHED UP
MY 606

400
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,333
AND THEN VOMITED
ALL OVER THE CABIN,

401
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,958
AND YET I HEAR
YOU REALLY MADE THE DAY.

402
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:47,750
IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT?

403
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,500
- YEAH, WELL, I GUESS SO.

404
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,666
- WELL, WITH ALL THAT
UNDER YOUR BELT,

405
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,166
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO AFTER
EUREKA FAIR AND SQUARE NOW.

406
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,416
- HUH?

407
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,000
- WHAT?  THAT THING
ABOUT YOU LIKING EUREKA?

408
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,083
( laughing )
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT IT.

409
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,333
- WHAT?

410
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,000
- ( laughing )

411
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,708
- WAIT A MINUTE, MISS TALHO!

412
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,166
YOU TOLD THEM EVERYTHING,
DIDN'T YOU?

413
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,583
EVEN AFTER YOU PROMISED
YOU WOULDN'T!

414
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,958
- NO WAY.

415
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,916
I HAVEN'T SAID A THING
TO ANYONE.

416
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,833
- HEY, WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

417
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,208
- ( laughs )

418
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,541
- Mischa: TO MAKE A WOMAN HAPPY,
YOU SHOULD START WITH A GIFT.

419
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,208
YOUNG HOLLAND DID QUITE WELL.

420
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,208
- HUH?
WAIT, HOLLAND GOT IT?

421
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,416
BUT I THOUGHT HE SAID NO?
- SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

422
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,458
- OH, YOU MEAN A GIFT
FOR EUREKA?

423
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,000
WELL, YOU SEE,

424
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,333
I DON'T THINK I HAVE MUCH
OF A CHANCE WITH HER ANYWAY,

425
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,458
SO IT ALL SEEMS
PRETTY HOPELESS.

426
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,208
- FOR GOODNESS' SAKES,
DON'T WHINE AND COMPLAIN.

427
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,458
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GIVE HER ANYTHING.

428
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,458
ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS
ARE YOUR ACTIONS,

429
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,375
LIKE WHEN YOU PUT YOURSELF
IN DANGER TO PROTECT TALHO.

430
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,791
- ( thinking ) WELL,
WHEN ALL WAS SAID AND DONE,

431
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,791
IT WAS HOLLAND
THAT PROTECTED MISS TALHO.

432
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,500
- WHAT?!
THAT THROW-UPPER GUY?

433
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,083
- THAT'S A LIE, MAMA!

434
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,916
- SOMEDAY WHEN MY HEIGHT
GETS A LITTLE CLOSER TO HIS,

435
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,250
I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO ASK HOLLAND...

436
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,708
- ( yawning )

437
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,291
...WHEN IT HAPPENED TO YOU,

438
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,375
WHAT WAS YOUR TASTE
OF FIRST LOVE LIKE?

439
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,833
TO BE CONTINUED!

440
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,541
- ( theme music playing )

441
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:32,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

442
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,708
- Narrator: THE BOY COMES
TO A REALIZATION

443
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,541
WHILE BATTLING
WITH THE CHILDREN

444
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,958
AND PROCEEDS
TO TAKE DECISIVE ACTION.

445
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,333
HOWEVER, WHAT HE DOES
IS ALSO PROOF

446
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,000
THAT HE IS STILL
A CHILD HIMSELF.

447

NEXT EPISODE, "CHILDHOOD."
