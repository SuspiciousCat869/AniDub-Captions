- WHAT DO YOU THINK
DINNER IS TONIGHT?

11
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,666
- SAME THING AS LUNCH,
I SUPPOSE?

12
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,500
- WE'VE GOT TO EAT THAT
AWFUL THIN SOUP AGAIN?

13
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,500
- WE'RE ALL GONNA STARVE!

14
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,708
- DON'T WORRY.
HILDA TOOK EUREKA

15
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,125
AND THE KIDS SHOPPING,
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

16
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,958
- YOU MEAN WE'RE GOING TO GET
A JUICY MEAL AT LAST?

17
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,958
- WELL, WHEN I SAW HILDA
A FEW MINUTES AGO,

18
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,041
SHE WAS HAPPY THAT
SHE FOUND SOME

19
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,916
HARD BREAD WITH
A LONG SHELF-LIFE.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,666
- IT FIGURES.
SHE SURE ISN'T EASY ON US.

21
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,750
- YEAH.

22
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,750
- I'M THINKING THREE MORE DAYS.

23
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,875
- YEAH. I THINK EVERYONE'S GOING
TO BE AT THEIR LIMIT BY THEN.

24
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,708
- WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN NOT
HAVING ANYTHING TO DO.

25
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,208
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH WORK FOR TODAY!

26
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,333
- WE'RE DONE, WE'RE DONE!

27
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,791
- ( chattering )

28
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,750
- HEY, COME ON, KIDDO,
WE'RE GOING BACK.

29
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,958
- OH, RIGHT.

30
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,375
OH, NO, NO, I GOTTA...

31
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,375
( grunts )

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,916
- ( urinating )
- ( sighs )

33
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,625
- ( man shouting indistinctly )
- ( gasps )

34
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,458
I MUST BE HEARING THINGS.

35
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,416
- ( shouting continues )

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,083
- WAIT A MINUTE, ARE YOU GUYS
MESSING WITH ME AGAIN?

37
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,291
- Man: GET OUT!

38
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,416
- ( gasps )

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,125
- EVERYONE THAT MAKES
THE SCUBS DIRTY, GET OUT!

40
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,708
- ( gasping )

41
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,833
- Man: WE DIDN'T MEAN
TO SOIL THE SCUBS.

42
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,750
MORE OVER, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE USING THE PLACE

43
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,000
TO HOLD BIG PARTIES EVERYDAY.

44
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,000
- WE'LL LEAVE WHEN WE FINISH
THE REPAIRS. I PROMISE YOU.

45
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,083
- THREE DAYS.
AFTER THREE DAYS, YOU GET OUT.

46
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:47,000
- I WONDER WHAT ONE WOULD
DIG UP IN A SITE LIKE THAT?

47
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,125
- THAT SCUB IS STILL KICKING!

48
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,375
JUST THREE, NO,
TWO MORE METERS OF DIGGING,

49
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,125
AND THOUSANDS OF
GALLONS OF TRAPARS

50
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,958
WILL SPRING FORTH,
I'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN.

51
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,000
- WHAT WAS THAT GUY?

52
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,833
- HE'S JUST SOME OLD DIGGER.

53
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,291
- I THOUGH HE WAS ULTRA SCARY.

54
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,333
- WOULDN'T IT BETTER
TO BE FRIENDLY TO HIM?

55
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,875
IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO,

56
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,791
WE COULD BE HERE WITH HIM
FOR MORE THAN A MONTH.

57
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,875
- SHE'S RIGHT.

58
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,708
- GOOD EVENING.

59
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,916
MR. BRITTANY?

60
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,625
A MAP.

61
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:34,250
FOURTEEN YEARS AGO.
THE SAME YEAR I WAS BORN.

62
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,833
- YOU SURE HAVEN'T BEEN
DISCIPLINED AT ALL, HAVE YOU?

63
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,000
- I'M SORRY I JUST CAME IN,
BUT IT WAS OPEN.

64
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,000
- YOU'D GO ANYWHERE AS
LONG AS THE DOOR IS OPEN?

65
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,458
- WELL, I UM...

66
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,041
- WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

67
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:53,000
- I JUST WANTED TO COME AND
APOLOGIZE ABOUT EARLIER.

68
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,791
- WHY?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

69
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,166
- DID YOUR HIGHER-UPS
TELL YOU TO DO THIS?

70
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,916
- NO, IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

71
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,833
- OH, THEN WHY?

72
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,166
GO HOME.

73
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,833
- ( metal clanking )

74
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,458
- Brittany: I'M GONNA DO IT!
I SAID, I'M GONNA DO IT!

75
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,583
DAMN IT!

76
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,458
- YOU KNOW,
HE'S VERY NOISY.

77
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,000
- VERY.

78
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,125
- HEY, RENTON!
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

79
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,000
- GO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE NOISE.

80
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,375
- OH, OKAY!

81
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,666
- ARE YOU SURE?

82
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,083
- YEAH, I DON'T MIND.

83
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,125
I'M USED TO DEALING WITH
STUBBORN OLD MEN.

84
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,041
- ( grunting )

85
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,375
- SOMETIMES, HE'S AMAZING.

86
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,250
- THAT BANGING NOISE
FINALLY STOPPED.

87
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,500
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS?
WAS IT FROM THE EXCAVATION SITE?

88
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,333
- LET'S GO LOOK!
LET'S GO LOOK!

89
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,750
- NOW, MAETER,
YOU GUYS ARE STILL

90
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,916
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR JOBS.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,541
- WHAT? BUT, I WANNA GO SEE!

92
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,750
- WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR MOM?
I'M POSITIVE SHE'LL SAY NO.

93
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,541
- MAMA, YOU WANT
TO GO SEE, DON'T YOU?

94
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,583
- NO, I THINK I'LL PASS.

95
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,375
- OH! COME ON. LET'S GO.

96
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,958
- DON'T ASK FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE.

97
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,708
- LET'S GO!

98
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,416
- I DON'T WANT TO!
- ( gasps )

99
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,916
( crying )

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,375
- I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

101
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,708
- OH, THERE, THERE.

102
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,416
ALL RIGHT, MAETER, LET'S GO.

103
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,666
YOUR MAMA'S REALLY TIRED,

104
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,083
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO
COME WITH ME, OKAY?

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,458
- Holland: WHAT HAPPENED?

106
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,375
- ( sighs ) I DON'T KNOW.

107
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,125
BUT, IT SEEMS LIKE SHE IS
EXPERIENCING SOME KIND OF STRESS

108
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,708
FROM THAT EXCAVATION SITE.

109
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,291
- ARE THE SCUBS AFFECTING HER?

110
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,250
- OR, IS IT...
- THE NIRVASH?

111
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,958
RIGHT NOW,
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT

112
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,750
IT CAN BE EITHER OF
THOSE TWO POSSIBILITIES.

113
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,291
HOLLAND, HOW MANY DAYS
HAS IT BEEN,

114
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,541
SINCE SHE STARTED TO LIVE
AWAY FROM THE NIRVASH?

115
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,625
- NINE DAYS.
OR MAYBE, TEN.

116
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,458
- IN EITHER CASE,
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.

117
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,000
I'M SURE THIS IS
THE FIRST EXPERIENCE

118
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,083
OF THIS KIND IN HER LIFE.

119
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,250
- SO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT BREAD YOU GOT?

120
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,166
- HONEY, CAN WE HAVE SOME BREAD?

121
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,375
- NO, NO BREAD!
- WHY?

122
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,875
- SOMEONE HERE ATE SOME
WITHOUT ASKING.

123
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,583
UNTIL THE CULPRIT CONFESSES,
NOBODY GETS ANY!

124
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,833
- IT'S JUST LIKE HER.
BOY, SHE'S TOUGH.

125
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,958
- WAIT A SECOND,
WHO DID IT?

126
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,750
COME ON, FESS UP,
OR WE'RE ALL GONNA STARVE!

127
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,041
- PLEASE!

128
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,291
- TALHO, DO YOU THINK
EUREKA IS ALL RIGHT?

129
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,500
- WHY DO YOU ASK?

130
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,166
- WELL, MISS MISCHA
WAS HERE EARLIER TODAY,

131
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,916
SAID SOMETHING TO
HOLLAND ABOUT EUREKA,

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,250
AND HE RUSHED OUT.

133
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,666
- IF YOU'RE
THAT WORRIED ABOUT IT,

134
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,708
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
CHECK UP ON HER?

135
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,833
- NO REASON.

136
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,666
( knocking on door )

137
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,458
- Brittany: WHO IS IT?
- Renton: UM, IT'S ME.

138
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,041
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

139
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,000
- I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
YOU HADN'T EATEN YET.

140
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,291
- HUH?

141
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,458
- EVERYONE TOLD ME
TO GIVE THIS TO YOU.

142
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,375
I'LL CARRY IT INSIDE FOR YOU.

143
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,000
- HEY! WAIT A MINUTE.

144
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,625
I FOUND IT.

145
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,458
- ( chuckles )
- WHAT IS SO FUNNY?

146
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,875
- OH, NOTHING.

147
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,875
- ( clock dinging )

148
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,958
- ( clock whirring )

149
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,791
- I'M IMPRESSED.

150
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,333
- YEAH? WELL, MY GRANDFATHER'S
A GREAT MECHANIC.

151
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,333
SO, I LEARNED TO BE ABLE
TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS

152
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,708
JUST BY WATCHING HIM.

153
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,708
THERE, IT'S ALL DONE.

154
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,416
- I GUESS,
I MADE A MISTAKE.

155
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,791
- HUH?

156
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,833
- ABOUT YOU NOT
BEING DISCIPLINED.

157
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,833
- IT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT KIND OF
STUFF DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME.

158
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,458
- YOUR NAME?

159
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,416
I ASK, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

160
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,375
- I'M RENTON.
MY NAME'S RENTON THURSTON.

161
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,583
- YOU'RE A THURSTON?

162
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,375
THAT GREAT MECHANIC
GRANDFATHER OF YOURS,

163
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,875
ISN'T BY ANY CHANCE
NAMED AXEL THURSTON, IS HE?

164
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,833
AND LIVES IN BELL FOREST?

165
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,083
- OH, YES.

166
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,125
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
SOMEONE DIDN'T ASK ABOUT

167
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,833
ADROC THURSTON AFTER
HEARING ME SAY MY NAME.

168
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,375
- WELL, ALL DIGGERS,

169
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,416
UNLESS THEY'VE COMPLETELY

170
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,833
SHUT THEMSELVES OFF
FROM THE WORLD,

171
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,333
FIRST THINK OF AXEL WHEN
THEY HEAR THE NAME THURSTON.

172
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,833
IT'S THE DREAM OF EVERY DIGGER
TO BE ABLE TO DIG UP SOMETHING

173
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,916
THAT MEETS THAT
MECHANIC'S CRITERIA.

174
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,375
- OH, I WISH GRANDPA COULD
HEAR WHAT YOU SAID!

175
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,833
SEE, THE NUMBER OF DIGGERS
HAS REALLY BEEN DECREASING

176
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,291
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

177
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,583
ALONG WITH PEOPLE WHO
SAY THAT KIND OF STUFF.

178
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,625
SO, HE'S LIVING ALL LONELY,
I GUESS.

179
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,458
- YOU MEAN,
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HOME?

180
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,416
- I CAN'T GO HOME YET.

181
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,666
I'M STILL IN TRAINING,

182
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,416
SO UNTIL I LEARN WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO, I...

183
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
- ( sighs ) SAME HERE.

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,333
- PUT IT ON.
- WHAT?

185
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,791
- UM, HOW FAR ARE WE
GOING TO GO?

186
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,291
ACTUALLY, I NEED TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

187
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,000
- WE'RE HERE.

188
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,291
- ( Renton grunts )

189
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,541
- TURN YOUR LIGHT OFF.
- HOW COME?

190
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,125
- YOU'LL SEE
WHEN YOU TURN IT OFF.

191
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,958
- WOW!

192
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,666
AMAZING!

193
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,125
- JUDGING FROM THE DEPTH HERE,

194
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:47,000
THESE LFO's ARE PROBABLY SOME
OF THE OLDEST IN THE WORLD.

195
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,000
AND I'M SURE THIS IS THE
ONLY PLACE

196
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,500
THAT SO MANY OF THEM ARE
GROUPED TOGETHER LIKE THIS.

197
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,416
- UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS IS AMAZING, MR. BRITTANY!

198
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,833
WAIT.

199
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,458
WHY ARE THEY DISAPPEARING?

200
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,208
- THEY'RE ALL DYING.

201
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,083
- HUH? BUT WHY?

202
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,291
- I GUESS THIS IS
AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY.

203
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,125
- ( machine whirring )

204
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,541
- ALL RIGHT.

205
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,000
- Man: THAT HARD-HEADED
OLD MAN'S NOT HERE TODAY.

206
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,416
- HMM?

207
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,791
- MAYBE I SHOULD GO TAKE A LOOK.
- WHY?

208
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,791
- OH, I JUST FEEL LIKE IT.

209
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,916
- HEY, RENTON, CAN YOU GET
THE NIRVASH MOVE IN A BIT?

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,958
- SURE!

211
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,291
- ( tires screeching )

212
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,375
- HEY WOZ,
IS THIS ALL RIGHT?

213
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,791
- YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

214
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,416
- MR. BRITTANY!

215
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,458
- HMM?

216
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,625
( gasps )

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,125
- Renton: MR. BRITTANY!
GOOD MORNING.

218
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,125
OH, I MEAN,
GOOD AFTERNOON.

219
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,166
- IS THAT...

220
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,208
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
OF COURSE.

221
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,541
YEAH, THAT'S THE
TYPE ZERO OF THE NIRVASH,

222
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,458
ITS THE OLDEST LFO IN THE WORLD.

223
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,833
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

224
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,833
- NO, NOTHING.

225
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,541
- All: THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD.

226
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,916
- Eureka: RENTON.
- HUH?

227
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,458
- EUREKA. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

228
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,000
- I HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK YOU.

229
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,125
- WHAT IS IT?

230
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,541
- IS THE NIRVASH ALL RIGHT?
- EUREKA.

231
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,625
- YOU SEE,
I CAN'T GO OVER THERE, SO.

232
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,833
- I'M GOING INTO THE
DIG SITE RIGHT NOW.

233
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,208
DO YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME?

234
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,916
I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,875
THIS IS MY CHANCE FOR ME
TO MAKE UP WITH HER.

236
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,333
I HAVE TO DO MY BEST.

237
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,708
YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY...

238
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,000
- I CAN'T GO, AFTER ALL.
- HOW COME?

239
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,416
- WELL, I CAN'T
PUT IT INTO WORDS.

240
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,833
- THAT'S OKAY. WE HAVE TO
GET UP EARLY TOMORROW, ANYWAY.

241
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,666
IT'S NOT TOO EARLY.
IT'S NOT TOO EARLY.

242
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,000
I SHOULDN'T RUSH.

243
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,291
IN ANY CASE, I HAVE TO
PATCH THINGS UP WITH HER.

244
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,125
- RENTON?
- YES.

245
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,750
- I'M HEARING SOMETHING.

246
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,208
- ( clanking indistinctly )

247
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,541
- OH, THAT'S MR. BRITTANY.

248
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,041
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HAVEN'T
MET HIM YET, HAVE YOU?

249
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,833
HOLD ON A SECOND. I'LL GO
DELIVER THIS TO HIM FIRST.

250
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,708
- ( clanking continues )

251
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,333
- Renton: MR. BRITTANY!

252
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

253
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,875
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?
- ( gun cocking )

254
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,083
- BUT WHY?

255
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,791
- THIS IS BETA.
ALPHA, DO YOU COPY?

256
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,083
- ALPHA HERE. GO AHEAD.

257
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,958
- NOTHING TO REPORT
BETWEEN FAC 40 AND 49.

258
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,291
- ROGER THAT.
- THEY'RE HERE.

259
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,208
- CONTINUE YOUR PATROL.
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

260
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,791
- THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.
BUT, I HOPE THE DON'T SPOT US,

261
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,708
AND MOVE ON TO THEIR
NEXT SEARCH AREA.

262
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,916
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- RENTON'S IN TROUBLE!

263
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,291
- SO I GUESS,
YOU GAVE UP ON DIGGING?

264
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,125
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
NOW THAT YOU'VE STOLEN THIS?

265
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,166
ARE YOU REALLY SATISFIED
WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

266
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,750
- WHAT DOES A DUMB KID
LIKE YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

267
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,041
THERE'S NO MEANING IN DIGGING,

268
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,166
IF YOU DON'T FIND ANYTHING
WORTH DIGGING FOR.

269
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,583
IT'S JUST PLAYING IN THE SAND,

270
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,291
UNLESS YOU STRIKE
SOMETHING GOOD.

271
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,500
- DOES THAT GIVE YOU
AN EXCUSE TO STEAL?

272
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,750
DOESN'T STRIKING SOMETHING GOOD

273
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,666
MEAN THAT YOU HAVE
TO EXCAVATE IT?

274
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,125
- THIS IS JUST LIKE
ME DIGGING IT UP.

275
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,375
- HUH?

276
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,333
- AS FAR AS THE REST
OF THE WORLD KNOWS,

277
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
I FOUND THIS
LFO BECAUSE I WAS

278
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,791
WORKING THERE
FOR OVER A DECADE.

279
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,666
- THAT'S COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS.
NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE THAT STORY.

280
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,416
- MY SON WILL BELIEVE IT.
I'M POSITIVE, HE WILL.

281
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,125
- YOU LEFT HIM ALONE
FOR FOURTEEN YEARS,

282
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,458
SO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

283
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,958
- WHAT WAS THAT?

284
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,458
- IF I WAS YOUR SON,
I WOULD NEVER BE HAPPY

285
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:54,166
ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

286
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,708
- HMM?

287
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,166
- ( gasping )

288
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,666
- ( both grunting )

289
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,625
- Man: THIS IS THE HACIENDA
STATE FORCES KLF SQUAD!

290
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,958
THE PILOT NEEDS TO
IMMEDIATELY DISEMBARK.

291
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,041
- Eureka: THERE IT IS. THE
NIRVASH AHEAD AT TEN O CLOCK!

292
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,583
- Man: CHECK IT OUT,
I SEE A BIT OF TROUBLE AHEAD.

293
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,583
- ( screaming )

294
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,375
- NO GOOD. LEADER, NO GOOD.
IT'S OBVIOUS TO THEM IT'S US.

295
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,458
- YOU FORGOT THE SAFETY.

296
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,083
- HUH?

297
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,125
- IT'S NOT WORTH IT FOR US
TO KILL YOU RIGHT NOW.

298
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,333
YOU CAN RUN OFF TO WHEREVER
YOU PLEASE. JERK.

299
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,875
- HOLLAND, STOP IT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

300
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,208
- I'M NOT THROUGH WITH HIM.

301
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,208
I DON'T LIKE HIS
CHILDISH LITTLE ATTITUDE.

302
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,416
- SO, YOU THINK
YOU'RE SHOWING OFF,

303
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,833
TAKING THE NIRVASH AND
TRYING TO MOVE IT BY YOURSELF?

304
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,333
ARE YOU LISTENING?

305
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,666
( grunts )

306
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,875
OW. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

307
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,333
- GETTING YOU ATTENTION,
SINCE YOU'RE THE ONE

308
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,625
WHO'S NOT LISTENING HERE.
IF YOU WERE,

309
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,291
YOU'D KNOW HE'S NOT
AT FAULT FOR THIS.

310
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,666
- YOU KNOW WHAT, HOLLAND?

311
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,625
WHY DON'T YOU STOP USING HIM
AS A MEANS TO ESCAPE?

312
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,250
- ( grunts )

313
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,958
- ( door slamming )

314
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,458
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

315
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,125
- I'M FINE, REALLY.

316
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,125
I DIDN'T CARE AT ALL.

317
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,500
OR RATHER,
I WASN'T LISTENING AT ALL.

318
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,625
I WAS THINKING MORE ABOUT
WAS WHY MR. BRITTANY

319
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,083
HAD STOPPED HIS EXCAVATIONS.

320
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,541
WHY HE HAD GIVEN UP?

321
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,000
IS THAT MINE REALLY DEAD?

322
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,416
AND IF SO, WHY DIDN'T HE
JUST START TO DIG THE NEXT ONE?

323
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,500
WAS THIS SOMETHING
THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE

324
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,416
FOR A KID LIKE ME TO UNDERSTAND?

325
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,250
WHAT DID HE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH
BY STEALING THE NIRVASH?

326
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,583
AND SHOWING IT TO HIS SON.

327
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,250
SIS, WHY DID DAD
LEAVE ME THE AMITA DRIVE?

328
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,625
WAS IT SOMETHING THAT DAD
REALLY FOUND IN AN OLD MINE?

329
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:33,083
IS IT SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD
BE PROTECTING WITH MY LIFE?

330
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:38,041
IF IT ISN'T SO, SIS,
THEN WHY AM I HERE?

331
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,041
- Eureka: RENTON.

332
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,083
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR PROTECTING THE NIRVASH.

333
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,541
FOR NOW,

334
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,916
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE OPERATING
THE NIRVASH BY YOURSELF.

335
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,541
I JUST CAN'T DO
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

336
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,250
IT'S WHAT HE WANTS AS WELL.

337
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,541
I'LL TALK TO HOLLAND AND
MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND

338
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,041
THAT IT'S THE BEST THING
FOR BOTH OF US.

339
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,583
HEY, RENTON?

340
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,791
- I'M SORRY, NOTHING'S GONNA
STICK IN MY MIND NOW.

341
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,833
LEAVE ME ALONE.

READY TO BE SWALLOWED
UP BY THE WORLD,
