11
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:46,708
- Hilda: ( on wireless channel )
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S

12
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,666
NOBODY IN THE CITY RIGHT NOW.

13
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,583
- Holland: ( on wireless
channel ) HOW ABOUT THE

14
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,125
ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG SITE?

15
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,166
- I'M GOING TO GO IN RIGHT NOW.

16
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,375
EUREKA?

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,833
- Renton: ( on wireless
channel ) UM, YEAH, ROGER THAT.

18
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,916
HEY, EUREKA?

19
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,791
( gasps )

20
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,291
AMAZING. WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

21
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,750
- Hilda: TRAPAR DENSITY, 8%.

22
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,625
LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S
COMPLETELY DRIED UP OUT THERE.

23
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,916
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S NOBODY IN HERE.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
- Holland: ( on wireless
channel ) ROGER.

25
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,583
- Renton: ( voice over ) THE
DAMAGE INFLICTED ON THE GEKKO

26
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,125
WAS MUCH WORSE
THAN WE'D FIRST THOUGHT.

27
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:45,458
FOR SOME REASON, EVER SINCE
THE INCIDENT WITH THE CORALIAN,

28
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,208
DENSE TRAPAR FIELDS DID NOT
REGENERATE LIKE THEY HAD BEFORE

29
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,791
AND WE HAD TO FIND
SOME PLACE TO HIDE

30
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:56,791
WHILE WE DID ALL
THE NECESSARY REPAIRS.

31
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,291
- Maeter: MAMA, WELCOME BACK!

32
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,458
- Mischa: FEELING UNEASY?

33
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,125
- THIS AREA'S
UNDER GOVERNMENT JURISDICTION.

34
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,750
A PATROL UNIT COULD SPOT US
AT ANY TIME.

35
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,416
- THAT'S NOT ALL, IS IT?
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

36
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,250
- ( sighs )

37
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,166
HEY, WHAT'S THE STORY
ON THE DAMAGES?

38
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,250
- Man: ( over wireless channel )
QUITE A BIT OF THE

39
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,416
REFLECTION FILM
HAS PEELED OFF THE SHIP.

40
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE
TO FIX.

41
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,250
- ( sighs )

42
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,416
- I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE
AND SCOUT THE AREA.

43
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,041
MAYBE THE MILITARY
LEFT SOME FOOD

44
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,666
STASHED SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

45
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,041
- LOOK FOR ANY MATERIALS
WE CAN USE.

46
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,791
- Matthieu: WE'RE TAKING RENTON
WITH US.

47
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,083
- HEY.

48
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,041
SO WAS IT
REALLY THAT SHOCKING TO YOU

49
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,291
THAT I WAS ABLE TO OPERATE
THE NIRVASH

50
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,791
A LITTLE BETTER THAN
YOU USUALLY COULD?

51
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,500
( stiffled sob )

52
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,208
SAME FOR ME!
I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED

53
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,708
BY ALL OF IT, TOO, YOU KNOW?

54
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,041
BUT THE FACT IS
THAT I DID OPERATE IT.

55
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,333
DO I HAVE TALENT?

56
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,041
UH... NAH, I DON'T.

57
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,375
IT COULD JUST BE THAT
I'M AN UNUSUALLY GOOD MATCH

58
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,375
FOR THE NIRVASH OR
SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT.

59
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,583
ON THE OTHER HAND,

60
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,708
MAYBE THE NIRVASH IS SAYING
IN ITS OWN WAY

61
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,875
THAT I'M BETTER AT IT THAN YOU.

62
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,833
NO WAY,
THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE IT!

63
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,875
( sighs )

64
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,416
- Hap: COME ON, RENTON,
LET'S GO.

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,875
- HUH? UH...

66
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,791
- YEAH, KID,
WE'RE GOING ON AN ADVENTURE.

67
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,125
( chuckles )

68
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,583
- HURRY UP, LET'S GO!

69
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,250
- ( footsteps retreating )

70
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,583
- ( sighs )

71
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,916
- Hap: IT'D SAVE OUR REARS
IF WE COULD FIND

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,666
SOME SPARE REFLECTION
FILM AROUND HERE.

73
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,500
- Matthieu: BUT FIRST,
WE HAVE TO FIND A POWER PLANT

74
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,333
AND RECHARGE OUR ENERGY PODS.

75
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,083
- Man 1: THIS WAS A PRETTY BIG
MINE BACK IN ITS DAY.

76
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,375
- ( camera clicking )

77
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,916
( camera clicking )

78
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,333
- OH, MAN,
THIS PLACE REALLY REEKS.

79
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,125
- MATTHIEU, CAN YOU CHECK
WHAT'S DOWN BELOW?

80
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,375
- SURE.

81
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,458
- GIDGET AND MOONDOGGIE,
YOU GUYS GO OVER THERE

82
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,583
AND LOOK AROUND, ALL RIGHT?

83
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,375
STONER, WHY DON'T YOU
GO THAT WAY?

84
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,416
- HUH?

85
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,666
( gasps )

86
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,875
( sighs )

87
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,041
- ( children laughing )

88
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,958
- Linck: HEY, WAIT!

89
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,416
WAIT!

90
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,000
- I...

91
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,916
I'M VERY SLEEPY.

92
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,541
- Renton: MAN,
I'M REALLY GETTING HUNGRY.

93
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,166
WONDER IF THERE'S ANY FOOD
LEFT AROUND HERE.

94
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,666
( gasps )

95
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,083
( gulps )

96
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,541
- ( speaking inaudibly )

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,833
- ( mechanical whirring )

98
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,958
- OH, IT'S ON.

99
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,916
OH, WOW!
THIS PLACE IS UNBELIEVABLE!

100
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,625
WHOA!

101
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,208
WHAT?

102
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,416
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS?

103
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,125
- IT LOOKS LIKE ALL THE
POWER SYSTEMS ARE STILL OKAY.

104
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:07,125
- I WONDER IF THIS SPRING REALLY
DRIED UP LIKE THEY SAID IT DID.

105
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,583
- IF WE WERE HERE
WITHOUT PROTECTION

106
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,375
BACK WHEN THEY WERE
STILL DIGGING IN THIS MINE,

107
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,916
WE WOULD HAVE ALL GONE
COMPLETELY INSANE.

108
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,791
- WE'RE ALL INSANE ALREADY,
AREN'T WE?

109
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,666
NOWADAYS, WE ALL THINK
IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL

110
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,958
TO USE THE LFOS WE DIG UP
TO FLY THROUGH THE SKIES

111
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,458
AND TO USE THEM AS WEAPONS
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

112
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,833
HOLLAND, HAVE YOU
EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

113
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:35,500
WHY THE LFOS ARE
SHAPED JUST LIKE HUMANS?

114
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,750
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
IT'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

115
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:42,125
WHEN I'M MOVING FAST THREE
CLICKS UP AND RIDING A BIG WAVE.

116
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,875
I WONDER IF ADROC
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE

117
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,791
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

118
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,041
- ( children laughing )

119
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,291
- HMM? HEY, WHERE'S EUREKA?

120
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,375
- MAMA IS LAYING DOWN
AND TAKING A NAP.

121
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,583
- Maeter: LINCK!
- OH!

122
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,000
- ( children laughing )

123
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,500
- TAKING A NAP?

124
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,000
- ( footsteps )

125
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,541
OH, I SEE.
THE GUYS WHO DUG THIS MINE

126
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,583
TRIED DIGGING AROUND
ALL THE WAY BACK IN HERE.

127
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,625
( gasps )

128
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,208
- NO! NO! NO! NO!

129
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,375
- ( cooing )

130
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,000
- ( screams )

131
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,708
- ANEMONE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

132
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,708
- NO, LEAVE ME ALONE!
DON'T TOUCH ME!

133
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,458
NO!
- ( groans )

134
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,500
ANEMONE! SETTLE DOWN! STOP IT!

135
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,750
- ( screams )
- ( groans )

136
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,333
YOU REALLY NEED TO LEARN
A LITTLE TOLERANCE.

137
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,208
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
IN MUCH MORE PAIN

138
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,416
IF YOU BECOME RESISTANT
TO THE MEDICATION!

139
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,208
- ( panting )

140
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,291
( hyperventilating )

141
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,708
- OW.

142
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,583
- HEY. DID YOU FIND ANY FOOD?

143
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,208
- UNH-UNH.

144
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,250
- ( door opens )

145
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,791
- MOONDOGGIE?

146
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,208
HEY, I JUST THOUGHT
OF SOMETHING. WHERE'S RENTON?

147
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,125
- EXCUSE ME,
IS THERE ANYONE AT HOME?

148
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,458
HELLO?

149
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,541
PLEASE PARDON ME
FOR INTRUDING.

150
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,083
( footsteps )

151
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,000
- ( toilet flushing )

152
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,583
- ( footsteps )

153
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,250
MM.

154
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,208
WOW!

155
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,375
- ( microwave dings )

156
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,250
- ( sighs )

157
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,666
( drowsily ) MAN, THAT PIZZA
WAS REALLY TASTY. WOW!

158
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,750
THERE'S STILL SOME OF IT LEFT,

159
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,541
SO I GUESS I SHOULD
TAKE IT BACK FOR THE GUYS.

160
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,000
FOR EUREKA, TOO.

161
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,958
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

162
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,000
IF I FALL ASLEEP
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS,

163
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,041
I CAN'T IMAGINE
ALL THE MISFORTUNE I'LL BE IN.

164
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,041
- ANY SPARE BATTERIES?

165
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:35,833
- Hap: ( over wireless channel )
JUST A COUPLE,

166
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,250
BUT AT LEAST I FOUND SOME.

167
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,708
- HAVE YOU FOUND ANY FOOD?

168
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,708
- Gidget: ( over
wireless channel ) NONE.

169
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,666
ABSOLUTELY,
POSITIVELY, NOTHING.

170
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,166
- ( sighs )

171
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,541
- WHY DON'T YOU HEAD BACK
TO THE SHIP AND TAKE A BREAK?

172
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,875
- Hap: HOLD ON A SECOND.
RENTON'S NOT HERE.

173
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,916
- RENTON? WHERE DO YOU THINK
HE RAN OFF TO?

174
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,291
- ( snoring )

175
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,000
HUH?

176
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,125
- ( people chattering )

177
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,125
- Renton: SOMEONE'S HERE.

178
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,791
IT'S... IT'S LIKE... OH, NO.

179
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,916
I SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR EATING
THEIR FOOD WITHOUT ASKING.

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,791
BUT, SEE, I'M STILL JUST A KID!

181
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,750
( gasps )

182
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,625
WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE. THIS IS...
- ( girl screaming )

183
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,583
- ( Anemone groaning in pain )

184
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,125
( exhales heavily )

185
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,458
- PLEASE, GO TO SLEEP NOW.

186
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:07,125
SLEEP IS THE ONE THING
THAT SEEMS TO GIVE YOU PEACE.

187
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,833
- ( girl screaming )

188
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,041
- WHAT WAS... WHAT WAS THAT?

189
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,958
THOSE WERE SKY FISH!

190
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,333
( running )

191
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,583
( gasps )

192
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,625
EURE...KA?

193
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,458
EUREKA. YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE.

194
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,791
YOU KNOW, EUREKA,
ABOUT EARLIER... I...

195
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:28,541
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

196
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,083
I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW
I MIGHT HAVE HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

197
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,958
EVEN THOUGH I WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING AT ALL TO HURT YOU.

198
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,708
YOU KNOW HOW I SAID
THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND

199
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,583
EXACTLY HOW MACHINES
FEEL, RIGHT?

200
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,000
AND YOU SAID THAT
THAT WAS NORMAL.

201
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,000
I WAS HAPPY THAT WE HAD
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

202
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,416
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME.

203
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,666
I JUST THINK I UNDERSTAND
HOW MACHINES FEEL.

204
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,750
MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BELIEVING
THAT I REALLY CAN DO IT.

205
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,333
BUT I'M POSITIVE THAT
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE

206
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:06,416
WHO COULD EVER BE TRULY
HEART-TO-HEART WITH THE NIRVASH.

207
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,833
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT
I'VE BEEN TOGETHER WITH YOU

208
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,333
FOR MORE THAN
A LITTLE WHILE NOW,

209
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,166
BUT I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT YOU

210
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,000
OR ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT FEEL.

211
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,125
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND A LOT
MORE ABOUT YOU THAN I DO NOW.

212
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,666
THAT'S BECAUSE...

213
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,208
HEY, YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU
THINK IT'S A BIT LITTLE CRUEL

214
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,583
TO IGNORE EVERYTHING I SAY?

215
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,625
WAIT! HEY,
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

216
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,916
EUREKA?

217
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,833
- RENTON!

218
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,958
RENTON! WHERE ARE YOU?

219
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,583
- Renton: A BLINK?

220
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,708
EUREKA'S BLINKING HER EYES.

221
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,916
BUT WHY SO SLOWLY?

222
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,166
IS THIS A DREAM?

223
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,000
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT IF I'M FLOATING AROUND

224
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,041
INSIDE THAT CORALIAN AGAIN?

225
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,916
EUREKA. WHAT IS IT
YOU'RE LOOKING AT?

226
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,875
- ( ragged breathing )

227
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,708
- ( gasps )

228
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,916
- STONER, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
RENTON ANYWHERE, HAVE YOU?

229
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,500
- NO. SORRY.

230
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,041
- HEY, IT'S STARTING
TO LOOK LIKE HE'S NOT

231
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,041
IN THE MAIN BUILDING ANYMORE.

232
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,833
- GEEZ, WHERE DID THAT BRAT GO?
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

233
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,000
- STOP IT! NO!

234
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,708
- ( groaning )

235
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,250
- Renton: THIS IS A DREAM!
IT HAS TO BE!

236
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,708
BUT EVEN IF IT IS A DREAM,

237
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,000
IS IT ALL RIGHT FOR ME
TO JUST WATCH IT?

238
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,500
ARE YOU SATISFIED
WITH THAT, RENTON?

239
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:52,291
( screaming ) STOP THAT!

240
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,125
- ( girl screaming )

241
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,000
- ( screaming )

242
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,416
- I'M SORRY. I'VE DONE
EVERYTHING THAT I CAN

243
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,708
DO FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

244
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,166
JUST TRY AND GET SOME REST.

245
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,291
IN THE FUTURE,
I MIGHT END UP PUTTING YOU

246
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,500
IN A MORE PAINFUL SITUATION.

247
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,000
BUT AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT,

248
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,708
SLEEP TIGHT, ANEMONE.

249
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,916
- ( footsteps )

250
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,416
- SO, THIS IS WHERE
HE'S BEEN HANGING OUT.

251
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,833
HEY, RENTON, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SLEEPING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

252
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,083
- HMM?

253
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,291
- ( grunting )

254
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,875
- HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

255
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,958
- Renton: EARLIER IN MY DREAM,

256
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,958
I MADE UP MY MIND
AND APOLOGIZED.

257
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,875
I KNOW I SHOULD DO IT ALL AGAIN
IN THE REAL WORLD.

258
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,958
- WHEN I'M HERE,

259
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:55,958
WHEN I'M INSIDE THIS CAVE,
I BECOME VERY SLEEPY.

260
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,375
- UH-HUH.

261
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,916
YOU KNOW...

262
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,833
EARLIER, I, UM...

263
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,708
I MEAN, I TRIED.

264
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,791
I THINK I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
TO YOU.

265
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,250
- I HEARD ALL OF THAT
WHEN YOU SAID IT BEFORE.

266
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,750
- RIGHT, YOU DID!

267
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,833
( sighs )

268
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,625
