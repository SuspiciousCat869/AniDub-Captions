00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,083
- ♪ I WANNA FLY AWAY ♪

4
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,666
♪ I CAN FLY AWAY ♪

5
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,958
♪ I CAN FLY AWAY ♪

6
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,708
- Dominic: THE WORLD HAS
STARTED TO CHANGE.

7
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,750
THE TECTONIC SHIFTS THAT
HAPPENED TOO FREQUENTLY.

8
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,500
THE FEDERATION COUNCIL,
ACTING TOO LATE.

9
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,875
THE PEOPLE MIRED
IN DISSATISFACTION,

10
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,875
AND THE RESULTING
RESTRUCTURING OF THE ARMY.

11
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,250
EVERYTHING IS MOVING ALONG

12
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,375
ACCORDING TO
THE COLONEL'S PLANS.

13
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,208
RENTON THURSTON.

14
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,166
HOW WILL YOU BE
INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS?

15
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,625
YOU, THE SON OF THE HERO.

16
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,250
( gasping )

17
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,083
( sighs )

18
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,541
HUH?

19
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,083
- Dominic: BELL FOREST.

20
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,916
DESPITE BEING IN THE OUTLANDS,

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,916
IT CAN BE SAID THAT
THE REVOLUTION CURRENTLY

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,458
TAKING PLACE ON THE WORLD,
ALL STARTED HERE.

23
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,833
THE TYPE ZERO,
FOLLOWING THE PIVOTAL BATTLE

24
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,958
FOUGHT IN THIS TOWN,
MASSIVELY IMPROVED ITS SPECS.

25
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,958
NOT ONLY THAT, WHAT SHOULD BE
ESPECIALLY NOTED HERE

26
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,750
IS THE FACT THAT THE SEVEN SWELL
EFFECT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED

27
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,541
FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THE SUMMER OF LOVE.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,708
- ( girl chuckling )

29
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,291
- ( exclaims )

30
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,708
( groans )

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,291
- ( crying ) MAMA.

32
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,875
- Dominic: SO MUCH THAT HAPPENED
SEEMED COINCIDENTAL.

33
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,791
HOWEVER, THANKS TO THE FACT

34
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,458
THAT THE BOY WAS THE
SON OF ADROC THURSTON

35
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,833
EVERYTHING WAS STARTING TO SEEM
AS IF IT WAS MEANT TO HAPPEN.

36
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,125
Oh, hey, you guys!

37
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,833
- HUH?

38
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,291
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
I CAN GO AROUND HERE

39
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,750
TO GET MY BIKE FIXED UP?

40
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,500
- YOUR BIKE?

41
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,250
- Dominic: I MUST KNOW.

42
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,250
RENTON THURSTON...

43
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,375
WHAT MEANING DOES
THAT BOY CARRY?

44
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:07,125
WHAT WAS HE ENTRUSTED WITH?
AND TO KNOW THAT...

45
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,916
- Girl: OH, THERE HE IS.
- HUH?

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
- AXEL, YOU'VE GOT A CUSTOMER.

47
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,416
- Axel: DON'T CALL AN ELDER
BY HIS FIRST NAME.

48
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,708
GEEZ, CHILDREN NOWADAYS
HAVE NO MANNERS. HMM?

49
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,750
- Dominic: I HAD TO MEET HIM.

50
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,250
I JUST HAD TO
MEET THIS MAN.

51
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,791
AXEL THURSTON.

52
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,416
- Renton: I'm sorry.

53
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,583
ABOUT LEAVING WITHOUT
TELLING YOU.

54
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,916
I HADN'T APOLOGIZED
FOR THAT YET.

55
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,416
- YOU WERE STAYING
WITH RAY AND CHARLES

56
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,958
DURING THAT TIME, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

57
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,375
- THE INSIDE OF RAY AND
CHARLES' SHIP WAS REAL CLEAN!

58
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,041
I MEAN IT WAS TOTALLY SPOTLESS.

59
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,375
- REALLY?

60
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,458
- I'D GET UP EARLY
IN THE MORNING

61
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,750
AND HELP CLEAN THE ENTIRE SHIP

62
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,083
FROM STEM TO STERN
UNTIL IT SHINED.

63
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,166
SHE SAID IT WASN'T HARD
IF YOU DID IT EVERY DAY,

64
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,000
'CAUSE THE DIRT
DOESN'T EVER BUILD UP.

65
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,916
WE DIDN'T SKIP EVEN ONE DAY.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,041
- MMM.

67
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,666
- AND WHEN WE WERE
DONE CLEANING UP,

68
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,916
WE'D ALL WORK TOGETHER
TO MAKE BREAKFAST.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,833
WE'D ALWAYS HAVE
FRESH FRUIT JUICE,

70
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,458
HOT BUTTERED BREAD,
A BIG TOSSED SALAD.

71
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,250
ALL OF IT GOOD AND FRESH
AND REALLY TASTY.

72
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,375
- MMM.

73
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,791
- THE TWO OF THEM
WERE BOTH REALLY CONSCIOUS

74
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,166
OF THEIR HEALTH AND STUFF.

75
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,875
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT WAS, EUREKA?

76
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,375
- I DON'T KNOW.

77
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,541
- IT WAS SO
THE TWO OF THEM COULD

78
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,083
MAKE THEIR LIVES TOGETHER
LAST FOREVER.

79
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,791
ISN'T THAT AWESOME?

80
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,583
"OUR FAMILY IS MADE UP OF
JUST THE TWO OF US,

81
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,791
"SO IF ONE OF US WERE TO LIVE
AN UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE THEN...

82
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,750
"THEN, SEVERAL DECADES,

83
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,625
"ONE OF US WILL BE BURDENED
WITH THE MISFORTUNE

84
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,958
OF LIVING OUT OUR LIFE ALONE."

85
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,375
"THAT'S WHY...

86
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,916
THAT'S WHY THE TWO
OF US, TOGETHER..."

87
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,916
DAMN IT!

88
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,916
WHY DID THE TWO OF THEM
HAVE TO DIE LIKE THAT?

89
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,875
WHY DID THEY HAVE TO
FACE SUCH TERRIBLE DEATHS?

90
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,000
IT'S SO CRAZY!

91
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:07,625
WHY DID THOSE TWO HAVE TO COME
HERE TO FIGHT AGAINST HOLLAND?

92
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,041
HOLLAND SAID HE DID IT
TO PROTECT ME.

93
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,791
BUT I DON'T GET IT.

94
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,500
WHY DID HE WANT TO
PROTECT ME IF IT MEANT

95
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,291
KILLING RAY AND CHARLES?

96
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,333
- Eureka: IT'S BECAUSE
I CHOSE YOU.

97
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,583
IT'S BECAUSE
I CHOSE YOU, RENTON,

98
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,958
INSTEAD OF CHOOSING HOLLAND.

99
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,083
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
HE WENT AS FAR AS HE DID

100
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,541
WHILE HE WAS
TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

101
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,333
- EUREKA...

102
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,833
- OH, RENTON, I...

103
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,375
I...

104
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,791
- IF IT'S HARD FOR YOU
TO TALK NOW, THEN,

105
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,750
YOU CAN JUST TELL ME
ABOUT IT SOME OTHER TIME,

106
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,416
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING
MORE COMFORTABLE.

107
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,833
- RENTON...

108
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,250
- EUREKA, IF YOU
CHOSE ME LIKE YOU SAID,

109
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,083
LET'S ALWAYS STAY TOGETHER.

110
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,666
WE'LL PICK UP WHERE
RAY AND CHARLES LEFT OFF.

111
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,208
- YES.

112
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,500
- YOU SAY YOU'RE
RENTON'S FRIEND?

113
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,375
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

114
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,166
- OH, YEAH? WELL, WHERE DID
YOU MEET HIM THEN?

115
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,166
- HUH? OH, AT SALISA ORNE.

116
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,166
- I KNOW WHERE THAT IS.

117
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,625
TA-DA!

118
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,875
IT'S HERE, RIGHT?

119
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,625
- ( chuckles )
YOU SURE KNOW A LOT.

120
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,375
- Girl 1: IT'S MY FAVORITE MAG.

121
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,500
- SO, TELL ME,
HOW IS RENTON DOING?

122
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,583
- Girl 2: OH, I HAVE A QUESTION.

123
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,125
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'RE A MEMBER

124
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,541
OF GEKKOSTATE, MR. DOMINIC?

125
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,541
- Girl 3: WHAT?
OF COURSE HE'S NOT.

126
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,708
LOOK AT WHAT HE'S WEARING.
IT'S ALL WRONG.

127
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,208
- ( chuckling nervously )

128
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,166
- THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN
NAGGING ME FOR A WHILE.

129
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,708
WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN RENTON AND TALHO?

130
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,875
- WELL, I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

131
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,708
- Girl 3: OH, IT'S BEEN
ON YOUR MIND?

132
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,166
- Girl 1: WHAT OF IT?

133
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,166
- YOU ALWAYS SAID
THAT YOU THOUGHT

134
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,416
RENTON WAS REALLY GROSS.

135
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,083
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID!

136
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,666
I WAS JUST SAYING THAT TALHO
MUST BE TROUBLED BY HIM.

137
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,416
- Axel: BE QUIET!
- ( all gasping )

138
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,416
- ENOUGH OF THIS.
I CAN'T GET A WORD IN AS WAS.

139
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,708
- Girls: Okay.

140
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,916
OH, I SEE,
SO RENTON SENT YOU HERE?

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,083
- YES. HE SAID IF I CAME
TO BELL FOREST,

142
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,541
I SHOULD STOP IN HERE AND SEE

143
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,250
IF YOU'RE DOING
ALL RIGHT, MR. THURSTON.

144
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,250
- ( laughs ) THAT KID...

145
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,333
- Girl: GOOD FOR YOU, AXEL.

146
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,250
I'M SURE THAT RENTON WAS
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

147
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,875
- ( grunts ) GIRLS TALKING
AS IF THEY KNEW IT ALL.

149
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,666
- YOUR NAME IS DOMINIC?
- YES!

150
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,416
- YOU SAID THAT YOU TRAVEL
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

151
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,708
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED NEXT?

152
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,791
- WELL, SIR, I REALLY
HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

153
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:51,250
- WILL YOU CHOSE A HOT PLACE
OR PERHAPS A COLD PLACE INSTEAD?

154
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,666
- UH, I SUPPOSE IF I HAD TO
CHOSE A PLACE RIGHT NOW,

155
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,000
I'D CHOSE HOT.

156
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,916
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

157
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,041
I'LL GET TO THE
REPAIRS RIGHT NOW.

158
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,458
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
HELPING ME, RIGHT?

159
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,333
- YEAH, I'D BE HONORED.

160
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,375
- ( yawning )

161
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,833
( gasps )

162
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,416
WHAT? WOW!

163
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,333
( exclaims )

164
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,000
( screaming )

165
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,375
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

166
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,583
- WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M CLEANING. CAN'T YOU TELL?

167
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,291
- ( exclaims ) GONZY!

168
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,208
I JUST FINISHED MOPPING UP
THAT PART OF THE FLOOR.

169
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,666
- WOW, THIS LOOKS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOW.

170
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,833
- MAKES ME FEEL UNEASY.

171
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,833
- YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD QUITE
A FEW SMOKY AFFAIRS RECENTLY,

172
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,416
SO THIS FEELS REFRESHING.

173
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,625
- Hap: IN ANY CASE, WHAT GOT
ALL THIS CLEANING STARTED?

174
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,166
- WELL, RENTON AND EUREKA
STARTED CLEANING FIRST.

175
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,208
- WHAT?
- WHY DID THEY DO THAT?

176
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,916
- WHO KNOWS?

177
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,333
- HUH?

178
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,625
- Hilda: I GUESS
I'LL HELP OUT, TOO.

179
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,125
- OH, COME ON.

180
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,791
- THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING,
EVEN IF WE CALLED ALL HANDS,

181
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,375
THEY WOULDN'T GATHER.

182
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,208
AND STONER'S PHOTO DEVELOPMENT
IS GOING TO TAKE A WHILE, TOO.

183
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,958
LET'S GO, MATTHIEU.

184
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,208
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU LATER.
- ( sighs )

185
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,000
- TORQUE WRENCH.
- HUH?

186
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,416
OH, UH...

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,833
HMM...

188
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,166
- Axel: WHAT'S WITH YOU?
THE TORQUE WRENCH!

189
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,916
- AS IF I KNEW.

190
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,750
- HMM?

191
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,958
- OH, NO, NOTHING AT ALL,
REALLY.

192
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,541
- ( gasping )

193
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,166
- THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

194
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,458
IF YOU RIDE BIKES,
YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS.

195
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:19,916
- YES, SIR.

196
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,000
- LOOKS LIKE THINGS
AREN'T GOING SMOOTHLY.

197
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,291
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

198
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,041
I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE
TOO TOUGH A REPAIR.

199
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,375
- ( laughs ) NO, I MEAN
ABOUT THE OLD MAN.

200
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,583
- OH.

201
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,833
- YOU SEE, WHEN THEY START
FIDDLING WITH MACHINES,

202
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,375
THEY DON'T STOP UNTIL
VERY BIT OF IT IS FIXED.

203
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,916
ALL THREE GENERATIONS OF 'EM,
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,833
- "THREE GENERATIONS OF THEM"?

205
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,958
DOES THAT INCLUDE
ADROC THURSTON?

206
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,000
- OH, YEAH. OF COURSE, IT DOES.

207
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,958
- HEY, COME ON GIRLS, WAKE UP.
IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.

208
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,375
YOUR MOMMAS HAVE YOUR
SUPPERS WAITING FOR YOU.

209
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,666
( laughs )

210
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,791
- ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID...

211
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,083
- WHAT ABOUT IT?

212
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,541
- THE THREE GENERATIONS
BEING THE SAME?

213
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,875
- YEAH.

214
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,750
- SOUNDS LIKE AN
INTERESTING STORY.

215
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,833
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR
MORE DETAILS ABOUT IT.

216
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,250
- ( metal clanking )

217
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,875
- UH. HUH?

218
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,875
- HEY, WHERE YOU
HEADED, OLD MAN?

219
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,000
- I NEED A GYRO.

220
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,500
I'M GONNA HEAD OVER TO
SCRAP METAL OZZY'S.

221
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,666
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

222
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,291
I HEARD A BLIZZARD
IS ABOUT TO HIT US HERE.

223
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,750
- Girls: HUH?

224
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,791
- UH, I'LL GO TOO.

225
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,041
- WELL, OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA
GO. IT'S ALL FOR YOU, ANYWAY.

226
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,333
- ( grunts )

227
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,500
- ( beeping )

228
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,833
- ( door opening )

229
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,666
- Woman: HOW LONG ARE YOU
PLANNING TO DO THAT?

230
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,208
IF YOU DON'T GET
A LITTLE REST SOON,

231
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,916
YOU'RE GONNA END UP WITH
AN IV TUBE STUCK IN YOU, TOO.

232
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,291
- DID THE SCOUTING ALL GET DONE?

233
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,625
- YEAH. I'LL WRITE YOU A REPORT.

234
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,458
- HOLLAND WAS...

235
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,625
HOLLAND WAS CONFRONTING
HIS PAIN, TOO.

236
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,458
- I'LL JUST LEAVE
YOUR MEAL RIGHT HERE.

237
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,125
EAT UP WHILE IT'S WARM.

238
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,708
RENTON AND EUREKA
WORKED TOGETHER TO MAKE IT,

239
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,875
AND IT'S REALLY TASTY.

240
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,250
- ( door closing )

241
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,875
- I'LL CARRY A BIT
OF IT FOR YOU.

242
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,416
YOUR TROUBLES, I MEAN.

243
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,666
- ( all exclaiming contentedly )

244
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,875
- OH, WOW!

245
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,416
- I'M IMPRESSED. THIS FOOD
SURE IS SOMETHING ELSE.

246
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,416
- YEAH. IT'S YUMMY, MAMA.

247
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,791
- YAY!

248
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,041
- HEY, EUREKA, DID YOU MAKE
ALL OF THIS BY YOURSELF?

249
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,750
- MMM-MMM.
Renton AND I MADE IT TOGETHER.

250
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,125
- ( chuckling )

251
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,375
I'M SORRY I DID THIS
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

252
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,000
I THOUGHT THAT AS LONG AS
I'M ON BOARD THIS SHIP,

253
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,458
WAITING TO TALK TO HOLLAND,

254
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,916
I'D TRY TO MAKE GOOD
USE OF MYSELF.

255
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,750
- COME ON, RENTON.

256
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,166
DON'T BE SAYING DEPRESSING
STUFF LIKE THAT.

257
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,625
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE DETERMINED

258
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,125
TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE,

259
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,083
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
GET IN YOUR WAY.

260
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,833
IN FACT, I...
I'D LIKE TO CHEER YOU ON

261
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,500
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF
OUR DEAR FRIENDS.

262
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,833
- THANK YOU, HAP.

263
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,000
- RENTON.

264
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,375
- YES?

265
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,833
- WE DIDN'T CREATE GEKKOSTATE
IN ORDER TO PRETEND

266
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,416
WE'RE SOME SORT OF AN
EXTENDED FAMILY. YOU UNDERSTAND?

267
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,916
- HEY, TALHO, THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO PUT IT THAT WAY.

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,875
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHUT UP, HAP?

269
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,958
- YES, I KNOW.

270
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,916
I THINK THE REASON THIS SHIP
EXISTS IS IN ORDER TO GO A WAR.

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,083
- HMM?

272
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,833
- BY ANY CHANCE, DO YOU HAPPEN
TO KNOW WHY WE'RE AT WAR?

273
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,625
- NO, I DON'T.

274
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,666
- SO YOU CAN FIGHT WITHOUT
KNOWING THE REASON WHY?

275
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,958
- I CAN'T FIGHT AT ALL.

276
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,791
AND I DON'T HAVE
THE WILL TO FIGHT, EITHER.

277
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,583
- REALLY? EVEN IF
THIS WAR WAS STARTED

278
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,250
BY THAT FAMOUS FATHER OF YOURS.

279
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,416
ADROC THURSTON WHO
SAVED THE WORLD?

280
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,583
- ( gasping )

281
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,333
- ADROC WAS WORKING AS
A TECHNICIAN FOR THE ARMY

282
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,333
WHEN ONE DAY HE MADE
THE SHOCKING ASSERTION

283
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,833
THAT THIS LAND, SCUB CORAL,

284
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,291
WAS ACTUALLY A CORALIAN,
A SENTIENT BEING.

285
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,125
HE TRIED TO PROVE
HIS ASSERTIONS,

286
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,875
BUT IN THE PROCESS OF THE
INVESTIGATION AT THE GREAT WALL,

287
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,000
ADVERSE AFFECTS ON HUMANS
BELIEVED TO BE FROM SCUB CORAL

288
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,166
EXPANDED AMONG THE RESEARCHERS
AND ARMY ASSOCIATES.

289
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,291
THE ARMY OFFICIALS
HEARING OF THIS,

290
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,083
DECIDED TO GET
RID OF THE CORALIAN,

291
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,500
AND ADROC IN THE END
WAS AGAINST IT.

292
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,666
HE WAS CONVINCED,
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED,

293
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,708
THAT THE CORALIAN WAS
AN INTELLIGENT LIFE FORM.

294
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,708
THAT WAS WHY HE HAD SEARCHED
FOR A WAY TO COEXIST.

295
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,875
HIS CONVICTION WAS CEMENTED
BY THE EMERGENCE

296
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,833
OF A HUMAN SHAPED CORALIAN.

297
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,333
THE NAME OF THE HUMANOID
CORALIAN IS EUREKA.

298
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,583
- ( gasping )

299
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,958
- SHE'S PART OF THE CORALIAN?
YOU MEAN THE CORALIAN?

300
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,125
- I HAD MY HUNCHES, BUT...

301
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,916
- BUT, WAIT. HOLD ON
A SECOND HERE. WHAT?

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,625
- Talho: I'M NOT DONE
WITH THE STORY YET.

303
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,250
NOW, HAP, TELL THEM
WHAT WE FOUND OUT

304
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,791
WHEN WE STARTED TAPPING
THE COMMUNICATION LINE.

305
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,458
- UH...

306
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,083
THE DETAILS ARE STILL UNCERTAIN,

307
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,458
BUT APPARENTLY THE STATE ARMY

308
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,625
HAS RECONSTITUTED AN
ANTI-CORALIAN SQUADRON.

309
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,416
ITS NAME, SIZE AND EVERYTHING
ABOUT IT IS A MYSTERY.

310
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,583
HOWEVER, AS PROOF THAT
THE SQUAD HAS REFORMED,

311
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,291
THEY'RE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING
A WEAPON CAPABLE OF

312
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,000
ATTACKING DEEP
BENEATH THE GROUND.

313
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,000
- THIS IS PROOF OF THAT.

314
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,583
- ( gasping )

315
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,875
- THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON THAT
HOLLAND CREATED GEKKOSTATE.

316
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,583
TO FOLLOW ADROC'S WILL
AND PROTECT EUREKA,

317
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,500
THE ONLY BEING ALIVE THAT
CAN ACCESS THE CORALIAN.

318
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,583
HOWEVER, THAT MEANT
FROM THEN ON

319
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,958
THE ENTIRE WORLD
BECAME HIS ENEMY.

320
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,125
CAN YOU BE RESIGNED
TO ACCEPT THAT FATE?

321
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,416
- YES, I CAN.

322
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,583
- ( sighs )
LET'S HEAD TO TRESOIR.

323
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,583
- TRESOIR? YOU KNOW, THAT PLACE
IS ONE OF THE ARMY'S...

324
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,458
- THE GUYS WHO WORK THERE
ARE THE ONLY ONES

325
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,458
THAT ARE CAPABLE OF
REPAIRING THE NIRVASH NOW.

326
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,500
- BUT...

327
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,041
- HOLLAND WOULD HAVE
DONE THIS TOO.

328
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,666
- ( sighs )

329
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,958
- EXCUSE ME.

330
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,791
RENTON, I'D LIKE TO HAVE
SOME MORE OF THIS LATER ON.

331
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,416
SO, CAN YOU SAVE ME SOME?

332
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,083
- OH, SOME FOR ME, TOO!

333
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,583
- I'D LIKE SOME MYSELF.

334
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,125
- ( grunts ) AH, GEEZ!

335
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,666
MATTHIEU, YOU AND STONER
TAKE THE 606.

336
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,000
HILDA, YOU FOLLOW
CLOSE BY IN 808.

337
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,250
- All: ROGER.

338
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,666
- Hap: GIDGET, CONTACT
TRESOIR ON CODE CURE.

339
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,875
- ROGER THAT.

340
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,375
- NOW, YOU GUYS
SHOULD COME WITH ME.

341
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,250
WE'LL EAT OVER THERE.

342
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,791
- BUT WHY?
WE'RE FINE HERE.

343
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,583
- COME ON, LET'S JUST GO.

344
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,041
- HEY, MISCHA,
IS MAMA'S NAME CORALIAN?

345
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,541
- UH...

346
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,541
- I DIDN'T ASK HER TO DO THAT.
- HUH?

347
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,250
- I KNEW I HAD TO
TELL YOU MYSELF.

348
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:52,625
BUT WHEN I THOUGHT THAT
YOU MIGHT HATE ME FOR IT,

349
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,125
RENTON, I...

350
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,250
( sobbing )

351
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,583
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
MUCH OF IT.

352
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,041
I MEAN, WHENEVER
I TOUCH YOU LIKE THIS,

353
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,000
IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME
HOW SPECIAL YOU ARE.

354
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,875
- RENTON...

355
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,208
- FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
YOU'VE BEEN DIFFERENT

356
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,625
FROM EVERYONE ELSE
I'VE EVER MET.

357
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,125
OH, EUREKA,
YOU ARE UNIQUELY YOU.

358
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,875
- ( Axel grunting )

359
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,916
BOY, IT'S ALREADY THIS LATE?

360
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,125
- ARE YOU ALL DONE?

361
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,166
- ( exclaiming )

362
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,166
- ( engine revving )

363
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,375
- SOMEHOW I THINK THE
GLIMMER OF THE COMPAC DRIVE

364
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,875
HAS INCREASED A BIT.

365
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,166
- THIS OLD BOY IS REALLY HAPPY
ABOUT IT. THAT'S FOR SURE.

366
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,250
- DOMINIC.
- YES?

367
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,750
- DO ME A FAVOR.

368
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,833
PLEASE KEEP BEING A GOOD FRIEND
TO RENTON FROM NOW ON.

369
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:22,416
THAT BOY'S FATHER WAS TOUTED
AS THE GREAT HERO OF THE WORLD.

370
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,208
BUT I SAY THAT IT WAS
NOTHING MORE THAN

371
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,125
A DESPERATE FABRICATION
OF THE STATE ARMY.

372
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,125
PLEASE, JUST ALWAYS
TRY TO SEE RENTON

373
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,208
FOR WHO HE REALLY IS.

374
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,041
FROM THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU,

375
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,625
I HAD A FEELING
THAT YOU WERE LIKE ME.

376
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,666
I WANT YOU TO FEEL FREE
TO DROP BY WHENEVER YOU LIKE.

377
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,666
AND IF IT'S FOR
REPAIRING YOUR BIKE,

378
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,416
THIS OLD MAN WILL BE
MORE THAN HAPPY

379
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,958
TO DO IT FOR YOU ANY TIME.

380
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,416
- HUH?

381
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,666
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

382
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,875
DAMN IT! DAMN IT!
DAMN IT! DAMN IT!

383
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,958
WHAT THE HECK AM I DOING?

384
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,625
I CAN'T DO IT.

385
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,333
I CAN'T GIVE A REPORT
OF THIS TO THE COLONEL.

386
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,208
( exclaims )

387
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,166
DAMN IT, OLD GEEZER.

388
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,583
WHO TOLD YOU TO DO SUCH
A PEAKY TUNE-UP OF MY BIKE?

389
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,041
- REPORT THAT SPEC OPS
CAPTAIN DOMINIC

390
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,958
IS LEAVING BELL FOREST.

391
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,625
- HOW ARE THE CONDITIONS?

392
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,041
- THEY'RE GOOD.
SEND THEM OUT ANY TIME.

393
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,333
- WOZ?
- ALL GOOD HERE.

394
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,083
- JOBS?
- EVERYTHING IS A GO HERE.

395

396

ENEMY SHIPS IN OUR AREA.

398
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:08,083

BOOSTERS. COMMENCE COUNTDOWN.

399
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,916
- COUNTDOWN COMMENCING.

400
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,916
- OH, LOOK, HOLLAND WOKE UP.

401

- MISCHA!
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

402
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,375
- IGNITION.
