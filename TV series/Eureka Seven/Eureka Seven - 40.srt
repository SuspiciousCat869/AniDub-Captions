1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,750
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,916
- YOU KNOW, THIS PICTURE
IS KIND OF EMBARRASSING.

4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
- IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO BE EMBARRASSED,

5
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,583
YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT THE OTHER
PHOTOS I HAVE OF YOU GUYS.

6
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,583
- SURE, WHY NOT?

7
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,375
BUT WHY RUSH ON
GETTING THROUGH ALL THIS?

8
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:10,041
- SOON, THE GEKKO WILL ARRIVE
AT THE VODARAC HEADQUARTERS,

9
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,416
THE VODARA SHRINE.

10
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,375
- VODARA SHRINE?

11
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,208
- IT'S WHERE THE ONE
THAT NORB CALLS SAKUYA IS.

12
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,333
WHEN WE FINALLY GET THERE,
WE WON'T HAVE TIME

13
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,208
FOR YOU TO CHECK
THESE PICTURES OUT.

14
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,666
- WE HAVE TO GET THIS PUBLISHED
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

15
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,458
USING ANY MEANS WE CAN.

16
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,250
I FEEL BAD THAT AS A RESULT
OF EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW,

17
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,458
WE HAVE TO USE YOU
AND EUREKA LIKE THIS.

18
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,666
BUT IN ORDER TO GET OVER
THE CURRENT SITUATION,

19
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,333
WE NEED AN ABUNDANCE OF SPEED
AND THE REAL TRUTH.

20
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,208
YOU CAN REST ASSURED

21
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,750
WHEN YOU COME BACK,

22
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,291
BOTH OF YOU WILL BE FAMOUS.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,083
- Renton:
IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME

24
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,333
IF WE NEVER END UP
FAMOUS AT ALL.

25
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,833
- Woman:
WELCOME BACK, MASTER NORB.

26
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,916
- ( groans )

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,791
I APPRECIATE
THE GREETING,

28
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,666
BUT YOU DO KNOW WHAT JOB
COMES WITH THE FACT

29
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,208
THAT I'VE RETURNED,
DON'T YOU?

30
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,458
YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN?

31
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,666
- NO, WE HAVEN'T.

32
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,958
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

33
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,875
THAT LAND HAS ALREADY
BEEN TAKEN OVER

34
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,291
BY THOSE THAT ARE EVIL.

35
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,125
- SO YOU BELIEVE
THEY'RE EVIL, HUH?

36
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,916
THOSE MEN
BELIEVE IN THEIR HEARTS

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,541
THAT WHAT THEY KNOW
IS THE TRUTH.

38
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,958
- GOOD TO SEE YOU'RE
DOING WELL, OLD LADY.

39
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,125
- YOU SEEM TO BE
DOING WELL YOURSELF.

40
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,291
WHERE ARE THOSE CHILDREN?
- Renton: MA'AM.

41
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,291
- OH?

42
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,625
THERE YOU ARE.
- ( laughing )

43
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,125
- I WANT TO DRINK
THAT TEA AGAIN.

44
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,791
- YEAH, THAT SWEET RED TEA.

45
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,291
- OF COURSE.

46
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,791
YOU'VE ALL GROWN UP
IN THE SHORT WHILE

47
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,000
THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU.

48
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,541
- OH, BOY.
DON'T SAY THAT.

49
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,916
YOU SOUND LIKE A RELATIVE
I HAVEN'T SEEN IN AWHILE.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,666
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
I MEAN IT.  SEE?

51
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,833
- YOU THINK SO?

52
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,166
I GUESS.

53
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,166
- I GREW TALLER TOO,
DIDN'T I?

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,666
- ME TOO, ME TOO!

55
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,500
- YES, YES.
ALL OF YOU HAVE GROWN

56
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,375
SINCE WE WERE
LAST TOGETHER.

57
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,458
NOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN
YOUR MAMA YET.

58
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,791
WHERE IS SHE HIDING?

59
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,166
- I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S HARD
FOR YOU TO SEE HER AGAIN.

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,791
IF I WERE IN YOUR SITUATION,

61
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,083
I'M SURE I'D BE FEELING
THE SAME WAY RIGHT NOW.

62
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,500
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE HER,

63
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,958
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

64
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,000
BUT EUREKA,

65
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,333
I REALLY THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT

66
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,666
THAT YOU MEET
THESE PEOPLE AGAIN.

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,750
- I KNOW,
BUT TALHO, I'M...

68
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,041
- NOT A HUMAN BEING?

69
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,875
THAT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL.

70
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,625
LISTEN TO ME, EUREKA.
- ( gasps )

71
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,625
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE HUMAN

72
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,041
OR CORALIAN.

73
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,875
WE'RE BOTH CREATURES WHO
LIVE TOGETHER ON THIS PLANET.

74
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,875
AND I WANT YOU TO MEET
THE PEOPLE OF THE VODARAC.

75
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,375
I KNOW THEY'LL TREAT YOU
JUST LIKE RENTON HAS.

76
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,541
IT'LL BE FINE.

77
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,833
- ( sighs )

78
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,583
I CAN'T DO IT, TALHO.

79
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,166
- ( sighs )

80
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,833
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY ARE
A BLOCKHEAD SOMETIMES.

81
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,625
- IT'S BEEN 40 YEARS.

82
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,375
- HAS IT REALLY
BEEN THAT LONG?

83
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,875
- HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET IN THERE?

84
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,708
THAT PLACE IS...

85
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,708
- CONTROLLED BY
THE MIYOTO SECT.

86
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,916
- THEY ARE THE ONES THAT FOLLOW
A TERRIBLE EVIL TEACHING.

87
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,416
THOSE THAT FOLLOW
THE TEACHINGS OF MASTER NORB

88
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,958
HAVE BEEN OPPRESSED,

89
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,708
AND SPEND THEIR DAYS WISHING
ONLY FOR THE MASTER'S RETURN.

90
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,416
- DON'T THEY KNOW THAT
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO LIVE ON

91
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,916
THAN TO DIE
FOLLOWING MY TEACHINGS?

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,250
- SO HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO TAKE THIS FILTHY OLD MAN

93
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,583
INTO A PLACE LIKE THAT
WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT?

94
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,791
- CURRENTLY
IN THE VODARA SHRINE,

95
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,916
MANY REFUGEES
ARE FLOODING IN.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,250
- ALL THANKS TO THE BATTLES
AGAINST THE ANTI-BODY CORALIANS?

97
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,833
- YES.  TAKE A LOOK.

98
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,500
- OH-- OH, MAN.

99
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:14,291
- THEY'RE REFUGEES
HEADING TO THE VODARA SHRINE.

100
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,125
THE OPPRESSION AGAINST
THE BELIEVERS OF THE VODARAC

101
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,166
HAS BECOME WORSE
THAN EVER BEFORE.

102
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,166
THE ONLY PLACE WHERE
THEY CAN ESCAPE TO

103
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,375
IS THE VODARA SHRINE.

104
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,916
FURTHERMORE, MUCH TO
OUR GOOD FORTUNE,

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,875
THE SHRINE IS HOLDING
A FESTIVAL.

106
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,375
- WAIT, YOU DON'T MEAN...

107
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,958
- YES.  A BRAND NEW
SAINT HAS BEEN BORN.

108
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,916
- A SAINT?
THEY'RE STILL DOING THAT?

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,625
THEY'RE ALL A BUNCH OF IDIOTS.

110
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,625
- AND SO WE'RE GOING
TO USE THIS FESTIVAL

111
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,458
TO QUIETLY ENTER
THE VODARA SHRINE

112
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,958
NIRVASH AND ALL?

113
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,291
- MM-HMM.

114
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,000
- YEAH, THAT COULD WORK.

115
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,583
- BUT BEFORE THAT...

116
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,333
- HUH?  WHOA!

117
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,333
- HUH?
- HEY, LET GO!

118
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,541
LET GO OF ME!

119
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,125
I ORDER YOU TO LET GO.

120
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,500
DAMN IT, KEEP THOSE
IMPURE HANDS OFF ME!

121
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,166
I AM MASTER NORB!

122
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,208
STOP-- AAH!
YOU GOT SOAP IN MY EYE.

123
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,416
ALL OF YOU ARE GONNA
GO TO HELL FOR THIS.

124
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
- Eureka: HEY.
- Talho: WHAT?

125
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,833
- I WAS JUST WONDERING,

126
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,541
WHY ARE THERE CREATURES
LIVING IN THIS WORLD?

127
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,000
- THAT'S A DIFFICULT
QUESTION TO ANSWER.

128
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,000
- I'M SORRY.

129
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,000
- I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT
VERY WELL,

130
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,750
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

131
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,250
THE WORLD AND THE CREATURES
ON IT AS SEPARATE THINGS.

132
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,250
- OH?

133
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,000
- THE WORLD IS ITS CREATURES,

134
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,000
AND THE CREATURES
ARE THEIR WORLD.

135
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,041
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
THIS KID HERE

136
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,833
IS TRYING TO TEACH ME.

137
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,000
- OH?

138
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,750
ARE YOU HAPPY
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY?

139
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,041
- ( chuckles )

140
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,166
( sighs )

141
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,041
HALF AND HALF I THINK.

142
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,708
AFTER ALL, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
DEAL WITH TWO KIDS NOW.

143
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,250
- YOU MEAN, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TWO BABIES?

144
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,541
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

145
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,375
SOMETIMES HOLLAND IS
LIKE A YOUNG KID,

146
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,833
JUST LIKE RENTON IS.

147
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,333
- I DON'T THINK RENTON'S
A YOUNG CHILD ANYMORE, TALHO.

148
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,916
- WHAT?  YOU'RE MAD AT ME?

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,250
- I'M NOT MAD.

150
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,000
- OF COURSE YOU'RE MAD.

151
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,541
- I AM NOT, TALHO.

152
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,458
- YOU'RE SO CUTE.

153
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,625
- ( grunts )

154
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,375
- ( gasps )

155
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,166
I SEE.  PILLOW FIGHT!

156
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,916
- ( grunts )

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,833
- ( chuckles )
- ( grunts )

158
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,125
( grunts )

159
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,375
- ( chuckles )

160
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,750
- ( gasps )

161
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,083
- ( both chuckling )

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,583
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?!

163
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,916
HONESTLY, I WAS WONDERING
WHAT YOU WERE DOING

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,500
INSTEAD OF
EATING YOUR SUPPER.

165
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,750
LOOK HERE, TALHO,

166
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,250
YOU'VE GOT TO ACCEPT
THAT YOUR BODY

167
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,916
IS NOT JUST FOR
YOU ALONE ANYMORE.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,083
- YEAH.

169
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,083
OH, WELL.

170
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,750
WE BETTER GO EAT.

171
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,708
- HUMAN BEINGS ARE
REALLY AMAZING.

172
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,416
- ( gasps )
- HMM?

173
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,125
- I MEAN, YOU CAN ACTUALLY
CARRY A WHOLE NEW LIFE

174
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,166
INSIDE OF YOU.

175
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,625
- EUREKA,

176
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,333
BIOLOGICALLY,
YOU'RE AS CAPABLE

177
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,458
OF BEARING CHILDREN
AS ANY HUMAN IS.

178
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,541
- WHAT?

179
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,416
- WITH 40 YEARS
OF DIRT OFF MY SKIN,

180
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,416
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA
CATCH A COLD.

181
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
- ( laughing )

182
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,083
- WELL, WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF

183
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,125
THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE
TO GETTING IN.

184
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,458
- NOW WE JUST NEED
TO TAKE EUREKA--

185
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,375
- ( door opens )

186
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,416
- Kids: MAMA.

187
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,333
- ( gasps )

188
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,333
WAIT.

189
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,500
SO, THIS IS THE PATH THAT
YOU HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOURSELF.

190
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,791
- ( gasps )

191
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,500
OH, MA'AM.

192
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,208
( crying )

193
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,666
- IT'S JUST ABOUT TIME.

194
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,166
WE ALL NEED TO GET READY.

195
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,166
- HMM.
- Renton: HOLLAND.

196
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,708
- YEAH?

197
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,041
- WHAT NOW?

198
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,583
WHAT IS IT THAT
WE'RE GONNA BE DOING?

199
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,500
- WE'RE GOING TO INFILTRATE
THE VODARAC HEADQUARTERS.

200
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,791
- ( gasps )

201
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,166
- I'M GONNA HAVE YOU GUYS
MEET WITH SAKUYA.

202
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,833
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
THAT WE'RE EVER GOING TO

203
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,958
BE ABLE TO SAVE THIS PLANET.

204
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:22,375
- WE'RE MEETING SAKUYA?
WHAT SHOULD WE DO THEN?

205
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,875
- DON'T KNOW.

206
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,833
THAT'S FOR
THE OLD MAN TO SAY.

207
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,083
- JUST BE THERE.

208
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,416
WHEN THE DECISION
HAS FINALLY BEEN MADE,

209
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,166
ALL WILL BE
SET IN MOTION.

210
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,625
FROM THAT POINT ON,
THERE WILL BE NO TURNING BACK.

211
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,000
- ( sighs )

212
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,041
- MM.

213
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,375
- ( murmuring )

214
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,166
- Maeter:
IS MAMA GONNA GO AWAY SOMEWHERE?

215
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,416
- I DON'T WANT THAT.

216
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,541
I DON'T WANT MAMA
TO LEAVE WITHOUT US EVER.

217
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,875
- ME NEITHER.

218
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,416
- Dominic:
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS.

219
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,708
IT'S JUST A HYPOTHESIS FOR
INFORMATION QUANTUM MECHANICS.

220
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,250
- ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS
BY THE MEMBERS OF AGEHA,

221
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,583
IT SEEMS THAT IT IS
NOT JUST A THEORY.

222
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,916
THIS MEANS THAT WE ARE
ON THE EDGE RIGHT NOW.

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,083
HOW THINGS WILL TURN OUT
FROM HERE ON,

224
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,083
WHETHER OR NOT
THE WORLD WILL END,

225
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,375
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON WHAT
WE DO AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

226
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,250
AND HOW WE ALL ACT.

227
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,750
- IMPOSSIBLE.

228
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,333
- ( chuckles )

229
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,000
SCUB CORALS COPY
EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS

230
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,666
AND TURNS IT INTO INFORMATION.

231
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,083
THEN AFTER
THE MATERIAL PLAIN COLLAPSES,

232
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,500
THEY WILL HEAD TO THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE EVENT HORIZON

233
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,750
TO BEGIN AN ENTIRELY
NEW EXISTENCE.

234
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,291
- THE LAST CHAPTER
OF THE AGEHA PROJECT.

235
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,708
RIGHT, SIR?

236
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,625
- IT JUST MEANS THAT ADROC
FORESAW WHAT WAS COMING.

237
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,250
EVEN HOW THE SCUB CORALS
WILL FINALLY DECIDE

238
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,125
UPON THE MOMENT
WHEN WE HAVE SURPASSED

239
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,958
THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT
OF QUESTIONS.

240
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,166
- HUH?
- UTTER NONSENSE.

241
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,916
- FIRST OF ALL,
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,916
WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN REACHED
IF THE SCUB CORALS

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,666
HAD NOT ARRIVED
ON THIS PLANET.

244
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,291
WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO BOARD
AN ARK TOGETHER WITH INTRUDERS

245
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,750
THAT NEVER ONCE APOLOGIZED
FOR THEIR ACTIONS?

246
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:11,125
I CHOOSE TO LIVE
ON THIS LAND FOREVER.

247
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,458
EVEN IF IT MEANS
DESTROYING THE ARK.

248
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,958
- HUH?  COLONEL...

249
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,291
- WHAT IS THE CURRENT
STATUS OF OUR TROOPS?

250
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,875
- SIR!  THE ATTACK SQUAD
IS ALREADY ON ITS WAY

251
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,333
TO THE VODARA SHRINE.

252
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,000
- THE GALAXY WILL
GO THERE AS WELL.

253
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,666
I HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL
THAT I WANT IT TO DO.

254
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,000
- I MAY BE OUT OF LINE...

255
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,333
BUT PLEASE STOP REFERRING
TO ANEMONE AS AN "IT."

256
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,000
SHE HAS A PERSONALITY
OF HER OWN, YOU KNOW.

257
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,541
- ( laughing )

258
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,833
THAT'S TRUE.

259
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,166
IT'S JUST AS YOU SAY,

260
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,708
SHE HAS A PERSONALITY
OF HER OWN NOW.

261
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,000
I WAS ABOUT TO
FORGET THAT.

262
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,291
THANK YOU.

263
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,208
- ( gasps )

264
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,416
GULLIVER?

265
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,375
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

266
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,750
- SO THIS IS THE HEADQUARTERS
OF THE VODARAC.

267
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,416
- WHERE MISS SAKUYA LIVES.

268
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,666
- ( camera shutter clicking )

269
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,291
- I REALLY WANTED TO
SEE THIS ONCE IN MY LIFE.

270
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,458
AMAZING.

271
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,958
- DO YOU MEAN THE LOVE PARADE?

272
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,000
IT'S FROM AN ANCIENT STORY.

273
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,208
- THE ONE THAT WAS BORN IS NOT
A TRUE SAINT OF THE VODARAC,

274
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,666
AND YET THEY DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

275
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,625
- Norb:
DOESN'T THE MIYOTO SECT REALIZE

276
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,791
THAT THE REASON WHY SAKUYA
CLOSED HER HEART

277
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,000
WAS TO PROTECT THIS PLACE?

278
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,666
THEY REALLY ARE IDIOTS.

279
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,791
- A HUGE WALL.

280
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,458
- Eureka:
ON THE OTHER SIDE...

281
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,291
- Renton:
MISS SAKUYA IS WAITING.

282
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,500
- Both: HMM.

283
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,666
- LADY SAKUYA,

284
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,375
BLESSED ONE WHO CARRIES
THE BURDEN OF ALL OUR SINS

285
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,833
UPON HER WISE SHOULDERS,

286
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,791
THE SAINT, NEWLY BORN,

287
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,625
WILL ARRIVE
AT YOUR EXALTED FEET.

288
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,833
- ( gasps )

289
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,500
- WOW.

290
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,500
- GEE, I WONDER WHERE
WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

291
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,000
- LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK.

292
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,500
- Maurice:
LEAVE IT ALONE, LINCK.

293
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,333
- I'M JUST GONNA TAKE
A PEEK OUTSIDE.

294
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,375
- ( gasps )

295
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,166
- SIT STILL.
WE'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT.

296
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,333
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

297
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,291
- NO, I DON'T WANNA!

298
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,625
( shouts )

299
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,625
- ( gasps )
- HUH?

300
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,208
- ( all gasp )
- HMM?

301
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,000
- ( crowd gasping,
chattering )

302
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,875
- WHAT THE--?

303
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,750
- Woman:
IT'S THE WHITE DEVIL!

304
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,416
- RUN FOR IT!
- ( crowd screaming )

305
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,208
- THIS IS ALICE-1.

306
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,125
CRESCENT RABBIT,
TEA TIME, TEA TIME!

307
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,708
- ( screaming )

308
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,375
- THIS IS RED QUEEN,
ROGER.

309
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,291
- THE KING'S WITH YOU TOO.

310
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,583
- THIS IS CRESCENT RABBIT,
ROGER THAT.

311
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,583
HUMPTY, DON'T YOU BE
RUNNING LATE. YOU COPY?

312
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,750
- YEAH, I WON'T.

313
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,291
- ( gasps )

314
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

315
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,833
- SORRY, MAMA.

316
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,791
- LEAVE THAT FOR LATER.
LET'S GO.

317
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,583
MASTER NORB!

318
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,625
- ( grunts )

319
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,333
- ( grunting )

320
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,500
- ( all gasp )

321
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,458

322
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,583
- YEAH.

323
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,583
- I'M SCARED.

324

WE'RE GOING TO CREATE
A DEFENSE LINE HERE.

328
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,833

WE'RE GONNA DEFEND THIS PLACE.

00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,583
- THOSE ARE...

333
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,458
- SOME MISGUIDED FOOLS.

334
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,916
THEY ALL MELDED WITH
COMPAC DRIVES

335
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,375
TO TRY TO OPEN
SAKUYA'S HEART BACK UP,

336
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,041
AND DIED IN THE PROCESS.

- ( gasps )

338
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,000
- NONE OF THEM COULD
POSSIBLY BE SAINTS.

339
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,833
THIS IS A COLLECTION OF FOOLS
WITH NO VALUE.

340
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,041
- THEY'RE A BUNCH
OF DEAD PEOPLE?

341
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,583

WE'RE AT A DEAD END.
THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO.

347
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,833
- HOLD ON A MINUTE.

348
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,000

IT'S GOTTEN BRIGHTER.  HUH?

352
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,625
- ( whimpering )

353
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,125
- LISTEN, EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

354
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,458
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

355
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,666
- ( grunts )
HEY, MASTER NORB,

356
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,458
WOULD YOU MIND
WARNING US NEXT TIME?

357
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,833
HUH?

358
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,875
HEY, UM, WAIT, MASTER NORB.

359
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,666
DON'T DO THAT.
IT'S DANGEROUS.

360
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,750
THIS DEEP DOWN UNDERGROUND,
THE TRAPARS COULD--

361
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,416
- DON'T WORRY.
THERE ARE NO TRAPARS DOWN HERE.

362
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,375
- HUH?

363
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,666
BUT WHY?

364
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,958
- RIGHT NOW IN THAT FORM,

365
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,916
TRAPARS ARE
NOTHING BUT POISON.

366
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,291
AT LEAST FOR SAKUYA.

367
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,791
- EUREKA.

368
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,333

369
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,833

UM, I CAN'T SEE
ANYTHING IN HERE.

378
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,541

380
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,291
