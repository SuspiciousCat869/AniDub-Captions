1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,958
- Hap:
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

4
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,958
THE GREAT WALL IS ONLY
A SHORT DISTANCE FROM HERE.

5
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,500
AND YET-- AND YET...

6
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,166
WHY THE HELL
DO WE HAVE TO STOP HERE

7
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,250
AND PLAY
A GAME OF SOCCER?!

8
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,416
- Hilda: HOLD ON.
ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,708
- Stoner: YEAH.
SERIOUS AS I CAN BE.

10
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,708
DEAD SERIOUS.
- Hilda: ARE YOU NUTS?

11
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,208
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT WE'RE
ON THE WANTED LIST RIGHT NOW?

12
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,250
YOU GUYS DO KNOW THAT
WE CAN'T STAY HERE

13
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,625
FOR VERY LONG, DON'T YOU?

14
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,000
- I WONDER IF THERE'S
A CORRELATION BETWEEN SOCCER

15
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,541
AND THE MYSTERIES OF
THE GREAT WALL.

16
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,375
- NOBODY WOULD BE AGAINST
THE IDEA IF WE COULD FIND ONE.

17
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,375
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

18
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,583
- THE BIG PROBLEM IS
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR RENTON

19
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,875
AND EUREKA TO PLAY SOCCER
ALL BY THEMSELVES,

20
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,916
EVEN IF IT'S ONLY A GAME
OF FUTSAL.

21
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,041
- I DON'T WANNA PLAY!

22
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,375
I'VE NEVER EVEN DONE IT BEFORE.

23
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,041
- I'LL PASS TOO.

24
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,916
- Holland: I THOUGHT SO.
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,250
- MM?

26
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,666
- BECAUSE MASTER NORB SAID

27
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,333
THAT DOING THIS IS PART
OF THE PATH TO THE GREAT WALL.

28
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:47,125
- HOLLAND, COME ON,
YOU REALLY BELIEVE HIM?

29
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,583
I DON'T WANNA SAY THIS
SO FAR INTO THINGS,

30
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,583
BUT MAYBE THAT OLD MAN ISN'T
THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING AT ALL.

31
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,583
- NOW THAT'S EVEN MORE
RIDICULOUS.

32
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,750
THIS IS MASTER NORB--YOU SAW
THE COMPAC ON HIS CHEST, RIGHT?

33
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,666
- YEAH, BUT STILL...

34
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,958
- COME TO THINK OF IT,

35
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,125
YOU WERE NEVER ANY GOOD
AT SPORTS WITH BALLS.

36
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,625
- THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING--

37
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,000
- Renton: COME ON, GUYS!
LET'S DO IT!

38
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,500
FOR A WHILE NOW
I HAVEN'T SEEMED TO BE ABLE

39
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,083
TO SIT STILL AND STAY CALM
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I TRIED.

40
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,916
I MEAN, I'VE REALLY WANTED
TO MOVE AROUND

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,125
AND GET IT
OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

42
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,083
- I SEE...

43
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:28,041
SO YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?
YOU'VE GROWN UP.

44
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,166
- REALLY, HOLLAND?
- LISTEN, RENTON.

45
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,000
IN A VERY SHORT TIME,
YOU AND EUREKA

46
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,583
ARE GONNA HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER
TO GET PAST THE GREAT WALL.

47
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,916
THIS IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES
LEADING TO IT.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,666
IT'S IMPORTANT.
I WANT YOU TO PASS IT.

49
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,500
THINK YOU CAN DO IT?

50
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,416
- YEAH!

51
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,958
- THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.

52
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,916
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO
A QUICK WARM-UP.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,875
- RIGHT.
- ( both panting )

54
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,958
- THERE ARE TWO IDIOTS HERE.

55
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,375
HEY, NORB!

56
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,125
I WANNA TALK TO YOU.
WHERE ARE YOU?!

57
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,666
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU SAY TO THEM?!

58
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,625
- ( snoring )

59
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,500
- ( ball bouncing )
- ( groaning )

60
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,333
- AMAZING!
- HUH?

61
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,250
- THAT WAS A REALLY NEAT TRICK.

62
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,083
- OH, WELL, IT'S NOT
REALLY SOMETHING

63
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,000
THAT YOU WOULD CALL A TRICK.

64
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,666
- GIVE IT TO ME!
LET ME TRY!

65
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,541
- WHY?  YOU'LL NEVER BE
ABLE TO DO IT.

66
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,541
- I SEE.
SO YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE?

67
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,041
- YEAH, A LITTLE,
BEFORE I STARTED TO LIFT.

68
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,208
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE
A TEAM AT BELLFOREST.

69
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,000
AND NOBODY AROUND THERE
LIKED TO PLAY.

70
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,500
SO I WAS ALWAYS HAVING
TO PLAY ALL BY MYSELF.

71
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,500
- OH, I SEE.

72
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,041
- IT SEEMS LIKE
THINGS ARE BEGINNING

73
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,500
TO GET KIND OF STRANGE.

74
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,041
- YEAH.
- HEY, I FORGOT TO ASK.

75
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,833
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED SOCCER
BEFORE?

76
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,875
- NO, I HAVEN'T.

77
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,125
BUT IF I'M WITH YOU, RENTON,

78
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,291
I'M POSITIVE THAT
I'LL BE ABLE TO LEARN HOW.

79
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,708
WILL YOU PLEASE TEACH ME?

80
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,750
- YEAH, OF COURSE!

81
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,083
HEY, GIVE ME THE BALL!
GIVE ME THE BALL!

82
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,083
- ( kids groan )
- WHAT IS IT, RENTON?

83
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,583
- I'LL TEACH ALL OF YOU GUYS
TOGETHER.

84
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,250
COME ON OVER HERE.
COME ON.

85
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,291
- REALLY?
ALL RIGHT!

86
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,875
- ( clears throat )

87
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,625
NOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN IT COMES

88
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,291
TO PLAYING
THE GAME OF SOCCER IS THIS--

89
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,583
- Man: HEY!
- HUH?

90
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,583
- HUH?

91
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,583
- ( sighs )
HOLLAND'S CALLING FOR YOU.

92
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,750
- HOLLAND IS?

93
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,708
( sighs )

94
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,708
- Hap: WHAT IS THIS?

95
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,708
- YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF.
IT'S A SPECIAL SCHEDULE.

96
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,916
- HEY, COME ON NOW.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,708
I'M ONE OF THE PLAYERS,
YOU KNOW?

98
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,708
- LIKE I SAID TO YOU EARLIER,
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

99
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,500
- HEY, HOW COME OUR LEADER'S
NAME ISN'T ON THE LIST?

100
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,833
- WHAT'S A SUPPORTER
SUPPOSED TO DO?

101
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,666
- APPARENTLY, TEND TO
THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SUPPORT

102
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,458
OF ALL THE PLAYERS IN THE GAME.

103
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,750
- I KNOW.  WHAT I'M ASKING IS
WHAT I NEED TO DO FOR THAT.

104
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,041
- HEY, HOLLAND,
CAN I ASK ONE THING?

105
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,125
- HMM?

106
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,583
- YOU WROTE HERE THAT
WE'RE GONNA RUN

107
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,708
AND DO MUSCLE
TRAINING AND STUFF,

108
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,458
BUT YOU NEGLECTED TO SAY
FOR HOW LONG.

109
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,958
- ( groans deeply )

110
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,166
- ( snoring )

111
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,750
- ( sighs )

112
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,166
SO ARE YOU GUYS UP FOR IT
OR NOT?!

113
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,291
- WE'RE TRYING TO TELL YOU
WE'RE NOT.

114
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,708
- LOOK, LEADER, I
REALLY DIDN'T WANNA

115
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,208
HAVE TO SAY THIS TO YOU,
BUT DON'T YOU THINK

116
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,541
YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN A
PRETTY GOOD REASON TO ASK NORB

117
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,291
WHY IT'S SO DAMN IMPORTANT
FOR ALL OF US TO PLAY SOCCER?

118
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,291
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

119
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,583
EVERYTHING WE'RE
DOING IS SO THAT

120
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,166
WE CAN GET OVER THE GREAT WALL.

121
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,291
- NO GOOD.
HE TOTALLY BELIEVES IT.

122
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,916
- NORB!

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
- HMM?

124
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,500
- YOU GOTTA TELL US.

125
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,833
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW
WHY YOU SAY

126
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,458
THAT ALL OF US
HAVE TO PLAY SOCCER.

127
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,000
- I TOLD YOU.
IT'S TO GET OVER--

128
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,375
- HOLLAND,
JUST BE QUIET, ALL RIGHT?!

129
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,333
NOW, I WANT YOU TO
ANSWER US, NORB!

130
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,708
GIVE US A REASON
THAT'LL SATISFY ALL OF US.

131
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,666
- ( snoring softly )

132
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,666
( chuckles )

133
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,333
- All: HUH?

134
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,666
- I DON'T GET IT.
WHY ARE YOU GRINNING?

135
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,208
- IT MEANS,
"BEST NOT TO ASK."

136
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,208
- ( techno music playing )

137
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,208
- ( panting )

138
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,916
- ( panting )

139
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,916
( grunts, shouts )

140
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,750
- ( shouts )

141
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,375
- NO!

142
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,833
- ( whistle tweets )
- ( cheering )

143
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,375
- ALL RIGHT!
- OH.

144
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,750
- WOW, DON'T YOU THINK
RENTON IS AMAZING?

145
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,000
- HE'S REALLY GOOD.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

146
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,333
- NO GOOD.

147
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,750
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH HIM.

148
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,541
JEEZ, SOMEONE HURRY UP
AND TAKE OVER ALREADY!

149
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,041
- YOU KNOW EVERYONE IS SAYING
THAT YOU'RE GOOD, RENTON.

150
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,541
- IT'S REALLY NOT TRUE.

151
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,375
I MEAN, I WAS PLAYING AGAINST
MISS HILDA AND MR. JOBS.

152
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,416
THEY'RE BOTH COMPLETELY NEW
TO THIS.

153
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,916
LET'S FACE IT--
ANYBODY COULD GET PAST THEM.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,541
- ( giggles )

155
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,416
- WHAT?

156
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
- NO, IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

157
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,708
- COME ON!
DON'T LEAVE ME WONDERING.

158
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,666
- I TOLD YOU, RENTON,
IT'S NOTHING.

159
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,416
- HEY!

160
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,416
IT'S ABOUT TIME TO BEGIN.

161
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,916
- ( whistle tweets )

162
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,916
- ( growls )

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,375
- HEH.

164
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,791
- ( laughing )

165
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,041
- GIDGET, LOOK OUT!

166
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,541
- AAH!

167
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,500
- REALLY BIG PANTHER SHOT!

168
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,291
- ( whistle tweets )
- ( gasping )

169
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,791
- HEY, RENTON,
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

170
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:10,916
( laughs )

171
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,625
( humming a tune )

172
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,958
( giggling )

173
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,708
- OH, DON'T MIND HIM, RENTON.

174
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,875
- ( growls )

175
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,958
- RENTON?

176
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,000
- ( whistle tweets )
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.

177
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,125
- NOT GOOD, HUH?
- YEAH, NOT GOOD.

178
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,791
- WELL, HOW IS IT NOT GOOD?

179
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,666
- I'VE DONE A THOROUGH
ANALYSIS OF WHAT NORB IS TRYING

180
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,375
TO ACCOMPLISH
WITH THIS PLAN OF HIS.

181
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,708
I THINK WHAT HE'S TRYING
TO DO IS HELP RID RENTON

182
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,875
OF ANY EVIL THOUGHTS
THAT MIGHT ENTER HIS MIND

183
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,333
AND HINDER HIM WHEN HE TRIES TO
ENTER THE GREAT WALL.

184
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,666
- EVIL THOUGHTS?
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

185
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,208
- YOU KNOW,
THE KIND OF THOUGHTS YOU GET

186
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,791
BECAUSE YOU'RE A TEENAGER.

187
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THOSE THOUGHTS.

188
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,916
- OH, NOW I GET IT.

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,916
WE HAVE TO DO THIS
SO THAT RENTON CAN GET RID OF

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,458
THAT THING YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG

191
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,166
BY GETTING IT OUT
THROUGH SPORTS.

192
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,583
- THAT'S MOST LIKELY IT.
- AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

193
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,208
THIS IS NOT LOOKING GOOD
AT ALL.

194
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,458
RIGHT NOW, RENTON IS
MENTALLY CORNERED,

195
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,166
ESSENTIALLY BEING FORCED
TO FACE OFF AGAINST DOGGIE

196
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,291
WHO'S OBVIOUSLY
MUCH BETTER THAN HE IS.

197
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,083
- THE PRESENCE
OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS

198
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,416
THAT ARE UNCONSCIOUSLY
TURNED AGAINST ONESELF

199
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,208
INCREASES PHYSICAL
PERSISTENCE THAT CAN

200
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,541
STUNT HEALTHY
EMOTIONAL GROWTH.

201
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,166
- YEAH, AND IF
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH,

202
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,041
HE'S STARTING TO GET A LOT OF
EMOTIONAL PRESSURE FROM EUREKA.

203
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,041
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SOMETHING
WILL HAPPEN AS A RESULT.

204
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,375
- YOU THINK SOMETHING
WILL HAPPEN?

205
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,541
- YOU BET.
THE CHANCES ARE VERY LIKELY

206
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,250
THAT SOMETHING WILL.

207
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,666
- ( groans deeply )

208
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,625
- ( all panting )

209
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,416
- I'M GONNA TAKE
ALL OF MY PAST ANGER

210
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,041
OUT ON HIM RIGHT NOW.

211
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,416
AAH!

212
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,958
- ( guys grunt, groan )

213
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,708
- OH.

214
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,375
- ( cheering )
- RENTON!

215
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,291
- OH...

216
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,958
- RENTON, PASS IT TO ME!

217
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,875
- RENTON, PASS IT!

218
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,875
- YOU'RE HOLDING THE BALL
TOO LONG!

219
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,541
PASS IT RIGHT NOW!

220
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,125
- HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
THE POSSIBILITY?

221
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,458
- WHAT?

222
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,125
- THAT RENTON DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO PASS THE BALL?

223
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,958
- AAH!

224
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,083
GOLDEN FALCON SHOT!

225
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,708
- ( whistle tweet )

226
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,208
- WHOO-HOO!
( laughing )

227
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,666
- JEEZ, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING, RENTON?!

228
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,250
- ( breathing heavily )

229
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,291
- RENTON.

230
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,833
STOP JOKING AROUND.

231
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,625
- HERE'S TO RIGHT NOW.

232
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,291
- CHEERS, GUYS.

233
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,000
- AHH!
- MAN, IT'S GOOD.

234
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,125
- YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS NICE
TO HAVE AN ICE-COLD BEER

235
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,625
AFTER YOU SPENT
MOST OF THE DAY

236
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,125
WORKING UP A SWEAT
ON THE SOCCER FIELD.

237
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,125
- OR YOU COULD END UP
WITH THE GOUT.

238
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,833
- WELL, THAT WOULDN'T BE
GOOD AT ALL.

239
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:23,125
- MM.  ANYWAY,
WHAT ABOUT RENTON?

240
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,375
- WE WERE EXPECTING THIS
TO HAPPEN, BUT STILL,

241
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,500
IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS.

242
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,250
- SO I GUESS IT'S BAD
ALL AROUND.

243
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,916
- LET'S FACE IT--
NOTHING GOOD COULD POSSIBLY COME

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,583
FROM MAKING HIM LOSE
HIS SELF-CONFIDENCE NOW.

245
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,250
- YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING TO
REALIZE WHAT NORB'S THINKING IS

246
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,250
REGARDING ALL THIS.
- OH, YEAH?  DO TELL.

247
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,916
- IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE
HE JUST WANTS TO SEE

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,500
HOW EUREKA AND RENTON
WORK AS A PAIR.

249
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,416
- OH, THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

250
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,416
- BUT THE OLD MAN WAS ASLEEP
THE WHOLE TIME.

251
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,416
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
- YEAH, GOOD POINT.

252
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,875
- ARE YOU GUYS
THE ALL GEKKO TEAM?

253
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,541
- ( crying softly )

254
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,708
- I DON'T GET IT.
DID I DO SOMETHING BAD?

255
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,208
- NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
DOGGIE.

256
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,541
- ( panting )

257
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,458
WHERE'S HOLLAND?

258
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,375
- A GAME?

259
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,041
- MM-HMM.

260
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,041
- YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS!

261
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,041
- YEAH, AND WHERE DID YOU GET
THESE GUYS FROM, ANYWAY?

262
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,916
- SO, HOLLAND,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

263
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,583
- PLAY THE GAME.
- WHAT?  ARE YOU NUTS?

264
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,708
- WE ONLY HAVE
ONE PATH LEFT TO US

265
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,208
FOR GETTING THROUGH
THE GREAT WALL.

266
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,916
RIGHT, NORB?

267
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,250
- ( chuckling softly )

268
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,958
- ( grunts )
- NOW WAIT JUST A MINUTE!

269
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,500
DON'T BE FOOLED BY
THAT STUPID GRIN OF HIS.

270
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,458
- I'M ANNOUNCING
THE STARTING LINEUP.

271
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,708
- All:
HEY HEY HEY HEY!

272
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,250
YEAH!

273
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,708
- WHAT'S UP WITH THEM?
- Holland: LISTEN UP.

274
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,666
SINCE WE DECIDED
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS

275
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,833
NO MATTER WHO WE'RE UP AGAINST,

276
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,666
WE WILL WIN!
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, CIRCLE UP!

277
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,208
ALL GEKKOS!

278
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,875
FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON!

279
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,458
- ( Gekkos sigh, groan )

280
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,916
- KEEP YOUR HEADS IN THE GAME.
DON'T LET THEM PSYCH YOU OUT.

281
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,791
- HEY, HOLLAND, HOW COME YOU'RE
NOT IN THE STARTING LINEUP?

282
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,416
- HE'S JUST THAT KIND OF GUY.

283
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,416
- HAVE FUN, MAMA!
- PLAY GOOD, MOM!

284
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,416
- ( groans softly )

285
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,416
- I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE SO HARSH.

286
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,916
- ( chuckles weakly )

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
- DON'T WORRY, RENTON.

288
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,958
I'LL DO MY BEST TO
COVER FOR YOU.

289
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,250
- GAH!

290
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,166
- ( whistle tweets )

291
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,458
- ( all shout )

292
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,708
- AAH.
- ( grunting )

293
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,583
- AAH!
EUREKA, TAKE IT.

294
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,666
- ( screams )

295
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,416
- EUREKA!

296
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,875
- HEY, DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT?

297
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,625
WASN'T THAT TACKLE
AGAINST THE RULES?

298
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,125
- NO, IT JUST LOOKED THAT WAY
BECAUSE EUREKA'S SO SMALL.

299
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,166
THE TACKLE WAS NOT
AGAINST THE RULES.

300
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,166
THAT'S WHY THIS SPORT'S
OFTEN BEEN CALLED

301
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,083
MARTIAL ARTS
IN A GRASS FIELD.

302
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,375
- MARTIAL ARTS, HUH?

303
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,333
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING TO EUREKA?!

304
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,666
- ( chuckles smugly )

305
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,625
WHOA!

306
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,083
- ( whistle tweets )

307
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,083
- WHAT?

308
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,125
- HAS HE BECOME
A COMPLETE IDIOT?

309
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,416
- YOU'RE IN, STONER.

310
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,416
- I'M WHAT?

311
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,291
- HEY, YOU SAID
THIS WAS MARTIAL ARTS.

312
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,083
- I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

313
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,000
- ( whistle tweets )

314
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,000
- ( all scream )

315
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,333
- ( whistle tweets twice )

316
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,125
- ( both sigh )

317
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,333
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

318
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,041
- I'M GOING IN.

319
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,791
- ( whistle tweets twice )

320
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,791
- ( all groaning, panting )

321
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:01,375
- I'M SORRY. I SHOULD REALLY BE
DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB AT THIS.

322
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,875
- THINGS NEVER TURN OUT THIS WAY

323
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,375
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING
ALL BY YOURSELF.

324
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,833
- YEAH, REALLY.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

325
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,333
LOOK, GUYS, THIS ISN'T JUST
RENTON'S PROBLEM

326
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,083
OR EUREKA'S PROBLEM
ANY LONGER.

327
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,791
THIS CONCERNS THE PRIDE
OF GEKKOSTATE AS A WHOLE.

328
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,333
- MAKES SENSE.

329
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,000
- NOBODY HERE IS
GOING TO BE SATISFIED

330
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,041
UNTIL WE GET
AT LEAST ONE GOAL

331
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,791
- OKAY, I'M CHANGING PLANS.

332
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,791
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
A PLAN IN THE FIRST PLACE.

333
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,375
- SO, WHAT IS IT?
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, LEADER?

334
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,375
- WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEFEND!

335
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,416
- ( helicopter overhead )

336
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,000
- ALL RIGHT,
BRING IT ON!

337
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,083
- HEY, RENTON.

338
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,416
- ( whistle tweets )
- I BELIEVE IN YOU.

339
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,375
- HUH?

340
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,166
EUREKA!

341
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,791
- WE'RE MOVING UP.
- RIGHT!

342
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,875
- EUREKA, OVER HERE!

343
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,333
- DOGGIE!

344
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,291
- ( all grunting )

345
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,666
- RENTON!

346
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,916
- BROTHER DOGGIE!

347
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,291
- OH, NO, HE'S DOING
THAT THING WITH THE BALL AGAIN!

348
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,166
- RENTON!

349
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,500
PASS!
PASS THE BALL TO ME!

350
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,333
IT'S ALL RIGHT, RENTON.
YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU TRY.

351
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,041
- WHOA...

352
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:42,416
- RENTON PASSED
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

353
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,000
- ( shouting )

354
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,750
- EUREKA, OVER HERE!

355
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,583
- RENTON!

356
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,666
- ( growls )

357
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,208
- RENTON, BEHIND YOU!

358
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,458
- ( shouts )

359
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,500
- ( growls )

360
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,833
- ( grunts )

361
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,166
- THAT'S THE BALL THAT
EUREKA PASSED TO ME!

362
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,208
( shouts )
- ( panting )

363
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,166
- ( shouting )

364
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,000
- ( grunts )

365
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,666
- NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES!

366
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,041
- Eureka:
HOLLAND!

367
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,041
- HUH?

368
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,458
- I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP THIS
BALL NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!

369
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,666
( grunts )

370
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,666
- ( groans )

371
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,666
- ( shouts )

372
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,166
- WHAT THE--?!

373
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,166
- ( both shout )

374
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,208
- ( cheering )

375
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,166
- ALL RIGHT!
- YEAH!

376
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,666
- ( both laughing )

377
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,583
- ( siren blaring )
- HUH?

378
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,666
- FREEZE!

379
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,625
- All:
HUH?

380
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,166
- Holland:
WHAT ABOUT REFUELING?

381
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,208
- IT'S ALL DONE.
- WE'RE GONNA USE THE BOOSTERS.

382
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,708
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE GUYS OUTSIDE?

383
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,041
- Gidget: ALL WORKERS
HAVE ALREADY EVACUATED.

384
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,000
- ALL RIGHT, LAUNCH!

385
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,291
SO WHAT DID NORB WANT TO
ACCOMPLISH WITH ALL THIS?

386
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,208
- MAYBE ALL HE WANTED TO DO
WAS TEACH US THE TEAMWORK

387
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,333
THAT WE'LL NEED IN ORDER
TO GET PAST THE GREAT WALL.

388
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,125
- NO, PERHAPS IT WAS SO THAT
WE'D BE PREPARED IN CASE

389
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,500
SOMETHING UNEXPECTED WERE TO
HAPPEN TO US ON OUR JOURNEY.

390
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,916
- ISN'T WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE?

391
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,083
- SO, NOW THAT ALL IS
SAID AND DONE,

392
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,583
WHAT WAS IT?

393
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,625
- HMM?

394
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,000
ALL IS WELL IF YOU LEARN
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF

395
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,166
AND ALL IS STILL WELL EVEN IF
YOU COULDN'T LEARN ANYTHING.

396
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,833
AND BESIDES ALL THAT...

397
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,875
IT WAS FUN, WASN'T IT?

398
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,791
- ( sighs )

399
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,625
- ONE DAY...
- HMM?

400
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,833
- ...WE'LL COME BACK HERE AGAIN.

401
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,041
AND WE'LL GO UP AGAINST
THOSE GUYS WE PLAYED TODAY

402
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,208
ONE MORE TIME,

403
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,875
WITH NOT ONE PERSON
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

404
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,333
THE ENTIRE GEKKOSTATE
AS A WHOLE!

405
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,333
- ( all softly groan )

406
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,291
- ( chuckles )

407
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,833
- I'M SORRY YOU'RE HAVING TO

408
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,416
STICK AROUND HERE
WORKING LIKE THIS.

409
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,750
- NO, I STEPPED ON
HOLLAND'S FACE TOO.

410
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,250
IT'S ONLY RIGHT.

411
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,083
- ( laughs )

412
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,041
- ( both laughing )

413
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,833
- BY THE WAY, WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO ME ON THE FIELD,

414
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,666
WHEN THE SECOND-HALF WHISTLE
WAS BEING BLOWN?

415
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,625
- OH.

416
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,125
"I BELIEVE IN YOU."

417
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,375
- WHAT?

418
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,500
- I REMEMBERED THAT IN
IMPORTANT SITUATIONS,

419
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,041
YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO BE ABLE TO

420
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,750
CREATE MIRACLES
AND SAVE THE DAY.

421
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,708
SO...

422
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,916
- ( giggles )

423
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,541
- FROM THE CORALIAN ATTACK
OF OUR CAPITOL,

424
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,541
WE LOST TWO OF
THE GREAT FOUNDATIONS

425
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,125
OF OUR TROUBLED WORLD.

426
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,958
THEY WERE KILLED BY
THE CORALIANS,

427
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,416
WHOSE EXISTENCE
THEY KEPT HIDDEN.

428
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,875
IN A WAY,
YOU COULD SAY THEY EACH

429
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,291
GOT WHAT THEY DESERVED.

430
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,125
HOWEVER-- HOWEVER,
I HAD NOT WISHED FOR THEM

431
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,125
TO BE MURDERED
IN COLD BLOOD.

432
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,791
THEY, THE SAGES, SHOULD HAVE
APOLOGIZED TO ALL OF US.

433
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,458
THOUGH COME TO THINK OF IT NOW,
THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AGONIZED

434
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:56,958
BY THE GREAT REGRET THAT THEY
MOST CERTAINLY WERE FEELING.

435
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,791
NOW I HAVE BEEN GIVEN
A DIRECT ORDER BY CODA,

436
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,041
THE SOLE REMAINING SAGE
OF OUR WORLD.

437
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,583
TO STRIKE,
TO STRIKE IMMEDIATELY

438
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,250
AND DECISIVELY.
AND SO I ASK AGAIN

439
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,916
FOR THE FULL DEPLOYMENT
OF THE AGEHA SQUAD.

440
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,750
WE SHALL ATTACK DEEP INTO
THE HEART OF THE GREAT WALL,

441
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,750
WHERE THE CORALIAN BASE
IS LOCATED

442
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,916
AND EXTERMINATE THEM
FROM EXISTENCE!

443
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,916
- ( cheering )

444
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,958
- Renton and Eureka:
TO BE CONTINUED.

445
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:32,416
- ( theme music playing )

446
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:39,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

447
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,875
- Narrator: THE GEKKO ARRIVES
AT THE GATE

448
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,666
THAT LEADS TO THE FUTURE.

449
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,875
IN A LIGHT THAT SHINES
UPON THE SHADOWS,

450
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,708
THE BOY AND GIRL ENCOUNTER
THEIR DESTINED RENDEZVOUS.

451
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,791
NEXT EPISODE...

452
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,583
"THE COSMIC TRIGGER."
