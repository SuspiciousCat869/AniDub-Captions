1
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:31,541
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,541
- Man: I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

3
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,541
TO THINK THAT SOMETHING
LIKE THIS WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

4
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,916
- Man #2: YES, BUT THE REPORT
SPEAKS THE TRUTH.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,833
- THE typeZERO HAS AWAKENED,

6
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,750
AND THE SEVEN SWELL EFFECT
THAT FOLLOWED WAS INCREDIBLE.

7
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,958
- EVERYTHING WORKED
EXACTLY AS PREDICTED

8
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,541
IN THOSE BLUEPRINTS.

9
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,666
THE MONARCH PROJECT.

10
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,541
THE LEGENDARY PROJECT BLUEPRINT

11
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,291
AUTHORED BY
DR. ADROC THURSTON.

12
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,916
BUT WASN'T THAT DOCUMENT

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DESTROYED
LONG AGO?

14
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,416
- I THINK WE SHOULD
BE CURSING OUR PAST.

15
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,416
ARE YOU TELLING ME NOW THAT

16
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,791
ITS GHOST STANDS
BEFORE US ONCE AGAIN?

17
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,083
- Woman: IN ANY CASE,
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

18
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,291
DON'T YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE WISE

19
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,291
TO TAKE SOME SORT OF ACTION?

20
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,541
- NOW WAIT.
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS

21
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,625
ABOUT CALLING THAT MAN BACK
WITH A SUMMONS.

22
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,958
- OF COURSE.
AFTER ALL, HE'S THE ONLY ONE

23
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,666
THAT CAN ACT WITH THE NECESSARY
CALM AND PRECISION.

24
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,750
I AM CERTAIN
WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT.

25
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,833
( snaps )

26
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,875
- WHAT COULD YOU BE THINKING?

27
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,875
YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
WE SEALED HIM AWAY

28
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,791
WITH OUR OWN HANDS?
HOW COULD YOU?

29
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,666
- WHAT ARE YOU
BABBLING ON ABOUT?

30
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,458
REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE MAY HAVE
DONE TO HIM IN THE PAST,

31
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,000
THIS MAN WHO TOOK OVER
ADROC THURSTON'S PLAN

32
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,750
TO ADVANCE THE MONARCH PROJECT

33
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,333
IS THE MAN THAT WE NEED
RIGHT NOW FOR OUR PURPOSES.

34
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:59,583
- ( sighs )
YES, COMMANDER DEWEY NOVAK.

35
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,625
ARE YOU SURE
THIS WILL BE ALL RIGHT?

36
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:05,083
- HMM.  IF WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE THE POWER TO BITE BACK,

37
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,000
IT'LL BE IMPOSSIBLE
TO DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION.

38
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,791
- Newscaster: ALL LANDS SOUTH,
SOUTHERN WINDS PREVAILING,

39
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,916
WIND FORCE ONE.
TRANSPARENCE LIGHT PARTICLES...

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,083
- IT'S SO PEACEFUL.

41
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,625
- WELL, IN THIS AREA, THE ONLY
PLACE YOU CAN FIND GOOD TRAPAR

42
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,166
IS ABOVE
THE HIGH-ALTITUDE LEY LINES.

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,916
SO WE MAY AS WELL
JUST KICK BACK AND RELAX.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,416
HEY, THIS CHICK'S HOT!

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,458
- ...FOR A SPECIAL NEWS UPDATE
CONCERNING...

46
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,958
- HUH?
- ...A RECENT TECTONIC SHIFT...

47
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,458
- TURN IT UP!
- GOT IT!

48
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,458
- ...5:26 A.M.,
A MAJOR TECTONIC SHIFT

49
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:40,458
WAS DETECTED AT UNDERGROUND .70
IN THE SAN ALTHIS MOUNTAINS.

50
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,416
- WELL?
- LOOKS GOOD.

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,625
CHECK IT OUT.

52
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,500
NOT TOO FAR
FROM WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

53
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:49,875
- OH!  STROHOLM, HUH?
- YEAH.

54
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,666
A PLACE THAT'S FAMOUS
FOR HAVING A GEYSER.

55
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,708
- WHY AM I HERE?

56
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,791
SEVEN DAYS
SINCE LEAVING BELLFOREST.

57
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,000
SEVEN DAYS
SINCE I BOARDED THE GEKKO.

58
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,083
AND SEVEN DAYS SINCE I STARTED
STAYING WITH THE GEKKOSTATE,

59
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,250
THE GUYS
I LOOKED UP TO SO MUCH.

60
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,958
IT'S TRUE THAT
BEING WITH THE PEOPLE

61
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,291
THAT I'VE LOOKED UP TO,

62
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,750
BEING WITH HOLLAND
AND THE OTHERS, MAKES ME HAPPY.

63
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,375
BUT I'VE BEEN WITH THEM
FOR SEVEN DAYS,

64
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,500
YET NONE OF THEM
EVER TRY TO LIFT.

65
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,875
THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM
TO WANT TO LIFT.

66
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,250
BUT IN SPITE OF THAT,

67
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,250
I REALLY HAVE NO RIGHT
TO COMPLAIN.

68
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,250
AFTER ALL,
I'M STILL IN TRAINING.

69
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,000
BESIDES, I HAVE TO LOOK AFTER
THE AMITA DRIVE,

70
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,250
THE KEEPSAKE OF MY DAD,
THAT I INSTALLED

71
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,041
ONTO THIS L.F.O.,
THE NIRVASH.

72
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,541
I HAVE TO STAY HERE
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO IT

73
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,000
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
I CAN PAY MY GRANDPA BACK

74
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,708
FOR LETTING ME
LEAVE LIKE THAT.

75
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,000
BUT... ( aloud ) I REALLY WANT
TO GET OUT THERE AND LIFT.

76
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,041
- Talho: HEY, RENTON,
YOU UP THERE?

77
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,375
- OH, YEAH!

78
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
LOUNGING AROUND LIKE THAT?

79
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,208
I TOLD YOU
I WANTED YOU TO HELP ME

80
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,000
AFTER YOU WERE DONE
CLEANING THE DINING HALL.

81
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,083
JEEZ!
YOU'RE SO SLOW.

82
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,916
- SORRY.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,333
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

84
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,958
AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THIS THING?  HUH?

85
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,333
- THERE ARE TWO COMPAC DRIVES
IN THE FRIDGE.

86
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,958
I WANT YOU TO DELIVER THEM
TO THE WORKSHOP RIGHT AWAY.

87
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,875
- HUH?  WHY WOULD A COMPAC DRIVE
BE IN A FRIDGE?

88
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,916
- WHAT'S WRONG?
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,416
- NO, I JUST--

90
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,416
I'LL DO IT RIGHT NOW.

91
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,916
- DON'T FORGET TO GET HOLLAND'S
SIGNATURE ON THE RECEIPT!

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,958
- YEAH, I KNOW.

93
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,416
THIS IS STARTING TO SUCK.

94
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,916
- LIFTING?

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,958
WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE I WANT TO.
- CAN'T DO IT.

96
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,083
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN STOP IN A PORT

97
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,958
ANYWHERE NEAR
A GOOD LIFTING SPOT,

98
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,708
CONSIDERING
OUR MONEY SITUATION.

99
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,750
- WHAT?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

100
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,541
- YEAH, WELL, YOU SEE--
- HMM?

101
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,458
- IN ORDER TO USE AN AIRPORT,

102
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,250
EVERY SHIP NEEDS
TO PAY A USAGE FEE.

103
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,041
AND AT THE MOMENT,
WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

104
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,208
SAVED UP
TO PAY FOR THAT KIND OF THING.

105
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,166
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

106
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,625
- Holland: ALL RIGHT,
TAKE TWO OF 'EM.

107
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:09,708
TELL ME, KID, DO YOU GOT
ANY LEADS ON GETTING US MONEY?

108
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,458
- Renton: IN OTHER WORDS,
THE GEKKOSTATE IS DEAD BROKE.

109
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,041
GRANDPA USED TO ALWAYS TELL ME

110
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,083
THAT REALITY IS
DIFFERENT FROM MY IDEALS.

111
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,125
HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

112
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,458
BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING
THAT I ALREADY UNDERSTOOD

113
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,875
AND HAD BEEN TOTALLY PREPARED
TO ACCEPT.

114
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,958
BUT SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT.

115
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,458
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
ABOUT ALL THIS.

116
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,833
WHY DID IT HAVE TO END UP
LIKE THIS?

117
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,916
IT'S DEPRESSING.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,166
( grunts ) HEY!

119
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,958
- ( spits )
- DAMN IT!

120
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,875
COME BACK HERE!
HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE!

121
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,041
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
NEWBIE?

122
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,666
- WELL, HELLO, RENTON.
YOUR TIMING'S PERFECT.

123
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,875
CAN YOU COME WITH ME
FOR A BIT?

124
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:58,291
UM, WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

125
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,250
WE HAVE TO DO ALL SORTS
OF TESTS ON YOU, YOU KNOW.

126
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,583
- REALLY? WHY?
- WHENEVER YOU'RE NEXT TO IT,

127
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,666
THE NIRVASH
SEEMS TO PERFORM BETTER.

128
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,000
WELL, AT LEAST
THAT'S WHAT EUREKA SAID.

129
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,500
- HUH?  EUREKA?

130
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,416
- Eureka: MISCHA?
- HMM?

131
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,333
- ARE YOU READY TO BEGIN?
- YES, JUST ABOUT.

132
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,083
I HAVE TO FINISH
THIS PAPERWORK.  HUH?

133
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,083
- ( squealing )

134
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,583
- WHAT ARE YOU
SO EMBARRASSED ABOUT?

135
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:27,333
ALL RIGHT, EUREKA,
IT'S JUST A SIMPLE TEST TODAY,

136
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,375
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PUSH YOURSELF TOO HARD.

137
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,541
- ROGER.

138
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,375
- CAN YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THE REACTION...

139
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,958
- ( thinking ) WHAT IS THIS?

140
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,875
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

141
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,875
BUT SOMEHOW THIS COCKPIT
FEELS SO STIFLING RIGHT NOW.

142
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,416
IT'S TRUE THAT I'M FLYING
HIGH UP IN THE SKY...

143
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,208
- Eureka: IT LOOKS GOOD.
- Mischa: I SEE.

144
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,208
ALL RIGHT THEN, RENTON?
- ...BUT, SIS,

145
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,708
THE SKY I'M SEEING
FROM UP HERE SOMEHOW

146
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,125
DOESN'T SEEM REAL.
- Mischa: RENTON?  RENTON?!

147
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,041
- UH, YES?

148
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,041
- WE CAN'T HAVE YOU
SPACING OUT IN THERE.

149
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,041
DID YOU CHECK OUT
THE AMITA DRIVE YET?

150
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,375
- UH, YES.
IT'S DOING FINE.

151
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,208
- GOOD.  PLEASE GO AHEAD.

152
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,083
- ( sighs )

153
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,708
HEY, EUREKA?
- WHAT IS IT?

154
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,416
- IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I CHANGE
THE CANOPY TO INVISIBLE MODE?

155
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,208
- WHAT FOR?

156
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,083
- SOMEHOW IT FEELS
REALLY STUFFY IN HERE.

157
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,916
- THE AIR CONDITIONING
SEEMS TO BE WORKING PROPERLY.

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,916
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,916
I FEEL LIKE--
LIKE I'M GONNA CHOKE

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,875
WHEN I SEE THE SKY
THROUGH A MONITOR.

161
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,125
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, RENTON.
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

162
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,208
- WILL I REALLY?
- EUREKA PROCEEDING TO...

163
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,208
- AM I REALLY GOING
TO GET USED TO THIS,

164
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,833
LIKE EUREKA SAYS?

165
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:38,250
- Mischa: LOOK-- IT'S ALMOST
AS IF IT'S BEEN REBORN SOMEHOW.

166
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,041
ALL RESPONSES SHOW VALUES
ABOVE THE BASIC AVERAGE

167
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,125
AND THE OCCURRENCE
OF THE SEVEN SWELL EFFECT.

168
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,750
- Holland:
WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE

169
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,750
CAUSING ALL OF THIS, DOCTOR?

170
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,916
CAN IT BE THAT RENTON
REALLY IS--

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,916
- I KNOW IT'S NOT
JUST THE AMITA DRIVE,

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,625
THOUGH I DON'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT IT.

173
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,208
THE typeZERO STILL HOLDS
MANY MYSTERIES.

174
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,958
AND BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT THOSE ARE,

175
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,916
I LEFT THE MILITARY
WITH EUREKA

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,083
AND I'M WORKING WITH YOU NOW.

177
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,083
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GOING TO BE SATISFIED

178
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,291
IF THIS ALL TURNS OUT
TO BE SIMPLE.

179
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,875
- HMM.
WELL, I GUESS IN ANY CASE,

180
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,125
WE'LL HAVE THE TWO OF THEM
PILOT IT TOGETHER FOR A WHILE

181
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,166
AND SEE HOW IT ALL GOES.

182
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,000
- IT'S BEEN SAID
THAT THE TRAPARS SPEAK

183
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,000
DIRECTLY TO THE HUMAN SOUL

184
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,375
AND THEN ALTER
THE SOUL'S EMOTIONS.

185
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,500
BUT IF THAT
REALLY IS THE TRUTH,

186
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,625
IS IT LOGICAL TO ASSUME THAT
THE REVERSE COULD NEVER HAPPEN,

187
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,708
THAT THE SOUL
COULD NEVER CHANGE THE TRAPARS?

188
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,083
I WONDER.

189
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,166
- ( bell dinging )

190
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,416
- Woman over P.A.:
ATTENTION ALL CREW MEMBERS,

191
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,416
ATTENTION ALL CREW MEMBERS,

192
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,458
PLEASE GATHER
IN DINING HALL ONE IMMEDIATELY.

193
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:02,333
I REPEAT, ALL CREW--
- YOU DID WELL.

194
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,166
YOU REALLY WORKED HARD TODAY.

195
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,666
- ( bell dinging )

196
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,333
- HEY!
- UH, WHAT IS IT?

197
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,875
- DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

198
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,250
- WHAT DO YOU NEED?

199
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,958
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

200
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,041
- NIRVASH IS SAYING
THAT IT WAS REALLY FUN

201
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,208
FLYING WITH YOU TODAY.
- HUH?

202
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,375
- YOU KNOW, HE HARDLY EVER
SAYS ANYTHING LIKE THAT

203
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,125
BECAUSE HE TENDS
TO BE A BIT MOODY.

204
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,708
BESIDES,
I HAD A LOT OF FUN TOO.

205
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:35,208
I WISH I COULD FLY WITH HIM
FEELING LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME.

206
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,375
IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF I COULD FEEL THIS WAY

207
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,708
EVERY TIME
I'M RIDING THE WAVES.

208
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,541
- ( thinking ) THAT'S RIGHT.
THE WHOLE TIME,

209
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,541
THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT
GOING THROUGH MY MIND

210
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,208
OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAS,

211
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,500
HOW COULD I KEEP
THIS GIRL SMILING?

212
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,083
- Holland: AND SO
AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW,

213
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,625
WE HAVE NO MONEY.

214
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,750
WE'D LIKE YOU GUYS
TO COME UP WITH IDEAS

215
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,250
THAT WILL GET US SOME
QUICKLY AND EASILY.

216
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,375
WHOEVER FINDS US
A GOOD WAY TO MAKE MONEY

217
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,625
WILL WIN...
- ( all gasping )

218
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,125
- ...A HOT KISS FROM TALHO.

219
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,041
- WHAT?!
- ( all groaning )

220
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,708
- WAIT A MINUTE!
WHAT'S WITH THAT REACTION?

221
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,083
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

222
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,291
- (thinking)
A HOT KISS FROM TALHO?

223
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,875
- Talho: NOW WAIT JUST A MINUTE!
- WELL IF--

224
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,000
IF THERE'S GONNA BE A PRIZE...
- IT'S A KISS FROM ME!

225
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,083
- ...I WOULD LIKE IT
TO BE HER SMILE.

226
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,916
RIGHT, AS IF.
- Talho: HEY, RENTON.

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,083
- YES?

228
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,833
- LISTEN, EVEN IF YOUR IDEA
IS ACCEPTED,

229
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,291
YOU OWE ME ONE,
SO YOU GET NO KISS.  GOT IT?

230
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,666
- OWE YOU?

231
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,916
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU DIDN'T FORGET, DID YOU?

232
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,083
THE FRIDGE!
- HUH?  I FORGOT!

233
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,083
( thinking ) THIS SUCKS.

234
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,458
THIS REALLY SUCKS.

235
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,958
IT FEELS LIKE THE ONLY THING
I'M DOING HERE

236
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,041
IS LOSING EVERYBODY'S TRUST.

237
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,166
MAYBE THAT'S WHY NONE OF THEM
ARE SHOWING ME

238
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,791
HOW THEY LIKE TO LIFT.

239
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,333
OH, WHAT DO I DO?

240
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,041
HUH?

241
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,416
THIS IS IT!

242
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,333
HOLLAND AND THE GUYS
SHOULD JUST ENTER THIS CONTEST.

243
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,458
- AND SO, EVERYONE,
THE MISSION THAT

244
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,875
I MANAGED TO GET FOR US

245
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,875
SO WE CAN MAKE SOME MONEY
IS A-- TO PUT IT BLUNTLY--

246
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,333
SMUGGLING JOB.

247
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,875
FIRST AND FOREMOST,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TIME.

248
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,916
IF WE GO BY THE LEY LINE
TO STROHOLM,

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,333
IT'LL BE TOO FAR
AND WE WON'T MAKE IT IN TIME.

250
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,708
- ( all sighing )

251
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:36,375
- HOWEVER, IF WE TAKE THIS ROUTE
WITH THE L.F.O.s...

252
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,375
- GO THROUGH ALL LAND VALLEY?
- HUH?

253
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,541
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
ISN'T ALL LAND THE AREA

254
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,375
WHERE THAT REALLY FAMOUS
STATE MILITARY BASE IS LOCATED?

255
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,083
THEY SAY THAT IT'S WHERE

256
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,375
THE NEWEST K.L.F.s
AND R.P.G.s ARE SENT

257
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,375
IN ORDER TO PREP THEM
BEFORE THEY'RE DEPLOYED.

258
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,541
- YEAH, THE RISK IS HIGH.

259
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,875
- BUT IF WE TAKE THAT COURSE,
WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.

260
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,666
- YEAH. SIMPLY PUT, WE NEED TO
PASS THROUGH THE ALL LAND VALLEY

261
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,208
ON OUR L.F.O.s
IN A LITTLE UNDER SEVEN HOURS.

262
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,916
- SEVEN HOURS, HUH?

263
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,041
SOUNDS ALL RIGHT TO ME.
WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN.

264
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,500
- Hilda: WAIT JUST A MINUTE.
- HUH?

265
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,333
- SO HOW MUCH
ARE WE DOING THIS FOR?

266
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,333
WE'RE REALLY TIGHT
ON MONEY, YOU KNOW.

267
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,333
- WELL,
THIS WAS KIND OF SUDDEN

268
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,833
AND I TOOK THIS JOB
AWAY FROM ANOTHER GROUP.

269
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,583
THIS MUCH.
- All: HUH?

270
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,125
- HEY, WERE YOU CONNED
INTO DOING THIS?

271
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,666
- Gidget:
THAT'S WAY TOO LITTLE.

272
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,500
- HEY, DOESN'T ANYONE ELSE
HAVE AN IDEA?

273
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,083
- Renton: I DO.
- All: HMM?

274
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,875
- WELL, IF WE CAN WIN THE PRIZE

275
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,833
IN THE BIG LIFT TOURNAMENT
IN FLINT FRANC,

276
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,375
I THINK THAT EVERYTHING
WILL BE OKAY.

277
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,833
I MEAN, IT'S SPONSORED
BY CLEA, YOU KNOW?

278
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,375
I THINK WE CAN EVEN GET MONEY
FOR JUST SHOWING UP.

279
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,416
LOTS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WOULD
JUST COME TO SEE THE GEKKOSTATE.

280
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,625
- ( sighs )

281
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,250
- AND WE COULD SELL
OLD ISSUES OF "ray=out."

282
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,791
THAT'S IT.

283
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,625
- Holland:
ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANYTHING?

284
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,041
IF NOT, THEN LET'S GO
AND GET READY FOR LAUNCH.

285
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,250
- All: SURE THING.
ALL RIGHT.  ROGER.

286
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,791
- Woman: YOU GOTTA DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

287
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,541
- Man: BE VERY CAREFUL
IN HANDLING IT.

288
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,500
NOW ABOUT THE TIME--
- YOU JUST LEAVE IT TO US.

289
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,000
THERE'S NOBODY
OUT THERE THAT COULD

290
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,916
DELIVER YOUR PACKAGE
FASTER THAN WE CAN.

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,875
AND BESIDES, THIS TIME
IT'LL COME WITH SPECIAL SERVICE.

292
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,416
- SO WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO EXACTLY?

293
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,958
- OF ALL THE L.F.O.s WE HAVE
AT OUR DISPOSAL HERE,

294
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,000
THE NIRVASH
IS THE FASTEST BY FAR.

295
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,000
SO YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT.
- MMM?

296
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,958
- UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE THAT HAS ANY FREE TIME,

297
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,958
UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO STAY BEHIND
AND WAIT?

298
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,958
- SO THIS IS WHAT YOU MEANT
BY A SPECIAL SERVICE?

299
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,333
- Eureka: ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THE REST.

300
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,250
SEE YOU AT 4:00.

301
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,500
- Holland: YEAH, THANKS.

302
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,666
- Man:
LET'S GO MAKE A TON OF CASH.

303
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,791
- Eureka: THIS IS NIRVASH.
ROGER.

304
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,333
- THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
ABOUT ALL THIS.

305
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,666
- Man:
I HEARD THAT THEY DESTROYED

306
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,875
ALMOST HALF
OF THE BELLFOREST AIRPORT.

307
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,375
- YEAH,
THE EVER-ELUSIVE GEKKOSTATE.

308
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,375
- OH, THAT'S REALLY SCARY.

309
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,166
- WELL, ANYWAY,
NO MATTER WHAT,

310
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,375
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY'D COME
THIS FAR INTO THE BOONIES,

311
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,750
ESPECIALLY TO SOME REMOTE PLACE

312
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,375
WHERE THE TRAPAR
CURRENTS ARE UNSTABLE.

313
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,625
- ( siren wailing )
- All: HUH?  OH!

314
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,291
- OH!

315
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,833
- A FRONTAL ASSAULT?
WAIT A MINUTE!

316
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,833
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?

317
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,583
- ( alarm continues )

318
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,541
- MMM.

319
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,583
- WHOA.

320
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,375
- EUREKA, COULD YOU FLY
A LITTLE SLOWER?

321
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,875
- Holland: FIVE MORE MINUTES.

322
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,375
- UH, UNTIL WHAT?  WHAA!

323
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,541
FOR A SECOND,
I THOUGHT I SAW--

324
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,000
THIS IS NUTS! WHY DO WE HAVE TO
GO THROUGH A PLACE LIKE THIS?!

325
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,500
- CALM DOWN.
NOW LOOK AHEAD OF YOU.

326
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,875
- AMAZING!  THE TRAPARS
ARE JUST GUSHING OUT!

327
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,166
- DON'T GET SO EXCITED.

328
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,083
THE FUN IS JUST STARTING.

329
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,000
- THE FUN?
- Stoner: YEAH.

330
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,166
HEY, RENTON,
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE NEWS

331
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,916
ABOUT THE TECTONIC SHIFT
ON THE RADIO, DID YOU?

332
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,416
- NO.
- ROUGHLY 12 HOURS AGO,

333
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,333
THERE WAS A BIG TECTONIC SHIFT
NEAR SAN ALTHIS.

334
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,791
YOU'RE A REF BOARDER,

335
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,708
SO I'M SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

336
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,958
TO THE TRAPAR
THAT'S PRODUCED THERE, RIGHT?

337
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,958
- CAN IT BE
THAT THE TRAPAR WAVES

338
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,000
ARE ALL COMING HERE
TO THIS GEYSER?

339
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,750
- ( beeping )
- Holland: 10 MORE SECONDS.

340
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,750
- NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN...

341
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,750
- SIX, FIVE, FOUR...

342
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,750
- THREE...
- TWO...

343
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,166
- ONE!
- Holland: ENGAGE!

344
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,541
- ( thinking )
TO TELL THE TRUTH,

345
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,958
I HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED
BY HOLLAND AND THE OTHERS

346
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,416
BECAUSE THEY REALLY
DIDN'T SEEM COOL AT ALL.

347
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,916
THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. THEY
DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO DO ANYTHING.

348
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,166
BUT NOW-- NOW I'M SEEING
HOLLAND AND THE OTHERS

349
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,166
LIFT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

350
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,041
AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

351
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,875
THE GEKKOSTATE IS AWESOME
AFTER ALL, SIS.

352
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,416
AH!  OH NO.  HUH?

353
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,875
- ( heartbeat )

354
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,625
Renton: WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT WAS IN THAT BOX?

355
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,208
IF I HAD KNOWN I WAS CARRYING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I'D--

356
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,291
- WHAT? YOU MEAN
YOU'D NEVER SEEN THINGS

357
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,375
LIKE CORNEAS OR KIDNEYS BEFORE?

358
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,833
IT'S WHAT THEY USE
FOR TRANSPLANTS--

359
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,250
- I KNOW! I'M NOT STUPID.

360
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,416
BUT IF I'D KNOWN
THAT THE MISSION WAS

361
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,583
TO SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE, I'D OF--

362
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,375
- THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS.

363
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,750
SOME POOR GUYS SELLS HIS ORGANS
TO PAY OFF HIS DEBT

364
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,708
AND SOME RICH GUY
GETS TO LIVE LONGER.

365
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,916
THAT'S ALL
THERE IS TO IT.

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,041
PRETTY SIMPLE STORY.
IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL.

367
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,291
- THEY'RE SELLING ORGANS?

368
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,291
- I TOLD YOU
THIS WAS A SMUGGLING JOB.

369
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,291
- YOU MEAN THOSE GUYS
WERE FROM THE MAFIA?

370
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,875
- DAMN IT!
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

371
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,208
- THAT GUY TRIED TO WELCH OUT
ON THE FEE.

372
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,250
- WHAT?
- COME ON, YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

373
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,250
- WELL, AT LEAST I MANAGED
TO GET 70 OUT OF HIM.

374
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,541
- AHH!
- ( laughs )

375
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,958
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

376
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,250
GUESS I'LL LET YOU OFF
WITH JUST CLEANING THE BATHROOM.

377
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,750
RIGHT, TALHO?

378
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,250
- HUH?  WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

379
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

380
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,291
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE REWARD
FOR COMING UP WITH A PLAN.

381
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,791
- HUH?
- WELL, WE DID GET STIFFED.

382
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,291
- ( groans )

383
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,833
HEY, YOU OVER THERE!
SHRIMP!

384
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,416
- UH, SHRIMP?

385
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,583
- THIS HAPPENED 'CAUSE YOU
DIDN'T COME UP WITH A GOOD IDEA!

386
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,500
SO YOU'D BETTER
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

387
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,041
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

388
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,750
( thinking ) THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG ABOUT ALL THIS.

389
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,458
- AH, RENTON,
HARD AT WORK, I SEE.

390
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,541
- YOU NEED SOMETHING?

391
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,208
I'M TRYING TO
GET THIS CLEANING DONE.

392
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,916
- AH.

393
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,458
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.
- WHAT?

394
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,541
- YOU KNOW THE POINT
WHERE CLEA IS SUPPOSED TO BE

395
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,083
HOLDING THAT BIG TOURNAMENT?

396
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,500
THE TRAPARS THERE
ARE ALWAYS REALLY WEAK.

397
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,583
BUT THE SMUGGLING COURSE
WE TOOK TODAY

398
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,750
HAD THAT COOL GEYSER
WE PASSED THROUGH, RIGHT?

399
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,166
WE FOUND OUT FROM THE RADIO
THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE

400
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,458
A MAJOR WAVE OF TRAPAR THERE.

401
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,958
BESIDES, MORE THAN ANYTHING,

402
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,208
WE NEVER DO
ANY EXHIBITION LIFTING

403
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,041
IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY.

404
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,458
IT'S JUST NOT OUR STYLE.

405
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,666
ONE MORE THING.
- HMM?

406
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,125
- YOU SEEM TO BE
PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT IT,

407
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,750
SO I'LL JUST TELL YOU.

408
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,833
OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE
FIGURE IT OUT EVENTUALLY.

409
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,833
YOU SEE, THOSE BRATS

410
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,333
REALLY AREN'T EUREKA'S KIDS.

411
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,791
- UH, WAIT!
- HMM?

412
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,333
- THANKS, MATTHIEU.

413
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,000
- HMM.

414
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,250
NO PROBLEM.

415
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,666
- Talho: WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.
- HMM?

416
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,083
- HE EXPLAINED THINGS
TO YOU, DIDN'T HE?

417
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,666
ABOUT ALL OF US

418
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,458
AND ABOUT EUREKA.

419
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,958
I'M CURIOUS, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE

420
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,041
IF THOSE KIDS REALLY DID
TURN OUT TO BELONG TO EUREKA?

421
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,083
- ( thinking )
I COULDN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

422
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,541
I KNEW THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
SOME GOOD WAY OF ANSWERING IT,

423
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,708
BUT AT THAT MOMENT,

424
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,916
I COULDN'T COME UP
WITH ANYTHING AT ALL.

425
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,833
- Man: EVERYTHING
IS GOING ACCORDING TO

426
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:34,833
WHAT YOU SAID, SIR--

427
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,958
THE ACTIVATION
OF THE typeZERO,

428
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,083
THE RETURN
OF THE SEVEN SWELL.

429
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,041
AT THIS RATE,
THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION

430
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,708
THEY WILL SOON
MAKE AN APPEARANCE.

431
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,083
IT WON'T BE LONG,
COMMANDER DEWEY.

432
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,208
THE SAGE COUNCIL
WILL BE SURE TO

433
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,583
APPROVE YOUR RETURN
TO THE MILITARY.

434
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,916
AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO--
- I HAVE NO INTENTION

435
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,041
OF IGNORING PROPER DECORUM.

436
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,875
THE CURRENT KING OF THIS WORLD
KEEPS ELUDING HIS OWN SINS

437
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,208
IN ORDER TO LIVE
WITHOUT REPERCUSSIONS.

438
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,541
AND HE IS SUPPORTED IN THAT.

439
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:06,708
HOWEVER, SOMEDAY THE KING
MUST ACCEPT DEATH

440
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,916
TO ATONE
FOR HIS GRIEVOUS SINS,

441
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,291
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
ELUDING HE DOES.

442
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,791
ON THE OTHER HAND,

443
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,541
IF THE KING IS OFFERING
HIS HEAD TO THE EXECUTIONER,

444
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,750
ISN'T IT ONLY PROPER DECORUM

445
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,875
TO ACCEPT HIS OFFER
AND CHOP IT OFF?

446
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,125
- Renton: TO BE CONTINUED!

447
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:32,666
- ( theme music playing )

448
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,458
- Narrator:
THOUGHTS SWELL

449
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,791
AND A PSYCHE
GOES OUT OF CONTROL.

450
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,500
THE BOY'S HEART IS AT THE MERCY
OF COMPLICATED SITUATIONS

451
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:12,458
THE ADULTS WEAVE.
NEXT EPISODE, "VIVID BIT."
