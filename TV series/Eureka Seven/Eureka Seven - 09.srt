1
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,958
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,166
- Woman: I'M VERY SORRY.

3
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,708
- Holland:
WHY ARE YOU APOLOGIZING?

4
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,041
- IT'S JUST THAT
I FEEL AS THOUGH

5
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,625
I'VE SOMEHOW FORCED YOU ALL
TO MAKE A VERY PAINFUL DECISION.

6
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,708
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.

7
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,333
- BUT THEN THERE'S NORB.

8
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,333
IF YOU INTENDED
TO SEARCH FOR HIM,

9
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,333
THEN YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN
THAT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

10
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,708
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO
TO <i>CIUDADES DEL CIELO.</i>

11
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,625
DIDN'T YOU?

12
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,708
- ( grunts ) YOU SEE THROUGH
EVERYTHING, DON'T YOU?

13
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,375
WELL, <i>CIUDADES DEL CIELO</i> IS

14
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,333
A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE
TO YOU PEOPLE.

15
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,750
IT'S A COINCIDENCE--
COINCIDENCE.

16
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,083
- THAT'S NOT SO.
( bangs table )

17
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,541
OF COURSE TO US,
THE VODARAC,

18
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,833
THAT PLACE IS THE LAND
OF PURIFICATION

19
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,208
FROM WHICH WE BEGAN OUR JOURNEY
TO THE GREAT WALL.

20
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:28,083
HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME,
IT CAN BECOME DESTINY'S GATE

21
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,916
TO ANYONE WHO GOES THERE
TO VISIT IT.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,291
- DESTINY'S GATE?

23
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,375
TRUE ENOUGH.

24
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,250
- Ken-Goh: ALL SYSTEMS
HAVE COMPLETED A CHANGE-OVER

25
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,958
TO GENERAL STANDBY MODE.

26
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,250
- Gidget:
THANK YOU!  GOOD JOB.

27
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,708
WHAT'S THE STATUS
OF THE COMPAC INTERFERENCER?

28
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,666
- Man:
POINT SYSTEMS ARE GO.

29
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,333
OF COURSE, IN A PLACE THAT'S
OUT IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS,

30
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,125
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER MUCH.

31
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,791
- Man over radio:
THE MAIN ENGINE IS STILL UP.

32
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,791
WE CAN TAKE OFF
WHEN NECESSARY.

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,166
- ROGER THAT.

34
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,041
IN ANY CASE,
IT'S NOT LIKELY

35
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,625
THAT WE'LL BE STAYING AROUND
HERE FOR VERY LONG ANYWAY.

36
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,291
AFTER ALL, THIS IS--
- PROBABLY NOT.

37
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,458
- HMM?

38
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,291
- SINCE SOMEBODY JUST
WANTS TO RUN AWAY

39
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,083
WITH HIS TAIL
BETWEEN HIS LEGS,

40
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,083
I'M SURE
WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY

41
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,333
AS SOON
AS WE DROP THAT LADY OFF.

42
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,041
- Hap: YOU HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN ANYTHING, HAVE YOU?

43
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,500
YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE
TO CHECK.

44
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,458
- THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

45
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,833
AND ALSO, IT'S NOT MUCH
IN THE WAY OF THANKS,

46
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,666
BUT I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,750
- WE DON'T NEED YOU
TO GIVE US THAT.

48
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,750
- OH, COME NOW,
JUST TAKE IT WITH YOU.

49
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,333
AFTER ALL, YOU MAY FIND
YOU NEED IT SOMEDAY.

50
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,541
AND IF YOU DO,
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT

51
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,291
NOT HAVING THIS, RIGHT?

52
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,708
- ( sighs )
FOR PETE'S SAKE.

53
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,708
ALL RIGHT.

54
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:50,583
I JUST PRAY THAT WE NEVER EVER
NEED TO USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

55
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,875
- HMM. AND I PRAY THAT THE
WONDERFUL LIGHT OF VODARAC

56
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,583
IS WAITING FOR ALL OF YOU.

57
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,250
- Renton: BROTHER!

58
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,625
BROTHER DOGGIE!

59
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,791
- I KEEP TELLING YOU,
I'M NOT YOUR BROTHER.

60
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,041
- BROTHER,
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS! SEE?

61
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,708
I'M FINALLY DONE WITH IT--
MY BRAND-NEW REF BOARD.

62
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,541
IT'S SO AWESOME, ISN'T IT?

63
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,916
- THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE DOING
INSTEAD OF HELPING OUT?

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,916
WE'RE TAKING OFF
AFTER WE'RE DONE.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,666
- HUH? HOW COME?
- BECAUSE HOLLAND SAID SO.

66
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,000
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

67
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,500
- WAIT, HOLLAND DID?
FOR WHAT REASON?

68
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,791
- HOW THE HELL
SHOULD I KNOW?

69
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,208
- THERE'S SOME REALLY AMAZING
WAVES COMING, AREN'T THERE?

70
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,666
- YEAH.

71
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,125
- HOLLAND SAID
HE'D GO ANYWHERE

72
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,125
AS LONG AS HE KNEW
THERE WERE GOOD WAVES,

73
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,791
DIDN'T HE?
- YEAH.

74
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,791
- SO I GUESS HOLLAND IS JUST
KIND OF TEMPERAMENTAL, ISN'T HE?

75
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,583
- BEATS ME. I DON'T KNOW.

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,625
- SO IS SHE GETTING
OFF THE SHIP HERE?

77
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,875
- WELL, BRINGING HER HERE
WAS THE DEAL WE MADE.

78
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,541
- BROTHER,
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

79
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,083
- I'M GONNA GO
AND GET OUT MY REF BOARD TOO.

80
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,875
WE CAN LIFT HERE WHILE WE
WAIT FOR THE WATER TO FILL UP.

81
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,333
- HEY, WAIT UP!

82
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,333
I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU!

83
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,583
- Holland: STATUS REPORT?
- Ken-Goh: NO CHANGES.

84
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,916
CURRENTLY WE'RE REPLENISHING
OUR DRINKING WATER.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,541
WE'LL TAKE OFF
WHEN THAT'S DONE.

86
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,250
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED, RIGHT?

87
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,916
- YEAH, BUT THOSE
ARE SOME GREAT WAVES OUT THERE.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,083
- PRETTY UNUSUAL
COMING FROM THE GUY

89
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,791
WHO SUPPOSEDLY
LIVES FOR THE WAVES.

90
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,416
- OKAY THEN,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU GOT A PROBLEM?

92
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,458
- NOW LISTEN--
- HEY, CUT IT OUT!

93
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:21,291
- Stoner: HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING, HOLLAND?

94
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT AM I DOING?

95
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,000
- WHAT I MEAN IS,
AREN'T YOU GOING TO

96
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,500
GO OUT AND RIDE THE WAVES?

97
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,375
- THE WAVES?
- YEAH.

98
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,791
I MEAN, THOSE TWO
ARE GOING OUT AHEAD OF YOU.

99
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,625
- THOSE IDIOTS!

100
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,625
- HOLLAND, WAIT A MINUTE!

101
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,500
- Renton: THE WAVES HERE
REALLY ARE THE TOTAL ULTIMATE!

102
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,500
- YEAH.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE

103
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,416
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
AT A SPOT LIKE THIS.  TOO COOL!

104
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,083
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
- HUH?

105
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:50,000
UH, I'M SORRY, WE'RE WAITING
FOR THE WATER TO FILL.

106
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,458
- I'M ASKING YOU
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

107
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,875
- IT'S JUST, THE WAVES HERE
ARE REALLY GREAT.

108
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,875
I'VE NEVER SEEN WAVES
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

109
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,875
AND THOSE RUINED BUILDINGS
OVER THERE,

110
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,458
THEY MAKE GOOD WAVES
EVEN BETTER.

111
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,708
I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE
AREN'T ANY PEOPLE AROUND HERE.

112
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,166
I'M JUST GRATEFUL THAT SUCH AN
AMAZING SPOT WAS EVEN CREATED.

113
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,041
SO YOU SEE, WE WERE--

114
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,125
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?!

115
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,708
- JUST SHUT UP.

116
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,125
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PUNCH ME
ALL OF A SUDDEN LIKE THAT!

117
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,875
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHY YOU DID IT!

118
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,041
- JUST SHUT UP!

119
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,500
( punching )
- Renton: AH!

120
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,541
WHAT IS THIS?

121
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,541
WHY DID YOU PUNCH ME AGAIN?
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

122
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,000
OH, I GET IT!

123
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,458
I GET IT.

124
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,416
I GET IT!

125
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,291
- MAMA LOOKS UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING.

126
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,875
- IT'S 'CAUSE MAETER
DID SOMETHING TO MAKE MAMA MAD.

127
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,208
- NO, IT IS NOT!

128
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,208
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU PEED
IN YOUR PANTS, LINCK!

129
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,250
- I DID NOT PEE IN MY PANTS!

130
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,208
- RENTON?

131
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,666
WHAT HAPPENED?  RENTON!

132
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,666
- ( sobbing )

133
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,750
AH!
- ( crashing )

134
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,083
- ( body collapsing )

135
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,500
- IT'S BURNT THROUGH.

136
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,041
WAIT, THESE AREN'T
JUST RUINED BUILDINGS.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,625
THEY'RE BRAND NEW.

138
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,416
WHICH MEANS THAT THIS AREA
WAS BOMBED RECENTLY.

139
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,291
- ( rustling )
- WHO'S THERE?!

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,458
HEY, COME BACK!

141
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,916
WHOA!

142
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,333
OW.

143
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,958
- Woman: GOODNESS, IT'S YOU.

144
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,291
- MA'AM.

145
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,333
- SO WHERE'S THE LITTLE SHRIMP?

146
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,166
- HOLLAND, RENTON WAS-- OH.

147
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,625
- SORRY.

148
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,791
- Woman: I SEE, I SEE.

149
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,625
WELL, THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE,
WASN'T IT?

150
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,416
DOES IT BOTHER YOU?
- HUH?

151
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,291
IT MAY LOOK LIKE A MOBILE HOME
ON THE OUTSIDE,

152
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,625
BUT IT'S A MONASTERY
ON THE INSIDE.

153
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,416
- A MONASTERY?

154
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,000
UM...
- YES, RENTON?

155
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,958
- ARE THE VODARAC REALLY AN
ANTI-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION?

156
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,041
- NOW WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT WOULD BE TRUE?

157
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,708
- BECAUSE AT SCHOOL, THE
TEACHERS AND ALL THE OTHER KIDS,

158
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,375
THEY SAID THAT WE
REALLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND

159
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,333
HOW YOU GUYS THOUGHT AND
THAT YOU WERE SCARY PEOPLE.

160
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,291
- THINGS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW OR
DON'T UNDERSTAND CAN BE SCARY.

161
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,250
IT'S THE SAME FOR EVERYONE.

162
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,625
- YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE

163
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,208
THAT KIND OF PERSON
AT ALL, MA'AM.

164
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,958
- TRUE, BUT YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT

165
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,416
PEOPLE ARE LIKE
FROM THEIR LOOKS.

166
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,583
NOW THE LAND IS JUST AS
YOU SEE IT, NEVER CHANGING.

167
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,375
I'M SURE
IF EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD THAT,

168
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,208
THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE
WOULD NEVER HAVE

169
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,250
ENDED UP RUINED IN THIS WAY.

170
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,041
THIS ANGRY LAND
DOESN'T JUST BELONG

171
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,625
TO HUMAN
BEINGS, YOU KNOW.

172
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,791
AND YET WE KEEP POUNDING
ENDLESS NUMBERS OF STAKES

173
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,000
INTO THE SHIFTING SCUBS,

174
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,208
AND PRETEND WE HAVE
CONTROL OVER THEM.

175
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,833
- BUT THE TEXTBOOKS
SAY THAT IF WE DIDN'T

176
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,916
HAVE THE PILE BUNKERS,
WE'D HAVE TECTONIC DISTURBANCES.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,583
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
WHY DO THE TECTONIC DISTURBANCES

178
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,666
DISAPPEAR WHEN WE HAVE
THE PILE BUNKERS?

179
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,083
- I DON'T KNOW.

180
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,750
- YOU ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU'VE
LEARNED FROM READING SOMETHING

181
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,833
THAT SOMEONE ELSE
HAS WRITTEN, CORRECT?

182
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,375
- Talho:
YOU STILL CAN'T FIND HIM?

183
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,375
COME BACK BEFORE IT GETS DARK.

184
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,291
GOING OUT IN THE NIRVASH
IS DANGEROUS.

185
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,541
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

186
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,958
- Renton: WHY DO YOU
GO TO SO MUCH TROUBLE

187
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,625
TO GATHER IN A DESERTED PLACE
LIKE THIS?

188
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,833
- ( sighs )

189
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,375
BECAUSE THIS IS DESTINY'S GATE.

190
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,375
- DESTINY'S GATE?

191
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,125
- <i>CIUDADES DEL CIELO,</i>

192
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,125
CAPITAL OF THE SKY.

193
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,916
THE LAND OF THE VODARAC,
ONCE KNOWN FOR ITS BEAUTY.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,916
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
THEY TRY TO DESTROY IT,

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,041
THAT FACT WILL NEVER CHANGE.

196
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,916
TO FOLLOW THE PATH
THAT LEADS TO THE GREAT WALL

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,416
OR TO CONTINUE LIVING HERE

198
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,666
IN THIS ENCHANTING
AND BEAUTIFUL LAND--

199
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,000
THAT IS THE SOLEMN CHOICE
THAT EVERYONE

200
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,125
WHO COMES TO THIS HOLY CITY
MUST MAKE.

201
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,833
- BUT IT'S ALL TORN UP.

202
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,458
- YES.
ONE DAY, SEVERAL YEARS AGO,

203
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,833
THIS TOWN WAS ATTACKED
BY THE MILITARY.

204
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,083
- WHAT?

205
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,500
- THEY DESTROYED THE WHOLE CITY,
TOWER AND ALL.

206
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,500
AND THEN THE MILITIA
SLAUGHTERED PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE

207
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,458
JUST BECAUSE
OF THEIR DEEP FAITH IN VODARAC.

208
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,958
- MADAME TIPTORY!

209
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,541
IT'S TERRIBLE!
THAT THING HAS COME BACK AGAIN!

210
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,833
THE WHITE DEMON!
- THE WHITE DEMON?

211
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,333
- ( explosion )

212
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,708
- ( door whirring )

213
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,958
- RENTON?

214
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,625
I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE SOMEWHERE.

215
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,833
EVERYONE IS WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
SO PLEASE HURRY--

216
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,000
- ( thinking ) EUREKA.
SHE CAME TO FIND ME?

217
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:38,125
- ( Eureka grunting )
- AH!  EUREKA!

218
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,166
- OH.  RENTON!

219
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,208
- EUREKA!

220
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,375
AH!

221
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,333
- ( grunts )
- People: OH!  IT'S HER!

222
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,833
- STOP IT!  WHAT DID THIS GIRL
EVER DO TO YOU?

223
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,958
- Man:
THAT GIRL IS A MURDERER!

224
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,166
- YES!  AND WE NEVER
DID ANYTHING TO HARM HER.

225
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,291
- MILITARY DOG!

226
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,666
- WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU SAYING?

227
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,125
EUREKA IS--
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

228
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,958
- WHAT-- WHY?
- ( all clamoring )

229
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,625
- BECAUSE IT'S ALL TRUE.

230
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,500
I WAS A MILITARY DOG.

231
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,750
- WHAT?
- ( air raid signal blaring )

232
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,208
- WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

233
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,500
- YOU BOTH HAVE TO GET OUT
OF HERE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN.

234
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,500
THE SCHEDULED BOMBING
IS STARTING.

235
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,416
- SCHEDULED BOMBING?
- ( rumbling )

236
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,083
- A MILITARY
AIRBORNE BATTLESHIP.

237
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,875
- ENEMY AIRBORNE BATTLESHIP
APPROACHING FAST.

238
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,375
IT'S BOMBING THE SOUTHERN AREA
OF <i>DEL CIELO.</i>

239
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,083
- THE CIRCUIT ROTATION
ISN'T IMPROVING.

240
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,708
WE CAN'T FIRE THE MAIN CANNON.

241
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,458
- THE FLY WHEEL
IS NOW STABLE.

242
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,500
- ALL RIGHT,
SYSTEMS ARE ALIGNED.

243
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,208
- GIDGET, WHERE'S HOLLAND?
- HE WENT OUT ON THE 909.

244
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,208
HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO PICK UP THE NIRVASH.

245
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,208
- THEN WE'LL PULL OUT
AHEAD OF HIM.

246
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,208
SO TELL HIM
HE'D BETTER NOT BE LATE.

247
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
- Renton: I DON'T GET IT.

248
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,083
WHY DID THEY DO THIS
TO YOU?

249
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,458
I MEAN, THEY SEEM
LIKE REALLY NICE PEOPLE.

250
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,916
I JUST DON'T GET IT.
- IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,125
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

252
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:21,083
IT'S REALLY MY OWN FAULT
THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS TO ME.

253
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,000
- BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT THEY'D

254
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,666
DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO A GIRL.

255
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,833
- IT CAN'T BE HELPED!

256
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,583
BECAUSE OF WHAT I DID.

257
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,125
BECAUSE I WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR SO MANY DEATHS.

258
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,625
"ANNIHILATE ALL THE PEOPLE
LIVING IN THE CITY."

259
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,958
THAT WAS THE MISSION
THAT WAS GIVEN TO US--

260
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,583
THE S.O.F.

261
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,875
- "S.O.F."?
BUT ISN'T THAT--

262
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,125
- SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCE,

263
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,208
THE UNIT THAT WE USED TO BE IN.

264
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,916
- WAIT!  ARE YOU SAYING THAT
THE GEKKOSTATE WAS ORIGINALLY--

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,708
- THAT'S RIGHT.
AS LONG AS WE HAD ORDERS,

266
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,416
WE WOULD DO ANYTHING. WE WERE
JUST A SQUAD OF MURDERERS.

267
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,000
- NO WAY.

268
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,291
THEN THE RUMORS
WERE ACTUALLY TRUE?

269
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,625
- THERE WAS NO REASON.
WE WOULD JUST FOLLOW ORDERS.

270
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,416
IT WAS PROOF THAT I COULD EXIST
AS I WAS.

271
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,875
BESIDES, BACK THEN I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IN ANYTHING OR ANYONE

272
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,083
OTHER THAN THE NIRVASH
AND HOLLAND.

273
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,500
AND THAT'S WHY IF HOLLAND
TOLD ME TO FIGHT,

274
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,458
I WOULD FIGHT.

275
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,250
BUT...

276
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,500
- ( grunts )

277
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,875
- ( all laughing )
- ( door whirring )

278
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,166
- ( people shouting )

279
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,875
- ( gasps )
- ( Maeter crying )

280
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,541
- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT THE CHILDREN

281
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,000
THAT YOU FOUND THERE ARE--

282
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,083
- MMM.

283
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,541
MAETER, MAURICE AND LINCK.

284
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,375
- NO WAY.
THEN DOES THAT MEAN

285
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,000
THE COMMANDER
OF THAT OPERATION WAS--

286
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:40,166
- THE LEADER OF OUR TEAM,
COMMANDER OF OUR S.O.F. UNIT,

287
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,500
WAS HOLLAND.

288
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,875
- BUT-- BUT YOU GUYS
REALLY COULDN'T HELP IT, RIGHT?

289
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,416
I MEAN, THERE WAS A
BIG WAR GOING ON BACK THEN,

290
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,375
WASN'T THERE?

291
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,666
AND YOU GUYS
WERE ALL SOLDIERS.

292
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,666
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- WHAT?

293
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,291
- WE'RE STILL FIGHTING A WAR,
EVEN NOW.

294
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,291
RENTON, WHAT WE'RE DOING
IS NOT A GAME OR A SPORT.

295
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,458
WHENEVER I FIGHT,
PEOPLE GET HURT

296
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,791
AND SOMETIMES
LOTS OF THEM EVEN DIE.

297
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,833
MAYBE YOU
HAVEN'T REALIZED IT YET,

298
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,541
BUT, RENTON,
YOU'RE A PART OF EVERYTHING

299
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,000
THAT'S GOING ON AS WELL--
PART OF THIS WAR.

300
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,375
- Maurice: WILL SHE COME BACK?

301
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,041
WILL MAMA COME BACK?

302
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,250
- Hilda: IT'S ALL RIGHT.

303
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,000
HOLLAND IS GOING TO
PICK HER UP RIGHT NOW.

304
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,125
- REALLY?
THEN MAMA IS COMING BACK?

305
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,666
- DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT.

306
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,291
IN ALL THIS TIME, HOLLAND HAS
NEVER LIED TO YOU, RIGHT?

307
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,041
- MMM.

308
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,208
- ( explosion )
- DAMN IT.

309
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,708
OF ALL THE TIMES
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

310
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,291
- Eureka: WE ALL WANT TO ATONE
FOR THE SINS WE'VE COMMITTED

311
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,416
IN ANY WAY WE CAN.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

312
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,666
WE HAVE TO STAY ALIVE
NO MATTER WHAT.

313
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,500
WE HAVE TO STAY ALIVE
AND MAKE SURE

314
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,958
WE COMPLETE OUR MISSION.
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT,

315
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,625
I'M WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.

316
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,291
- SO THEN THAT MEANS
YOU BROUGHT ME ONTO THE GEKKO

317
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,500
IN ORDER TO FIGHT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

318
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,458
I BROUGHT YOU
BECAUSE THE NIRVASH

319
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,625
WON'T WORK PROPERLY
WITHOUT YOU.

320
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,708
AND IF WE DON'T
HAVE THE NIRVASH,

321
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,416
THEN WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO COMPLETE OUR MISSION.

322
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,666
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

323
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,708
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
YOUR MISSION OR WHATEVER IT IS.

324
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,875
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN WHY IS IT--

325
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,375
I MEAN, WHY DID--WHY DID YOU
RESCUE MAETER AND THE OTHERS

326
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,375
WHEN YOU WERE HERE?

327
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,625
IT'S NOT THAT
I BELIEVE EVERYTHING

328
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,083
IS EXACTLY AS YOU SAID.

329
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,500
BUT THE FACT
IS THAT YOU LEFT THE MILITARY

330
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,708
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO KEEP KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE

331
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,375
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE
ORDERED YOU TO, RIGHT?

332
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,000
YOU'RE SITTING THERE TALKING
ABOUT MISSIONS AND STUFF,

333
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,000
BUT THE WAY I SEE IT,
THAT'S REALLY NO DIFFERENT

334
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,250
FROM THE ORDERS
THAT THE MILITARY GAVE YOU.

335
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,000
EUREKA,
YOU'RE JUST LYING TO YOURSELF!

336
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,500
YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE INNOCENT PEOPLE

337
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,208
CONTINUE TO BE KILLED, DO YOU?

338
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,125
YOU'LL ATONE FOR YOUR SINS
IN ANY WAY YOU CAN, RIGHT?

339
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,583
- BUT IF WE GO OUT RIGHT NOW,

340
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:54,208
WE'LL CAUSE TROUBLE
FOR HOLLAND AND THE OTHERS.

341
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,041
- OH, IS THAT SO?

342
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,208
- RENTON!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

343
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,250
- I'M GONNA USE THE NIRVASH

344
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,875
TO MAKE THE
MILITARY STOP BOMBING.

345
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,333
- BUT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

346
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,333
- I CAN'T JUST SIT
AND WATCH MISS TIPTORY

347
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,833
AND THE OTHERS HERE
GET KILLED.

348
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,583
- WELL, I FEEL THE SAME WAY
YOU DO!

349
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:11,000
- THEN LET'S GO OUT TOGETHER.
COME ON!

350
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:19,583
Renton:
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

351
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:25,291
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,
BUT IT JUST--

352
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,583
EUREKA?

353
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,333
- RENTON, LET'S GO.
- WHAT?

354
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,708
- IT'S THE NIRVASH.

355
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,041
IT'S TELLING ME
I SHOULD DO WHAT YOU SAY.

356
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,750
- THAT WAS--

357
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,916
THE NIRVASH!

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,166
- Renton:
I CAN'T NAVIGATE BECAUSE OF

359
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,458
THE FALL WE JUST TOOK.
BUT I PATCHED THE HOLE

360
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,416
AND THE DATA CAN BE SEEN
ON THE MAIN MONITOR.

361
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,750
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

362
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,583
IF WE GO AROUND THE TOWERS,
WE MIGHT NOT GET THERE IN TIME.

363
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,791
- IT'S OKAY.
JUST LOOK IN FRONT OF YOU.

364
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,833
WE CAN SLIP THROUGH THE SPACE
BETWEEN THE TWO TOWERS

365
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,041
AND GET AHEAD OF THEM
THAT WAY.

366
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,166
- Jurgens: ALL RIGHT,
TIME'S UP! MISSION COMPLETE.

367
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,583
ALL TROOPS WITHDRAW
FROM THE AREA IMMEDIATELY.

368
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,375
- Woman: CAPTAIN, AN UNKNOWN
SHIP HAS APPEARED AT 2:00!

369
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,250
- HUH?
- UNIDENTIFIED L.F.O.

370
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,125
APPROACHING THE SHIP
AT HIGH VELOCITY!

371
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,833
- AN L.F.O.?
YOU'RE SURE IT'S NOT AN R.P.G.?

372
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,166
- ( alarm sounding )
- WHAT?

373
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,666
- ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES.
- IT'S OKAY.

374
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,333
- ( both shouting )

375
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,708
- Tiptory: I SEE. SO THAT IS
WHAT YOU TWO HAVE DECIDED.

376
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,291
FROM THIS TIME FORWARD,

377
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,625
EVEN IF A ROAD OF HARDSHIPS
AWAITS YOU,

378
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,458
MAY THERE BE A GLORIOUS LIGHT

379
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,625
SHINING DOWN
ON YOUR DESTINATION.

380
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,625
- Holland:
BREAKING THE REFLECTORS

381
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,875
TO REDUCE THEIR REFLECTIVITY.

382
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,375
THAT ISN'T EUREKA'S
FIGHTING STYLE.  NO WAY.

383
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,875
- Renton: EUREKA?

384
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,291
EUREKA?

385
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,875
LOOK-- LOOK OVER THERE.

386
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,791
- OH.
- HEY, LISTEN TO THIS.

387
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,083
THEY SAY THAT THIS IS
A PLACE THAT MAKES

388
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,958
EVERYONE CHOOSE SOMETHING.

389
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,666
SO THAT MEANS
THAT YOU MUST HAVE

390
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,750
CHOSEN SOMETHING
HERE TOO, EUREKA.

391
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,333
BESIDES,
LIKE MISS TIPTORY TOLD ME,

392
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,000
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
ITS APPEARANCE CHANGES,

393
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,833
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT THIS PLACE IS WHAT IT IS.

394
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,208
I THINK WHAT YOU CHOSE
TO DO HERE A LONG TIME AGO

395
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,208
WAS SOMETHING REALLY AMAZING.

396
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,541
AND EVEN NOW, THE FACT THAT
IT'S AMAZING DOESN'T CHANGE

397
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:34,166
IN THE SAME WAY THAT THIS PLACE
DOESN'T CHANGE.

398
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,166
YOU KNOW, EUREKA,
IT DOESN'T MATTER

399
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,333
WHAT CHOICES
YOU MIGHT HAVE MADE IN THE PAST,

400
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,083
BECAUSE I STILL BELIEVE IN YOU.
AND BESIDES, I ALSO BELIEVE

401
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,125
THAT YOU ACTUALLY
HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE BIT

402
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,333
FROM THE PERSON
THAT YOU WERE BACK THEN.

403
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,000
- I HAVE CHANGED.

404
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,125
AT LEAST, I THINK I HAVE.

405
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,708
EVER SINCE
YOU CAME AND JOINED US,

406
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,708
I THINK MAYBE I HAVE CHANGED.

407
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,875
- ( thinking )
I DON'T KNOW.

408
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,833
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS,
BUT AT THAT MOMENT,

409
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,750
ALL I WANTED
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART

410
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,458
WAS TO BE OF HELP
TO THIS GIRL.

411
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,333
THAT WAS WHAT I HAD CHOSEN
FOR MYSELF, SIS.

412
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,125
THAT'S WHY...

413
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,458
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED!

414
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,333
THIS IS SOMETHING I DID
ALL ON MY OWN,

415
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,416
AND THAT'S WHY EUREKA
ISN'T RESPONSIBLE!

416
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,291
- SO WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH YOUR BOARD?

417
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,541
- HUH?  WHAT?

418
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,625
- YOU MADE A NEW ONE,
DIDN'T YOU?

419
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,041
- WELL, IN ALL THE CONFUSION,
I KIND OF LOST IT.

420
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,916
- I SEE.

421
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,333
WELL, THEN YOU CAN PUT THIS
ON YOUR NEXT BOARD.

422
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,041
- HEY, ISN'T THIS--

423
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,750
- I HEARD ALL ABOUT IT
FROM EUREKA.

424
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,125
AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN POSSESSION
OF THAT WHEEL,

425
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,333
YOU ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFICIAL
MEMBER OF THE GEKKOSTATE,

426
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,000
WHICH MEANS
NO MORE GOING OFF ON YOUR OWN.

427
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,083
- UM, DOES THAT MEAN--
- LITTLE SHRIMP?

428
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,958
- UH, YES?
- KEEP IT CLEAN OR ELSE.

429
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,375
- HUH?

430
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,583
WHOA,
WHAT IS THIS MESSY CLOSET?

431
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,916
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

432
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,375
THIS IS YOUR ROOM.
- HUH?

433
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,250
- NOW THIS IS YOUR FIRST JOB
AS AN OFFICIAL CREWMAN.

434
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,916
CLEAN UP THIS ROOM,
SPIC-AND-SPAN.

435
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,750
- OKAY!

436
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,125
- I HAVEN'T CHANGED.

437
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,625
I REALLY HAVEN'T CHANGED,
HAVE I?

438
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,625
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT, ISN'T IT?

439
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,208
RIGHT, NIRVASH?

440
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,041
- Renton: TO BE CONTINUED.

441
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:32,458
- ( theme music playing )

442
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,083
- Narrator: TO ESCAPE FROM
THE TRUTH THAT IS THE PAST,

443
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:04,875
THE GEKKO HEADS TOWARDS THE
PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING STARTED.

444
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,875
AT THE SAME TIME,
A CERTAIN PLAN

445
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,125
STARTS TO MAKE ITS MOVE
ALONG WITH A YOUNG GIRL.

446
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,958
NEXT EPISODE,
"HIGHER THAN THE SUN."
