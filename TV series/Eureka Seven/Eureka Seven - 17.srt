- Holland: HOW ARE THE FILM
REPAIRS GOING?

10
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,083
- AS I EXPECTED, WITH THE
TRAPAR SPRINGS ALL DRIED OUT,

11
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,416
IT'S GOING SLOW.

12
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,166
- HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU
THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

13
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,875
STAY HOLED UP IN THIS PLACE?

14
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:05,083
I'M SICK OF EATING SANDY FOOD.
AND ON TOP OF THAT, IT'S BORING.

15
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,791
- AT THE CURRENT RATE,
IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN A YEAR.

16
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,375
- HUH?

17
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,708
WE SHOULD GO FIND
A FILM DEALER.

18
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,541
- BUT AREN'T THE SECURITY GUYS
AND THE GOVERNMENT

19
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,583
WATCHING OVER THEM
PRETTY CLOSELY.

20
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,208
- I KNOW SOMEBODY.

21
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,375
- CAN WE COUNT ON HIM
TO KEEP QUIET?

22
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,416
- MMM-HMM.

23
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,250
- EVEN SO, HAP JUST ISN'T
GOING TO LIKE IT. DAMN.

24
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,166
- SO? EXACTLY HOW MUCH
FILM DO WE NEED?

25
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,625
- AT LEAST 276 HEXAS.

26
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,958
- YOU ARE KIDDING?

27
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,541
AND HOW MUCH DO YOU
THINK THAT'S GOING TO COST?

28
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,083
- LET'S SEE.
- OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT,

29
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,125
I KNOW, I KNOW.

30
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,041
LET'S FACE IT,
WE ARE SHORT ON MONEY.

31
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,125
AND SINCE THE GEKKO CAN'T FLY,
WE CAN'T GET ANY JOBS.

32
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,750
AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE
ANY FEWER MOUTHS TO FEED.

33
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,083
- HMM?
- HMM?

34
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,916
- LOOK, WE ARE LOSING MONEY
RIGHT NOW, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,208
- SO, WE CAN'T WAIT FOR ALL
THE REPAIRS TO BE FINISHED

36
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,458
AT THE CURRENT PACE THEN,
CAN WE?

37
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,958
- YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT...
- THINK OF IT AS AN INVESTMENT.

38
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,000
- ( gasps )

39
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,250
IT'S JUST SO MUCH.

40
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,916
- JUST GIVE UP, HAP.
- HMM?

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,500
- NO COSMETICS FOR A WHILE.
- WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

42
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,333
- THE GEKKO IS NOW ENTERING
TIGHT FIVE BATTLE MODE.

43
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,708
- HUH?

44
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,833
- IN OTHER WORDS, WE ARE
ENTERING THE PENNILESS MODE.

45
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,208
- YOU WANT ME TO GET THAT?
- DON'T TOUCH IT.

46
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,041
- I GET IT,
THAT MUST BE THE CASH.

47
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,083
- WHATEVER, JUST STAY AWAY.

48
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,333
- EUREKA!

49
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,291
- HUH?
- WHAT'S WRONG?

50
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,583
- MY HEAD REALLY HURTS.
LET ME REST TODAY.

51
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,208
- ALL RIGHT.

52
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,458
EUREKA IS NOT
FEELING UP TO IT TODAY.

53
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,125
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO BE THE PILOT.

54
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,208
- OKAY.

55
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,500
- JUST BE CAREFUL
WITH IT, ALL RIGHT?

56
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,500
- HEY, I'M ALWAYS CAREFUL.

57
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,875
- I SURE HOPE SO.

58
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,625
- HMM...

59
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:32,000
- ( exclaims ) WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU DOING?

60
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,208
- HEY, I AM CURIOUS
WHAT'S WRONG WITH EUREKA?

61
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,791
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

62
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,875
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
BETWEEN YOU GUYS?

63
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,166
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT YOU TWO
MADE A REALLY CUTE COUPLE.

64
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,583
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

65
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,250
- I TOLD YOU I DON'T KNOW.

66
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,625
- HUH? CAN YOU SPEAK UP
A LITTLE LOUDER?

67
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,458
CAN'T HEAR WITH THE WIND.

68
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,875
- I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON, ALL RIGHT!

69
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,375
- ( grunts )

70
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,250
- GEEZ, I WOULDN'T BE HAVING
SO MANY PROBLEMS IF I DID.

71
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,666
- A WOMAN'S MIND AND
AUTUMN WIND CHANGE OFTEN.

72
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,500
( chuckles )

73
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,250
- WHAT THE HECK
IS AN AUTUMN?

74
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,208
- DON'T REALLY KNOW.
IT'S JUST SOMETHING

75
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,041
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS SAID.

76
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,666
( exclaims )

77
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,500
HEY, THAT WAS
DANGEROUS. CAREFUL.

78
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,500
- DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE

79
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,416
APPROACHED THAT
CORALIAN THAT DAY?

80
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,666
- HUH?

81
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,625
- I THINK THAT IT STARTED
RIGHT BEFORE THAT.

82
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:24,208
- SOMEHOW WE ARE DRIFTING
APART, ME AND EUREKA.

83
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,583
- SO, THINGS WERE
GOING WELL UNTIL THEN?

84
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,625
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE JUST GOT ALONG REALLY WELL.

85
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,958
- ( chuckles ) THAT'S GREAT.
SWEET ADOLESCENCE.

86
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,416
SO, WHAT DO YOU DO?
YOU PUSH HER OR SOMETHING?

87
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,166
HEY, YOU IDIOT, CALM DOWN,
WILL YOU?

88
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,333
HEY, WERE YOU ABLE TO KISS
HER AT LEAST?

89
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,416
- ( stammers ) KISS HER?

90
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,750
- OH, COME ON,
YOU DIDN'T GET THAT FAR?

91
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,000
- A GUY HAS TO PUSH
HIS WAY FORWARD, YOU KNOW.

92
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,916
- ( exclaims )

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,916
- UM, HAP,
DID YOU REALIZE THAT

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,583
YOU TURNED THE COMMUNICATOR ON?

95
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,416
- OH? SO I DID.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

96
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,958
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT.
YOU MEANT TO DO IT.

97
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,541
- ( laughs )

98
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,291
- RENTON, A GUY HAS GOT TO PUSH,
PUSH, PUSH HIS WAY FORWARD.

99
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,208
- NOT VERY CONVINCING,
COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO

100
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,291
HILDA HAS ALL WRAPPED
AROUND HER FINGER.

101
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,791
- HEY, I AM JUST A VERY
OPEN MINDED PERSON.

102
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,208
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,

103
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,333
SAYING YOU ARE SORRY EVERYDAY
IS BEING OPEN MINDED?

104
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,333
- SHUT UP.

105
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,208
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

106
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,625
A WOMAN'S MIND AND
AUTUMN WIND CHANGE OFTEN.

107
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,833
- YEAH, YEAH.
YOU ALREADY SAID THAT.

108
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,625
- GUYS SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED
ABOUT THE FINE DETAILS.

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,375
- SOMETIMES I THINK THAT,

110
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,833
I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER WITH YOU

111
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,708
FOR MORE THAN
A LITTLE WHILE NOW.

112
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,541
BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU,

113
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,416
OR ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT FEEL.

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,708
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND
A LOT MORE ABOUT YOU

115
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,291
THAN I DO NOW.

116
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,708
THAT'S BECAUSE...

117
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,333
- MAMA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

118
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:16,291
- I'M SORRY, I'M SLEEPING
SO MUCH. WHAT IS IT?

119
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,958
- HILDA IS CALLING FOR YOU.

120
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,166
SHE WANTS SOME HELP
WITH THE LAUNDRY.

121
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,041
- HMM, RIGHT. I GOT IT.

122
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,583
- ( grunts )

123
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,125
- All: WOW.

124
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,541
- ALL RIGHT THEN. NOW,
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FOLD THEM.

125
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,750
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW TO DO IT.

126
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,416
YOU JUST FOLD THE SOCKS
IN THREE LIKE THIS,

127
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,541
THEN YOU TAKE THE TOP,
AND FLIP IT OVER.

128
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,333
- SEE?
- I GOT IT.

129
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,250
LET'S SEE, LIKE THIS?

130
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,875
- THAT'S WRONG. HERE, GIVE.
- NO!

131
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,083
GET AWAY,
I WANT TO DO IT MYSELF.

132
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,291
- YOU GIVE ME.
- NO, LET GO.

133
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,375
- HEY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

134
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,083
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

135
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,500
- I MEAN, YOU NOT WANTING TO
GO OUT ON THE NIRVASH TODAY.

136
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,625
- I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.
- WHY IS THAT?

137
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,958
- NIRVASH HAS BEEN
IN A BAD MOOD.

138
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,416
- HMM?

139
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,750
- RENTON HAS TO BE ON BOARD
NOW, I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

140
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,666
- YOU KNOW, EUREKA,

141
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,916
WHEN I THINK OF THE NIRVASH
AS A FEMALE FRIEND,

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,416
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING
SEEMS TO FALL IN TO PLACE.

143
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,041
- HUH?

144
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,458
- IT'S KIND OF LIKE
WHEN YOUR BEST FRIEND

145
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,583
STARTS GOING OUT
WITH A NEW BOYFRIEND,

146
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,666
SOMETIMES IT CAN PUT
A REALLY BIG STRAIN ON

147
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,750
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND'S
RELATIONSHIP.

148
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,500
YOU START TO FEEL LIKE
THAT BOYFRIEND

149
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,541
JUST STOLE HER AWAY FROM YOU.

150
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,666
- I DON'T GET IT.
- IT'S A FORM OF JEALOUSY.

151
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,833
- JEALOUSY?

152
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,291
- ( chuckles ) OH, COME ON NOW,

153
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,375
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME THAT

154
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,708
YOU HAVE NEVER
FELT JEALOUSY BEFORE?

155
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,541
GEEZ, SOMETIMES, I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL.

156
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,458
NOW, LISTEN, YOU BETTER
REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

157
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,958
- I MEAN WHERE THAT
JEALOUSY IS TAKING YOU.

158
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,041
- HUH?

159
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,791
- WHETHER IT'S ALL
ABOUT THE NIRVASH,

160
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,125
OR IF YOU ARE FEELINGS
ARE REALLY ABOUT RENTON.

161
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,166
- I DID IT.
- WOW, GOOD GIRL.

162
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,666
- LOOK, I DID IT, TOO.

163
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,791
- SEE, SEE.
- ALL RIGHT.

164
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,791
- ( chattering excitedly )

165
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,458
- HEY.
- WHAT?

166
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,500
- HOW LONG ARE WE GOING
TO BE LIKE THIS?

167
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,875
- HOW LONG? YOU DON'T LIKE
BEING ALONE WITH ME?

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,625
- YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

169
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,333
- LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT
I'M RUNNING AWAY FROM IT.

170
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,458
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.
- WE CAN'T HELP IT, YOU KNOW.

171
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,833
WITH THE GEKKO IN THE
CONDITION THAT IT'S IN.

172
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,541
- OKAY, THEN. WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO ONCE IT'S FIXED?

173
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,916
HOW FAR ARE YOU GOING
TO RUN ONCE IT'S ALL FIXED UP?

174
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,583
- ( clanging in distance )

175
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,666
- ( gasps )

176
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,291
- WHAT WAS THAT?

177
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,208
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT NOISE?

178
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,000
- SOUNDS LIKE A DIGGER.

179
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,458
SOMEONE STILL
BELIEVES THAT THERE'S

180
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,166
A MINE WORTH DIGGING DOWN HERE.

181
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,708
SOMEONE BELIEVES THAT THERE'S

182
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,625
A DREAM BURIED
AWAY IN THIS PLACE.

183
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,000
- IT'S A RATHER SAD SOUND.

184
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,916
- EDMOND, ARE YOU IN HERE?

185
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,708
HEY, EDMOND, WHERE ARE YOU?

186
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,541
- HMM.

187
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,458
MAYBE YOUR FRIEND
WENT OUT OF BUSINESS.

188
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,875
- HEY, EDMOND, IT'S ME, KEN-GOH.

189
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:45,916
- ( gasps )

190
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,083
- WHAT IS IT? WHO ARE YOU?
- IT'S YOU.

191
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,666
- EDMOND IS DEAD. GONE.

192
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,333
- DEAD?
- YEAH.

193
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,375
HE DIED LAST YEAR.

194
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,375
- YOU ARE DRINKING
WHILE THE SUN IS STILL UP.

195
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,583
- SO WHAT? I PAID FOR IT
WITH MY OWN MONEY.

196
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,958
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT, HUH?

197
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,416
- ( gasps )

198
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,416
- ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH
OF THAT, NEAL.

199
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,000
- HUH? WAIT A MINUTE.
I DON'T KNOW YOU,

200
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,958
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

201
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,916
I KNOW, YOU ARE FROM
A COLLECTION AGENCY.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,958
- ( grunts )

203
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,583
- MY BOTTLE.

204
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,291
( screams )

205
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,333
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE YOU DOING, OLD MAN?

206
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,916
- I NEED A LOT OF
REFLECTION FILMS, RIGHT AWAY.

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,541
- WHAT?

208
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,916
- I SAID, I'M HERE TO BUY A LOT
OF REFLECTION FILMS FROM YOU.

209
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,541
- OF ALL THE THINGS YOU COULD
WANTED, IT HAD TO BE THAT.

210
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,541
I STOPPED DEALING THAT STUFF.

211
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,208
THEY'RE WAY TOO MUCH
OF A HASSLE,

212
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,125
AND THEY REALLY DON'T
SELL WORTH A DAMN.

213
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,208
- THEN I GUESS WE'LL JUST
PLACE A BIG ORDER.

214
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,708
- I'M SAYING I WON'T DO
ANY JOBS THAT PAY LIKE DIRT!

215
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,291
( groans )

216
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,791
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

217
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,208
- HOW PATHETIC!

218
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,083
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT'S SOMETHING
EDMOND'S SON WOULD SAY?

219
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,791
HE WAS A DECENT MAN,
WHO DEDICATED HIS TIME,

220
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,125
ENERGY, AND PASSION TO THE
MAKING OF REFLECTION FILMS.

221
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,791
- AND WHAT DID THAT BRING HIM?

222
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,791
HE WAS ALWAYS DIRT POOR
AND THEN HE DIED

223
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,166
BECAUSE OF THE
DESPERATION DISEASE!

224
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,375
- ( gasps )
THE DESPERATION DISEASE...

225
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,916
- HEH, I WANT NONE OF THAT.

226
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,833
- I HAVE THE MONEY!

227
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,916
- BUT WE HAVEN'T BARGAINED.

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,750
- ( grunting )
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

229
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,375
- TAKE IT!

230
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,500
- BUT THE CRAFTSMEN
ALL MOVED AWAY.

231
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,916
- FINE, THEN WE'LL HELP YOU.
- HUH?

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,166
- WE'RE JUST HERE TO PICK
THEM UP AREN'T WE?

233
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,041
- WHAT'S THAT?

234
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,583
- ( all groaning )

235
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,583
- BUT, THE MACHINES,
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN USED

236
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,833
IN A REALLY LONG TIME.

237
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,916
- YOU SCARED?
- JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,750
- EVEN THOUGH I SPEND
MY DAYS FULL OF BOOZE,

239
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,500
MY SKILLS ARE STILL GOOD.

240
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,791
- THEN HOW ABOUT YOU SHOW US
ALL THOSE GOOD SKILLS IN ACTION?

241
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:04,875
- HUH?

242
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,125
- DO WE HAVE OURSELVES
A DEAL OR NOT?

243
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,208
- ( sighs ) I GUESS WE DO.

244
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,916
BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT DRINKING NOWADAYS.

245
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,875
- WHATEVER MADE ME THINK
WE WOULD BE ALL RIGHT

246
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,791
WORKING WITH SUCH A DRUNK.

247
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,708
- ( sighs )

248
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,041
- I SEE IT.
- HUH?

249
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,291
- THE VALLEY CALLED
AURA DE PUNTA.

250
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,041
- ( sneezes ) IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

251
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,125
- THERE ARE TRACE BITS
OF TRAPARS ALL AROUND US.

252
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,916
- DON'T WE HAVE TO GO
WHERE THE SKY FISH

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,666
GATHER IN LARGE NUMBERS?

254
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,541
- THEY DON'T JUST GATHER HERE,
YOU HAVE TO LURE THEM.

255
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,041
- HUH?

256
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,916
- IT'S A LITTLE LONELY
OUT HERE WITHOUT MUSIC.

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,625
- HUH? RIGHT.

258
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,375
- HEY, THAT'S GREAT.

259
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,708
- ( upbeat music playing )

260
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,208
- OH, MAN. DON'T TELL ME YOU
ONLY HAVE STUFF LIKE THIS?

261
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
STUFF LIKE THIS?

262
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,833
- WHEN I LISTEN TO THIS
KIND OF MUSIC, I GET NAUSEATED.

263
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,750
- THEN YOU HAVE TO DRINK.

264
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,250
- WILL DRINKING
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

265
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,500
- AT LEAST,
YOU WON'T KNOW WHETHER

266
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,791
YOU ARE NAUSEOUS FROM THE
MUSIC, OR ALL THE ALCOHOL

267
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,166
YOU HAVE BEEN CHUGGING
DOWN LIKE IT WAS WATER.

268
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,000
- DAMN IT, I'M DRINKING.

269
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:56,125
- YEAH. ALL RIGHT! DRINK MORE!
DRINK MORE, DRINK MORE.

270
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,291
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL DID YOU
GIVE MOONDOGGIE TO DRINK?

271
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:03,083
- OOLONG TEA.
- OOLONG TEA?

272
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,041
- Renton: ALL THE ADULTS
STARTED TO DRINK ALCOHOL

273
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,041
AND GET LOUD AND ROWDY.

274
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,666
NEAL TOLD US THAT THE SKY FISH

275
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,166
ALWAYS COME AROUND
TO THOSE PEOPLE

276
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,708
WHO ARE HAVING FUN
WHILE THEY ARE

277
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,500
NEAR THEIR COMPAC DRIVES.

278
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,291
BUT IS THAT REALLY SO?

279
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,416
- ( buzzing )

280
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,708
- HMM?

281
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,375
( gasps )

282
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,291
- HEY, YOU'RE NOT
DRINKING ENOUGH.

283
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,458
AT THIS RATE, ALL THE SKY FISH
ARE GOING TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

284
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,958
- All: HUH? OH, YEAH.

285
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,416
- NUMBER 36! I'M GOING TO DO
MY QUICK STUNT.

286
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,166
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT!
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

287
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,583
- ( whistles )

288
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,208
- ( breathes deeply )

289
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,500
- GYOZA.

290
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,083
( chuckles )

291
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,416
- ( groans )

292
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,916
- OH, NO! WE GOT TO DRINK
MORE. HAVE A GREAT TIME.

293
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,333
- All: YEAH!

294
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,250
- GO AHEAD AND DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

295
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,750
- WHAT'S WRONG?

296
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,750
- NOTHING.
- IT'S MORE THAN NOTHING.

297
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,833
- I MEAN YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE

298
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,375
YOU HAVE BEEN
DOING VERY WELL LATELY.

299
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,625
THEY'RE ALL REALLY
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

300
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,416
- I DON'T KNOW. THEY ALL
SEEM TO BE AVOIDING ME.

301
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,666
- WELL, OF COURSE, THEY ARE.
- HUH?

302
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,500
- NOBODY LIKES TO
HANG OUT WITH PEOPLE

303
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,583
WHO DON'T SEEM TO BE
HAVING FUN, YOU KNOW.

304
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,166
- ( gasps )

305
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,625
- YOU GOT TO TRY
AND SMILE, OKAY?

306
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:47,958
- SURE.

307
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,666
- COME ON, DRINK UP,
DRINK UP.

308
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,958
- IN OTHER WORDS,

309
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,291
WE ALL JUST GOT TO
THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS, RIGHT?

310
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:12,291
- HEY, COME ON, DRINK SOME.
YOU, TOO, GO ON. HMM?

311
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,583
IT'S HERE! IT'S A BIG ONE!

312
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,041
- I CAN'T STAND UP.
- YEAH, ME NEITHER.

313
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

314
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,625
THIS IS WHERE THE
HARD WORK REALLY STARTS.

315
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,875
- I'LL DO IT.
- HMM?

316
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,041
ALL RIGHT. NOW TRY TO HOLD
THEM DOWN WITH THE REF-BOARD!

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,500
- NOW, YOU GUYS STAY PUT.

318
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,916
- ( gasps )

319
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,041
- DON'T JUST STAND THERE!
BEHIND YOU!

320
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,958
- ( screams )

321
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,791
- ( screaming )

322
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,916
- MAMA? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

323
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,041
- RENTON?

324
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,041
RENTON!

325
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,625
- ( gasps )

326
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,208
RIGHT. NOW, IT'S MY TURN.

327
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,916
ONE, FOR STARTERS!

328
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,333
THAT IS HOW WE MANAGED TO

329
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,458
COLLECT ALL THE
SKY FISH WE NEED.

330
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,500
- SO, WE JUST HAVE TO DELIVER
THEM TO THE WORKSHOP NOW?

331
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,250
- YEAH. BUT ONCE
THEY ARE THERE,

332
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,375
IT'S A JOB FOR ME AND ME ALONE.

333
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,208
- IT'S GOING TO BE
HARD BY YOURSELF.

334
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,916
WHY DON'T YOU LET US HELP OUT?

335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,625
- AMATEURS SHOULD NEVER
TRY TO MEDDLE

336
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,583
INTO A PROFESSIONAL'S JOB.

337
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,500
- YEAH.
-BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP,

338
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,750
TRY CLEANING UP AFTER THE PARTY.

339
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,291
- RIGHT, GOT IT.

340
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,125
- IT'S A PRO'S JOB.

341
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,083
HE REMINDED ME OF MY GRANDPA
JUST A BIT.

342
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,916
NEAL IS WHAT NEAL IS,
AN ARTISAN.

343
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,750
AND UNTIL VERY LATE THAT NIGHT,

344
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,416
THE LIGHT STAYED ON
IN NEAL'S WORKSHOP.

345
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,708
- ALL EXCEPT THE SEVEN
THAT HAVE BEEN SENT

346
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,083
TO WORLD ARMY ARE NOW HERE.

347
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,875
- I'M SURPRISED
YOU ALL MADE IT BACK.

348
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,916
I APPRECIATE THE HIDDEN SUPPORT
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME.

349
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,583
- LIEUTENANT COLONEL DEWEY,
WELCOME BACK.

350
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,583
- NO WAIT, I HEARD
YOU ARE A FULL COLONEL.

351
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,541
- HMM.

352
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,416
IT'S NOTHING
MORE THAN A NAME.

353
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,791
PATHETIC RULES
OF AN ARCHAIC PAST.

354
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,750
- IN THE LAST
BUDGET COUNCIL MEETING,

355
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,708
THE REASSEMBLY OF THE SQUADRON
HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY GRANTED.

356
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,791
RIGHT NOW, IT CONSISTS
OF JUST THE COLONEL AND I,

357
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,125
BUT SHORTLY THE SERVICE
TRANSFER ORDER

358
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,041
SHOULD ARRIVE AT YOUR DOOR.

359
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,583
- IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

360
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,541
- PATHETIC. IT'S ALL
SO PATHETIC.

361
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,708
- THE SAGE COUNCIL STILL
DOESN'T REALIZE

362
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,041
THE TRUTH BEHIND THIS?

363
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,166
- WHENEVER YOU SHOW
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

364
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,916
THOSE WITH HALF BAKED KNOWLEDGE
WILL MAKE A COMMOTION.

365
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,375
THE SOCIETY THAT WE
LIVE IN ONLY GOES SO FAR.

366
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,541
THOSE THAT BELIEVE THEY
ARE JUSTICE,

367
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,916
NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME
THEY HAVE TO THINK,

368
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,291
SHOULD ALL MEET THEIR DEATH.

369
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,333
I WILL SHOW THE PEOPLE
THE TRUE ILLS OF THE SOCIETY,

370
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,833
AND THEN ARMED WITH THE TRUTH,
I WILL BRING HUMAN KIND BACK,

371
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,000
TO IT'S RIGHTFUL STATUS
AS RULERS OF THIS WORLD.

372
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,208
THAT IS SOMETHING
THE HERO, ADROC THURSTON,

373
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,416
COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH.

374
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,833
YES, IT WILL BE
THE SECOND SUMMER OF LOVE.

375
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,541
- OKAY, I'VE SECURED
THE LAST OF THE CARGO.

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,125
- IT'S AMAZING.

377
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,333
- YOU CAN TELL?

378
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,791
I THINK THAT EDMOND MUST BE
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

379
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,750
- ( chuckles )

380
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,791
IF DAD WAS HERE,
HE'D BE KICKING MY ASS AROUND

381
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,666
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

382
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,208
BUT AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO DO
ONE LAST GOOD JOB.

383
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,041
- HMM?
- I'M CLOSING SHOP.

384
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,500
OH, DON'T GET ME WRONG
OR ANYTHING.

385
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,416
I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE
TO DO ALL THIS

386
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,916
IF I COULD,
BUT THERE'S JUST NO ORDERS.

387
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,708
- WAIT, ISN'T THE MILITARY
YOUR BIGGEST CUSTOMER?

388
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,458
- THEY QUIT SENDING ME ORDERS
ALMOST A YEAR AGO.

389
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,375
- NOW, WE CAN FIX UP THE GEKKO.

390
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,291
- LET'S GET THEM INSIDE,
RIGHT AWAY.

391
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,375
- ROGER THAT.

392
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,333
- SO PRETTY.
- HUH?

393
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,333
- THIS IS PRETTY.

394
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,750
- YEAH. BUT THEN, WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT HOW YOU MAKE THEM

395
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,666
FROM A SKY FISH, IT'S SEEMS
JUST A LITTLE BIT SAD.

396
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,958
- YES, BUT,
THEY ARE STILL PRETTY.

397
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,083
AT THAT MOMENT,
I FELT THAT THE DISTANCE

398
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,458
BETWEEN ME AND EUREKA,

399
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,625
WAS SLIGHTLY MORE LIKE
OF WHAT IT USED TO BE.

400
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,041
TO BE CONTINUED.
