00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,750
- Voice: HOLLAND?
- STOP IT.

8
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,541
- ( crying echoes )
- SOMEBODY MAKE IT STOP!

9
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,333
I WASN'T-- I DIDN'T--
- ( rifle cocking )

10
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,375
- ( gunfire )

11
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,875

00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,083
- ( moaning )

13
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,333
HEY, GET IT TOGETHER, RENTON.

14
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:19,041
- ( gasps )
- ( footsteps, banging )

- Newscaster: A.M. SOUTHEAST OF

16
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,958
NAGORIN ISLAND IN SOUTH
ARIB AT A DEPTH OF 60,

17
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:33,000
WE HAVE OBSERVED
AN ALPHA 7530 TECTONIC SHIFT.

18
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,291
I REPEAT, TODAY
AT APPROXIMATELY 8:48 A.M.,

19
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,208
SOUTHEAST OF NAGORIN ISLAND
IN SOUTH ARIB

20
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,416
AT A DEPTH OF 60,
WE HAVE OBSERVED--

21
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,916
- COME ON, HOLLAND.

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,333
WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO TELL
YOU TO KEEP THE RADIO DOWN?

23
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,375
HMM?
- DUE TO THIS TECTONIC SHIFT...

24
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,250
- HOLLAND?
- ...PART OF THE LEY LINE...

25
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,250
- ( Hap snoring )

26
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,000
- Holland: HAP!  HAP!

27
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,375
- UGH!  WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

28
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,833
WHY ARE YOU
IN SUCH A BIG HURRY?

29
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,416
- ( panting )
IT'S HERE!

30
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,916
- ( thinking ) THE STORY THAT
EUREKA TOLD ME ABOUT HER PAST,

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,916
THAT IT WAS HOLLAND'S GROUP
THAT TURNED <i>CIUDADES DEL CIELO,</i>

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,208
THE CITY WHERE MISS TIPTORY
AND THE OTHERS LIVED,

33
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,916
INTO A PILE OF RUBBLE,
WAS HARD TO HEAR.

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,208
OF COURSE
I BELIEVE IN EUREKA.

35
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,583
SO I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING TO HER OR HOLLAND

36
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,833
ABOUT THE THINGS
FROM THEIR PAST THAT HAUNT THEM.

37
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,416
IT'S JUST THAT... ( sighs )

38
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,250
...WHEN I SEE EUREKA IN PAIN
AND SUFFERING LIKE THAT,

39
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,583
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
IF THERE'S REALLY ANYTHING

40
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,208
I CAN DO FOR HER.

41
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,500
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REAL TRUTH
IS ABOUT ANYTHING.

42
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,166
NOT ABOUT EUREKA,

43
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,750
NOT ABOUT HOLLAND.

44
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,291
COME TO THINK OF IT,

45
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,708
I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE WORLD.

46
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,791
IT'S JUST LIKE
MISS TIPTORY TOLD ME.

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,208
I MEAN,
I SUPPOSE I CAN GO ON LIVING

48
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,208
WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING.

49
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,708
BUT...
( aloud ) THE REAL TRUTH, HUH?

50
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,458
MMM!

51
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,333
AH!

52
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,416
( grunting )

53
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,291
OH NO.

54
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,666
MISS TALHO'S GONNA KILL ME.

55
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,291
( grunting )

56
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,041
( sighs )

57
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,708
WHAT THE HECK AM I DOING?
HOW LAME.

58
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,583
- HEY, RENTON?
- AH!

59
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,250
I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING, REALLY!
NO, NOTHING AT ALL.

60
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,333
- I NEED GREEN STEPPEN BAN.
- HUH?

61
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,625
- BOARD WAX!

62
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,791
- UM, OH.

63
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,625
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

64
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,125
I HAVE SOME THAT JUST CAME IN
A FEW DAYS AGO.

65
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,625
- HEY, RENTON?

66
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,291
HAVE YOU FINISHED GETTING
YOUR BOARD READY YET?

67
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,708
- HUH?

68
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,958
- THERE'S A WAVE COMING.
AND IT'S HUGE!

69
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,583
- AH!

70
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,458
- IF WE CALCULATE IT
USING THE SOURCE

71
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,583
OF THE TECTONIC SHIFT
AND THE FLOW OF THE STRATA,

72
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,708
THEN THE BEST WAVES
ARE GONNA BE...

73
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,208
- ( scanning )

74
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,833
...RIGHT HERE.

75
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,333
- Matthieu: SO? HEY, THAT'S DOWN
IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.

76
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,000
- THAT'S WAY TOO FAR.
- IF WE STAY ON THE LEY LINE,

77
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,500
WE WON'T MAKE IT IN TIME
FOR THE WAVES' ARRIVAL.

78
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,500
- THAT'S IF WE STAY
ON THE LEY LINE.

79
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,208
- UH, NO WAY.

80
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,166
- WE'RE GONNA DO IT?
- SERIOUSLY?

81
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,083
- WELL, IT HAS BEEN A WHILE.

82
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,250
- AW, FINE.

83
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,083
YOU WANT ME TO DO IT THAT BAD,
I'LL DO IT.

84
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,083
- All: ALL RIGHT!
GREAT!

85
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,583
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN!
- THIS IS GONNA ROCK!

86
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,416
- Stoner:
THEN THERE SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM!

87
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,791
- Hilda: DON'T SLAP ME,
IT HURTS.

88
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,791
- THIS IS GONNA BE SO GREAT.
- IT REALLY HURTS!

89
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,541
- Hap: WELL SAID!

90
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,958
- DON'T HIT ME.
- HMM.

91
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,000
AH!  THEY ALL
JUST THINK OF THEMSELVES.

92
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,708
WHERE'D YOU GO, RENTON?
ARE YOU HERE?

93
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,666
I WANT MY CHANGE.

94
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,208
HE'S AS BAD AS THE OTHERS.

95
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,000
I'M JUST GONNA GET IT MYSELF!

96
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,625
- ( dinging )

97
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,916
- AHHH!

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,916
WHA-- WHA-- WHA--

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!

100
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,875
THIS IS MY--

101
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,958
THIS IS MY--

102
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,291
I FORGOT I HAD THIS THING.

103
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,458
- ( children giggling )

104
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,583
- ( sighs )

105
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,583
IT JUST
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

106
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,958
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

107
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,083
- WELL, THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT A BIG WAVE,

108
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,416
BUT IT'S REALLY FAR AWAY.

109
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,708
I MEAN,
BY THE TIME IT GETS HERE,

110
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,750
THERE WILL BE
NOTHING LEFT OF IT.

111
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,166
WHY IS EVERYONE
GETTING SO EXCITED

112
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,916
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,250
I DON'T GET IT.
- HUH? WELL, BECAUSE--

114
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,291
- ( alarm sounding )
- ( gasps )

115
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,458
- TRAJECTORY FLIGHT?

116
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,791
- MAURICE,
GET IN THE COPILOT SEAT.

117
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,833
- OKAY.
- RENTON, HURRY UP.

118
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,458
YOU GET IN TOO.
- HUH? WHAT FOR?

119
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,125
- THE GEKKO IS GOING TO FLY
OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE.

120
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:26,500
- FLY OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE?

121
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,625
- WOZ, WHEN YOU'VE GOT
THE COURSE CALCULATED,

122
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,791
SEND IT HERE.
- ALREADY SENT.

123
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,625
- WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
BEFORE THE WINDOW.

124
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,625
WE'RE GOING STRAIGHT TO
MAXIMUM LOAD. EVERYBODY READY?

125
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,625
- I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS EXCITED
IN A LONG TIME.

126
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,291
- Talho: WE START 35 SECONDS...

127
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,291
- ...AFTER THE TRAPAR
SITE SHUTS DOWN.

128
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,458
- ( tools rustling )
- Eureka: HERE, TAKE THIS.

129
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,625
- HUH?

130
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,416
- IT'S GOING TO BE
REALLY INTENSE TODAY.

131
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,958
- HUH?

132
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,958
( grunts )

133
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,166

- HIGHER THAN THE SUN!

- ( all grunting )

151
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,291
- ( thinking ) ROCKET?
BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS SAYING

152
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,041
THAT WE REALLY SHOULDN'T USE
ANY KIND OF JET PROPULSION

153
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,458
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
IT POLLUTES THE AIR!

154
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,041
- ( all moaning )

155
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,166
- MAMA, THIS BELT IS TIGHT.

156
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,791
- ISN'T IT OKAY NOW?

157
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,916
- YES, IT'S OKAY.

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,250
- ( giggling )

159
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,375
- WOW.

160
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,916
- THAT WAS CLOSE.

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,916
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO THROW UP AGAIN.

162
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,250
- RENTON, COME ON.
- WHAT?

163
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,750
- YOU CAN SEE THE PLANET
REALLY CLEARLY.

164
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,416
- PLANET?

165
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,958
- Children: WOW!

166
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,000
- AMAZING.

167
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,541
THE PLANET--
IT REALLY IS ROUND.

168
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,208
- All: WOW!

169
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,791
- Stoner: THE GREAT WALL.

170
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,083
- SO THIS IS THE THING
THAT MISS TIPTORY

171
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,708
WAS TELLING ME ABOUT.
HMM?

172
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,166
( thinking ) IF ONLY
I'D BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND

173
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,791
WHAT IT WAS THAT EUREKA'S EYES
WERE SAYING AT THAT VERY MOMENT,

174
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,583
MAYBE--JUST MAYBE WE WOULD
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT

175
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,750
THROUGH IT ALL WITHOUT
HAVING IT END THE WAY IT DID.

176
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:33,125
YOU KNOW, SIS?
BUT-- BUT FOR NOW,

177
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,791
JUST LET ME SAY ONE THING.

178
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,625
HURRAY FOR ZERO GRAVITY.

179
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,833
- Dominic:
AND THAT IS THE SITUATION

180
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,500
LEADING UP
TO THE CURRENT STATUS

181
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,458
OF OPERATION SORRA 107
IN <i>CIUDADES DEL CIELO.</i>

182
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,500
SEVEN MINUTES FROM ENEMY
CONTACT, THE SQUADRON WITHDRAW.

183
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,416
BECAUSE THEY USED AN L.F.O.

184
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,333
INSTEAD OF WEAPONS
JUST AS R.P.G.s,

185
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,666
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK
THAT THE ATTACK WAS INITIATED

186
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,833
BY A REBEL FORCE
LIKE THE VODARAC.

187
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,833
I BELIEVE
THAT SOME OTHER FORCE

188
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,291
MUST HAVE INTERVENED THERE.

189
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,541
- ENOUGH WITH THE REPORT.
- SIR?

190
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,791
- I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK, DOMINIC.

191
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,625
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT OTHER FORCE IS?

192
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,875
- SIR!  ANALYZING ALL THE DATA
WE'VE COLLECTED,

193
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,958
IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT A GROUP OF CIVILIANS

194
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,708
WOULD USE L.F.O.s IN COMBAT
AS WE SAW HERE.

195
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,208
IN PARTICULAR, THE ACCURACY
OF THE ATTACKS

196
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,625
WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE
OF THE OLD S.O.F.

197
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,458
FIRST MOBILE SQUADRON.
IN ADDITION,

198
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:30,333
THE FACT THAT EYEWITNESS REPORTS
ALSO MENTION A WHITE L.F.O.

199
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,250
LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE
THAT THE GEKKOSTATE

200
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,375
WERE PROBABLY THE ONES
INVOLVED IN THIS ATTACK.

201
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,708
- I SEE.

202
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,375
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOW
MAKING BLATANT ATTACKS

203
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,166
AGAINST MILITARY FORCES,

204
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,833
THERE ARE NO SQUADRONS
CAPABLE OF

205
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,166
DEALING WITH THEM AT PRESENT.

206
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,958
I WAS GOING TO WAIT
UNTIL MY SQUADRON

207
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,583
WAS OFFICIALLY COMMISSIONED,

208
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,625
BUT HOW
IS THAT OTHER THING GOING?

209
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,125
- UH... YES.

210
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,791
RIGHT AWAY!

211
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,500
YOU, GUARD,
BRING THE BLACK ONE OUT FRONT!

212
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,416
- HOW FAR DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN STRETCH IT?

213
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,333
THE GEKKO CUP COMPETITION
CHEESE-STRETCHING CHAMPIONSHIP!

214
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,166
- ALL RIGHT! WHOO!
OH YEAH!

215
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,125
- AND NOW MOONDOGGIE
WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS!

216
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,958
- SO WHERE ARE WE?

217
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,416
- IT'S THE MONAKE BASE.
- MONAKE?

218
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,750
- Hilda: AN AIR FORCE BASE
THAT WAS ABANDONED

219
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,250
AFTER A TECTONIC SHIFT
HIT IT SIX MONTHS AGO--

220
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,791
THE LARGEST MILITARY TOWER
IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.

221
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,458
BUT NOW
IT'S JUST AN EMPTY RUIN.

222
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,416
- Matthieu: I SEE.

223
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,250
AND WHY EXACTLY
ARE WE IN A PLACE LIKE THAT?

224
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,916
- WHO KNOWS?
ASK TALHO.

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,666
- MMM.

226
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,958
- ( grumbling )

227
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,666
- OH, WELL, MAYBE SHE'S
LOST HER TOUCH OR SOMETHING.

228
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,083
- ( groans )

229
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,875
- ( all snoring )

230
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,458
- HMM.

231
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,958
- Eureka: HEY!
- HUH?

232
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,708
- AREN'T YOU GOING?
EVERYONE ELSE IS.

233
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,791
YOU'RE FINISHED REPAIRING
YOUR BOARD, AREN'T YOU?

234
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,208
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

235
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,958
- I THINK I'M GOING
TO BE STAYING HERE.

236
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,583
I WANT TO STAY HERE.
- OKAY.

237
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,250
THEN I WILL TOO.
- WHAT?

238
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,916
- IT'S JUST,
YOU SEE, TODAY IS...

239
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,375
WELL, HURRAY FOR ZERO GRAVITY.

240
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,166
- OH.

241
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,916
THAT'S NICE, ISN'T IT?

242
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,625
( straining )

243
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,666
- Renton: I'M SORRY.
DID I PUT THAT ON TOO TIGHT?

244
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,500
HERE, THIS ONE TOO.

245
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,125
AH!

246
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,666
- WHAT'LL I DO?

247
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,583
MY VOICE, IT ISN'T REACHING.

248
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,208
- JEEZ.

249
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,208
THEY DON'T HAVE TO FLAUNT IT
LIKE THAT.

250
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,541
- Talho: NO KIDDING.

251
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,666
AND DOING IT HERE
OF ALL PLACES, RIGHT?

252
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,416
- Moondoggie and Gidget:
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!

253
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,041
- Gidget: LOOK OVER THERE!
- A WAVE!

254
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,166
- Both: ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!
- LOOK OVER THERE.

255
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,208
- A WAVE!
- Both: PAPER, ROCK, SCISSORS!

256
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,000
- Stoner: THE WAVE ISN'T COMING,
IS IT?

257
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,125
- Hilda: NEITHER IS HOLLAND.

258
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,625
- TAKE ME WITH YOU.

259
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,625
TAKE ME AWAY WITH YOU.
PLEASE, HOLLAND.

260
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,041
YOU'VE CHANGED.

261
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,375
- Renton: I'M SURE
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

262
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,416
I MEAN, YOU'VE REALLY
HAD TO DO AN AWFUL LOT

263
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,625
OF DIFFICULT MANEUVERS,
ALL IN JUST THE SHORT TIME

264
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,708
SINCE WE ALL TOOK OFF
FROM BELLFOREST.

265
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,458
OR IT COULD JUST BE
SOME KIND OF WARP

266
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,666
IN THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE
OF THE SHIP.

267
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,333
HEY, MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING
IN THE AMITA DRIVE.

268
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,625
HEY, EUREKA?

269
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,166
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T THINK

270
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,375
I CAN HOLD MYSELF BACK
ANYMORE.

271
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,125
- MMM?

272
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,208
- Man: JUST SPILL IT ALREADY.
- ( gasps )

273
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,666
- RENTON?

274
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,083
- YOU KNOW THINGS WOULD BE
A WHOLE LOT EASIER

275
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,166
IF YOU JUST SPILL IT, RENTON.

276
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,083
- RENTON, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

277
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,875
- I'M FINE.  IT'S NOTHING.

278
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,958
AFTER ALL, THIS IS
ALL FOR YOU, EUREKA.

279
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,166
- HUH?

280
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,250
- YOU SEE, IT'S NO BIG DEAL
IF IT'S FOR YOU.

281
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:34,333
I MEAN,
BECAUSE OF HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

282
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
I-- I--

283
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,458
- YOU'LL FEEL MUCH BETTER
IF YOU JUST SPILL IT ALL OUT.

284
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,458
- IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SPILL OUT?

285
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,750
- NO, I CAN'T SPILL IT.

286
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,958
I CAN'T SPILL IT OUT
AFTER ALL.

287
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,541
- YOU'VE CHANGED, HOLLAND.

288
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,958
WHY WON'T YOU LOOK AT ME?

289
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,041
- YOU'RE BUGGING ME.

290
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,875
- YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY?!

291
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,500
- YEAH.
I WANT TO RUN AWAY.

292
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,375
AS IF I ACTUALLY COULD!

293
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,583
I WANT TO RUN AWAY

294
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,166
TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE PLANET OR ANYWHERE ELSE.

295
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,208
I WANT TO FORGET

296
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,541
THAT DAY, THAT PLACE,
AND EVERYTHING ELSE-- ALL OF IT.

297
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,541
BUT I CAN'T.

298
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,375
IT ALL KEEPS CHASING AFTER ME.

299
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,208
I REALLY JUST WANT
TO RUN AWAY.

300
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,916
- EVEN FROM ME, HOLLAND?

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,875
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

302
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,916
I'M BEGGING YOU.

303
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,375
CAN'T YOU JUST HELP ME
FORGET ABOUT IT?

304
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,541
- THAT'S IT.
THE WAVE NEVER CAME.

305
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,000
- GUESS NOT.

306
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,625
- AT LEAST THE PIZZA WAS GOOD.

307
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,958
- YEAH, WELL, NEXT TIME
TRY AND LEAVE SOME FOR US, OKAY?

308
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,958
- YOU LANDED US HERE
ON PURPOSE, DIDN'T YOU?

309
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,250
- WELL, IT DIDN'T MATTER
TO YOU ANYWAY.

310
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,125
THAT WAVE, I MEAN.

311
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,416
THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL EVER
FORGET ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW.

312
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,250
IT REALLY WOULDN'T BE RIGHT
TO FORGET.

313
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,708
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF FORGETTING.

314
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,250
THAT'S WHY YOU BROUGHT HIM
ONBOARD THE GEKKO, ISN'T IT?

315
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,416
- BROTHER.

316
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,333
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO HIT A GUY
WHERE IT HURTS.

317
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,291
- YOUR WEAK SPOTS
ARE JUST TOO EASY TO FIND.

318
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,000
- ( Renton thinking ) THERE ARE
STILL A LOT OF THINGS THAT

319
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:18,125
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND,
ABOUT HOW HOLLAND FEELS,

320
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,833
ABOUT THE REASON
MISS TALHO LOOKS AT HOLLAND

321
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:24,333
THE WAY SHE DOES,
AND ABOUT EUREKA'S FEELINGS.

322
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,500
- ( bird chirping )

323
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,708
- HMM?

324
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,250
- ( laughs )

325
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,958
- LOOK, IT'S A BIRD!

326
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,375
- A BIRD, A BIRD!

327
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,166
- OH.

328
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,958
- ( thinking ) THERE ARE ALL
THESE THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

329
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,208
BUT THE FACT THAT I'M
STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW,

330
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,208
THE FACT THAT I'M LOOKING
OUT AT THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,

331
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,041
I FELT CERTAIN
THAT WAS THE TRUTH.

332
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,458
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I COULDN'T HELP THINKING,

333
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,250
WHAT AM I HERE FOR ANYWAY?

334
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,833
WHY WAS I BORN
ON THIS PARTICULAR PLANET?

335
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,750
AND WHAT EXACTLY IS IT
THAT I'M LIVING FOR?

336
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,250
- PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK AGAIN?

337
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,041
THE LIEUTENANT COLONEL
IS COMING.  HUH?

338
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,916
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

339
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,291
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE THE
LIEUTENANT COLONEL FOR SO LONG.

340
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,041
COME ON,
STOP PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK NOW.

341
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,833
- NO!
- UGH!

342
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,750
OH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

343
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,750
- IT-- IT KEEPS SPILLING OUT
AND WON'T STOP.

344
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,416
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
HASN'T IT?

345
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE DOING SO WELL.

346
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:00,250
I HOPE IT HASN'T BEEN TOO HARD,
MY SWEET LITTLE ANEMONE.

347
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,750
- ( gasps )

348
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,541
- NOW BE A GOOD GIRL.

349
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,875
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN THREE YEARS.

350
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,791
WON'T YOU SHOW ME THAT
PRETTY LITTLE FACE OF YOURS?

351
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,500
- SURE!  OKAY.

352
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,708
WELCOME BACK,
LIEUTENANT COLONEL DEWEY!

353
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,000

354
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,708

355
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:32,000

356
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,041

357
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,666
CALLED A CORALIAN.

358
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,375
THE BOY UNKNOWINGLY HEADS OUT
AND IS ASSAULTED
