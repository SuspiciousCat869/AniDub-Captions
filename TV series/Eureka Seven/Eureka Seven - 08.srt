I'M ON THE COVER

I NEED TO GO

YOU'RE NOT FEELING UP TO IT?

32
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,541
- IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.
THE PAY IS GOOD.

33
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,333
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.
BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS.

34
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,041
- BY THE WAY,
WHERE THE HELL IS RENTON?

35
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,291

WITH EUREKA

ON A LITTLE SHOPPING TRIP.

- WHY?

38
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,125
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET HIM
INVOLVED IN JOBS LIKE THIS?

39

THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,166
IT'S JUST A PAIN
TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM.

BUT I'M NOT SURE.

I DON'T GET IT.

EVERYONE IS STARING AT ME.

47

AM I SOME KIND
OF CELEBRITY OR SOMETHING?

00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,333
- Man: THAT CAN'T BE HIM.

49
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,875
- OF COURSE I AM!

50
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,083

- All: WHAT?!

54
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,500
- STUDYING IS VERY IMPORTANT.

55
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,000
AT LEAST, I THINK SO.

56
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,541
- THAT'S RIGHT, IT IS.

00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,541

STUDYING EITHER, RENTON.

- WELL, I, UH...

59
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,500
- HEY, DO YOU PREFER GUYS
THAT LIKE TO STUDY

60
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,000
OR WEIRD GUYS WHO SMELL
LIKE THROW-UP ALL THE TIME

61
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,250
THAT DON'T STUDY?
- HEY, MAETER, WATCH IT.

62
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,833
- HA HA!
I GOT RENTON MAD AT ME!

63
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,833
( laughs )
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

64
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,166
- JEEZ, SOMETIMES
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KIDS.

65
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,708
- YOU'RE JUST A KID YOURSELF,
YOU KNOW?

66
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,833
- NO WAY!  I'M AN ADULT.
- YEAH?

67
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,375
DO YOU HAVE HAIR GROWING
ALL AROUND YOUR YOU-KNOW-WHAT?

68
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,916
- AH!  WHAT'D YOU SAY?

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,125
- IDIOT!

70
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,750
I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOUR STUPID ARMPITS!

71
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,916
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,875
- ( spits )
- YOU LITTLE BRAT!

73
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,333

74
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,166

75
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,833
- MAETER!

76
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,375
MAETER IS MISSING.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,083
- HEY, EUREKA!
- Maurice: IS SHE GONNA GO AWAY?

78
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,416
ARE THEY-- ARE THEY ALL
GOING TO GO AWAY?

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,666
- STUPID! THIS TIME IT'S
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

80
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,833
FROM BACK THEN.

81
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,583

82
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:27,333
THEY'RE NEVER--
THEY'RE NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN!

83
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,416

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,375
I'M TELLING YOU, STOP!

85
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,916
( wailing )

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,833

00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,750
OH BROTHER.

88
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,333
- WE'RE GONNA GET THIS ONE
DONE QUICK AND HEAD HOME.

89
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,166

COME ON, DON'T CRY.
- RENTON!

94
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,000
- Both: MAMA!

95
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,750
- HAVE YOU FOUND HER?

96
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,666
- WHAT--
I'M SURE SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

97
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,500
KNOWING HER, SHE'S PROBABLY JUST
HIDING SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

98
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,375
SHE'LL FIND US SOON
AND SHE'LL CALL ME--

99
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,875
- Maeter: THROW-UPPER!

100
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,458
- --OR SOMETHING LIKE IT.
- Both: HUH?

101
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,333
- WAIT!  WHERE IS SHE?

102
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,458
- THROW-UPPER!
- HUH?

103
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,833
- ( laughs )

104
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,458
MAMA!

105
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,250
- OH, MAETER!

106
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,041
WHAT SHOULD
I GO ABOUT ALL THIS?

107
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,250
- HUH?

108
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,041
- HOW DO I SCOLD HER?
- UH, LET'S SEE--

109
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,958
WELL, SINCE SHE MADE EVERYBODY
WORRY SO MUCH,

110
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,958
A GOOD SLAP
OUGHT TO DO THE TRICK.

111
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,041
OH!  AH!  HOLD ON!

112
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,708
- ( all panting )

113
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,458
- ( giggles ) MAMA!

114
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,625
- EUREKA!

115
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,500
- OH.
- AT LEAST I KNOW

116
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,208
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU SCOLD A BOY.

117
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,541
- MAETER, HOW COULD YOU?!
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND

118
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,750
THAT YOU MADE EVERYONE
WORRY ABOUT YOU?

119
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,666
- ( whimpering )

120
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,916
I-- I'M SORRY.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,583
( crying )

122
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,458
- Woman: I DO APOLOGIZE.

123
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,875
THIS LITTLE GIRL WAS WANDERING
DOWN THE STREET LOST,

124
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,416
AND I BROUGHT HER BACK HERE
SO SHE'D BE SAFE

125
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,958
UNTIL I COULD FIND HER MOTHER.

126
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,208
- OH, NO, WE'RE THE ONES
WHO SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

127
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,416
- IT'S NOT MUCH
BY WAY OF APOLOGY,

128
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,541
BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY
AND HAVE TEA?

129
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,125
- OH, NO THANK YOU.
WE HAVE TO GO.

130
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,083
MAETER, COME ON NOW.
LET'S GO HOME.

131
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,500
- HEY, BUT I'M THIRSTY!
- YEAH, ME TOO.

132
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,208
- AW, COME ON.

133
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,875
- THEY'RE RIGHT.  LET'S ALL STAY
AND HAVE SOME TEA.

134
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,416
- UH...

135
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,125
- Both: WHOO-HOO!
( laughing )

136
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,708
- ( thinking ) DOESN'T ANYBODY
HAVE ANY DECORUM?

137
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,791
- Holland: THIS IS ALICE.

138
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,958
THE MAD HATTER
IS IN THE TEA ROOM.

139
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,041
DID YOU CLOSE OFF
THE FRONT EXIT?

140
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,458
- Talho: THIS IS THE RABBIT.
WE'RE COVERING THE FRONT.

141
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,458
- THIS IS THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.
I'VE REACHED MY POSITION.

142
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,625
- ROGER THAT.

143
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,875
ALICE WILL SECURE
THE BACK DOOR.

144
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,250
- HEY, MAMA, LOOK.
THIS TEA IS COLORED RED.

145
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,458
- ( laughs )
YES IT IS, DEAR.

146
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,791
WHAT IS THE COLOR OF THE TEA
THAT YOU USUALLY DRINK?

147
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,791
- THEY COLOR OF THE TEA
THAT GONZY POURS

148
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,500
IS LIKE SEWER WATER.

149
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,208
IT'S REALLY REALLY BITTER.
- I SEE.

150
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,416
THEN YOU MAY
PUT AS MUCH SUGAR

151
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,125
AS YOU WANT TO
INTO THIS TEA.

152
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,541
- YOU MEAN IT?

153
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,250
- BUT HOLD ON FOR A MOMENT
BEFORE YOU DO.

154
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,666
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

155
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,625
NOW PLEASE GO AHEAD.
- ( all clamoring )

156
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,791
- ( thinking ) THE TEA
THAT THE LADY BREWED FOR US

157
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,666
SMELLED NICE AND SWEET.

158
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,958
IT HAD A MYSTERIOUS
FEELING ABOUT IT,

159
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,458
JUST LIKE EUREKA,

160
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,125
AND WAS JUST
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,250
- ( banging )
- ( all gasp )

162
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,333
- EEK!
- All: AH!

163
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,125
- ( both gasp )
- Holland: I TOLD YOU NOT TO

164
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,125
BUY THAT CHEAP
BLACK-MARKET STUFF!

165
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,375
DON'T MOVE.

166
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,875
- HOLLAND, WHAT ARE YOU--

167
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,250
- RENTON?  WHAT--

168
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,291
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

169
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,166
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

170
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,541
- THIS WOMAN'S A KEY MEMBER
OF THE VODARAC,

171
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,875
A LARGE SYNDICATE
THAT'S REBELLING

172
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,083
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.

173
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,416
WE'LL GET A LOAD OF CASH
IF WE TURN HER IN.

174
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,083
- BUT, HOLLAND,

175
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,916
ISN'T THE GEKKOSTATE REBELLING
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL?

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,416
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU'LL
DO ANYTHING FOR MONEY?

177
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,583
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,

178
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,416
IF THE MONEY'S GOOD ENOUGH.

179
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,375
- NO WAY.

180
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,875
- ALL RIGHT, BOTH HANDS
ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD NOW.

181
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,291
- DAMN YOU!  AH!

182
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,125
- ( grunts )

183
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,583
AH!
- ( squeals )

184
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,708
- AH!  YOU BITCH!

185
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,916
ALICE TO QUEEN OF HEARTS,
IT'S THE MAD HATTER--

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,791
SHE'S ESCAPED
AND IS ON THE RUN.

187
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,625
HEY, MATTHIEU, WE'LL GO
AFTER HER IN THE L.F.O.s.

188
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,125
- HOLLAND, WAIT!

189
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,375
- SHUT UP.  I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO EXPLAIN RIGHT NOW.

190
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,458
COME ON, EUREKA!
AFTER HER IN THE NIRVASH!

191
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,375
IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT
WHAT'S GOING ON,

192
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,333
YOU CAN STAY HERE
AND DRINK TEA IF YOU WANT.

193
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,166
- HMM?

194
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,958
I AM BEING TESTED
BY VODARAC.

195
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,625
- HOLLAND, WE FOUND HER.
- ROGER.

196
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,333
THERE'S NO WAY
FOR YOU TO ESCAPE, LADY.

197
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,916
- ( gasps )
- ( horn honking )

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,541
- WHOA!
- AH!

199
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,708
- WHAT?

200
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,791
DAMN!

201
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,875
- ( gasps )
- Men: OH!

202
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,708
- RENTON,
SECURE OUR FIELD OF VISION!

203
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,791
- AH!

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,375
( shouting )

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,375
AHHHH!

206
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,416
- ( gasps )

207
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,333
- IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO GIVE UP, LADY.

208
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,333
- ( gasps )

209
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,916
- Hilda: ORDER UP, GUYS.

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,791
ONE TERRORIST,
SERVED TO ORDER.

211
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,291
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

212
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,375
WHY AREN'T YOU HAPPY?

213
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,041
- HOW COULD I
BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS?

214
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,541
- ( sizzling )

215
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,750
- Renton:
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

216
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,250
- HMM?

217
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,041
- WHY ARE WE ALL SITTING HERE
EATING A MEAL

218
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,583
AT THE HOUSE OF THE WOMAN
WE JUST CAPTURED?

219
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:48,041
- HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW HOW THE VODARAC THINK?

220
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,250
- HERE WE GO--
THE NEXT COURSE IS DONE.

221
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,541
- MMM!

222
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,166
- HMM!

223
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:01,041
MATTHIEU, LET RENTON KEEP AN EYE
ON THE OLD LADY FOR A WHILE.

224
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,083
APPARENTLY,
HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE EATING.

225
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,000
- HMM!

226
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,000
- ( utensil tapping )

227
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,625
- HMM.

228
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,958
SO ARE YOU GOING
TO BE HELPING ME OUT HERE NOW?

229
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,958
- I'M ON GUARD DUTY.

230
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,083
- ( chuckles )

231
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,791
- I DON'T GET IT.

232
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,791
- DON'T GET WHAT?

233
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,291
- WHY ARE YOU FEEDING US
THIS BIG FEAST?

234
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,458
- IF I'M TO BE HANDED OVER
TO THE GOVERNMENT,

235
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,625
THEN ALL THE FOOD HERE
WILL ROT, WON'T IT?

236
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,583
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

237
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,666
- IT'S BECAUSE I'M A VODARAC.

238
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,875
- HUH?

239
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,166
- CAN YOU GET ME THE PEPPER
FROM OVER THERE?

240
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,666
- WHAT?

241
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,791
- YOU SEE, IT WAS FATE
THAT I WOULD BE

242
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,291
CAPTURED BY YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS TODAY.

243
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,416
- HMM.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

244
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,541
- WELL, THEN WHY'D YOU TRY
TO RUN AWAY FROM US?

245
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,625
WELL, YOU SEE, IN THIS WORLD,

246
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,166
THERE ARE DESTINIES
THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT

247
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,208
AND CHALLENGES
THAT YOU MUST FIGHT AGAINST.

248
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,750
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
AT ALL.

249
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,916
- THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE PEOPLE

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,250
THAT HAVE SEEN
THE BRILLIANT LIGHT OF VODARAC.

251
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,250
NOW CAN YOU HAND ME
THE CAYENNE PEPPER, PLEASE?

252
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,541
- HUH?

253
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,916
- IT'S THE BOTTLE
NEXT TO THE BLACK PEPPER.

254
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,541
- SO WHY ARE YOU IN A COALITION
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT?

255
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,625
- OH, BRING ME THE SALT TOO.

256
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,500
YOU SEE, WE REALLY
DON'T MEAN TO BE

257
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,166
FIGHTING AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT.

258
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,666
- HMM?

259
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,166
- IT'S JUST THAT THE
ARMED FORCES THINK WE ARE.

260
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,333
WHEN A BIRD
IS LOCKED UP INSIDE A CAGE,

261
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,916
IT DREAMS OF THE SKIES
EVERY DAY, RIGHT?

262
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,250
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TASTE IT?

263
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,791
- UH, SURE.

264
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,791
AHHH!

265
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,416
- ( laughs )
- ( coughing )

266
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,083
- PERHAPS YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO
YOUNG TO BE EATING THIS FOOD.

267
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,083
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

268
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,250
- RENTON,

269
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,833
I'M RELIEVING YOU.

270
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,291
- HMM.  THANKS A LOT.

271
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,125
- YOU'LL GROW TO
UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS BETTER

272
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,666
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER
AND BECOME AN ADULT.

273
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,958
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TASTE THIS
FOR YOURSELF?

274
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,625
- I DON'T LIKE THE SMELL.

275
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,583
- THIS IS THE SOUL FOOD
OF MY PEOPLE.

276
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,458
IT CAN BE A LITTLE MUCH
FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T USED TO IT.

277
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,541
- SO TELL ME
WHERE NORB IS.

278
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,833
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO START
OUT BY USING FORCE LIKE THAT.

279
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,833
BUT THE MILITARY
TOLD US THAT YOU WERE

280
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,541
A VERY DANGEROUS,
ANTI-GOVERNMENT FACTION.

281
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,291
I'M SORRY.

282
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,250
- AND THAT WAS THE MOST
STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY

283
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,416
TO HANDLE IT, CORRECT?

284
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,583
- THE MONEY!

285
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,541
( whistles )

286
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,166
- WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO TO THEM?

287
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,041
- NOT A THING.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

288
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,625
HMM.  ALL RIGHT!
IT'S A DEAL!

289
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,166
- AH!
- WHAT THE HELL?

290
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,583
- AHHH!

291
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,041
WHOO-HOO!
- SHIT!  DON'T LET 'EM GET AWAY.

292
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,625
- THEY'RE COMING!
- Talho: I KNOW!

293
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,750
- ( gasps )

294
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,583
- ALL RIGHT NOW! LET'S GIVE
'EM A HOT ONE TO CHEW ON!

295
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,000
- COMMENCING ENERGY CHARGE!
HEAT RATE OF INCREASE

296
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,916
IS WITHIN
THE EXPECTED PARAMETERS!

297
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,916
THREE, TWO, ONE,

298
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,958
FIRE!

299
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,666
- ALL RIGHT! YEAH!

300
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,000
WE DID IT! ( laughs )
- ( yawns )

301
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,916
- ( stuttering )

302
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,500
- Maeter: WELCOME BACK!

303
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,916
MAMA, YOU WERE AMAZINGLY COOL
OUT THERE!

304
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
- COOL?
- OH YEAH!

305
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,000
YOU WERE REALLY REALLY COOL!

306
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:19,041
- ( Renton gagging )

307
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,583
- LET'S SEE...

308
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,208
- Holland: LOOK, I'M SORRY,
ABOUT GETTING YOU INVOLVED IN

309
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,416
OUR PERSONAL FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.
- I DON'T MIND.

310
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,250
EVERYTHING HAPPENS IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE WILL OF VODARAC.

311
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,458
- I KNOW THIS WON'T MAKE UP
FOR EVERYTHING,

312
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,625
BUT I'LL TAKE YOU
TO ANY LOCATION

313
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,083
THAT YOU WANT TO GO.
- WELL THEN,

314
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,708
I'LL GO
TO OUR PILGRIMAGE LAND,

315
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,833
TO <i>CIUDADES DEL CIELO.</i>

316
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,791
- Hap: THE FACT THAT THEY WANT
THE VODARAC MORE THAN US

317
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,416
MIGHT MEAN THAT THE
INFORMATION ABOUT US

318
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,416
HASN'T MADE ITS WAY TO THE
LEADERS OF THE ARMED FORCES YET.

319
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,875
- THAT'S TRUE,
BUT WE STILL CAN'T

320
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,625
AFFORD TO LET OUR GUARD DOWN.

321
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,958
- I AGREE.

322
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,958
ON TOP
OF THEIR SQUADRON CHANGES,

323
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,541
THE FLOW OF MONEY
INSIDE THE ARMY IS GETTING BIG.

324
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,333
- I HEARD A RUMOR
THAT THE GOVERNMENT

325
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,541
HAS BEGUN MASS PRODUCTION
OF COMPAC DRIVES IN PUNA POA.

326
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,208
- NOT ONLY THAT,
GENERAL CREIGHTON, THE MODERATE,

327
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,291
HAS MET
WITH AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT.

328
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,666
IT LOOKS LIKE THE ARMY'S GOING
TO BE GETTING A NEW LEADER SOON.

329
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,333
- SO THEY'RE REORGANIZING.

330
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,833
HUH.

331
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,583
- Holland: LET'S HOPE
THAT'S ALL THEY'LL BE DOING.

332
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,083
THE KING
OF THE FOREST OF NEMI.

333
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,750
- HERE,
STUDY GUIDES FOR EACH OF YOU.

334
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,166
- All: WHAT?!

335
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,041
- Maeter: I HATE MATH!
- Both: WE DON'T NEED THOSE!

336
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,166
- HERE'S YOURS, RENTON.

337
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,916
- UH, I'M DOING 'EM TOO?

338
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,208
- YOU WERE REALLY COOL
BACK THERE.

339
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,208
WHENEVER YOU SMILE, RENTON,
NIRVASH SMILES TOO.

340
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,625
- ( laughs nervously )

341
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,875
- <i>CIUDADES DEL CIELO</i>
OF ALL PLACES.

342
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,958
- YOU KNOW,
I GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS

343
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,208
THE MOMENT I ATE
THAT GOD-AWFUL SPICY FOOD.

344
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,375
- HOW LONG

345
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,791
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN BACK?

346
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,291
- I'VE FORGOTTEN.

347
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,375
- LIAR.

348
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,625
- ( yawns )

349
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,875
( thinking ) SO WHAT WAS IT
THAT WAS COOL ANYWAY?

350
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,125
( yawns )

351
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,250
GOOD NIGHT.

352
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,958
- ( drinking )

353
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,666
WHAT IS THIS?
MY HEAD-- IT HURTS.

354
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,333
- Renton: TO BE CONTINUED.

355
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:32,916
- ( theme music playing )

356
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,833
- Narrator: THE HOLY LAND
OF THE VODARAC,

357
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,458
WHICH MANY CALL
THE CAPITAL OF THE SKIES.

358
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,708
THERE THE GIRL'S
PAST IS REVEALED.

359
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,958
WHAT DID THE BOY CHOOSE
IN THE FLAMES OF BATTLE,

360
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,125
NOW THAT HE KNEW THE TRUTH?

361
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,708
NEXT EPISODE,
"PAPER MOON SHINE."
