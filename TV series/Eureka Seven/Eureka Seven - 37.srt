1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,000
- ( sniffing )

4
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,833
- PEW!

5
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,375
MAMA, HE'S STINKY.

6
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,125
A LOT STINKIER THAN PUKEY.

7
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,041
- BE QUIET, MAETER.

8
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,458
WE HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT
TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

9
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,708
- WELL THEN, WHY DON'T
WE GET STARTED?

10
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,041
- Dr. Egan:
STARTED WITH WHAT?

11
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,708
I EXPLAINED IT ALL EARLIER.

12
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,875
WE WANT YOU AND MASTER NORB
TO SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE

13
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,708
AND EXPERIENCE WITH US.

14
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,541
FIRST, WE'LL HAVE
THE SCIENTIFIC SIDE

15
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,958
OF THINGS FROM YOU.

16
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,875
THEN MASTER NORB WILL TALK
ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS SIDE.

17
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,708
EVERYBODY GOT IT?

18
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,958
- WELL... YES, I SUPPOSE.

19
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,708
I'LL START
BY CONFIRMING SOMETHING

20
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,333
THAT I'VE BEEN SAYING
FOR A WHILE.

21
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,333
I'M CONVINCED
THAT THE SCUB CORAL

22
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,041
IS AN INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORM.

23
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,333
FURTHER, I FIRMLY BELIEVE
THAT CORALIANS

24
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,791
ARE ACTUALLY COMMUNICATION TOOLS
CREATED BY THEM.

25
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,625
- THAT'S JUST A HYPOTHESIS.

26
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,333
- HOW WOULD YOU
EXPLAIN EUREKA, THEN?

27
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,625
- THE FACT THAT HUMAN BEINGS
POSSESS INTELLIGENCE

28
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,625
DOESN'T PROVE
THAT A SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISM

29
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,333
BACK ON PRIMARY EARTH
HAS INTELLIGENCE, DOES IT?

30
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,916
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,916
IF THE SCUB CORALS ARE ALIVE,
THEN WHAT IS OPERATION ORANGE,

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,708
THE PROGRAM THAT THE ARMY
IS WORKING ON,

33
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,875
SUPPOSED TO DO TO THEM?

34
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,041
- MAKE THEM CREATE
ANTIBODY CORALIANS.

35
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,458
- ( snoring )

36
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,916
- Mischa:
WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND ANTIBODIES

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,291
WORK AGAINST VIRUSES
AND BACTERIA

38
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,333
THAT ENTER AND THREATEN
AN ORGANISM.

39
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,666
BUT THAT DOESN'T PROVE

40
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,625
THAT EITHER OF THEM
ARE INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORMS.

41
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:20,916
- THAT'S TRUE.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,041
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE ARMY'S THINKING.

43
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,708
- Dr. Egan:
THAT'S BECAUSE THEIR OBJECTIVE

44
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,000
ISN'T TO CREATE
ANTIBODY CORALIANS.

45
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,166
- REALLY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,791
- OH, WELL TO BEGIN
WITH THE CONCLUSION,

47
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,958
IF WE LET THE NUMBER
OF INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORMS

48
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,666
INCREASE EVEN FURTHER,

49
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,916
THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE
WILL FALL APART.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,083
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS
THAT CAN BE ASKED

51
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,500
IN INFORMATION DYNAMICS--

52
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,000
- HEY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

53
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,333
- BE QUIET, MAETER.

54
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,125
- ( yawning )

55
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,833
YOU GUYS ARE STILL YAPPING
ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT?

56
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,125
- OH, THE STINKY, OLD MAN
HAS WOKEN UP.

57
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,500
THIS WORLD THAT WE CALL
THE THIRD PLANE

58
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,333
IS ONLY THE MERE FOAM
OF VODARAC'S IDEAS.

59
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,291
SOME DAY IT WILL JUST DISAPPEAR.

60
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,541
- AND THAT IS TRIGGERED
BY THE TOTAL NUMBER

61
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,125
OF INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORMS?

62
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,083
- MM-HMM.

63
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,875
WE HAVE ALWAYS CALLED THEM
LIVING HESITATIONS.

64
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,458
BUT I THINK
INTELLIGENT LIFE-FORMS

65
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,000
ARE THE SAME THING.

66
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:24,333
YOU SEE, IF THE PLANE IS FILLED
WITH WORRY, PAIN, AND DOUBT,

67
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,833
VODARAC'S IDEAS WILL VANISH.

68
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,166
- YOU MEAN VODARAC'S NOT GOD?

69
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,708
- Master Norb:
VODARAC IS A TERM

70
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,541
THAT POINTS TO A STATE OF BEING.

71
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,500
HOWEVER, IT IS A STATE
THAT HAS A WILL OF ITS OWN.

72
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,833
- BUT I FIND THIS
RATHER STRANGE.

73
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,000
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS,
THE TOTAL LIFE-FORM MASS

74
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,250
OF THE SCUB CORALS
HAS ALREADY SURPASSED

75
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,416
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS.

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,166
- THAT'S BECAUSE THE LAND
IS DREAMING.

77
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,791
- OH, I KNEW IT!
MY WORKING HYPOTHESIS

78
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,125
WAS CORRECT AFTER ALL!

79
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,125
I'VE BEEN SAYING
FOR SEVERAL YEARS

80
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,166
THE SCUB CORALS WERE
IN A STATE OF DEEP HIBERNATION.

81
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,000
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVEN'T REACHED
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS YET.

82
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:03,666
- IF THE LAND REAWAKENS,
THE SKY WILL TEAR.

83
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,708
- Ageha Member #1:
CONFIRMING DETONATION OF ORANGE.

84
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,458
ERROR IS 0.4.

85
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,875
- CONFIRM TECTONIC SHIFT PULSES.

86
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,083
FROM THE ALPHA AND BETA WAVES
INTERFERENCE, WE BELIEVE

87
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:20,208
THAT THE KUTE-CLASS WILL APPEAR
IN 26 MINUTES AND 30 SECONDS.

88
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,375
- ( laughing )

89
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,416
- THEY SURE KEEP ME WAITING.

90
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,791
- IT'S DANGEROUS TO CREATE
A NEW HYPOTHESIS

91
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,000
BASED ON ANOTHER ONE.

92
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,916
- BUT YOU MUST HAVE
SEEN IT AS WELL,

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,916
THE INFORMATION ON CAPITOL HILL.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,250
- WHAT IS GOING ON, MISCHA?

95
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,000
- WELL, I--

96
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,250
- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH TROUBLE ALREADY.

97
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,500
IT WOULDN'T HURT
FOR YOU TO TELL US.

98
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,000
- I'LL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING TO YOU.

99
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,166
THE INTEL DEPARTMENT
HELD BACK CRITICAL INFORMATION

100
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,416
ABOUT THE GREAT WALL.

101
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,083
WITHIN IT, THERE IS A SPACE
THAT IS WARPED.

102
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,500
A PLACE WHERE EVERY LAW
OF PHYSICS CEASES TO FUNCTION.

103
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,125
- ( gasps )

104
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,541
- Dr. Egan: MOST LIKELY IT BEGAN
WITH A GIANT METEOR THAT FELL

105
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,416
SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS AGO.

106
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,291
IT CAUSED SOME OF
THE HIBERNATING

107
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,958
SCUB CORALS TO AWAKEN.

108
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:21,125
AND THEY WENT BEYOND
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS.

109
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,458
I ASSUME THE SCUB CORALS
QUICKLY RETURNED TO HIBERNATION.

110
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,958
HOWEVER, THERE WAS A POCKET
OF SPACE LEFT BEHIND

111
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,791
THAT HAD SURPASSED
THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS.

112
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,458
IF EVERY SCUB CORAL
WERE TO AWAKEN NOW,

113
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,000
THE EMPTINESS
WOULD ENGULF EVERYTHING.

114
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,416
- ( gasping )

115
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,291
- ( burping )

116
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,458
- ( sighs )

117
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,500
- AND SO WE MUST UNITE OURSELVES
WITH THE SCUB CORALS.

118
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,208
IN OTHER WORDS, WE MUST
HEAD TO THE TENTH PLANE.

119
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,625
AND DO OUR BEST
TO SEEK OUT THEIR VODARAC.

120
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,041
THE SCUB CORALS ARE SHIPS,

121
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,458
SHIPS THAT WILL TAKE US
TO THEIR SHORES.

122
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,833
- SHIPS?  THAT'S A RATHER
INTERESTING INTERPRETATION.

123
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,500
- OH, BROTHER.
I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE

124
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,166
HOW IGNORANT YOU ALL ARE.

125
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,833
WE ARE ALWAYS FEELING THE WIND
THAT GUIDES US TO THE SHIPS.

126
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,833
- THE WIND?
LIKE WHAT FILLS A SAIL?

127
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,541
- YOU FOOL,
I'M REFERRING TO TRAPARS.

128
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,541
- ( gasps )

129
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,541
- LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE SCANNING
ALL OF THE INFORMATION.

130
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,250
THE INFORMATION LOCKED
WITH THE BRAIN

131
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,333
THAT'S BEEN PILING UP.

132
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,041
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

133
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,041
HOW WE CAN GET ENERGY
OUT OF THE TRAPARS.

134
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,041
- CONSIDER WHY YOU THINK
WISHES OFTEN COME TRUE.

135
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,500
I'VE GOT IT!  A THOUGHT
CARRIES WITH IT ENERGY.

136
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,375
- THE POWER OF THE SEVENTH PLANE
AFFECTS THE THIRD PLANE

137
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,458
IN WAYS YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

138
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,833
AND YET THE SEVENTH PLANE
IS NOTHING MORE

139
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,083
THAN THE THOUGHTS OF LIVING,
INTELLIGENT CREATURES.

140
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,791
- WHAT ABOUT COMPAC DRIVES?

141
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,291
I'VE ALWAYS ASSUMED
THAT THEY WERE

142
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,208
SOME KIND OF TRAPAR AMPLIFIER.

143
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,708
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
FINALLY REACHED THE ENTRANCE

144
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,375
TO THE TEACHINGS OF THE VODARAC.

145
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,208
THE COMPAC DRIVE
IS WHAT CONNECTS

146
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,083
EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF US TO THE WIND.

147
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,375
- I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
ALL OF THIS STUFF,

148
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,083
BUT DOES IT MEAN
THAT THE COMPAC DRIVE

149
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,041
AFFECTS BOTH US AND THE TRAPARS?

150
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,625
- MM-HMM, THAT'S RIGHT.

151
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,541
AND THEY ALSO AFFECT
THE SCUB CORALS.

152
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,583
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
I WONDER IF THE SKYFISH

153
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,958
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH ALL THIS.

154
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,958
THEY LIKE TO SHOW UP
WHEN YOU THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS

155
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,625
WHILE YOU'RE REALLY CLOSE
TO A COMPAC DRIVE.

156
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,750
- MM-HMM.

157
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,333
- SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- WHAT?

158
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,791
- DO THEY AFFECT YOU
THE SAME WAY?

159
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,666
- I DON'T KNOW.

160
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,000
- SCIENCE AND RELIGION
ARE NOTHING MORE THAN TWO ENDS

161
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,916
OF THE SAME ROAD.
IT'S THE SAME WITH ONE'S SOUL.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,833
THE SPIRITUAL FOR THE PERSON,
THE MATERIAL FOR THE LAND.

163
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:51,416
WE ARE ABLE TO BE FREE
BECAUSE WE POSSESS BOTH OF THEM.

164
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,708
ALTHOUGH, THIS FACT
DOES CREATE A BIT OF WORRY.

165
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,166
AS SAD AS IT IS,
IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN

166
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,708
THAT THESE TWO CAN INTERTWINE.

167
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,291
- LET'S EDIT THIS INTERVIEW
AND GET IT ON TO THE MEDIA

168
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,500
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

169
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,208
I'M SURE THE WORLD
WILL FLIP ABOUT IT.

170
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,666
- WAIT A MINUTE, DO YOU
EVEN HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

171
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,458
HOW THE MATERIAL WORLD WILL END?

172
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,583
AND THAT THE SCUB CORALS
ARE REALLY SHIPS?

173
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,041
WHY WOULD THE ARMY GO THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE AND EXPENSE

174
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,791
TO AWAKEN THE SCUB CORALS,

175
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,625
IF THE MATERIAL WORLD
IS GOING TO END?

176
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,666
- THE ARMY IS PLANNING
ON ANNIHILATING

177
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,958
ALL OF THE SCUB CORALS
BEFORE THAT CAN HAPPEN.

178
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,375
- NOT THE ARMY, A YOUNG MAN
NAMED DEWEY NOVAK.

179
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,458
- Ageha Member #1:
THREE, TWO, ONE, ZERO.

180
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,625
- Ageha Member #2: CONFIRMING
THAT KUTE-CLASS HAS APPEARED.

181
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,583
- ( screaming )

182
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,458
- OH, NO!

183
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,708
MISAU, ARE YOU OKAY?

184
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,625
- Anemone: WHAT ARE YOU
DILLYDALLYING AROUND HERE FOR?

185
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,583
BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU
ARE TAKING YOUR TIME

186
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,625
GETTING OUT OF HERE,
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

187
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,125
THIS IS A STAGE
MADE JUST FOR ME,

188
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,500
SO DON'T GET IN MY WAY!

189
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,333
JEEZ, YOU'RE REALLY LATE.

190
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,541
IT'S TIME FOR THE GAME TO BEGIN.

191
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,041
JUST TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT THE POWERS

192
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,208
THAT ME AND MY SERVANTS HAVE!

193
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,833
- AGEHA SQUAD,
GAKUN DORA FORMATION!

194
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,791
VALHALUK SWELL!

195
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,166
- Dominic: DO YOU REALIZE
HOW MANY PEOPLE

196
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,750
ARE INSIDE THAT TOWER?!

197
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,416
- 35,215.

198
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,250
- THEY'RE NOT NUMBERS, THOSE ARE
PEOPLE INSIDE OF THERE!

199
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,083
ARE YOU GONNA IGNORE THEM
AND LET THEM DIE?

200
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,666
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO ASKED
HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE WERE.

201
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,625
- DO YOU HAVE AN ACQUAINTANCE
IN THAT TOWER?

202
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,875
- NO, BUT--

203
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,541
- THEN IT'S BEST
THAT YOU STAY QUIET.

204
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,916
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE WE
ACTUALLY HAVE THE MEANS

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,166
TO ANNIHILATE
THE ANTIBODY CORALIANS.

206
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,625
- WHEN THE ANTIBODY CORALIANS
NATURALLY CEASE FUNCTIONING,

207
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,583
WE'LL SEND THE ANEMONE SQUAD.

208
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,625
- THAT WAY, IT WILL LOOK
TO THE WHOLE WORLD

209
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,583
LIKE WE
SUCCESSFULLY ANNIHILATED THEM.

210
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,791
- ( laughing )

211
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,291
- Ageha Member #3: IT'S BEST
THAT YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS.

212
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,125
TO THE MASSES, VICTIMS
ARE NOTHING MORE THAN NUMBERS.

213
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,291
- Ageha Member #2:
BUT NUMBERS MOVE THE MASSES.

214
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,666
- Ageha Member #1:
ALL IN THE DIRECTION

215
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,500
THAT THE COLONEL SEEKS.

216
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,833
- ALL IS GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

217
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,208
- YOU ARE WATCHING THE TIME
THAT THEY RETREAT, CORRECT?

218
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,541
- YES.

219
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,833
AND WHAT ABOUT THE CLOWNS
THAT WILL START THE RIOT

220
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,791
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT?

221
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,041
I CAME HERE TODAY IN ORDER
TO SPEAK THE TRUTH TO YOU.

222
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,000
TRUTH IS NOT ALWAYS
SWEET AS CANDY.

223
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,791
SOMETIMES IT IS BITTER,
SOMETIMES IT IS HARSH.

224
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,833
BUT REGARDLESS OF THE TASTE,
WE MUST FACE IT HEAD-ON.

225
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,333
BECAUSE IT IS THE TRUTH!

226
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,083
- HORRIBLE!

227
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,583
- HOW COULD IT BE?

228
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,041
- WE WERE-- WE WERE
JUST THERE TODAY.

229
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,833
- CONTACT ALL KEY STATION,
RIGHT AWAY!

230
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,166
THIS IS A SCOOP,
GET A GOOD SHOT.

231
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,208
- THIS TRAGEDY IS HAPPENING
ON OUR PLANET AS WE SPEAK.

232
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,875
AT THIS VERY MOMENT,
HUMANS IN EVERY REGION

233
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,625
ARE BEING ASSAULTED
BY UNKNOWN CREATURES

234
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,125
CALLED CORALIANS.

235
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,875
YET THE SAGE COUNCIL IS TRYING
EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER

236
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,416
TO HIDE THIS FACT FROM US.

237
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,750
WHY?!

238
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,708
- Dewey: ( on television )
BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED.

239
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,208
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
HAVE THE ABILITY

240
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,041
TO SEIZE CONTROL OVER THEM!

241
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,750
THE SAGE COUNCIL
HAS LOST ITS POWER.

242
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,541
- OH, COME ON.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

243
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,125
WHO'S BEEN PROTECTING
THE WORLD FOR ALL THIS TIME?

244
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,583
THE SAGE COUNCIL, RIGHT?

245
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,833
BUT YOU KNOW, THERE ARE MORE
AND MORE TOWERS LATELY

246
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,416
THAT HAVE DROPPED
ALL COMMUNICATIONS.

247
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,875
- DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THAT BIZARRE THINGS LIKE THAT

248
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,958
ARE GOING TO APPEAR
OUT OF NOWHERE AND ATTACK US?

249
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,291
- IT'S TRUE.

250
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:02,041
THEY EXIST, THEY ATTACKED
AND MURDERED MY FAMILY.

251
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,166
- Dewey: ( on television )
IF WE CAN'T RELY ON THE SAGES,

252
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,208
IS OUR ONLY OPTION
TO SIT HERE AND WAIT

253
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,583
FOR OUR VIOLENT DEATHS?

254
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,416
- THE ANSWER IS, NO!

255
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,083
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

256
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,750
EVEN IF IT MEANS
GOING AGAINST

257
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,333
THE ENTIRE SAGE COUNCIL
AND RISKING IMPRISONMENT,

258
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,583
I WILL SAY, NO!

259
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,458
POWER GOES AGAINST POWER.
AND IF THE ENEMY

260
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,291
POSSESSES ABSOLUTE POWER,

261
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,333
WE SHOULD SEEK
THE SAME FOR US.

262
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,000
- ( murmuring )

263
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,833
- DON'T BELIEVE IT!
IT'S ALL A BIG LIE!

264
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,833
- IT IS NOT A LIE, IT'S TRUE!

265
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,791
- YOU CAN'T GET IN TOUCH
WITH THE CAPITAL?

266
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,416
I DON'T WANNA HEAR THAT CRAP.

267
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,833
WE GOT A BIG SCOOP HERE.

268
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,583
- Dewey: WITHOUT POWER,
THERE IS NO FUTURE FOR MANKIND.

269
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,875
( on television ) POWER IS WHAT
BRINGS THE FUTURE TO US ALL!

270
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,291
- SO MANY FACES LOOKING
LIKE THEY'RE THINKING,

271
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,875
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT.
SO DISGUSTING.

272
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,833
- SO NOW MY FRIENDS,
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU

273
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:54,833
TO OUR LAST HOPE.

274
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,541
THE AGEHA SQUAD!

275
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,375
AND HERE'S THE LEADER
OF THE AGEHA SQUAD,

276
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,541
OUR BEAUTIFUL GODDESS OF WAR--
ANEMONE!

277
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,875
- ( cheering )

278
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,333
- Dewey:
I WAS NOT THE ONE WHO THOUGHT

279
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,333
THAT TODAY'S SITUATION
WAS IMMINENT.

280
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,791
NOR THE ONE THAT CREATED A FORCE
TO FIGHT AGAINST THE CORALIANS.

281
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:39,375
IT WAS NONE OTHER
THAN OUR HERO, ADROC THURSTON!

282
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:43,166
IT WAS HE THAT ANTICIPATED
THE ATTACK OF THE CORALIANS,

283
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,541
KNEW OF THE CONSPIRACY
AMONG THE SAGES,

284
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,708
AND LEFT BEHIND
THE AGEHA PROJECT

285
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,416
THAT PERSEVERED
AND SAW THROUGH IT ALL!

286
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,416
- ( cheering )

287
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,583
- ( hushed awe )

288
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,625
- ( nervous chattering )

289
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,416
- AH, MY FRIENDS,

290
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,375
I JUST GOT WORD
OF A VERY TRAGIC INCIDENT.

291
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,833
CAPITOL HILL
IS UNDER ENEMY ATTACK.

292
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,125
- ( frightened groans )

293
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,375
- THE ROTTEN SAGE COUNCIL
IS POWERLESS

294
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,416
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT,
AND IS JUST SITTING THERE

295
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,166
WATCHING IT HAPPEN.

296
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,916
IF THEY WILL NOT ACT,
THEN I WILL!

297
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,916
I WILL HEAD TO THE CAPITAL
AND RESCUE IT!

298
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,875
- ( cheering )

299
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,833
- Hap: IF THEY HAD
FOOTAGE OF THE CORALIANS

300
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,333
ATTACKING THE CAPITAL,
IT'D BE PERFECT.

301
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,708
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
OUR SCOOP OF THE CENTURY

302
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,000
IS ALL FOR NAUGHT.

303
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,166
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

304
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,583
WE STILL HAVE
ALL OF THE FOOTAGE, RIGHT?

305
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,583
- WHEN SOMEONE GOES OUT
AND TELLS A LIE

306
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,125
AS BIG AS THIS ONE,
THE PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME

307
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,375
FINDING THE TRUTH.

308
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,500
- EVEN IF WE HAVE
TRUTH ON OUR SIDE,

309
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,541
A GLASS FULL OF WATER DOESN'T
CHANGE THE FLOW OF THE RIVER.

310
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,208
- IF THIS IS A MEDIA WAR,

311
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,958
WE JUST SUFFERED A TOTAL DEFEAT.

312
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,625
- I PROMISE YOU
I'M FINISHING THE ARTICLE.

313
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,625
- YEAH, BUT YOU
MISSED YOUR CHANCE.

314
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,125
- EVEN IF THE ENTIRE WORLD
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT,

315
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,291
ALL I NEED IS ONE PERSON
TO READ IT.

316
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,958
AND IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN

317
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,083
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO FINISH UP THIS ARTICLE.

318
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,041
- BUT FOR NOW, PUBLIC OPINION
WILL BE SET

319
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,333
ON COMPLETE ERADICATION
OF THE CORALIANS.

320
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,125
- HAP, STOP!
- HM?

321
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,083
- DON'T RUN AWAY FROM IT.

322
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,166
- Eureka:
YOU'RE GOING?

323
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,375
- MM-HMM.

324
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,375
- IF THE LIMIT OF QUESTIONS
THEORY IS TRUE,

325
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,166
THEN WE NEED
TO ACCURATELY ANALYZE

326
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,833
THE VARIABLES IN ORDER
TO CALCULATE

327
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,250
THE MOMENT THAT IT WILL HAPPEN.

328
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,666
AND TO DO THAT,
WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE LAB.

329
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,166
BESIDES, WE'VE GOT ALL SORTS
OF WORK PILING UP.

330
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,875
- IT'LL BE LONELY WITHOUT YOU.

331
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,125
- WHAT?  LONELY, YOU SAY?

332
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,375
- WELL, GREG, YOU TAKE CARE.

333
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,875
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME WITH US?

334
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,041
- NO, THANKS.

335
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,583
I STILL HAVE QUITE A FEW THINGS
LEFT TO DO.

336
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,416
- IF YOU EVER WANTED TO DO
SOME RESEARCH ON SOMETHING,

337
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,875
WOULD YOU WANT TO WORK
AT THE DESK NEXT TO MINE?

338
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,375
- Mischa: IF YOU GOT
LIGHTER BY 10 KILOGRAMS.

339
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,875
- ( gasping )
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE

340
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,375
TALKING ABOUT HYPOTHESES!

341
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,583
- IT'S ABOUT THE FAMILY
WE'D BE CREATING.

342
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,083
- Dr Egan:
EUREKA IS CHANGING TOO QUICKLY.

343
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,333
- Holland:
WE CAN'T GO AS IS, RIGHT?

344
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,166
- ( farting )

345
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,250
- I ATE TOO MANY BEANS.

346
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,041
EVERYTHING IS
AS THE VODARAC GUIDES IT.

347
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,833
WHAT KIND OF ENDING
WILL MANKIND SEE?

348
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,416
THAT'S FOR THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE.

349
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,083
- UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, I'M NOT
A WORSHIPPER OF THE VODARAC.

350
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,750
I CAN'T LET SOMETHING
LIKE THIS DETERMINE

351
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,416
THE DESTINY OF MANKIND.

352
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,583
ON TOP OF THAT, HE BROUGHT UP
THE NAME OF ADROC.

353
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,875
- ( footsteps )

354
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,208
- Eureka:
YOU ALL RIGHT?

355
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,458
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?
- WHAT?

356
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:14,125
- WHAT DEWEY SAID,
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?

357
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,458
- NO, I DON'T.

358
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,708
BUT...

359
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,291
I'M SORRY.

360
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,208
- WHY ARE YOU APOLOGIZING?

361
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,833
- YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S REALLY HURT THE MOST

362
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,333
BY ALL OF THIS.
BUT I--

363
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,583
- I'M FINE,

364
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,541
JUST BEING LIKE THIS.

365
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,416
- Master Norb: EUREKA IS
STARTING TO LOSE POWER.

366
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,958
IT IS IMPORTANT
FOR A HUMAN AND A CORALIAN

367
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,500
TO RIDE THE NIRVASH AS A SET.

368
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,250
JUST LIKE TWO HALVES OF A SOUL.

369
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,250
EUREKA IS TRYING TO BE
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT EUREKA.

370
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,833
SHE IS TRYING TO BECOME A HUMAN.

371
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:05,500
WE MUST GO THROUGH WITH IT ALL
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

372
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,083
THAT IS THE PROMISE
WE MADE WITH SAKUYA.

373
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,333
- I KNOW.  I'LL HURRY.

374
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,416
ESPECIALLY WITH DEWEY
ON THE MOVE.

375
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,500
- Dewey: NOW THE MASSES
WILL BEGIN TO MOVE.

376
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,166
HUMANS ARE QUITE SIMPLE.

377
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,000
STIR UP A LITTLE UNREST
AND ADD ONE DROP OF HOPE,

378
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,708
AND THEY ARE EASILY LED.

379
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,416
A HOPE JUST LIKE YOU.

380
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,166
- SO <i>I'M</i> THEIR HOPE?

381
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,458
- THAT'S RIGHT.

382
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,041
- Dominic: COLONEL!

383
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,375
THE ANTIBODY CORALIANS
AT THE CAPITAL,

384
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,166
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY
COULD POSSIBLY BE--

385
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,708
- COLONEL, THERE ARE NO REPORTS
OF ANY KUTE-CLASS ANTIBODIES

386
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,541
IN OR AROUND THE CAPITAL.
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

387
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,666
- SOMEONE HAS TO LIGHT
THE BEACON

388
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,333
TO AWAKEN THE SLUMBERING MASSES
AND THE SLEEPING LAND.

389
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,333
- Renton: EUREKA, WHAT'S
BEYOND THE GREAT WALL?

390
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,625
- Eureka:
I DON'T KNOW.

391
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:03,291
BUT THERE'S ONE WORD
I KNOW OF TO DESCRIBE IT.

392
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,375
- WHAT IS IT?

393
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,375
- FUTURE.

394
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,250
THAT IS WHAT IS BEYOND
THE GREAT WALL, RENTON.

395
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,416
ADROC SAID THAT TO ME.

396
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,875
- MY DAD DID?!

397
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,416
- MM-HMM.

398
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,750
- WAIT, YOU MEAN YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT MY DAD?

399
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,875
- Eureka and Renton:
TO BE CONTINUED.

400
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,791
- ( theme music playing )

401
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

402
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,708
- Talho: WITHIN THE GIANT
SWELLS OF CHANGING TIMES,

403
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:04,666
THE BOY LEARNS THE TRUTH
ABOUT HIS FATHER.

404
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,708
HOW WILL THE STORIES
OF THE PAST

405
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:10,000
TIE THE BOND BETWEEN
THE BOY AND THE GIRL?

406
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,000
NEXT EPISODE-- "DATE OF BIRTH."
