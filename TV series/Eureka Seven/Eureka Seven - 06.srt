1
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:31,625
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,875
- ( Renton groaning )

3
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,041
( screaming )

4
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,500
- HMM?
- HUH?

5
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,875
- ( laughs )
- HUH?

6
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,666
OH!  AHH!

7
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,500
- HUH?

8
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,208
- NOW LOOK HERE!

9
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,375
- OH, HEY,
IT'S ONLY YOU, RENTON.

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,250
- "LOOK HERE" MAKES YOU SOUND
LIKE AN OLD GUY TALKING.

11
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,666
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, RENTON?

12
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,583
- DON'T YOU
"WHAT DO YOU WANT" ME!

13
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,458
THIS IS ALL YOUR GUYS' DOING,
ISN'T IT?!

14
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,583
- ( all laugh )
I TRY TO STAY CALM,

15
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,208
BUT YOU KEEP SETTING TRAPS
AND DOODLING ALL OVER ME.

16
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,541
- YEAH, AND PUT ROACHES
IN YOUR POCKETS.

17
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,166
- PRANK PHONE CALLS TOO.

18
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,291
- IT WAS SO FUNNY WHEN WE SEWED
UP THE ZIPPER ON YOUR PANTS.

19
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,291
- ( sighs )

20
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,625
YOU KNOW, BIG BROTHER
IS VERY MAD AT YOU RIGHT NOW.

21
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,791
WITH YOU GUYS PLAYING PRANKS
LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME,

22
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,125
I CAN'T KEEP BEING ADULT
ABOUT IT.

23
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,666
- Boy: BUT YOU'RE A KID, RENTON!

24
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,416
- Girl: A KID, A KID, A KID!

25
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,708
AND I HEARD MISS TALHO SAYING

26
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,875
YOU STILL DON'T HAVE YOUR HAIR.

27
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,833
- ( all chuckling )

28
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,625
- ( grunting )

29
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,333
AHHH!

30
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- MMM.

31
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,375
- RENTON, WHAT'S WRONG?

32
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,333
- AH!  OH, WELL, I--
- ( all laughing )

33
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,375
- SEE, IT'S JUST--
HEY, EUREKA,

34
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,375
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN YET,
HAVE YOU?

35
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,750
- NN-NNH.

36
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,750
- HOW ABOUT WE
GET SOMETHING TOGETHER THEN?

37
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,416
I KNOW A PLACE WHERE WE CAN
GET A GREAT VIEW OF THE OUTSIDE.

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,291
- HOLLAND CALLED FOR YOU
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

39
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,250
- IT LOOKED LIKE
HE WAS IN A HURRY.

40
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,125
- YOU BETTER GET GOING, RENTON.

41
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,166
- ( sighs )
- YOU'VE GOT TO WORK.

42
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,333
WE CAN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

43
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,000
- ( Renton thinking )
WELL, SIS, IT LOOKS LIKE

44
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,166
THEY DECLARED WAR ON ME
BEFORE I EVEN REALIZED IT.

45
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,666
- All: NYAH!

46
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,208
- THE ATTACKS HAVE GOTTEN BOLDER
AND MORE FIERCE

47
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,791
SINCE THIS TIME
LAST WEEK.

48
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,666
AND NOW WITH ALL THIS,

49
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,000
THEY'VE COMPLETELY
CROSSED THE LINE.

50
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,208
BUT THEY'RE EUREKA'S CHILDREN,

51
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,916
SO I CAN'T FIGHT BACK

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,583
AND I CAN'T MAKE PEACE.

53
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,125
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

54
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,208
( sighs )

55
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,541
RENTON, REPORTING FOR DUTY,
JUST AS YOU REQUESTED.

56
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,041
- NOT BAD.
THAT WAS PRETTY QUICK.

57
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,791
- RENTON, YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE CARGO

58
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,875
WE'RE CARRYING
ONBOARD RIGHT NOW?

59
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:42,958
A LOAD OF WAX, RIGHT?

60
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,875
THE KIND YOU PUT
ON REF BOARDS AND STUFF.

61
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,541
- I WANT YOU TO TEAR OFF
ANYTHING THAT CAN IDENTIFY

62
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,916
THE SENDER OR THE RECIPIENT
FROM THE CONTAINERS.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,541
- YOU WHAT?!
BUT HOW COME?

64
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,625
- THE RECIPIENT VANISHED.

65
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,416
- IN OTHER WORDS,
THEY WENT BANKRUPT

66
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,666
AND RAN OFF LAST NIGHT.

67
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,208
- IT'S BECAUSE WE KEEP
ACCEPTING SHADY CARGO.

68
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,458
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, RENTON.

69
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,875
IT WASN'T THAT THE CARGO
WAS SHADY THIS TIME.

70
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,958
IT WAS THE RECIPIENT
THAT WAS SHADY.

71
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,875
- WE CAN'T KEEP
SOMETHING THAT HUGE

72
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,166
STORED ON THIS SHIP FOREVER.

73
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,958
SO WE DECIDED TO SELL THEM
ALL OFF IN BURDETH.

74
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,000
- KEN-GOH'S
GONNA THROW ANOTHER FIT.

75
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,000
- I'LL SELL 'EM
BEFORE HE GETS PISSED.

76
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,791
- YEAH, BUT ISN'T BURDETH--

77
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,166
- WELL, AT LEAST YOU KNOW
HOW TO READ A MAP.

78
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,875
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

79
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,916
WE'LL HAVE TO PASS RIGHT
IN FRONT OF A MILITARY BASE.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,916
- THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.
- HMM?

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,958
LOADED INTO THE CENTRALIZED
COMPUTING SYSTEM ON THE GEKKO

82
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,541
IS A DEVICE CALLED
THE COMPAC INTERFERENCER.

83
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,208
THIS DEVICE THREE-DIMENSIONALLY
SCANS THE SKY

84
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,541
FOR THE TRAPAR WAVES
THAT ARE CREATED

85
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,541
WHENEVER A COMPAC DRIVE
IS IN OPERATION,

86
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,541
ALLOWING US TO USE IT
AS A KIND OF RADAR

87
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,083
TO SEARCH FOR ENEMY SHIPS.

88
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,333
OF COURSE, WE CAN ALSO
CANCEL OUT THE FREQUENCY

89
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,333
OF THE TRAPAR WAVES
EMITTED FROM OUR DRIVES.

90
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,708
- THAT'S IT!

91
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,166
THAT'S WHY WE DON'T SHOW UP
ON THE RADAR.

92
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,916
- HMM.  VERY GOOD, RENTON.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,083
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT AN
AWESOME SHIP THE GEKKO IS.

94
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,416
SO I GUESS THAT'S WHERE
IT GOT ITS NICKNAME.

95
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,791
- Jurgens: AH, THE EVER-ELUSIVE
GEKKOSTATE, HUH?

96
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,041
- Man: I'M SURE THERE'S NO
MISTAKE ABOUT THE INFORMATION.

97
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,541
THEY'RE HEADING DIRECTLY
TOWARDS OUR MILITARY BASE.

98
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,458
- HA!
THEY'RE SO FULL OF THEMSELVES.

99
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,041
ALL RIGHT THEN, EXTEND THE
RANGE OF OUR RECONNAISSANCE.

100
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,791
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
OUR RESERVE FORCES?

101
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,291
- I DON'T CARE.
DON'T HOLD ANYTHING BACK!

102
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,791
- I NEED TO BORROW THIS,
OKAY?

103
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,916
- RENTON, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,625
YOUR FACE IS A MESS.

105
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:37,125
- WHEN I LEFT THE BRIDGE,
FOR SOME REASON, I FELL DOWN!

106
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,958
- ( all sighing )
- AH, THEM AGAIN.

107
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,208
THEY'RE SURE GIVING YOU
A HARD TIME.

108
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,625
- THEY AREN'T OLD ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO REASON WITH YET.

109
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,125
JUST GIVE 'EM A WHACK!
- NEVER HAPPEN.

110
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,000
WITH HIS DEAR EUREKA
AS THEIR MOMMY,

111
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,541
HE CAN'T REALLY
GET MAD AT THEM.

112
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,541
- Woman: TRYING TO WIN THE MOM
THROUGH HER KIDS.

113
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,166
- IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT, OKAY?

114
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,708
- YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE UP.

115
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,041
I TOLD YOU, DIDN'T I?
EUREKA PREFERS OLDER GUYS.

116
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,666
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

117
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,000
- I'M POSITIVE.

118
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,000
- WELL, UM,

119
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,500
EXACTLY HOW OLD IS EUREKA,
ANYWAY?

120
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,416
- HOW OLD IS SHE?
- HEY, DON'T ASK ME.

121
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,041
- I'D SAY AROUND 15 OR 16,

122
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,041
JUDGING FROM
THAT BEAUTIFUL FIGURE OF HERS.

123
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,666
- OH, MISS HILDA! MATTHIEU'S
LOOKING AT YOUNG GIRLS

124
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,791
LIKE A DIRTY OLD PERVERT.
- IDIOT, WOULD YOU STOP THAT?

125
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,958
- YOU WANT EUREKA AS THE COVER
GIRL FOR NEXT MONTH'S ISSUE?

126
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,750
MAYBE WE'LL GET
SOME BRAND-NEW FANS.

127
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,166
- Stoner: YEAH, WELL,
WE DON'T NEED FANS LIKE THAT.

128
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,708
- Gidget: MATTHIEU
HAS A LOLITA COMPLEX!

129
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,708
- HEY, YOU WANT ME
TO PUNCH YOU, GIDGET?!

130
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,041
- WHAA!

131
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,875
- ( thinking )
HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

132
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,708
I'M IN LOVE WITH EUREKA.

133
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,375
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE
ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE KIDS.

134
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,250
SO I DON'T GET MAD AT THEM

135
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,000
AND THEY
DON'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.

136
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:49,250
THEN THE PRANKS CONTINUE AND
I CAN'T BE ALONE WITH EUREKA.

137
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,250
IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE.

138
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,500
AHH!

139
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,708
HUH?

140
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,041
CUT-- CUT IT OUT!
- ( kids giggling )

141
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,041
RENTON,
YOU'D BETTER HOLD ON TIGHT

142
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,375
'CAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS
UP THERE!

143
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,000
- WAIT!  STOP THAT!

144
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,083
WHAAAA!

145
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,500
YOU GUYS
ARE SO OUT OF CONTROL.

146
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,500
IF YOUR MOM WASN'T EUREKA,

147
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,250
I WOULD WIPE YOU OUT.

148
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,750
- WANT SOME HELP?

149
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,250
- YEAH, THANKS.

150
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,916
A LITTLE HIGHER UP, PLEASE.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,583
- YOU MEAN HERE?

152
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,583
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

153
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,458
AY!

154
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,708
THAT'S COLD.

155
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,333
HEY, THANKS A LOT.

156
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,791
EEK!

157
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,083
- DID THE CHILDREN
DO THIS TO YOU?

158
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,291
- NO!  I MEAN, THAT'S NOT IT.

159
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,000
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.
DON'T WORRY.

160
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,625
- REALLY?

161
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,708
I'M GLAD.

162
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,625
DO YOU THINK THAT I'M
DOING A GOOD JOB AS A MOTHER?

163
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,625
- HUH?
YEAH, YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE.

164
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,791
AT LEAST I THINK YOU ARE.

165
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,791
- I REALLY AM TRYING.

166
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,125
I'M DOING EVERYTHING
EVERYONE TOLD ME I SHOULD DO.

167
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,458
IT'S A PARENT'S JOB
TO SCOLD THEIR CHILDREN.

168
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,541
- HUH?

169
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,458
- THAT'S WHAT
THEY CALL DISCIPLINE.

170
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,666
RENTON, HOW DID YOUR PARENTS
DISCIPLINE YOU?

171
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,250
- BY THE TIME I WAS OLD ENOUGH
TO NEED DISCIPLINE,

172
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,083
BOTH MY PARENTS WERE DEAD.

173
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,125
- I SEE.

174
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,958
- SO WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

175
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,333
MY OLDER SISTER TOOK OVER
THE JOB OF BEING MY PARENT.

176
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,333
I REALLY LIKED
BEING WITH MY SISTER.

177
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,750
SHE SMELLED SO NICE.

178
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,625
- Newscaster:
AND NOW FOR OUR NEXT STORY.

179
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,291
THERE'S BEEN AN UPDATE
ON THE EXPLOSION AT KAPEL BASE

180
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,791
THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE EARLY-
MORNING HOURS OF THE 16th.

181
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,125
THE UNITED FEDERATION'S FORCE
HAS DETERMINED

182
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,125
THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT
TO BE THE EXPLOSION

183
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,958
OF AN OLD-STYLE WEAPON.

184
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,875
HOWEVER, NO DETAILS
HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED,

185
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,708
INCLUDING THE EXACT NATURE
OF THIS WEAPON.

186
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,541
THE OPPOSITION PARTY IS SEVERELY
CRITICIZING THE HANDLING OF...

187
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,791
- ( Holland thinking )
THE ONE THAT KILLED THE KING.

188
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,125
BUT THAT KING IS ALREADY--

189
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,875
- ...SERIES
OF UNEXPLAINED ACCIDENTS.

190
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,375
- THAT'S NO GOOD, MAURICE.
IT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH.

191
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,208
- SHOULD WE ATTACH ONE MORE?

192
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,000
- WON'T IT JUST BREAK
IN THE MIDDLE?

193
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,666
IT'LL BE PRETTY HEAVY
WHEN WE ADD WATER TO IT.

194
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,958
- HEY, I KNOW!
- HMM?

195
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,500
- JUST USE A LONGER CORD!
( laughs )

196
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,583
- HEY, RENTON,
HOW YOU DOIN'?

197
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,250
SO HOW'S YOUR WAR
WITH THE LITTLE BRATS GOING?

198
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,916
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU--

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,958
I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO A BIG
FIGHT WITH THOSE THREE KIDS.

200
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,416
UNLIKE THEM,
I'M AN ADULT WHO KNOWS HOW--

201
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,916
- OOOH!

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,791
- ( grunting, screaming )
THOSE BRATS!

203
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,291
- Maeter:
THIS IS GONNA REACH IT EASY.

204
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,916
LINCK, YOU'RE GREAT.
- ( Linck giggling )

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
- CAN YOU CARRY IT?

206
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,250
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

207
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:20,083
- BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T TRIP.
- 'KAY.

208
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,625
AHH!

209
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,875
- ( whirring )
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

210
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,916
- HE TRIPPED ON SOMETHING!

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,833
( grunting )

212
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,500
- ISN'T IT THIS OVER HERE?

213
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,750
WHAT DO WE DO?!

214
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,250
- NOISY!  I DON'T LIKE IT!

215
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,583
- LINCK, WHICH ONE OF THESE
DID YOU PUSH?

216
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,625
- ( grunting )

217
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,625
- ( whirring dies down )

218
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,083
- Maurice: IT STOPPED.
- IT'S NO GOOD IF IT STOPS

219
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,250
BECAUSE IT WAS MOVING BEFORE!

220
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,708
SHOULD WE TELL MAMA?

221
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,791
- NO, WE'LL TELL HOLLAND
ABOUT IT.

222
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,708
HE'S THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP.

223
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
WE SHOULDN'T TELL MAMA.

224
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,625
- WE CAN'T!
- HUH?

225
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,375
- IF WE TELL HIM, HOLLAND
WILL KICK US OFF THE GEKKO.

226
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,250
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT IF WE
JUST APOLOGIZE FOR DOING IT.

227
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,125
- IF WE GOT SEPARATED FROM MAMA,
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT.

228
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,416
- NO.

229
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,750
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
SENT AWAY FROM MAMA!

230
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,125
WE MADE A PROMISE, DIDN'T WE?

231
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:17,416
THAT WE WOULDN'T LET RENTON
OR ANYONE ELSE HAVE MAMA.

232
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,416
SHE'S OUR MAMA!

233
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,750
( crying )

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,125
- I'M SORRY, LINCK.

235
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,625
WE DID PROMISE, DIDN'T WE,

236
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,666
THAT WE'D GET RENTON
OFF THE SHIP

237
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,708
AND PROTECT MAMA TOGETHER?

238
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,791
- ( Linck crying )

239
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,708
- ( thinking )
OH MAN.

240
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,541
I KNEW THAT WAS IT.
I KNEW THAT WAS IT ALL ALONG.

241
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,000
THAT THEY DIDN'T
WANT EUREKA,

242
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,541
THEIR MOM, TO BE
TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM.

243
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,208
I WAS LIKE THAT TOO.

244
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,791
- Diane: RENTON!

245
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,875
I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT
APPOINTMENT TO GO TO.

246
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,166
GIVE THAT BACK TO ME!

247
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,875
- YOU CAN'T HAVE IT!
NO WAY.

248
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,541
YOU'RE SO UGLY, SIS!
( snorting )

249
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,666
- COME ON!
GIVE THAT BACK!

250
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,375
- ( Renton thinking )
I COULD KIND OF TELL

251
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,166
WHEN SIS WAS GOING OUT
WITH SOMEONE.  SO I KNOW.

252
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,791
- ( alarm sounding )

253
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,791
- Holland: THE COMPAC
INTERFERENCER JUST SHUT DOWN?

254
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,541
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

255
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,166
- FOR NOW, THE MILITIA
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIND US

256
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,916
BECAUSE WE'RE HIDDEN
BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS.

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,083
- BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
WE CAN'T JUST STOP

258
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,958
AND HIDE INSIDE THESE CANYONS
FOREVER!

259
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:30,208
- Stoner: BUT IF WE TRY TO FLY
NOW, THEY'LL SPOT US, RIGHT?

260
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,166
- ( alarm continues )

261
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,625
- HEY.
- ( gasps )

262
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,208
HUH?

263
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,083
- SHH.
- ( ship whirring )

264
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,500
- MATTHIEU, HAVE YOU SEEN
THE CHILDREN ANYWHERE?

265
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,541
- YEAH, I SAW THEM WITH RENTON
HEADING TOWARDS THE HANGAR.

266
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,625
WHAT ARE YOU--
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

267
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,041
THE NIRVASH HAS JUST LAUNCHED?

268
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,375
- Maeter: HEY, RENTON,
I DIDN'T KNOW

269
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,250
YOU KNEW HOW TO PILOT AN L.F.O.

270
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,833
- YEAH, IT WAS MY JOB TO
MOVE THE L.F.O.s WHERE THEY

271
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,416
NEEDED TO BE WHEN I WORKED
IN MY GRANDPA'S FACTORY.

272
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,750
- SO YOU'VE NEVER LIFTED BEFORE?
- DON'T WORRY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

273
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,291
I'VE WATCHED EUREKA HANDLE
THE CONTROLS LOTS OF TIMES.

274
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,916
- MMM.

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,083
- Man: CONFIRMED, AN UNKNOWN
CONTACT MAKING A FAST APPROACH!

276
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,333
IT'S A SINGLE SHIP.

277
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,041
- IS IT THE GEKKOSTATE?
- THAT'S STILL UNCLEAR.

278
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,916
- HA!
I WONDER.

279
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,125
- IT MIGHT BE A DECOY,
COMMANDER.

280
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,916
- YES, IT MIGHT.

281
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,583
- HEY, HOW COME
THEY'RE NOT SHOOTING?

282
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,916
- I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT IT'S PERFECT FOR US.

283
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,875
AH!
WHAT THE--

284
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,333
- ( both whimpering )

285
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,416
- MAN, THAT'S NOTHING!

286
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,291
- All: HUH?

287
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,000
I'LL SHOW YOU GUYS
HOW TO PULL OFF

288
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,000
A REAL PRACTICAL JOKE.

289
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,333
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO!
- All: OKAY!

290
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,666
- Jurgens: WHAT IS THIS?

291
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,333
- I'M UNABLE TO OPERATE
THE RADAR-GUIDED MISSILES.

292
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,500
- COUNTER-ATTACK EFFECTIVE
IS DOWN TO 40!

293
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,750
- WHAT'S THE CAUSE?

294
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,833
- I BELIEVE IT'S WAX
USED FOR LIFTING.

295
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,000
- THEY CAME
TO TAKE OUT OUR RADAR.

296
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,250
- GET THE RECON SQUADRON
BACK HERE!  AND MAKE IT QUICK.

297
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,125
- Maeter: AH, THEY'RE SO SLOW!
- Linck: YOU CAN'T GET US!

298
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,041
- HEY, RENTON, WE'RE ALMOST
OUT OF THE LIFTING WAX.

299
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,666
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

300
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,083
TIME FOR THE FINISHING TOUCH!
- All: PERFECT!

301
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,375
- LOOK AT THAT.
- All: WOW.

302
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,083
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- THIS IS AMAZING!

303
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,750
IT FEELS REAL GOOD.

304
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,333
- ( giggling )

305
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,291
( laughing )

306
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,916
- ( all laughing )

307
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,208
- ( alarm sounding )
- HMM?  OH NO.

308
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,875
- LOOKS LIKE THE AIR FORCES
HAVE COME BACK.

309
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,500
- ALPHA AND CHARLIE
HAVE NOW RETURNED TO OUR SECTOR.

310
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,916
- BRAVO WILL ARRIVE BACK HERE
IN TWO MINUTES.

311
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,083
- I HOPE THEY ENJOYED
THEIR FUN AND GAMES.

312
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,291
BECAUSE NOW IT'S TIME
TO PAY.

313
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,500
- HEY, RENTON!
THEY'RE GOING TO GET US.

314
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,041
- THERE'S ONE BEHIND US.

315
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,541
( gasping )

316
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,041
- DAMN IT!

317
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,083
AM I JUST
COMPLETELY HELPLESS HERE?

318
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,000
HUH?

319
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,291
THEY CAME FOR US.

320
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,041
606, MATTHIEU,
IS THAT YOU?

321
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,500
IT'S EUREKA!

322
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,916
HUH?  WHAT WAS THAT?
- RIGHT AWAY, MAMA!

323
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,541
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

324
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,500
AH!

325
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,041
YAH!
- MAMA!

326
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,458
- IS EVERYONE HERE ALL RIGHT,
MAURICE?

327
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,208
- YEAH, MAMA, WE'RE ALL FINE.

328
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,875
- IT WAS SCARY. WE WERE
REALLY, REALLY FRIGHTENED.

329
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,833
- RENTON?
- HUH?

330
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,583
- SLIDE BACK IN THE SEAT, OKAY?

331
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,208
- UH, RIGHT, NO PROBLEM.

332
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,041
- ( all shouting )

333
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
- HOLD ME STILL.
- HUH?

334
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,000
- HOLD ME STILL
SO I DON'T SHAKE SO MUCH.

335
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,916
- UH, BUT THAT MEANS--

336
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,208
- HURRY!

337
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,375
- OKAY.

338
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,416
- HOLD ON TO ME
AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN!

339
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,833
- RIGHT.

340
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,541
I WON'T LET GO EVEN IF I DIE.

341
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,041
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LET GO EITHER.

342
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,916
- WHY ARE WE HAVING
SO MUCH TROUBLE

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,166
AGAINST ONLY FOUR CRAFTS?

344
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,666
TAKE THEM OUT NOW!

345
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,083
- IT EVEN MOVES DIFFERENTLY.

346
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,750
I GUESS THAT MEANS
THEY REALLY DO MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

347
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,250
- MAMA, THERE'S ONE COMING
FROM THE BACK!

348
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,208
- I THINK IT'S THE LAST ONE!
- LET'S GO GET HIM, MAMA!

349
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,500
- Children: CUTBACK!

350
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,208
DROP TURN!

351
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,500
- Maurice: ALL RIGHT!
- Maeter: AMAZING, MAMA!

352
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,750
- CUTBACK TURN DROP!
- ( all laughing )

353
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,333
- Maeter:
NO, LINCK, THAT'S NOT IT.

354
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,333
IT'S A CUTBACK DROP TURN!

355
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,625
- A CUTBACK DROP TURN?

356
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,625
CUTBACK TURN DROP!
- CUTBACK DROP TURN!

357
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,416
- CUTBACK TURN DROP!

358
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,583
- CUTBACK DROP TURN!
- CUTBACK!

359
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,041
- Matthieu: AREN'T YOU BEING
A LITTLE TOO ROUGH ON HIM?

360
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,916
THROWING HIM
IN THE LOCK-UP LIKE THAT?

361
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,916
- Holland: UNAUTHORIZED USE
OF THE NIRVASH,

362
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,625
MAKING A SOLO LAUNCH,

363
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,000
AND TAKING THE KIDS
ABOARD WITH HIM?

364
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,958
NONE OF THOSE CAN BE EXCUSED
AS JUST CHILDISH PRANKS.

365
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,416
- YEAH, BUT HE WAS JUST
COVERING UP FOR EUREKA'S KIDS.

366
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
- I KNOW THAT!

367
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,916
HE'S HAD NO ADULTS
TO SUPERVISE HIM.

368
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,125
AND THERE WERE NO ADULTS
WHO WOULD REALLY PUNISH HIM.

369
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,083
SO THAT'S WHY
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT.

370
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,541
AS THE ADULTS IN HIS LIFE,

371
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:17,166
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
RENTON IS PROPERLY PUNISHED.

372
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,250
- ( door unlocking )

373
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,916
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THEM,
RENTON?

374
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:34,041
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THEM
THAT THE KIDS BROKE THE SYSTEM?

375
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ADULT?
BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN?

376
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,083
- BECAUSE I'M RENTON THURSTON
AND THAT'S WHAT I DO.

377
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,666
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

378
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,291
- ME NEITHER.

379
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,083
HMM?

380
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

381
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,416
- THEY WANT TO TAKE THEIR
PUNISHMENT FOR WHAT THEY DID.

382
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,541
- HMM.

383
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,958
- I'M SORRY, RENTON.

384
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,416
- HMM?

385
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,458
THANKS A LOT.

386
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,750
AH!

387
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,750
BUT, EUREKA, WHY YOU?

388
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,333
- I'M HERE
BECAUSE I'M THEIR MOTHER.

389
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,708
IS THAT STRANGE?
- NNN!  NO, IT'S NOT.

390
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,833
I DON'T THINK
THAT IT'S STRANGE AT ALL.

391
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,208
- IT'S COLD IN HERE,
ISN'T IT?

392
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,791
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD.

393
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,750
TO BE CONTINUED!

394
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:32,333
- ( theme music playing )

395
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,291
- Narrator:
WITH THE PREMONITION

396
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,291
THAT SOMETHING BIG
IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN,

397
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,791
RENTON IS ASSIGNED
AN IMPORTANT MISSION.

398
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:09,291
WHAT AWAITS HIM
AS HE FIGHTS TO DO HIS BEST?

399
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,500
