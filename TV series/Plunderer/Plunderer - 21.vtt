Come on, you idiot.
Where are you?

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
Can you hear us, Pudding?

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.526 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.945 position:50% align:center

I found him!

[ERIN]
First Lieutenant Jail.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.955 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Assistant Officer Erin.
Is he available?

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.125 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but he's had an
extremely busy few days.

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:50.337 position:50% align:center
He's finally taking time to
eat a proper meal now.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.130 position:50% align:center
So, if you could
come back later,

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
I would prefer
not to interrupt--

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
...him.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.349 position:50% align:center
All right. Enough.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
Don't you know better than to
disturb a man while he's eating?

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
So, let's see if I can guess.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
You're here to talk
about that time

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
you messed with Althing, right?

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
Well, don't worry.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50% align:center
I dealt with it.

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
I never could say 'no' to kids.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
Just don't have
it in me, I guess.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50% align:center
What's more...

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
Jail-boy.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:34.422 position:50% align:center
I suspect we've got a major
conflict in our near future.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:38.009 position:50% align:center
That GefÃ¤ngnis Company of yours
may be full of troublemakers,

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
but it's still the
leading fighting force

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
in the Royal Army.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
We can't afford to lose its
strength at a time like this.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
Okay. So that's settled.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
Now come here! Gimme a smooch!

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
Please! Haven't you missed
your dear old dad?

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
What's wrong, Jail, my boy?

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.160 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to
dodge and send me

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
flying face-first into the wall.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
Did you eat something
you shouldn't have?

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
Is your tummy hurting?

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Money! Is that the problem?

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
Is some big bully shaking
you down for cash?

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
Well, let's see.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
He we go, all set!

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50% align:center
Just pass some of this around.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'll make a friend
or two. Go on, take it!

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
[ALEX laughs]

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
I see. It's too late.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center
You already made one.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
I knew you could do it.
You just had to try.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
I'm proud of you, my boy. I am.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
But, Jail, did it have
to be Licht Bach?

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
[ALEX grunts] Do you
understand what this means?

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
If you're truly taking his side,

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
then I will have no choice but
to pass judgment on you.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
I understand. Now, sir,
please bet your stars.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:19.652 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] I have come for the top.
For the head of the Royal Army.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
Supreme Commander
Alexandrov Grigorovich.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
AKA... Captain Alan!

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50% align:center
Let's do it, Four-eyes.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
[JAIL grunts]

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
[ALEX, JAIL grunting]

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:05:57.232 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
Haven't gotten any better
at feints, I see. Pathetic.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
[gasps, grunts]

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.781 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
You're too obvious!

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Nice try.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
But sweeping my leg out from
under me with your right hand

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
isn't gonna work.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
You really never learn, do ya?

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
No! Right leg?

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
[ALEX groans]
The jaw!

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
Didn't see that coming.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
Acting like you were still bad
at feints was a feint itself.

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] All those times
you challenged me

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
300 hundred years ago
were leading up

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
to this one single hit.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
Impressive. You learned fast.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
Though I suppose the
young usually do.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
Youth is immaterial.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
My conviction's what matters.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
I am determined to correct
the mistake you made.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50% align:center
Captain Alan. How could you?

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
Tell me... you traitor!

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
I think I've heard enough.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
A brat like you would never
get it. Not a chance.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
You've got conviction, huh?

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
That won't be enough
to douse it. Not from this.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:44.547 position:50% align:center
The fire of the Ace
of Explosive Strikes!

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
[JAIL grunts]

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
Now shut up and let
me tell you a story.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
I lived in a little country town

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:05.151 position:50% align:center
where I did office
work for the army.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.531 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] I had two kids:
a son and a daughter.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
He was eight and she
had just turned three.

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I had to work
at headquarters overnight,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
my kids hated it.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.751 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
So the next morning,

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
I headed home with some
toys to surprise them.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
But when I opened the door...

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] There was something
in my daughter's hand,

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
a scrap torn from
a bag of snacks.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
I think my son tried
to protect his sister.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
Don't know what I did to
deserve such a brave boy.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
He shielded her body
with his own,

00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
all of his wounds
were on his back.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
They were dead, but I could
still hear their voices.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
"Have a good day at work, Daddy.
Come home as soon as you can."

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
[ALAN yells]

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
In such a small town,

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.976 position:50% align:center
finding the man responsible
didn't take long.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
Please. God. No...

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] But then...
I looked around his bare home.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.407 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] And I...
I couldn't pull the trigger.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
'Cause the truth was:

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
I needed to aim my hatred
at the world we lived in and

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
the adults like me who couldn't
stop it from falling apart.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
You're right, Four-eyes.
Alcia is a betrayal.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
But if we want at least
some to live in peace,

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
there is no other way.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
Now that you understand, you can
start over as a new recruit.

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:29.045 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Your stars.
Bet them all, right now.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
You fool.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
This time, I won't go easy!

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
The thing is...

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
That story made it clear.
You won't ever defeat me.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
As long as I live,

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
my convictions will
remain unstoppable.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
And while you might fight me,
you won't take my life.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
You cocky brat.
What makes you so sure?

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:59.409 position:50% align:center
It's not just the future,
but the past, too!

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Three hundred years ago,

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
you learned Nana could
send people back in time.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
So why didn't you
use her ability?

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you ask her
to send you back in time

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
so you could save
your children's lives?

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
Because you were afraid
of changing the future.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
If you saved your children,
your convictions would waver.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
Alcia would never be built.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
And if Alcia ceased to exist,
then I would, as well.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
So instead, you chose not to
erase your children's death.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] For me...
a four-eyed fool...

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
...who never learned
how to make friends.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
An ungrateful wretch.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
A foster son. A brat.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
Oh, please.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
Don't think so
highly of yourself.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
I had a sure thing in you.
I couldn't change that.

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:09.604 position:50% align:center
You came for the head of
the Royal Army, did ya?

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] Seems to me you just
came for closure, for Rihito.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
