[LICHT grunts]

[LICHT]
What's going on?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
It's useless.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center

Show yourself!

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.425 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] You're at the bottom
of a pit of gravity

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.844 position:50% align:center
that not even light can escape.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
Just give up.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.473 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Doan? That can't be.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
We are the Aces.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.438 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
We kill and we kill.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.816 position:50% align:center
Our sole purpose for existing is
to end as many lives as we can.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.651 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
We kill our friends, too.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.861 position:50% align:center
Forsake them.

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
[NANA] We could search
for an eternity,

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.948 position:50% align:center
but our souls still
wouldn't find redemption.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.242 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] That's what it
means to be an Ace.

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
You guys are...

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.623 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Raising a blade against myself?

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.875 position:50% align:center
I really am beyond redemption.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.253 position:50% align:center
Pity. But there is a
bright side to this.

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:28.797 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
What?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.675 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Staying here means
I won't have to kill anymore.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.343 position:50% align:center
I'd finally be free.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.637 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] This place is
out of everyone's reach.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.180 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
And if no one can reach us,

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
no one else can fall
victim to our slaughter.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.686 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] The only person who's
going to fade away is you,

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.271 position:50% align:center
but it's a rest you've
definitely earned.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:49.317 position:50% align:center
That's enough! I refuse to
rot in a place like this!

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:54.447 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.158 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
You never learn, do you?

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
The harder you try,

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.495 position:50% align:center
the more pain you'll
put yourself through.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:01.746 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
Just accept your fate,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.456 position:50% align:center
and everything will
be much easier.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.375 position:50% align:center
Shut up! All of you!

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.628 position:50% align:center
I can't die here!
They're people waiting for me!

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:10.547 position:50% align:center
I will find a way back!

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.923 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
It's no use.

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
But, then again, swinging that
sword is all I know.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
So that's probably what I'll
do till my dying breath.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.182 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] So much for
the grand leader of the

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.184 position:50% align:center
"Army That Doesn't Kill," huh?

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.978 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
That army was a dream that got

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.479 position:50% align:center
blown way out of proportion.

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.565 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Yes. An impossible dream.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:29.607 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
You're wrong!

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.192 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
And just how is that wrong?

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.194 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Hero of the Waste War,

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
bringer of death
and destruction.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.448 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
No denying that's you.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:39.534 position:50% align:center
'Cause 300 years ago,
I didn't have a choice!

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:40.702 position:50% align:center
I had to kill.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50% align:center
I wanted to end the war,
and quickly.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.080 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Murderer.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.331 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] You can't end a
war without casualties.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.376 position:50% align:center
It's impossible.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] And I was fully aware
of that fact, wasn't I?

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.509 position:50% align:center
Not true. I just made a mistake.

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:59.804 position:50% align:center
I promised my friends we'd
be an army that didn't kill.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.682 position:50% align:center
But all I did was stop
them from killing.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.017 position:50% align:center
They were the army
that didn't kill

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.312 position:50% align:center
because I was the
one-man-army that did.

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.606 position:50% align:center
I broke our promise.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50% align:center
I took countless lives and lost
everything in the process.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center
I won't make that mistake twice!

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50% align:center
Because this time, I intend
to find some real answers!

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:21.451 position:50% align:center

You already have a real answer.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:22.869 position:50% align:center

So long as you stay here,

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
you'll never have to
kill anyone ever again.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.873 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
That's what you want, right?

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
No! I told Hina I'd
make it back to her.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
So that's what I'm gonna do!

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.550 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE] You sure do love
attacking me, don't you?

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
Say you do make it back.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
Are you really going to
hold Hina with those

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
bloodstained hands? The same
hands that killed her father?

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I...

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE] No matter how
you try to justify it, 

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
you're a murderer

No, I don't.

And neither does Licht!

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
It is.

[grunts]

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] He's as insolent
as he is stubborn.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
And his stupidity makes
that combination

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
all the more unstoppable.

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He'll be back.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
Sure sound confident
about that.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center

He will be back.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center

[LICHT gasps]
Hina...

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Is no longer my concern.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
Like hell she's not.
I promised I'd see her again.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
So? Big deal.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center
I bound myself to her

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
There's no way I can
just lay down and die.

At least not till I fulfill it.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
So, I have to live!

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Licht! I need you!

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.115 position:50% align:center
I can hear her calling.

She believes in our promise

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
She wants me to win

[TOKIKAZE]
What are you doing?

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Going back.

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
To the people who
matter the most!

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] You can put your mind

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Returning will only bring
you more pain and suffering.

And I can take it!
It's different now.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
I have people who can
share that pain with me!

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] There's someone

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
Someone to share my laughter.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
I'm going! Ah!

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center

[DOAN] I'll send you all to the

He came through!

Huh?

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I made a promise
to the students of Class A.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.507 position:50% align:center
To become the army
that doesn't kill.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.926 position:50% align:center

You damn bug!

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts] Lend me your

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.772 position:50% align:center

[LICHT]
Was this your doing?

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
Doan, did you kill him?

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Why does it matter?

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.425 position:50% align:center
He was the enemy.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
I've said it time
and time again,

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
Wars don't end unless
our enemy does.

I'm sorry.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
You did this for me.

Cockroach. You listening?

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
The two of us, together.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] We have the power

So let's make it quick.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
Let's kill every enemy we face
and be done with this.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:18.707 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yeah. You and me.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
We'll end it.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I promise.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]
I'm glad you're safe!

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
You came back to me.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
The Original Ballots.

[LICHT, HINA gasp]

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
[DOAN grunts] Captain Alan
has three of the seven.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
But you guys might know him
better as the Supreme Commander.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
The other four are in
the SSU's headquarters.

00:08:56.453 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
Well, except for the one that
was stolen five years ago.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
I have no clue where
that one wound up.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
None at all.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.339 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
I don't submit to anybody.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50% align:center
Especially not to you.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
I told her.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
I told Hina how I felt about
her just like I promised.

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.746 position:50% align:center
So, thank you.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
Also... sorry.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Pudding?

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
[yelps] Where did my clothes go?
What happened?

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
I love you. So much.

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Why do I get the
feeling I said something

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
outrageously embarrassing?

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
Must've been a dream!

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
For sure.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
And besides, what would the
townspeople of Homhough

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.367 position:50% align:center
be doing all the way out here?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.995 position:50% align:center
What if it were real?
Ha... I'd die!

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
We saw it all!

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
The whole thing!

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
[LYNN yelps]

someone who can support

broken you feel."

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
Hey, nice rejection!

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.176 position:50% align:center
Yes! Very!

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
Best I've ever seen!

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
Rejected?

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
That's right.
I said "I love you."

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
But I got rejected in the end.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. Maybe next time.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
He made her cry.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
[NANA] They sure are noisy.
Anyway, what are you up to?

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
As you can see, I'm reading.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
Are you really reading?

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
Or are you secretly
guarding your subordinate

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
because you actually care?

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
Heh. What about you?

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
I came to talk to Lynn.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
Someone needs to tell her
not to waste any more time

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.852 position:50% align:center
on that good-for-nothing.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.937 position:50% align:center
She should focus on
finding a new love,

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
and the sooner
she does, the better.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
Nana?

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

Huh?

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
...just let me know since
I owe you 300 years' worth.

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
I promised, after all.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You did! And don't
think you haven't been

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50% align:center
accruing interest all
these years, because you have.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center

Hm.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
What happened?

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
It's a really long story, man.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Yeah, I bet.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
As fun as this conversation is,

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:09.979 position:50% align:center
could we continue
after I'm untied?

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
When did I say I
would untie you?

an ounce of compassion

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
in their souls, I swear!

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
[PELE] 
Hey, Mister Pudding.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Huh?

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
How did you know I'd be
able to do that surgery?

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.423 position:50% align:center
Tell me, right now.

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:37.799 position:50% align:center
Just a hunch.

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
Hunch my ass. Why didn't
you ask Hina instead?

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
She's medically trained.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
And you knew that
because you were there

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.932 position:50% align:center
when she was learning.

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
Any normal person would
agree Hina was most suited

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center
to patch up Sergeant Major Lynn.

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
But, for some reason, you felt
she wouldn't be fast enough.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
So you chose to rely on me.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
It was a smart call, but how did
you know what I was capable of?

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
When did you know?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
I figured it out back
during the SSU attack.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
Alcians should have
no knowledge of guns,

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
yet you countered them like you
knew exactly what they were.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.836 position:50% align:center
That said, you chose
to side with Lynn.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
And if you're a friend of hers,

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
then you're a friend of mine.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
So it doesn't matter who
you really are, right?

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
[GROCER A]
Pele! There you are!

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
Been looking for you!

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's going on?

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
Um, the sergeant major's room?

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.240 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:46.576 position:50% align:center
She just got dumped,
so now's your chance!

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
Good luck, soldier!

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
[LYNN giggles]
Whoopsie.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
I didn't wanna be
seen like this.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
The tears won't stop.

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
I try, but... sorry.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
You supported my decision
to tell him, Pele. But I--

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
I got rejected.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
You honestly think I care that
some stupid guy turned you down?

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center
Um, Pele? Aren't you
kinda close right now?

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
Good. There's no sign of anemia.

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
All right, next I'll
check out your sides.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center
What're you checking?

00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
Don't make this harder
than it has to be!

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
[LYNN yelps]

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:44.676 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
There's no festering.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
And you haven't
reopened your wounds.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:47.470 position:50% align:center
Ow.

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
Kay. Now onto the thighs.
Spread your legs.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
Spread my wha--?

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.436 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to be professional
about this, okay?

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
Well you need to work
on your phrasing!

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps, whimpers]

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
Is it hard for you
to move your feet?

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Um, no.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.033 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Wait here. I'll be right back.

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Huh?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
Did you make all
of this yourself?

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
Sure did. Surprise!

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center
[PELE] What's with that look?
Hurry up and eat!

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
Oh. Guess I'll dig in, then.

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Oh, whoa! This is spectacular!

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I don't know if
it counts as cooking,

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
but you like rice, don't you?

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps]

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
Well... It was a fluke.

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
What was a fluke?

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
You know.

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
How Mister Pudding rejected your
heartfelt confession like that.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
He just has weird taste.

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
And you were true to yourself,
so why cry about it, right?

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
If you told anyone in
Homhough you loved them,

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
they'd be over the moon.

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
There's no way they'd
turn you down.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center
Wow. Anyone, huh?

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
Then, I have a question for you.

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What is it?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
Does that mean that you
would be over the moon, too,

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
Sergeant Pele?

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
Nope. You're too fat for me.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
[LYNN laughs]

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
What're you laughing at?

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
It's ironic, is all.

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
You're not into chubby women,
but your cooking would make

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:36.121 position:50% align:center
any girl who dates
you put on weight!

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
Shut up, and who asked you?

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
I think you may be forgetting
who the commanding officer

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:43.211 position:50% align:center
in this room is.
Still want me to "shut up?"

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Damn straight.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
Er, Sergeant Major, Ma'am.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Hey, I promised, didn't I?

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Yep! And you kept it!

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:58.226 position:50% align:center
I was able to keep
it thanks to you.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
You're what pulled
me outta there.

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yeah. You really did help.

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
Which means I have
a reward coming.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.279 position:50% align:center
So let's make babies!

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
What kind of person wants
a prize for saving people

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:12.615 position:50% align:center
from certain death?

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.909 position:50% align:center
Now hurry up Hina and put
your filthy pillows away!

00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:17.037 position:50% align:center
But I thought you
really liked boobs.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they're my favorite,
but not right now!

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right! You were
always more interested

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.877 position:50% align:center
in what was under my
skirt than my shirt!

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
The kinda guy who knows what
he wants and cuts to the chase!

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:29.674 position:50% align:center
Hina, please! What would your
mother say if she saw you?

00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
She would probably say
something encouraging.

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:32.886 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
She said that when
I fell in love,

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
I should have a baby and
make it so he can't escape!

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:39.267 position:50% align:center
That's gotta be the worst
advice I've ever heard of!

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
To each their own. Come here!

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Stop!

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
Oh what's wrong?

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
There's no need to
act so shy with me!

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
I'm undressing, too! See?

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
If you have any dignity at all,

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
I am begging you
to channel it now!

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
But baby-making is top priority!

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
Time and place should
be up there, too!

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
They would be if I didn't
think you'd run away!

00:17:58.203 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
I can't waste a single second!

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
There's nothing to worry about.

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:02.874 position:50% align:center
Count the clouds in the sky

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
and it'll be over
before you know it!

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
Don't say things like that!

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:10.173 position:50% align:center
Hina. Please.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:14.135 position:50% align:center
Come on. It's just you and me.

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
[LICHT gasps]

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:17.639 position:50% align:center
Ahem.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
[HINA, LICHT gasp]

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:22.894 position:50% align:center
We came to talk, but this
may be a bad time.

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
Real bad.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Wait! I'd love to talk!

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
This is the perfect
time to talk!

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
So, what do you wanna discuss?

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
It's simple, really.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
What's next for you?

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
[LICHT sighs]
Collecting the Original Ballots.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
Which means you're after Alcia.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that was the plan.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
What changed?

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
I realized something crucial.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
I realized just how dangerous
and powerful Althing can be.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
It can create or destroy
continents with a mere vote.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
That sort of thing should
be nonsense, but it's real.

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center
Yes, it is.

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
Power has a tendency to bring
people nothing but sorrow.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
That's especially true
when it's too strong.

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
And us Legendary Aces?

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
We came to know that
better than anybody.

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
Pudding.

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
The Count controls every
last thing about this world.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
People fear getting
sent to the Abyss,

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
yet never stop and question
the decisions Althing makes.

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
Well, it kinda keeps us alive.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
Who in their right mind would
question something like that?

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
We should. There's gotta
be another way to live

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
that doesn't involve Althing.

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center
[LYNN, PELE gasp]

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
Humans have the
potential to do it!

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying it'll be easy.

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
But as long as we trust
each other, share our ideas,

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
and unite our powers, I'm
positive we can accomplish this.

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
I know because that's
what you all taught me.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Heh.

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] People should be
allowed to determine

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
their own destinies, so let's
find a way to do that.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
Even if we have to
take on all of Alcia.

00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50% align:center
You idiot.

00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
Well, safe to say we have
our work cut out for us.

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
No point in overthinking
a decision once it's made!

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
You could dive headfirst
into the Abyss,

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:10.460 position:50% align:center
and I would follow
right behind you.

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
[NANA chuckles] Hina, I think
you're the toughest one here.

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
If it happens, it happens.

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
I'm in!

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
What?! Have you all
lost your mind?

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
[PELE sighs] Fine. Guess you
can count me in, too.

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
And on the plus side of things,

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
at least we have more
allies than we used to.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Huh?

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:33.983 position:50% align:center
I'll accompany you
anywhere you go, Rihito!

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate it.

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
Now that we have a plan,
shall we get going?

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
The Royal Capital will
be our first stop.

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:43.827 position:50% align:center
We have to get those Ballots.

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
It seems he's on the move.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
[NICOLA] We are fully prepared
to take over the Capital.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
All SSU personnel are awaiting
your command, sir.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
There's no need to rush.

00:20:57.257 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
Rabbits that act too quickly are
the ones who wind up dead.

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] Though tortoises
are just as prone to pointless

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
deaths if they're foolish
enough, are they not?

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center
Heh. Ah, Licht Bach.
I will be waiting.

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:30.165 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Here! Try some!

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's good!

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
Another promise kept.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:40.050 position:50% align:center
And it won't be the last one.

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:43.011 position:50% align:center
You know, I can make this
for you whenever you want!

00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
All you have to do
is say the word.

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
You might wind up in some bad
situations because of me.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
Aren't you scared?

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
Not if you're by my side, Licht.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
Ever since the day my
mother gave me this Ballot,

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:00.111 position:50% align:center
I've been dreaming of a
chance to travel with you

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:01.863 position:50% align:center
just like this.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.741 position:50% align:center
That's why you're stuck
with me no matter what.

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:08.453 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and I'm okay with that.

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:12.248 position:50% align:center
Glad you feel that way!
You're my Ace, after all!
