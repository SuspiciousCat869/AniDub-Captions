Wait a second!

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.557 position:50% align:center
Going through with a
surgery that might kill him

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.685 position:50% align:center
is a big decision to make so,
can he have some more time?

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.854 position:50% align:center
I believe I already
explained it.

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
We're doing this so we can
guarantee everyone's safety.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.942 position:50% align:center
I'm still not okay with it!

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.445 position:50% align:center
Same here! And why only Rihito?

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center
You can't divide a
class like ours!

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.574 position:50% align:center

That's not possible.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
There's no way you can hope to
beat professional soldiers,

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:41.124 position:50% align:center

six months of training.

and you would rather die

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center

If there's a real chance
of saving everybody,

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center

Pudding?

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.656 position:50% align:center
Oh! Sorry 'bout that.
I meant Rihito.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.243 position:50% align:center
Do you think you're doing this
to shoulder everyone's burden?

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.954 position:50% align:center
So you're the only one
who has to fight? Maybe?

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO laughs]

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.043 position:50% align:center
I wish I were cool enough
to have a motive like that.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.504 position:50% align:center
But it doesn't get
much weaker than me.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:28.838 position:50% align:center
I'll still need everyone's help,

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.758 position:50% align:center
'cause I can't do
this by myself.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.343 position:50% align:center
What if you could?

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.554 position:50% align:center
What if you became strong enough
to single handedly win a war?

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.099 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
I'd still insist
we fight together.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.479 position:50% align:center
There's no "I" in "army".
Gotta carry your own weight.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:46.523 position:50% align:center
I mean, that make sense?

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.110 position:50% align:center
I hate you.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.781 position:50% align:center
[HINA] So you're really
just going to stand by

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.325 position:50% align:center
and watch while Licht
gets the operation?

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.827 position:50% align:center
I told you before.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.037 position:50% align:center
There's nothing more
we can do here.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:01.663 position:50% align:center
You say that...

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.248 position:50% align:center
I agree with Hina.

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.917 position:50% align:center
If we can, we should stop
him from becoming an Ace.

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
Say we succeed in doing that.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.006 position:50% align:center
And then return to a
future with no Alcia.

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.055 position:50% align:center
all for the sake of one man?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
If it is, then that's the

[HINA, LYNN sigh]

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.979 position:50% align:center
Good news is that
we know for a fact

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:28.523 position:50% align:center
Licht doesn't die
in the operation.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.234 position:50% align:center
So let's just wait
and see what happens.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.070 position:50% align:center
All right then.

If we don't do something
to save him now,

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.349 position:50% align:center
he's going to become the

I'll get stronger,
then I'll fight alongside him,

to go it alone.

Seems you're still
acting the fool.

to do with you!

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
Please. I need a star!

What?

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.727 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] Just like last time.
Without one, I can't stay!

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] Why do you think
she's the only student

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.606 position:50% align:center
they gave a gun to?

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you.
She's nothing but a weakling!

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
And all weaklings do is serve as
cannon fodder during wartime.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to spare her from
dying a horrible death on the

and getting her kicked out.

Believe it or not,
I'm being considerate.

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
If you say so.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
I did. Heh.

[DOAN]
I'm outta here.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
Please give me one!
I'll do anything you ask!

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:26.970 position:50% align:center
Just name your price
and I'll pay it!

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Not this time.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
You act so devastated
when they're gone.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
So why not take more care
in protecting them?

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] You know.
I've been bullied all my life.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
And Rihito is the only person
who ever stood up for me.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
That's why I have to become
a soldier with him!

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
The second I leave his side,

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
I'll go right back to being
constantly bullied.

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
That's an unhealthy dependence.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
I don't care!

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] My one piece of advice
is to have conviction.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.543 position:50% align:center
Conviction?

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
If you desire to become strong,
you have to believe.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA whimpers]

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] I don't understand.
I'm sorry, but I don't.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Really?

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
We couldn't save him after all.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
What choice did we have?

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
We can't exactly wipe out an
entire population for one guy.

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
That isn't what's
bothering me.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
Do you remember how
Pudding saved me

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
from falling off that cliff
back in Homhough?

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
It made me so happy.

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
But if we change the past,

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:51.596 position:50% align:center
there's a good chance that
moment will never happen.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
It's a wonderful memory
that I didn't wanna lose.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
I like who he becomes
and I don't want him

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
to just fade away,
as if we'd never met.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
I know I'm awful.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
We're here because we're
supposed to save him.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
And what'd I do?
Pretty much the exact opposite.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
I'm such a terrible person.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center

Who cares anyway?

It doesn't matter
if it's the war,

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
the Legendary Aces, or any
of that other mumbo jumbo.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
You're too stupid to
comprehend that stuff.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
The bottom line is,
you like Mister Pudding

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:41.771 position:50% align:center
just the way he was back when
you met him in Homhough.

tried a lot harder to stop him.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center

[LYNN]
Huh? Um...

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:28.068 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry, Hina. I know
that you're his girlfriend.

[HINA]

[LYNN]
Uh...

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
Well even if he's
not your boyfriend,

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
you still like him, don't you?

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:42.165 position:50% align:center
Don't think so. Then again,
it's kinda hard for me to tell.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
If I'm being completely honest,

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.336 position:50% align:center
Licht is the first male
companion I've ever had,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center
boyfriend or not.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
So I don't know how to
place my feelings for him.

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
Enough about that!

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
I came up with a plan that
could still save Licht!

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
[LYNN, PELE]
Huh?

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking
this whole time.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.685 position:50% align:center
And I realized that we never
had to stop Licht's surgery.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.645 position:50% align:center
All we have to do is stop
him from becoming

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
that horrible killing machine.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
It's not too late.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
He still wants this army
that doesn't kill.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
So why don't we help him out?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
It's a long shot, but if we
somehow manage to win the war,

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
and prevent Licht from
actually killing his enemies...

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
Alcia would still be created!

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
Licht treasures every last
one of his classmates.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
Enough to make him sacrifice
himself to save us.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
So I say we return the favor!

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center

Well. That may be worth a try.

Lieutenant Jail!

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
IIf we see to it that
Class A doesn't abandon him,

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
then maybe he'll kick
that mask-wearing habit

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center
of his to the curb.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center

We can save Nana as well.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
You forgot a key fact.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for those masks
and that killing spree,

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
our side wouldn't have won.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
You guys saw it firsthand.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
Mister Pudding's full-blown
strength may be terrifying,

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
but without it, I don't
think we stand a ch--

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
You're wrong! When it comes
to his true strength,

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
Normal Licht overpowers
that Licht. I'm positive!

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center

She's right.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.208 position:50% align:center
It's hard to put into words.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
Something was different
when we fought in Homhough.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
It pains me to admit it,
but he was much stronger.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center

wanted us to change.

Are you there, Captain?

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
I am. So tell me what
the situation is.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.713 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] They re-did the
vote concerning war.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:04.881 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
They what?

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
There are seven Ballots
in the whole world

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
that possess the ability
to cast a vote in Althing.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
Other countries own four,
which is more than half,

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
and majority rules.

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:17.644 position:50% align:center
while we had our guard down,
the rest of the world held

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
a vote to change the ban on
war and Althing approved!

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.776 position:50% align:center
It was moved to September,
and we had absolutely no clue!

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:27.570 position:50% align:center
They tricked us and we fell
for it like gullible fools!

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Are you... enjoying this?

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA]
No! That would be inappropriate.

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we have a major problem.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Huh?

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] They managed to cut
the lab's electricity.

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
If we don't do something to
get it back, Rihito will die.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
What?

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.419 position:50% align:center
That can't be true!

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Why will he die?

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.464 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] The procedure was
going well, but the genetic

00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:50.760 position:50% align:center
injections he's been given
can't be stopped manually.

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
He's way over capacity
as things stand.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:57.183 position:50% align:center
Fairly soon, his body will
begin rejecting the transfusion

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:58.685 position:50% align:center
and enter cardiac arrest.

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:00.186 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] Someone needs to
start the backup generator soon.

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
That's the only way we can save
Rihito's life at this point.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:10.196 position:50% align:center
But the enemy has seized
control of the whole academy!

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
So it would be us against
an entire army, basically.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
I don't care!

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna let
him die like that.

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
It's not even a choice.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
This is dangerous.
Volunteers only.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50% align:center
[AKUI] I'll go. It's for
the sake of our commander.

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center

I see.

Where's the power source?

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
About 50 meters away.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be on
the right-hand side

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
of the gym warehouse
across the field.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center

we waiting for?

even make it halfway.

Watch this, kid.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
It would take you
less than six seconds

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
to get to the other side,

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center

than one second to die.
