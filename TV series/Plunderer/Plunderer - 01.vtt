There's not much time.
Take this.

leave. And search for someone.

From Fieni.

I didn't mind it all that much.

[TOWNSWOMAN 1B] Have you been
traveling all over Alcia?

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.840 position:50% align:center
Yes, I have. I'm looking
for a very special person.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:34.219 position:50% align:center
Oh really? Like a boyfriend?

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center

[TOWNSWOMAN 1A]
That sounds familiar.

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:42.727 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSWOMAN 1B] Ah, you know,
like from those tales.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.855 position:50% align:center
They run faster than a horse,
fly like a hawk?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.400 position:50% align:center
Everybody heard
about them when we were kids,

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.319 position:50% align:center
but that's obviously just
a silly children's story.

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:53.363 position:50% align:center

Hello.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.501 position:50% align:center
Uh. Nice to meet you.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
My name is Licht.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:12.048 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I know this
is kind of a weird question.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.259 position:50% align:center
After all, we just met.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:16.970 position:50% align:center
But I... I need it.
I need it bad.

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:18.388 position:50% align:center
Will you give me some money?

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
Why should I give you any money?

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.100 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I haven't eaten
in about a week,

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:24.561 position:50% align:center
and I'm practically knocking
on death's door!

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.354 position:50% align:center
What happened to me
is a real tear jerker,

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:29.024 position:50% align:center
and I wouldn't
wish it on anybody!

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center
You see, I was sent
on a shopping errand.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.111 position:50% align:center
But unfortunately one thing
led to another, you know,

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.071 position:50% align:center
and I spent all the money
on “adult goods.”

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.157 position:50% align:center
No! No! I mean I lost
it in an accident!

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.038 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I know what you're thinking,

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.539 position:50% align:center
but it wasn't a
moment of weakness.

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center
I didn't just indulge some silly
temptation or anything.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.169 position:50% align:center
Really, it's the tragedy of man.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:50.628 position:50% align:center
But if I don't give that
money back,

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.297 position:50% align:center
I won't be given any food.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center

and I'm dying from thirst.

Um. I guess?

As a token of apology,
how about a nice meal?

[LICHT] If you're offering,
can I have some, too?

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
Pay me. I did give
you money earlier.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Yeah. But you haven't
fed me in in a week!

Oh. Sorry about that, it's Hina.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center

the first “Hina” I've met.

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
How do you spell it?

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center

Uh... Well...

that often... around here.

Where are you from?

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Well. Right here on the map.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
I'd say that's pretty
deep in the mountains.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
I mean, I hadn't even
heard of any villages

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
or anything near there.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center
Because... It was
just my mother and I

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
living there by ourselves.
Until one day she disappeared.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
She was just dragged into
the ground all of a sudden.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center
Oh, you poor thing.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid she must've
been sent to the abyss.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
The abyss? What's that?

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
Do you really not
know what that is?

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Mm.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay. Look at all
the people around us.

They're great! Please, try one!

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.995 position:50% align:center
[NANA] You see how everyone
has a different number

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.872 position:50% align:center
written somewhere on them?

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
Those numbers are what
control our world.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
[HINA] What do you mean,
it's controlled by them?

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
I'll explain it best I can.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
From the moment we're born,

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.801 position:50% align:center
every single person is obligated
to count something specific.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
Yeah, like what?

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center
Well, like this. I've got my
very own number right here, see.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.183 position:50% align:center
This marks how many times
a customer told me

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
my food is good.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center
When they say it's bad,
my count goes down.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
You should have your own number
somewhere on your body,

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center

Where was I?

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, like I was saying,
the count can go down.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Ah.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
[NANA] You want your count to
keep going up and up,

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
but if things don't go your
way and it falls down to zero...

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
If that happens...
you'll be sent to the abyss.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center
That's not good, is it?

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
It's not, and that's the reason
everybody tries their best

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
to get those numbers to go up.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
Or at least attempts to
avoid them going down.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
[NANA] There're rumors
about what really happens.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
Some say you die in the ground,

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center
and others say it's
even worse than death.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to upset you.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
No, I'm fine, really.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
Ah. There's one more thing,

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
another rule about
what the number means.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
And that's, you can't disobey
any order from a person

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
who has a higher count than you.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
Can't disobey them?

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:21.608 position:50% align:center
Yes, so it's very important
you remember that.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
What it boils down to is a
difference in count reflects

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
a difference in status.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
Ultimately, it's just
another way those numbers

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
have control over our lives.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.746 position:50% align:center
Oh I never asked
what yours meant.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
What is it you're counting?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
Well, uh. Mine is...
It's the distance I've walked.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.963 position:50% align:center
That's what mom told me anyway.

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.548 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you sure about that?

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
Because walking converts to one
for every hundred kilometers.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
And if you're at 441,

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
you've walked almost
45,000 kilometers?

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
For the last five years,

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center
I've been searching for someone
important, so I've walked a lot.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.896 position:50% align:center
That's so incredibly far.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine how hard
that must've been on you.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.443 position:50% align:center
I don't really think
of it that way.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
My mother told me to
find them without fail.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.741 position:50% align:center
Those were her last words,
so it's just what I have to do.

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
Every time this number goes up,

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
I can feel her
with me even more.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
Like she's cheering me on,

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
and telling me she
knows I'll find them.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
To think there's some
amazing person out there

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
who's that important to you.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
Who are they, anyway?
I'm dying to know at this point.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
She said they're
The Legendary Ace.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.805 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
The Legendary Ace?

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.391 position:50% align:center
That's right, an honorable
and courageous hero

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
who wears a shining white star.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
Have you never heard
of them before?

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I have.
But the “legendary” part

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.442 position:50% align:center
means it's just a fairy tale
that people tell--

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
But it's true! While I was
traveling the countryside,

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.573 position:50% align:center
I heard that The Legendary
Ace was in this town!

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
That's the entire reason
why I came here!

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
I've never heard that rumor.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
I've been in this town
for quite a while now.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50% align:center
And no one has ever
mentioned them to me.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.130 position:50% align:center
Hear that, Licht? Hina's talking
about some Legendary Ace.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
Know anyone like that here?

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.470 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything.

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50% align:center
Hang on just a second, Hina.
I wasn't trying to be cruel.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] Are you looking
for me, young lady?

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]
You've got a white star!

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.739 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do. A courageous
hero from the Waste War

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
who's adorned with
a shining white star.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.244 position:50% align:center
AKA “the Legendary Ace.”

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
And I'm indeed
here in the flesh.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50% align:center
Huh. Is that right?

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center
[HINA sobs]

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
Really? It's you?
I've searched so long.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.133 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
What wrong Hina?

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:56.888 position:50% align:center
[HINA] I'm sorry.
I've just dreamed of this day.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.225 position:50% align:center
Searching. Looking everywhere.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] Hm. I feel so
very honored. Truly.

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.067 position:50% align:center
Now, I'm a sergeant major
in the military.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.902 position:50% align:center
Come to the guardhouse.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.446 position:50% align:center
I would love to hear your story.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sure.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.951 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait! Hina!

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
Now you wouldn't
defy the military.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
[NANA grunts]

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
Please, excuse us.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
Thank you guys so much for your
help! I really do appreciate it!

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
I really hope Hina'll be okay.

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] There are rumors
floating around about men

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
who pose as Aces and do
terrible things to young ladies.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.784 position:50% align:center
If you knew about that, then--

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
[sighs] The word of an Ace in
this town has spread quickly.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
I certainly didn't expect it.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts] It's stupid
to believe, though.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?
'Cause as things are now...

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.175 position:50% align:center
[LICHT shouts]

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
[BOY 1A] What is this stupid
looking, old thing, anyway?

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center

Rawr!

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
Hey! You get back here you
little brats! That's mine!

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
Get your grubby little
hands off it right now!

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
Hey, Licht!

[NANA grunts]

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.121 position:50% align:center
Um. So, uh...

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
Hm. You're beautiful. Really.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
Unbelievably cute. Hm-hm.

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
Anyway, my mother's last
words to me were to find you,

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.134 position:50% align:center
and I've looked for five years.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:11:59.969 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] I don't believe
I caught your name.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Huh? It's. Hina.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.724 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
I see. You're so cute.

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Oh. I forgot!

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:10.939 position:50% align:center
For you!

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
A ballot?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.655 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]
What's wrong?

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
Hina.

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes?

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:23.910 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
Are you a ballot holder?

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
Dunno. What does that mean?

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:30.375 position:50% align:center
I see. I guess that's a no.

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
Well then.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
You should hand it over.

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Huh? But I can't do that.
My Mom gave it to me.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.390 position:50% align:center
[HINA yells]

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.520 position:50% align:center
Please don't make
this difficult.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
What's happening?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Stop! I'm ordering you!

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
Mm. Really?

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:00.113 position:50% align:center
[HINA] It says right there your
count is only three-twenty.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50% align:center
What exactly is your point?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Well, my count is
four hundred, forty-one!

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.121 position:50% align:center
You can't disobey a person
with a higher count than you.

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
Those're the rules!

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.207 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
Hm?

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] Hm. It's true.
I'll give you that.

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
Heh. Well then.
You should bet your stars.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, what?
What's that mean?

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
As I said. With the privilege
given to us military men,

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
I formally challenge
you to a Star-Stake!

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
But, I have no clue
what you're talking about!

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
I guess a commoner
would be ignorant.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
But, nevertheless, If you
choose not to bet your stars,

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.118 position:50% align:center
I'm not obligated to obey you.

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:52.165 position:50% align:center
Now, what're you going to do?
The decision is yours to make.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
Well. I suppose.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
If that's what I have to do
to make you stop this.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
Heh. You have yourself a deal.

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
[ABYSS groans]

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] We're forbidden to
disobey those who possess

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:14.437 position:50% align:center
a higher count, but there
is a way around that rule.

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
To claim victory
in a star-stake!

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
[grunts, coughs]

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:25.031 position:50% align:center
It's a battle in which one
can place their own count

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
on the line.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center

[HINA shouts]

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
[DAVID grunts]
Some commoners such as yourself,

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
might have heard the term
thrown about before.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.549 position:50% align:center
But the fact remains,
the star-stake is the ultimate

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
privilege given exclusively
to those in the military.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.138 position:50% align:center
And it is a unique pleasure.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.769 position:50% align:center
A duel only granted
to us chosen ones!

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:56.479 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Please. Let go.

00:14:56.563 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] The look on your face
is quite pleasurable as well.

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:02.986 position:50% align:center
Please stop! I am begging you!

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
Stop, you say?

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:07.615 position:50% align:center
With those words you are
acknowledging your loss to me.

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
Understand? What that means...

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
...is your number belongs to me.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] Let's take a look.
And watch your count disappear.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] The winner can take
the loser's count, you see.

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
And then add it to their own.

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:35.685 position:50% align:center
That is the entire purpose
of the Star-Stake!

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
[DAVID laughs]

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
No, stop it!

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.357 position:50% align:center
Let's find out.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
Exactly how low did
that take your number?

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Oh my! It appears
you're down to only one!

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
[DAVID laughs]

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what do you think about
handing over that ballot now?

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
Now do what I say and
give it up like a good girl.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
Or would you prefer to go
though all that over again?

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
You're one tiny number away
from the abyss, you know?

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
How could you? Why are you
doing such a terrible thing?

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
The Legendary Ace is
supposed to be a hero!

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
[DAVID chuckles] Do you actually
even know what a Legendary Ace

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
is you naive little girl?

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.229 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Yes I do!

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
The Legendary Ace is a brave
hero from the Waste War!

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:24.776 position:50% align:center
They wear a shining white star,

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
and carry on them the number
of foes they've slain.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:31.866 position:50% align:center
Their abilities are
no less than superhuman.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.119 position:50% align:center
It seems you do know.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
And I stand before you now
as the Legendary Ace!

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.126 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Behold.

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
You foolish girl.

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
I mean, come on.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
Don't you know how long ago
the Waste War was?

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
You need to learn
something about history,

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
because it was over
300 years ago!

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
Three centuries ago!

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
Suppose all of the legends
about them were true,

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:03.481 position:50% align:center
there's still no way in hell
they would be alive today.

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
If they even existed
in the first place,

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:09.237 position:50% align:center
by this time they'd be nothing
but bones in the ground!

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center
No way, that's
not true. It can't be.

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:17.495 position:50% align:center
[DAVID laughs] It was all
just one big waste of time.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
You've been blindly following
this stupid fantasy

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center
of looking for someone
who died 300 years ago,

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
because mommy told you to!
You are both idiots.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
She wasn't lying.

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
All those years.
All of that distance.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
Your mom fed you
a bunch of nonsense

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
and you believed
her like a fool.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
Now, hand over that ballot!

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
I'll do another Star-Stake,
if that's what it takes!

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] What'll it be?
Don't make me wait!

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
She'll bet it.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
Licht, it's you.

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
So you're deciding
for her. That right?

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Indeed. And I shall
fight in the Star-Stake...

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
...on her behalf.

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
How can you do that
with your count?

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
It's negative nine hundred
and ninety-nine.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
[laughs] That's the
lowest I've ever seen!

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.347 position:50% align:center
A ridiculous number like that,
and you're challenging me?

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
It was foolish, but now...

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
...I believe I should take
this as a personal insult.

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
I'll send you to the
abyss for that!

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
Are you okay? Licht!

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
Are you hurt? Say something!

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
[DAVID laughs]

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
What's the matter?

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
Are you too feeble
to put up a fight?

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
You're nothing but human scum!

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
Something's strange here.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
 The guy's at negative
nine ninety-nine!

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
That's not even possible.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
[NICOLA] Sergeant Major David!
Something's not right!

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
What should I care?

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
[NICOLA] But his count,
it's way in the negative!

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
That's right.

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.065 position:50% align:center
Because he's the
lowest of the low!

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
But, sir, listen. If his count
is that far below zero,

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
then why hasn't he been
sent to the abyss yet?

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
[NICOLA] It must be because
the negative nine ninety-nine

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
is being cancelled
out somehow!

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
[NICOLA] There's only one
way for that to happen.

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
This guy...

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.712 position:50% align:center
He's a ballot holder!

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
[DAVID gasps]

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Thanks, I needed a haircut.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
Wait, who are you?
What is going on?

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Listen, Hina.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:43.850 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, what is it?

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna kill you!

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.021 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] You should stop looking
for Aces. You'll be happier.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
They're not heroes.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
No. What they are,
are murderers.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] You're better off
giving up your search.

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
Go live an ordinary life.

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
That's my advice for you.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
--But I...
--[DAVID] You bastard!

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.798 position:50% align:center
I asked you a question,
so tell me who you are!

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
Hina.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
Those five years you spent
faithfully following your

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
mother's last wishes,
the 40,000 plus kilometers

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:27.644 position:50% align:center
on your feet,
should never be mocked.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
And you.

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
If you know what's good for you,

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
give back the count
you stole from her.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
It can't be.

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
He's not just some kind of
ordinary ballot holder!

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
[NICOLA]
Look! You see that star?

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
They wear a shining white star,

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
and they carry on them the
number of foes they've slain.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
Their abilities are no less
than superhuman.

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
The Legendary Ace!

00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:38.983 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Hey, it's Licht!
We're in for a panties festival

00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:41.403 position:50% align:center
next time. Panties,
panties, panties!

00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:43.613 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Do you really love
panties that much?

00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:45.699 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I'd never say
no to a peek at yours!
