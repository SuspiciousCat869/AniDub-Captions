a swirling pit of darkness!

I saw the demon!

Can you describe the demon?

Sir, I think he's in shock.

No, this is the work of

No, that time I was
faster and you know it!

Nope! It was me!

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
Look! There's another one!

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center

Oh, I remember when you
were faster than me!

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.745 position:50% align:center
It was when you saved Lynn!

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
My Count is twelve thousand
and five-hundred.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center
That's higher than your paltry
fifty-seven hundred!

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
You can still count! Uh-oh!

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
I suspect that you have been
concealing your true power.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:17.093 position:50% align:center
Which means you must
possess a hidden Ballot.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.263 position:50% align:center
That's what you used!
That's right isn't it?

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
Wha--? This is the
only Ballot I use.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center

Tell you what I believe.

You're a Ballot Holder,
but you're a different,

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
special, kind of one.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:34.486 position:50% align:center
Jail, you're drunk.
I don't know what you mean.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center

a walking miracle!

Since I'm over 300 years old!

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
I don't make the rules.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
It's what the wanted
poster says!

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Then it must be true!

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
You think I want to believe
something so absurd?

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
That's what I'm sayin.
Now you're making sense.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
They sent me on a mission
to find the Legendary Ace.

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:07.560 position:50% align:center
His name's Licht Bach.

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
Tell me who you really are.

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
I will, if you have
one more drink!

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
Then you'll have one too!

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.332 position:50% align:center
Answer me! Who are you, really?

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
So you're that kind of drunk?

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
You ask the same
questions over and over.

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
I answered you
ten times already!

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
No you didn't!
You keep dodging me!

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm dodging you? Heh!

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center
Look, you can't blame
your mistakes on me.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
Or is that just how your
"conviction" works?

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
You're insulting my convictions?
How dare you!

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
Good stuff, huh? Don't let
it get you so worked up.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to condemn
the crime, not the person.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
Sounds like an opportunity for
you to be the bigger man here.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
You are not worthy
of my sympathy!

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.657 position:50% align:center
And that's why I worry about
the size of your heart.

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:04.409 position:50% align:center
Hey, how 'bout a new name?

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
You should call
yourself Little Jail.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:09.330 position:50% align:center
Iron Jail sounds so
closed off. And dumb.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center

Shut up!

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
Hey come on,
don't get so excited.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center
Be mindful of your
blood pressure!

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
Have another drink
and calm down!

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.886 position:50% align:center
No one's calmer than me!

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
No one's a better
drinker either.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
Hey! You made me
drink by myself!

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
No, I didn't make you.
You're blaming again, Jail-ster.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
Stop mocking my name like that!

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center

not have time to play around

what I wanted to say to you.

Do you think they're
gonna be okay?

Yeah, they'll be fine.
Don't worry.

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
I think the Lieutenant needed a
drink after what we saw. Um...

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
And, honestly, I think I could
probably use one as well.

pudding the first time you met!

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
So what is it you wanted
to know about him?

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Oh nothing! I mean...
I guess I forgot.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

Seriously? What's going on?

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:54.467 position:50% align:center
No idea. Now what? Tell HQ?

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
Hold on.
I hear something. Listen.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
[NICHOLA pants] Do you believe
me now, First Lieutenant?

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:11.693 position:50% align:center
What are you doing outside?
You should to be in bed!

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
[NICHOLA] This noise,
that's what we heard in Linden.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
When you saw the
Demon of the Abyss?

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]
It's returned to kill us all!

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
No one is safe.
Women, children...

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
No one's getting out!
It's coming! This is it!

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
We're all going to die!

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
Everyone, listen up!
I'm with the Gefangnis Company!

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
First Lieutenant Jail! We need
to evacuate all civilians.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
If you have a shield,
surround the opening.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
Archers, gather ammunition
and prepare to fire.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
And whatever comes
out of this hole,

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
destroy it at once!

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS]
Sir, yes sir!

00:19:57.364 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
What is that noise?
It sounds like...

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
Cancel that, Lieutenant!
You have to pull everyone back!

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
What? I knew it!

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
You do know something about
this Demon of the Abyss!

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
But this, it's just
not possible.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:18.385 position:50% align:center
Or it shouldn't be, at least.
They're gone. All gone.

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
So this can't be.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center
Say it! How do you know
the Demon of the Abyss?

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Sir, I think it's coming!

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
[ABYSS DEMON B growls]

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
Is that the demon?

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
No way. How is it
still able to fly?

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:52.293 position:50% align:center
And what is it doing here?

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
The war. They were taken out
of the sky so long ago.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
For one of them to
show up like this...

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
[ABYSS DEMON B growls]

00:22:35.313 --> 00:22:38.024 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] In the town engulfed
by flames, the man of iron,

00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:39.401 position:50% align:center
faces his final battle!

00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:41.861 position:50% align:center
Does the now-blind Jail
have any chance of victory?

00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:43.071 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Have you seen my glasses?

00:22:43.154 --> 00:22:45.115 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Next episode,
"Jail Dies Again"!

00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:47.117 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Stop it, he's not going to die!

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.618 position:50% align:center
Next episode, "Plunderer."

00:22:48.702 --> 00:22:49.911 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Where are my glasses?
