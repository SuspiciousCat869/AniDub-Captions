a great conflict in this land,

your top priority is
to punish criminals.

but that's no excuse.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:20.258 position:50% align:center
You can't simply ignore official

not accustomed to
dealing with conflict.

If you have time to waste
on utter nonsense,

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
you have time to
enforce justice.

If I wanted to, I could've cut

You know why?

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:17.357 position:50% align:center

she is to this town!
