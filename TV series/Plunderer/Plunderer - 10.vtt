Now I know it really
is you, commander.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
Please. Let me have this honor?

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.939 position:50% align:center
Please kill me.

You think you're ready?

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
Seems like you're forgetting
something important.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
The rule for when
two Aces fight.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Go on.
You know the words to say.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.429 position:50% align:center
Yes I do.

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:59.476 position:50% align:center
Before this battle,
I'll bet... all my stars.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
As will I. I pledge them all.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
Every last one.

A Star Stake?

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to start. Are you?

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.172 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yes, I am. Let's go.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
If she's an Ace, then...

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
That's right, she is
a Legendary Ace.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
Meaning this battle will not end
until one of them is the victor

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.873 position:50% align:center
and the other lies dead.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.712 position:50% align:center
Well... I'm sure
Pudding will be fine.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
I'm not so sure.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Huh?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
Her Count. It's much
higher than you'd think.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
She has thirty-two thousand!
She's gonna outlast Licht.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
His Count is only
fifty-seven hundred!

Licht's been hit!

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
You can relax, he won't lose.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
Unlikely, anyway. His opponent's
got quite a fight on her hands.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
Just think about it. When he
and Lieutenant Jail fought,

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
neither one overpowered
the other.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
Somehow, both of them
fought on the same level.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center
The Lieutenant's count is more
than double what Pudding's is.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
Seems impossible, but still...

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
How did he do it, then?

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50% align:center
There's only one way he
could've made that work.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps]

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center

don't you?

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
There's more to Mr. Pudding.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
He's hiding his true powers.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center

No! How is that possible?

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
[NANA] It's true. What we're
seeing now is the Ace.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
And his opponent...

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center

referred to as Legendary Aces.

He'd want you to.

He's said before that
unleashing the power of the Ace

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
would mean that another
personality would take over.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
Take over his body?

Yes.

"Schmerman". A man driven
by the intent to kill.

That wasn't her, either.

something Licht once said.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
There was a girl among the Aces
who never killed anyone 

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
until the end.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
She was afraid of everything,

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
and she was made to
believe she was useless.

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.402 position:50% align:center

the kindest one in the group.

They drugged that poor girl.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center
That's how they forced her
powers to come out.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.212 position:50% align:center
Then made her fight Licht,

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
so he would turn back
into the monster he was.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
It's their doing.

want to do this!

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.953 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] I have no choice
but to accept my fate.

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
After all, we Aces have always
taken from innocent people.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
It was bound to catch up to us.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
We've taken so much.

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
But... I just have one request.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
It's okay if you wait
until after I die.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center

Could you please...

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center

like was before?

Please don't, Sir.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:27.033 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. But really,
you've done enough.

00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center
So have you.

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.
I didn't mean it!

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have shot you,
that wasn't my intention.

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center

You sliced through

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
But as of right now, I feel that
you have no convictions at all.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center

Shut up.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
So this is it? Your full power?

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
And you're using it to
threaten a subordinate

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.195 position:50% align:center
who looks up to you.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.864 position:50% align:center

How can we take you seriously?

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Being controlled by a

Unable to resist
the urge to kill.

Can't swing a sword

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
And that's the best you can do?

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
Huh?

[LICHT grunts]
How dare you. This is war.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.809 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] War doesn't
end until enemies die.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
It's not about an urge.
If I kill an enemy,

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
I'm taking that burden
onto my own shoulders.

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
nobody else will have
to become a murderer.

If I annihilate all the enemies,
I will free my friends.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.081 position:50% align:center
My friends.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
Those kind, precious souls
will never become murderers.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
I will spare them that pain.

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
That's why... I have to do it!

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
No, you don't.

[JAIL] I don't have
time for excuses.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
But if what you just said is a
true statement of your beliefs,

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
then I will trust
in my convictions

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] Once upon a time,
there was a tortoise and a hare.

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:32.005 position:50% align:center
One day, the hare
told the tortoise,

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
"You are much too slow."

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
To which the tortoise said,
"Well, that depends.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
Why don't we have a race
to the top of that mountain

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
and see who can
get there faster?"

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
And with that, they both headed
toward their starting point.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.064 position:50% align:center
Right away, the hare
was too fast,

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
and the tortoise was
struggling to catch up.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
Suddenly, a wizard appeared.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
He had a special message
for the tortoise.

00:19:56.613 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50% align:center
"My blood is overflowing
with magic. If you drink it,

00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
you will be able to run
faster than any hare."

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
The tortoise desperately
wanted to catch the hare,

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
so he drank the wizard's blood.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN gasp]

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
So what happened after that?

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center
Did he start running faster?

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:14.005 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] As soon as
the tortoise swallowed

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
the first drop, he felt a surge
of energy and dashed off,

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:21.388 position:50% align:center
running faster and faster until
he caught up to the hare.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
And then he killed him.

00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN giggle]

Excuse me, sir.

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
Did it fail?

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
There was some
unexpected interference,

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
Even Major Sonohara turned back.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.743 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me, sir.
I messed up.

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] That's all right.
Don't worry about it.

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
There's nowhere to run, anyway.

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
I'm a wizard.
I'll fix it if I need to.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:56.965 position:50% align:center
Please do me a favor and bring
my beloved tortoise soon.

00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:58.883 position:50% align:center
Absolutely!
