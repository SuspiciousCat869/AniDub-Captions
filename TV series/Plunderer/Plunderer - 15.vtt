a successful feint.

You four-eyed spaz!
You've up and done it now!

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center

scary before, just wait!

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
Ready when you are.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:47.212 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] You might've
stood a chance, that is,

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
if you had bothered to
make a friend or two.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
I don't believe you
have any ill intentions.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.139 position:50% align:center
Not now nor in the future.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] But if you were
to make a mistake

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
somewhere down the line, I need
to know I can defeat you,

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
so that I can
right that wrong...

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
...by becoming the supreme
commander myself!

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
He's the definition of awesome.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
That's great for him,

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.787 position:50% align:center
but what are the rest of
us supposed to do?

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
Well, well.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize Captain Alan
gave out extra credit.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on, Mister S?

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you asked.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50% align:center
Today, we start a new kind
of training regimen.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
One that only an army that
does not kill undertakes.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center
Shall we begin?

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] You're all unique,
and your weapons and training

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
should be catered
to that uniqueness.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
Take Ichinose.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.106 position:50% align:center
She tends to focus on what's
directly in front of her.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
This sword is like that, too.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
Spears are perfect for Akui
and Suda's personalities.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
And Hina. With your kind
heart and loving nature,

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
you have the perfect
disposition to be a medic.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
Knowledge will be your weapon,
and the way you wield it

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
will mean the difference
between life and death.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
Why aren't we using things
more along the lines

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center
of guns and grenades?

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
Because modern weaponry
will only be used

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
in the beginning stages.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
For the second phase, combat
will consist of free-for-alls

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
and reusable weapons.
So you'll train with these.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
Because if you can
overpower your enemies

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
once phase two is here...

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
We can win without
killing, right?

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
Precisely right, Mister Rihito.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
All I know is that I
trust Mister Schmerman!

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center

[FIRENDA]
Well, Major?

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
I'm curious to hear
your assessment.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
It's a class full of good eggs.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
I wish their bright eyes never
had to see the horrors of war.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
That's one wish that
won't come true.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
The deadline is creeping
around the corner,

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
and once it arrives,
war will be unavoidable.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] This upcoming
conflict is going to be unlike

00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
anything we've
ever seen, correct?

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.556 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
Humankind won't be fighting over
limited resources this time.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
They'll be fighting to
lessen the population.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
In other words...

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
A war to rid the world
of wasteful humans.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
The children need
to be protected.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
I won't have them dealing
with such nonsense.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50% align:center
It's utterly ridiculous.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
And that's exactly what
Project Ace was meant for.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
I know that!

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
Then, with your blessing,
we should move to human testing.

a scalpel to any of my children.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
While it's true that they're
training to become soldiers,

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
you have to acknowledge
how young they are.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center

worked hard enough

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Huh? Who's there?

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
King Cockroach himself.

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
C'mon! How about we
settle this one-on-one?

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
Fine then. So long as you
realize it's your funeral!

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
Huh? What trick are you
tryin' to pull now?

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
It's my way of saying I'm gonna
beat you without that thing!

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
Bleh!

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
Why you little...!
Get back here!

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
As soon as I catch you...
you're dead!

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
You spineless insect!

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:35.055 position:50% align:center
Catch me if you can,
slow poke!

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
You can't run forever!

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
[DOAN laughs] There's nowhere
left for you to go.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
Brace yourself.

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Eh... truce?

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:59.579 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.748 position:50% align:center
[DOAN gasps]

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
That damn cockroach,
he tricked me!

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
Not too shabby, Class A!

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
Lemme take this
off your hands.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
We're the
indisputable champions!

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
We really did it!

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE] Let's all raise
a toast! To Class A!

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
[CLASS A STUDENTS]
To Class A!

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
You know, Rihito...

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
Um, know what?

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
You were cool
out there, commander!

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Did you say "commander?"

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
[SUMIYA]
The biggest reason we won

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:41.329 position:50% align:center
is because you
took charge, commander!

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Who is this "commander" guy?

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
Obviously, you.

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Me?

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna lie. I had some
serious doubts about this

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
"army that doesn't kill" stuff.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.631 position:50% align:center
You're tellin' me!

00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
But since we did it in
the game, you never know,

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
it might be possible
to do it in real life.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
As long as you're
there too, commander.

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
[SUDA]
So whaddaya say?

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.310 position:50% align:center
Wanna make this
"commander thing" official?

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
I think it's a
great idea. Honest.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
If you're our leader then,

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
I see a lot more
victories in our future!

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.111 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
I vow with all that I have,

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
we will be a real army
that doesn't kill!

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.916 position:50% align:center
[CLASS A STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
David really died?

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] And, sadly, that's not
the only issue at hand.

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Huh?

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
Before David met his demise,
he sent one last transmission,

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
though what it means,
I don't know.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
[DAVID] The bleeding won't stop.
What a joke, they got us good.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
You hear me?
They tricked us all.

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:56.029 position:50% align:center
Tricked us how?

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
He was far too vague.

00:19:57.572 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] Hm. Perhaps the
details of our plan were 

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
leaked out unbeknownst to us.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:08.750 position:50% align:center
If that's the case, we're left
with very little choice.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
We must move forward with
Project Ace right away.

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
What?

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
I will not use my children as
guinea pigs for an experiment

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
that could cost
them their lives!

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
And there it is. The X factor.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
It's the reason the
lab rats are going berserk.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
They possess your genes, sir.

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
That includes your
desire to kill.

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
There is nothing left for
us to try with the rats.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
Either we put a human
being on the table,

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
or we put a hold on Project Ace.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
Testing shows one candidate
could actually do this.

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
His DNA works.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
There's not much risk involved
when the chances of success

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
are as high as his.

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
I understand.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
This'll make our
dream a reality.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
And then we can do our
part to protect the world.

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:37.691 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Don't die, Captain Alan!

00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:39.901 position:50% align:center
[HINA] What do you expect
us to do if you leave us?

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:42.362 position:50% align:center
[ALAN] What are you
talkin' about? I'm invincible!

00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:45.156 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] Next time,
"The War of Waste Disposal."

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.825 position:50% align:center
Also, Alan dies.

00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:49.744 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
But I had so much to live for!
