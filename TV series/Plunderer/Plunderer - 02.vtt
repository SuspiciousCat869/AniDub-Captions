00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Many years ago,
there was a great 

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.019 position:50% align:center
conflict in this land,
known as the Waste War.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.154 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
The battle raged on and on.

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:31.031 position:50% align:center
During this time,
a group of heroes,

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.324 position:50% align:center
known as Aces, emerged.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:45.378 position:50% align:center
[NANA] They were marked
with white, shining stars,

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
and possessed
abilities far beyond

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.424 position:50% align:center
any other human warriors.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
The number of enemies vanquished
was engraved on their blades.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
[NANA] However, it is said that
when peace finally brought

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:06.232 position:50% align:center
an end to the bloodshed,
the Aces vanished.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.336 position:50% align:center
[NICOLA gasps]

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:52.380 position:50% align:center
He's really the Legendary Ace?

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
But that's impossible.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
Maintain your composure,
you fools!

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
It's just a bluff.
How could it not be?

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.476 position:50% align:center
The so-called Aces were
around 300 years ago.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard of a real
person living that long?

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
It's ridiculous!

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
But, sir.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
Wait, he's right,
this has to be an act.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.234 position:50% align:center
This guy's no Ace!

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
He's nothing but a fraud!

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
Let's teach him a lesson!

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.074 position:50% align:center
Hina, close your eyes.

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Huh?

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50% align:center
Do it.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yell]

[gasps]

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
What the...?

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS scream]

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
[DAVID gasps]
What just happened?

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center
Damn it. Where did he go?

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
What the...?

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
No. It's crazy. Stop this!

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Where are you?
Where are you, you coward?

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
Stop hiding! I order you to
come out and face me like a man!

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:10.417 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Sir. Behind you!

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50% align:center
I've got you now!

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.845 position:50% align:center
[DAVID shouts]

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I'm just walking
over here. I'm not hiding.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
[grunts, shouts]

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.900 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Now, give it back.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:44.200 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] The count you
wrongly took from her.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
The trust in her mother
you made her question.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
The years she searched.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50% align:center
Give it back to her.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:04.888 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
A legendary Ace.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
One who's letting
off a little steam.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
[DAVID grunts]

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
How dare you make a fool of me!

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
It won't be enough
to just kill you.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
For this, I'm going to
cut you into ribbons!

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:38.713 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
Bastard! I'm the chosen one!

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
I never lose a battle!

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
There's not a single
man out there

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
who can avoid the
sting of my blade!

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
I am the fastest swordsman

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
in the officer's ranks!
I simply never lose!

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
You will.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
Wow. The major's in trouble.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Wielding a great sword
as long as a man's height.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
[DAVID grunts]

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.701 position:50% align:center
His left hand, bearing a
count of negative 999.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
He is a Legendary Ace.

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
[DAVID shouts]

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:16.918 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
[NANA] His legs exert force
unthinkable by normal standards.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
His attacks move exponentially
quicker than the human eye.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
These extraordinary traits
earned him the name,

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
"Ace of Flashing Strikes!"

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
How fast can he be?

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
But you just told me his count
was negative 999, didn't you?

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:39.691 position:50% align:center
If it's that far down, he must
be extremely weak.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
Oh, about that number?

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
[DAVID groans]

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
[NANA] That counts the times
he's been rejected by women.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center
[HINA whimpers]

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center

[LICHT]
Hina. Keep your eyes closed.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
Right. I'm sorry.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yeah, no problem.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
Um, are we just floating
in the sky? How?

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center
Heh. Sorry 'bout that.
Are you scared?

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Kind of, actually.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
It just seems unbelievable.
I mean, people can't fly.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Maybe some can.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
Amazing. So, you really
are the one.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
The person that I've been
searching for for the last--

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
Look.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
Right now, I think we should
just finish this and focus on

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
getting your count back.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Wait a sec!
Licht, you, uh...

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center
You're still hungry, aren't you?

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.685 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Hm? Hungry?
Yeah, I mean, I could eat.

00:07:56.768 --> 00:08:01.272 position:50% align:center
[HINA] In that case.
When we get back...

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
To repay your kindness today.
Dinner is my treat.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
Ha! Aw, don't worry.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
I promise that I'll get
your count back--

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
That's not it!

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
The count doesn't matter.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
Please don't get yourself hurt!
Promise me!

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
Aren't you the one
who's injured?

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.049 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.968 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Listen.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
Just promise me. Okay?

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
Then we'll eat all
the food we want.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
Alright... I give you my word.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I won't get hurt.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna get your numbers back.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.198 position:50% align:center
We'll go home and then
we can have a feast,

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
just you and me!

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center

Ow...

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center

[LICHT] Well, that's a
better number, isn't it?

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
Plus. I'm just fine. You see?

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
I'm not even sore
after all of that.

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
Oh. Good!

[HINA'S MOTHER]
Hina.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
You need to leave.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:40.807 position:50% align:center
And search for someone.
The Legendary Ace.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
[HINA sighs]
I've... found... him.

[gasps]

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.407 position:50% align:center
[HINA] It took five
years of searching,

but I finally found
the Legendary Ace.

I guess I'll be
taking this. He, he.

[HINA]
Huh?

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
I can hardly even
believe my luck.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:28.355 position:50% align:center
A ballot like this
is worth more money

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
than I've seen in a while.
Yep. Damn good luck.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
Thanks to this little thing,
I'm a rich man now.

No. You're joking.

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:50.710 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Do you still not
get how this works?

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center

Yours is just seven-sixty.

I looked for so long.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] What's wrong?
You wanna trade me?

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:26.746 position:50% align:center

No way...

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
'Cause Mom said... that I just
needed to find the Ace.

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not the only
person in the world

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
who's known as an Ace.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
So the one your mom wanted
you to find. It's not me.

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
Hang on. Did he leave me here?

There you are!

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
I was so worried
about you, Hina!

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:43.490 position:50% align:center
Are you okay? Where's Licht?

[HINA sobs]

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
I see.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
He took the last thing
my mother gave me.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
what's going on.

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
What do I do now?

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
Where am I supposed
to go from here?

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
[NANA sighs]
What now, huh?

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
[HINA sighs]

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center

You know what?

[HINA]
Huh?

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
[NANA] I think the best
thing for right now,

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
is to hold on to this.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
It's just a silly doll.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center

Come on, Hina. Trust me.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center

But...

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
You'll know what to do soon.
I promise you'll want this guy.

00:14:57.439 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]
I... I don't believe it!

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center
[NANA] You should,
'cause there's your ballot.

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but why? I mean...

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
Owning a ballot is illegal.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.535 position:50% align:center
The authorities don't
take too kindly to it.

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's considered
one of the biggest no-nos

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
under Alcian law.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:15.915 position:50% align:center
What? Really?

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center

pull something like that.

[HINA pants]

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
[NANA] You probably
wouldn't have been charged

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
if you gave it over
to the military.

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.868 position:50% align:center
Especially since you
didn't know what it was.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
But you refused to do so,

00:15:56.664 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
and there were soldiers
who saw it happen.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
You would have been
branded a criminal,

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.131 position:50% align:center
and mercilessly hunted down.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
And not just by the military.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
There are lots of thugs out
there who would do anything

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
to get their hands on a ballot.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.227 position:50% align:center
If no one had plundered
it from you,

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
I doubt an innocent
person like you

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
would last for more
than three days.

Wait!

Please! Wait a second!

[HINA]
Licht, come back!

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
I looked... for you!
I looked for so many years!

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
After my mom vanished
into the ground...

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
[HINA] When she left,
I was all alone.

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
It was like that for
five long years.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
I traveled all by myself.
I was so lonely.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
I felt like I was invisible.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:26.171 position:50% align:center
[HINA] I went from town
to town, with nobody's help,

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
and nobody to keep
me company. It was so hard.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
I was afraid my life
would end up

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
staying like that forever.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center

[HINA gasps]
But then...

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
I met you, and Nana,
and everything changed.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
I felt like... I wouldn't
have to be alone anymore.

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
Right then.

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
I felt... like it was
okay to smile and laugh

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
and things might get easier.

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:57.660 position:50% align:center
Please don't go!

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:00.997 position:50% align:center

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
[HINA sobs] You promised
you'd share a meal with me.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
You gave me your word
that you would!

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:22.811 position:50% align:center

I'm begging you to come back!

I don't care about that thing.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:28.543 position:50% align:center
I have no interest in
the ballot whatsoever.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center

to come and thank you.

I gotta say,

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
that was unbelievably
cool earlier.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
He was able to blow our men
away just by walking.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
He must've been moving faster
than the speed of sound

or something.

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
And that big finishing move?

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
Oh man, he went up in the
sky and was like, boom.

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
Honestly it was more like a
bombing run than a fight!

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
With gravity working
with him like that,

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.967 position:50% align:center
there was no way for the
Sergeant Major to block it!

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
Even if he'd dodged, the
shockwave would've gotten him.

beat that? Oh yeah!

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:36.152 position:50% align:center

Yes, it's me. Yeah. Yep.

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center

you'd said it would.

What is going on here?

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm absolutely positive.
