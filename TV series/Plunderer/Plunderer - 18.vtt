[ICHINOSE] They disappeared.
All three of them.

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:18.935 position:50% align:center
[AKUI]
Yeah but where did they even go?

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.688 position:50% align:center
Jail said that they were
returning to the future.

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...
What's that even mean?

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
It means they'll be waiting.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
Three hundred years.

she'd wait for a murderer.

Rihito.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.788 position:50% align:center
So we have friends
in the future, huh?

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty crazy
concept to think about.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
Good luck living that long!

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
Three hundred years from now,
we'll all be dead.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
Yes, but, apparently
we have a connection.

They came here, didn't they?

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:01.227 position:50% align:center
They did.
They somehow found a way.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
Let's wrap up this stupid
war as soon as possible.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
Then we'll figure out how
to get to the future.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.361 position:50% align:center
And we'll reunite with them.

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:11.488 position:50% align:center
You've sure got a way
with words, don't you?

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.074 position:50% align:center
Yep, the commander's
always been good at that!

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
[AKUI] Together, we can end
this war in no time at all!

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.245 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.749 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] I will never allow
any of them to take a life.

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
Class A can still be
"the army that doesn't kill".

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.589 position:50% align:center
They don't need to feel the
pain that I endured. Ever.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:34.344 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Yeah. This is for the best.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:39.057 position:50% align:center
I'll kill... so they
won't have to.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.769 position:50% align:center
[NANA] The world was once again
engulfed by the fires of war.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:44.938 position:50% align:center
And the sole reason people
fought was to decrease

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:48.983 position:50% align:center
the population until famine
was no longer an issue.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.195 position:50% align:center
It would later come to be
known as the "Waste War".

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.489 position:50% align:center
Rather than waste
away from starvation,

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50% align:center
humanity chose to lay
waste to each other.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.456 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
It all started 300 years ago.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.584 position:50% align:center
I want those of you watching
this to know the truth.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:10.046 position:50% align:center
The truth about Licht
and what happened to him.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.259 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA]
The results are superb!

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:17.220 position:50% align:center
It was everything we
hoped it would be!

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
Was it, though? He broke his
oath and killed because of me.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.230 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] He had to kill so the
other children could live.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.815 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.776 position:50% align:center
We will not make it through this
war without an Ace on our side.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
We need him to change
the future and stop them

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.406 position:50% align:center
from plundering all
that we have, sir.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:46.082 position:50% align:center
[MALE SOLDIER A] Hm? What's that
guy think he's doing?

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.940 position:50% align:center
He's back. Thank goodness!

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
His face...

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
[NANA] That day,
Rihito slaughtered 337 people.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
And he did it all by himself.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO sobs]

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Um. Are you okay?

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
It'd been a long time coming,

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
but a second Ace
was finally born.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
An Ace as gentle as
he was optimistic.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center
[NANA] He felt more like a big
brother than a war hero to me,

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
so I called him Big Bro.
It seemed like fate.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
Like I became a guinea pig
in the Ace Project

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
because I was
destined to meet him.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Licht steadily changed
with each passing day.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it was due
to his overexposure

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
to Schmerman's genes. Scars that
couldn't heal started appearing.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
Both inside and out.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Schmerman's deadly
impulses took a stronger hold

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
on his mind with
every kill he made.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
Eventually, his kill
count reached 10,000.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
By that point in time,
Licht lost the ability to smile.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE]
Oh, Rihito!

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
Surprise!

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center

scrub down, too!

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE] Just so we're clear,
I'm drawing the line at bathing.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:32.040 position:50% align:center
The only thing I want
you to do for me,

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.541 position:50% align:center
is refrain from killing.

The perverted yet kindhearted
Rihito we knew and loved

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
is a distant memory now.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure it's because
we weren't wearing

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.230 position:50% align:center
the right kind of underwear.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
So, does anybody
know what he likes?

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
White stripes? Black lace?
Something flashier?

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center

I don't think that's it.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE]
Well, I'm not giving up on him.

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
The Rihito we knew
can't be gone.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center
You'll see.

we find the perfect lingerie.

[FIRENDA] It's all
rather touching, isn't it?

back the commander of their

As sweet as that may be,

if you were to adopt those
philosophies once again,

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center

From that day on...

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center

both on and off the battlefield.

that ahead of schedule

By that point,

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
Licht had lost every
semblance of his humanity.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.115 position:50% align:center
Even so, the members of
Class A respected their

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center

stayed as far away

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.578 position:50% align:center
from the battlefield
as they could.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
I think, inside, they all knew.

[NANA] Licht's desire
to prevent his friends

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
from becoming killers was all
that he was clinging onto.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
If he lost that,
he would've also lost

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
the only thing tying him
to his former self.

Da-da-da-da! Hard to believe,

Now that it's done, I won't
have to use my powers

to help them strategize!

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center
My job as a soldier ended right
along with the war, so you know,

I can focus on becoming
Big Bro's wifey!

lightning bolts pass between us

the very first

Turns out "love at first sight"

That's why I decided
to make this video.

Oh, well! It won't
be too long now!

what actually happened

all seven Original Ballots,

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.921 position:50% align:center
and passed a resolution

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center
[NANA] They chose to forsake
this crumbling world.

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
And in its place,
they created a utopia,

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.441 position:50% align:center
guaranteed to be
safe and prosperous.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
With Althing's
extraordinary power,

00:12:56.151 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
a continent was created 3,000
meters above the ground.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
This floating island was
given the name "Alcia."

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
Then, using a second
unanimous vote,

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
they plundered the
resources from below.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center

be no way to operate

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
any kind of aircraft.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center

their newfound paradise.

Embryos of people from
various nations and races

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
were used to populate Alcia.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
This allowed them to grow up
without any knowledge

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
of the civilization
they truly came from.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
It also left them with no
recollection of Althing.

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50% align:center
And though nobody
knew of its nature,

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
it was still used to govern
with absolute power.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
To make sure the past
didn't repeat itself,

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
a Count was forced
on every Alcian.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
Sending people to the Abyss
kept population growth in check

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center
and forbidding the study
of flight kept Alcia's

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
true nature a secret.

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
A military was formed and
armed with replica Ballots

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
in order to immediately quash
any dissent among the citizens.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
Schmerman got his wish,
and a select number of people

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
got to live free from war in
a utopia among the clouds.

I'm sure you've pieced
it together by now.

The "Abyss" is the world
that Alcia abandoned.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
It didn't have much to offer,
especially not after the war.

But that didn't stop Althing
from stripping away every last

resource those poor survivors
were clinging to for dear life.

itself if it takes

from the people
suffering beneath it.

I'm going to flat-out

turn me down

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
himself and destroy this corrupt
piece of paradise in the sky.

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
That's why I chose
to rely on you.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
He needs help, and he'll end up
dead if he doesn't get any.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.698 position:50% align:center
That's why I thought
I'd change the past.

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
I'd stop him from
regretting anything.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
But I can't do it alone!

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
Just looking at me reminds
Licht of that awful war.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.085 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's hopeless. Maybe there
isn't way to save him after all.

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
But, I can't stop myself
from believing! I can't.

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
Because, for the first
time in 300 years,

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:38.762 position:50% align:center
one of you was able
to take off his mask.

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
You accepted him and
embraced his sorrow!

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
So, please. Please save him.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
I wish I could, but I'm
powerless to help my Big Bro.

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:57.906 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:19:57.989 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
You made it back.

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
Um... so... Nana.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
I know. You tried, but you
couldn't change it.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
I just wanted you
to know the truth.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope you
guys are hungry!

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
I made quite the spread
to celebrate your return!

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Please, tell me.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.762 position:50% align:center
Where's Licht right now?

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
Hey, there.

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
Look at me, Licht.

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:59.259 position:50% align:center
Let's pick up where we left
off all those years ago.

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:02.095 position:50% align:center
Right here. You and me.

00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:39.484 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Hey, guys! Licht here!
Finally back on preview duty

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.569 position:50% align:center
just in time for the
nip-slip episode!

00:22:41.653 --> 00:22:42.821 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Yep, here goes!

00:22:42.904 --> 00:22:44.531 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Whoa! A little
warning would be nice.

00:22:44.614 --> 00:22:45.990 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
That defeats the purpose!

00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:47.784 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Three hundred years
can really change a girl.

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.869 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Next time: "Cheating."
