I'm so freakin' hungry.   

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.292 position:50% align:center

Uh.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.258 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Licht!

[LICHT gasps]

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.565 position:50% align:center
Finally found you!

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.569 position:50% align:center
I've looked everywhere for you.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.613 position:50% align:center
It was pretty rude of you
to disappear like that.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.324 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Caw? I, I can't
understand you! Caw!

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.702 position:50% align:center
I'm just a lonely field crow!

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
Caw! Ca-Caw! Caw!

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.127 position:50% align:center
Licht, I know it's you.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.004 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Ack! No it's not me.

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
I mean, "Caw I'm a crow!"
It's not me!

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.758 position:50% align:center
Enough!

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:01.514 position:50% align:center
I can recognize you no matter
what mask you wear, 'kay?

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50% align:center
[gasps, sighs] Yeah. So how
did you know where I was?

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
Just a hunch.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.022 position:50% align:center
What?

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
You may not believe me,
but it's very real.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
Is it on your back? The hunch?

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.279 position:50% align:center
Huh? No, like an instinct!

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.865 position:50% align:center
That's what a hunch is,
and I'm usually right.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center
I mean, obviously, since it lead
me here to your exact location.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:26.373 position:50% align:center
[LICHT laughs]

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.125 position:50% align:center
What? What's so
funny about that?

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Hey!

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:37.050 position:50% align:center
[NANA chuckles]

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry for all
the trouble I caused.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
Nah, don't worry about it.
I'm completely fine.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
But...

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
He's fine. Listen to him.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
He's practically made a hobby
out of being chased by the army.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
Can't get enough of it!

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't go that far.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
I heard you had a great
time without us around.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
You started a commotion all
by yourself in Homhough.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
Bet it was exciting to
face off against Iron Jail

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
over some girl
you don't know.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
Or maybe you did?

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
Regardless, the good lieutenant
set up roadblocks all over.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
Wow, I can't believe
he would do that!

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Uh...

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
It gave us a lot of
trouble on the way.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
But I guess since you don't
ever take major roads,

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
it doesn't matter to you, right?

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.854 position:50% align:center
Yeah, those crowded
roads can be very risky.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.480 position:50% align:center
If the army ever
caught up with you,

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
think of all the innocent people
who might've been harmed

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
in that scuffle. Eh?

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
Yep. I hear what you're saying
loud and clear. Thank you.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
Now can I please have
something to eat?

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
You are no longer employed
by this establishment.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
If you wanna to eat,
you'll have to pay me first!

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
But I'm broke.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
Then you should do
something about that!

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
Hina was just saying she
could use some help

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
gathering firewood.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
You lied to me.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
You said you'd be right back
and we'd eat together.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Yeah, well.
I was going to, but then...

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center
Um... I, uh, didn't.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
How could you leave me behind?

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Here.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
I came up with a way for
you to keep your promise.

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
Okay, you have to go easy on me.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
It's hard to learn how to
cook living on the road.

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:59.025 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Um, I'm sorry about
the other day. I swear.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:00.568 position:50% align:center
It was nothing you did.

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
You know, with the food
and the scenery,

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
this kind of feels like a date.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
A what?

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
It's okay, I understand, Licht.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.995 position:50% align:center
I don't blame you for wanting
to date as many women

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
as possible after
we parted ways.

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50% align:center
Slow down, Hina.
Where is this coming from?

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
What'd you hear about Homhough?

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh that.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
Nothing, and I don't even care.
I'm just happy to see you again!

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
Well, why don't you try some
and tell me what you think?

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Sure...! I'm starving!

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
Whoa! What is that?

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.321 position:50% align:center
No clue.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
[PELMO pants]
Come on! Just fly!

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
Oh no! She's gonna crash!

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
Take off, dammit! Frikkin' fly!

[panting continues]

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
I did it! I'm flying!

Good job. Go get him, Hina.

[chuckles]

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
Licht are you okay?

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
Heh! Hey there!
You know how to fly?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
I'll find out. Just hold still!

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] What? Wait, wait, wait!
What are you--?

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
[PELMO ] Don't move!
This won't take long.

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Okay, wait!
That's a no-no zone!

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:24.921 position:50% align:center
You gotta stop!

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
[HINA whimpers]

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.094 position:50% align:center
[PELMO] You're ridiculous!
I said hold still!

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Oh, I'm ridiculous?
Look at you!

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
I can't fly, okay?
I just uh... I just uh...

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
I just jump a little higher
than most people!

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50% align:center
But now.. I really
wish I could take off!

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
[LICHT gasps]

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.193 position:50% align:center
I see. So you're just
a flying imposter?

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
And that's a mask.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.115 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sorry.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center
[PELMO]
Lame. Get up.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
Wait! Hold on!

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.414 position:50% align:center
Hey there! I'm Pelmo!

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:03.460 position:50% align:center
This may sound crazy, but I have
a strong hunch about you two.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
I think you're here to
make my dreams come true.

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
[PELMO] The one you saw
was the ninth prototype.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
But I'm placing all my bets
on this baby right here!

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
Haven't you ever wanted
to soar through the sky

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
to wherever the wind
could take you?

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
You mean... like a bird?

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.068 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted to have
the freedom of a bird.

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
And I think I might be close to
making that dream a reality.

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
Just gotta finish building it.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
But take in this moment because
you are in the presence

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
of what will be called
"The Flying Machine".

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.332 position:50% align:center
A machine... that can fly?

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.793 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah. This is
gonna change lives.

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
Once it's completed, the
possibilities will be endless.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
We will literally be able to
fly over mountains and canyons!

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
You'll be able to get
anywhere you want to go

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
in a fraction of the time!

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
And the best part?

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center
We'll finally be able
to experience life

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50% align:center
through the eyes of the birds.

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
This invention is
not only my dream,

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
but a fantasy realized
for all of humanity!

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Except you're not supposed to.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Oh wow! That's so exciting!

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
It could be! I'm just having
trouble with the lift-off.

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
Last thing I did was
change the gear ratios.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
That helped create more power,

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.367 position:50% align:center
but it still never
left the ground.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
I'm doing wrong.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.836 position:50% align:center
Do you have any ideas, mister?

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
I think you should be careful.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
It's strictly forbidden to
attempt flying here in Alcia.

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
[PELMO gasps]

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
It's punishable by death.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center

not hurting anyone.

As weird as it sounds,
he's right.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
Out here, anyone caught
just researching flight

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
could be put to death,
so I'm trying to lay low.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
I've tried to make sense
of it, but I can't.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Wait! You knew
all this? Then why...?

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
Because there are some dreams

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
that are worth
risking your life for.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
I've wanted this
since I was young,

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
and everyone tried to stop me.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.877 position:50% align:center
I've heard all the
dire warnings.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
But still, I refuse to give up.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
Dreams allow us to
define our own future!

If we're not allowed to
live the life we want,

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
we might as well be dead!

[LICHT]
No... Maybe.

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
You're right!
It makes sense now.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.838 position:50% align:center
It's all in the shape.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
Hey, tell me who you are.

Or don't.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:03.056 position:50% align:center

that I was right about you!

so much on her own!

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
Was that wrong? Helping her?

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.627 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Of course not!

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
I still don't get
why it's bad to fly.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
But I think it's great that you
took the time to help her

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:40.010 position:50% align:center
pursue her dream even
though you disagree.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.846 position:50% align:center
I bet that's something
she's not used to.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
Yes I do!

Dreams, huh? Now I'm
thinking about my own.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
You see, ever since
I lost my mother,

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
the only dream I've had was
to find the Legendary Ace.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
I guess I can say
my dream came true.

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
I hope you're not
starting that again!

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.802 position:50% align:center
I already told you I'm not
the one you're looking for,

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
and that hasn't changed.

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
Maybe. But who knows?

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
[HINA] You've never told
me what your dream is.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.606 position:50% align:center
I guess I don't know.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:35.899 position:50% align:center

Does there? Let's see...

I haven't had time to work

No, I understand.

If the test flight
had been successful,

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
there would have been witnesses,

out for the best!

Put her down!

and how many times
I realized them.

I'm okay, really.
I actually feel complete.

That's what she needed to fly.

I can go happily. Thank you!

are taking me somewhere
