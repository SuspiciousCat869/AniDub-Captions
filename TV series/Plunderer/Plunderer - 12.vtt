it's nothing at all!

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
That's what soldiers do, kid.

00:10:58.533 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.036 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant!

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
This should go without saying.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
But those who assault their
superior officers, also die.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center

Drop your weapons!

What?

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Do it or this man's
blood will be on your hands!

thinks your joke is funny.

Who said I'm joking?

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
Do you honestly think
you can threaten anyone?

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
Let alone take a hostage,
with a mere stick.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Hm?

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
It's dull, so it would
definitely hurt more,

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
but I still don't know how
efficient it would be.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
Oh. I get it.

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.574 position:50% align:center
You're not taking me
seriously because you

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
have no idea what
I'm capable of!

00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
No!

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
You didn't laugh.
You didn't even chuckle!

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] So what you
should've done... was this.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.559 position:50% align:center
There you go.

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
If you twist with some
power behind it,

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
you could easily snap my neck.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] You must also
consider how you're twisting,

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
for a simple jerk won't do.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
Imagine pulling the tip
of my jaw toward my ear

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
in one swift motion.
I'd be dead before I knew it.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
The rest of you would do
well to remember that, too.

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
Even in circumstances where
you're unarmed and outmatched,

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
you can still kill someone if
you know the proper techniques.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
Why not show them how it's done?

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What?

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] I'm the
commander-in-chief, after all.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
You could put an end to this
little war if you killed me.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
I promise none of
my subordinates

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
will retaliate if you do.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
But if you can't
go through with it,

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center
that young lady will
suffer the consequences.

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] The only way
to save her is to kill me.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
You don't want her
to die, do you?

00:12:55.525 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
So what'll be?
Her life or mine?

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center

Choose.

I won't.

Are you sure?

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can
live with that girl's death

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
weighing on your conscience?

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] If you want
blood spilled so badly,

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
then you can have mine instead.

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center

Because I won't kill.

That's him. Hands down.

It's a tough lesson,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.841 position:50% align:center
but better to learn it this
way than the alternative.

you're gone, too.

I should thank you for earlier.

was staged to teach
a lesson, huh?

Right. Looking back the captain
didn't have a lethal vibe.

But... The same cannot
be said for that man.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center

intention of killing.

Ah. The optimistic dreamer.

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure. That bleeding
heart doesn't suit a soldier.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
The one who stood out
to me in terms

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
of usefulness was
the samurai boy.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
No denying he's immature.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
But even so, that boy perked up
and sprang into action

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:40.667 position:50% align:center
the moment you
pulled out your gun.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
While the samurai boy
only began moving

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.755 position:50% align:center
after you fired the first shot.

[ALAN]
Yeah.

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
And if being the first one to
take initiative wasn't enough,

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
he went straight for me.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
He knew taking the head
meant taking control.

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
I guess he did.

the one to lead the squad?

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:05.066 position:50% align:center
I haven't decided just yet.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
He may not have
the aptitude for it.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
Despite voluntarily joining
a school for soldiers,

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
he says he won't kill.
The contradiction is obvious.

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
So what's he playing at, then?

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
He's certainly piqued
my curiosity.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
He, he, he!
For some strange reason,

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:31.760 position:50% align:center
I find his naïveté to be as
adorable as it is foolish.

00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center

It somehow ties into the story

of how Licht became
a Legendary Ace?

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center

Otherwise, why send us here?

change something, right?

supposed to change.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
Maybe we should find out.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
First Lieutenant.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
[PELE] This thing's
called a "computer",

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
It's a tool people
here utilize to gather

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
all kinds of information.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
So I did a
little research, and...

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
What is that?

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:40.245 position:50% align:center
Looks like something
fell down from the sky.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
You see that title there?

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Althing?

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
What does this mean?

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
[PELE] I don't know.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to find out more,
but the damn thing won't let me.

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
It's a secret
they want to keep.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
Probably because
it's top-level info.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
What exactly is Althing?

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
A god.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
During the previous war, humans
were on the brink of extinction.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
Then one fateful day,
this thing came crashing down

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
out of nowhere and
nobody knew why.

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
[ALAN] It was built using
extremely advanced technology.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.582 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
It was built?

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
That's correct.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
Built to take votes and then
use its mysterious power

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
to force the majority
decision on everyone.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
Humanity never mastered
the art of compromise,

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
but now they wouldn't have to.

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
There was a new judge
in town, so to speak.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
An assembly of sorts,
unlike any other.

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
I see.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
[ALAN] And this
decision-making entity

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
was given the name Althing.

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.856 position:50% align:center
That's Althing?

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
People rejoiced, called it
an epiphany from heaven.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.071 position:50% align:center
They immediately tried it out
once they knew how it worked.

00:19:56.154 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
They voted to ban warfare.
To dispose of nuclear weapons.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:03.495 position:50% align:center
Supposedly, every threat
would be eliminated.

00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:04.788 position:50% align:center
You mean they weren't?

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
But that means it's
peaceful now, doesn't it?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
What a great world to live in!

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Until it wasn't.

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
I don't understand.

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:18.385 position:50% align:center
[ALAN] We're announcing
classroom arrangements soon.

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.095 position:50% align:center
Don't be late.

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Think it's true?

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:25.266 position:50% align:center
About Althing not
being created in Alicia?

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Well, the captain would've had

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
nothing to gain by lying.
And everything he said adds up.

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.524 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
The Count and the Abyss.

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
[PELE] Alcia is chockfull
of strange rules.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
And Althing could have
willed them into existence.

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
So, those black hands.

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
That's what I'm thinking.

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
What if they're the
mysterious enforcing power

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
that the captain mentioned?

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
It does seem to line up.

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
[HINA] So this is
where it all began.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Apparently.

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
Licht isn't the only one
we'll be learning about.

00:20:56.006 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
Alcia has just as many secrets.
But not for much longer.

00:22:36.231 --> 00:22:39.901 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Ah, the girls' bath.
Butts 'n' boobs on full display!

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:42.737 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE] Come on, Rihito!
Control yourself!

00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:45.240 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Let go, Tokikaze!
It's my destiny!

00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:47.784 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE] Fine, but I'm
destined to come with you!

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.828 position:50% align:center
Next episode, "Full Stomach."
