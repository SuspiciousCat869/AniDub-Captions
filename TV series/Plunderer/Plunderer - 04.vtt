[NANA grunts]

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.248 position:50% align:center
Hey Hina! Are you okay?

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.669 position:50% align:center
I think so. Where'd those
metal spears come from?

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center
They came flying out
of the ground.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:34.219 position:50% align:center
Like a nightmare. Or a magic
spell from a fairy tale.

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:37.555 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess now you know why
it's illegal to own a Ballot.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.433 position:50% align:center
And why the punishment
would be so severe.

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.102 position:50% align:center
This is the damage it can do.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.437 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:53.321 position:50% align:center
[NANA] You see now?
That is the power of a Ballot.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.355 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Anything helps, thank you!

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Thanks for checking it out!

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.608 position:50% align:center
We appreciate you!

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
Tell a friend!

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
Know what we need? You!

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
Help...

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I can't believe how
close we were yesterday.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
Yesterday?

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
Oh right, you mean when we
let Mr. Pudding get away?

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
Well yeah. I mean,
that wanted poster

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
came to us directly
from headquarters.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
If we had caught him,

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
that would've been
an instant promotion.

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's true.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
Which would mean you'd be
Second Lieutenant today.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
A real live, full-grown officer.

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:21.845 position:50% align:center
That's right, I would!
And you know what that means?

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
All new work attire!

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
Officers are allowed to wear
any uniform they want!

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
Finally, I could
design an outfit

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
that wasn't a perv magnet.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
So then, more like a
waitress uniform?

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
Ooh, those are cute! Maybe!

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
Can I help you?

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yeah you can.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps]
No! I'm so sorry, sir!

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I'm not.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
No way! Why would I dress
like a waitress?

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.418 position:50% align:center
That comes with
everything I don't want!

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
I didn't think you'd
take me seriously.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] I'm a member of
the military! Strong! Heroic!

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
Impeccable hygiene!

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
Well then how about
a task master?

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah! That sounds cool!

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
You're all filthy pigs!

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yes we are!

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
You all disgust me!

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Thank you, ma'am!

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
[LICHT groans]

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
Show me some gratitude, pig!

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yes, ma'am!

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
That's not funny!

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
Can you please suggest
something that

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.362 position:50% align:center
doesn't involve a miniskirt?

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.572 position:50% align:center
I'm not telling you
how to picture it.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
Argh. I was thinking
something like this...

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] I'm Lynn,
the Second Lieutenant, 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
and quite impressive.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
[sighs] But he got away,
so it doesn't matter.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
And, some dreams
aren't meant to be.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
Your destiny's a miniskirt.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
[LYNN growls]

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
If anyone deserves the
perfect uniform, it's you.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
But is that where
your heart is now?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
So you believe in me?

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center
We can have what we want
if we're willing to work hard.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
Come on. Let's pass these out.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
Thank you! You are so right!
Dream big, start small.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.611 position:50% align:center
And with hard work
and determination,

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
I will be free of the miniskirt!

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
That's it. Reach for the stars.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
Please help if you can!
And one for you...

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center

What are you doing?

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
Please help out!
It's for a wonderful cause!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
Ah... I can't turn my
back for one second.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
Is he seriously the only one
here who's willing to help me?

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center

I'd love to assist you!

find a better deal!

How did you catch up
to us so quickly?

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
[GROCER A] By the way, why are
you chasing a human pudding?

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center

Because he must be punished!

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
[GROCER A] Oh I see.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
Did she just say...?

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
It can't be...

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
Our sweet Lynn has a boyfriend?

[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Lynn has a boyfriend?

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
I would never go out
with that creep!

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
What? That's not true!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
I thought we had a
lovely date yesterday!

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
And you wouldn't stop
showing me your undies!

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps]

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
She showed them to that guy?

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
And wouldn't stop?

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
Just what kind of date
were they on?

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
[FISHMONGER A] Is there anyone
here who hasn't seen them?

[TOWNSPEOPLE mumble

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Huh?

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
[GROCER A] If she's going to
show them off so much,

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
she should invest in
more exciting selections.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPEOPLE mumble
in agreement]

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.063 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps] I'm working
on getting a new uniform

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
so none of us have to suffer!

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
So, that's why I'm
chasing after-- 

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where'd he go?
That man was a felon!

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
Did anyone see where he went?

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:13.451 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on!
This is so not fair!

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
[HINA] We have to find
a way to warn Licht!

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
I'm worried we won't
have much time left!

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
This is my fault.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
I want to get him out of
this as soon as possible!

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:26.965 position:50% align:center
I know how you feel.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
Then we should leave,
right away!

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:29.884 position:50% align:center
We can't. Not right now.

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
But he's in danger!

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
We could be too if we
have to travel in that!

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Huh?

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:37.976 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.478 position:50% align:center
We have to rebuild this bar
before we do anything.

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
After that, we'll be
free to go look for him.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I understand.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
Besides. If I don't have my bar,

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
I won't be able to
maintain my Count.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'm sorry!

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
I was so worried about Licht,
I... got distracted.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50% align:center
He's lucky to have you
in his corner.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.130 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's fix it up
and then get out of here.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
It's time to head west.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
Okay! I'm ready to help
out however I can.

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
Just tell me what you need.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
Well, then, In that case,

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.350 position:50% align:center
what I could really use is a
hard-working full-time employee.

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:19.225 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.354 position:50% align:center
No more part-time wages.

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
We'll both work hard and go
after Licht, with real money.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.443 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Yes!

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Hey! Where'd you go?
This is cheating!

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
[LICHT sighs] Still yelling?
Most would've given up by now.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
But things are different here.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.413 position:50% align:center
You'll get him someday.
Keep trying.

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no rush.
Just give it time.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
You don't get it.
I need this promotion!

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
It's the only way to
get out of this uniform!

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
I don't know why you
hate it so much.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.547 position:50% align:center

Yeah it looks good on you!

This town really is special.

I was wondering if you would
help me give her a name.

[LYNN gasps] I couldn't
do that! It isn't my place.

Hold on, just give me a minute?

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center

conversations have we had

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
about not stealing
from people?

I know, but I was really hungry.

it okay! So as punishment,

Yeah.

All right, that's fair enough.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center

Our mission is to arrest

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
And what is a Ballot Holder?

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
That's who we're
looking for now.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
One who holds illegal Counts,
aka Ballots.

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
And, uh, the felony
is owning one.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.543 position:50% align:center
Even if you don't use it!

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
So then, I would be a felon?

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
No sir!

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
Military officials have special
permission to own Ballots.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center

[LYNN]
Oh. Yes sir!

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
Ballots are all equipped
with unique features.

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
But they aren't very
well understood.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
A Ballot Holder has the ability
to activate these features.

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
Though their level of usage
depends on their Count.

objects is an example

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
of these special features.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
Very instructive, thank you.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.875 position:50% align:center
But I should add, your
ability's strength...

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
...is also dependent on
your Count. Right, Lieutenant?

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
As you well know, there's
variance between individuals.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
Your count is 900, for example.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.720 position:50% align:center
While mine is
fifty-seven hundred.

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
It might not be
the wisest choice

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
for you to try to fight me.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
You can't escape!

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Put your blades away.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.885 position:50% align:center
I already said I don't
want to fight you.

00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
Now you're not leaving
me much choice.

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
Where did he go?

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
Wow. He disappeared? Wild.

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:14.654 position:50% align:center
He must be moving
extremely fast!

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
Like, crazy fast.
Like, insanely, really fast!

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
So this is the Flashing Strike.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:24.247 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Good.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
It looks he's still waiting,
which means he can't see me.

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
In that case, this is
the perfect time...

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
...to make my escape!

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.176 position:50% align:center
Embarrassing.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
You'll have to do better than
that to slip through my grasp!

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:41.598 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts]

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Ow, my head.
How did this even happen?

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
With your Count,
it doesn't make sense.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
Oh... I get it.
Your Count's wrong.

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
You're not actually a 900.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
It's part of my conviction.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
I will fight evil, and I'll
do it with my own hands.

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
[PELE, LYNN gasp]

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] I have no interest in a
promotion that will land me

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
behind a desk. That is my Hell.

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the military
has certain rules

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
I don't agree with.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
If my Count gets too high,

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
I'm forced into a promotion.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.946 position:50% align:center
And that's why I've
resorted to this.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
It's the only way to
honor my convictions,

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
and to achieve my goals.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
Your Count's 12,500?
Ok, happy for you.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I mean. That's high.
I could be in trouble.

00:22:35.814 --> 00:22:37.524 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Lieutenant Jail
unleashes his true 

00:22:37.607 --> 00:22:38.608 position:50% align:center
destructive force.

00:22:38.692 --> 00:22:40.527 position:50% align:center
Turns out he's a
robotic war machine

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.112 position:50% align:center
developed by the Empire!

00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:44.656 position:50% align:center
He attacks with laser beams that
are launched from his glasses!

00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:46.199 position:50% align:center
[JAIL ]
I don't emit lasers.

00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:47.575 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Well, you should.
