you wound up all alone.

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:11.424 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Hina. You seem to
misunderstand something.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Huh?

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] It's true I slaughtered
countless enemies.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
And that came to
separate me from Class A.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] However...
I was never alone.

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
Not even for a day.

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
But there was a
promise that I broke.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.568 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Doan?

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
Bring it on, bug!

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Go... Go help Nana.

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
But what about you?

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I'll be fine.
I'll win and come back to you.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
No more running. I promise.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
Sorry for being late!
I'm here now.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Wait, but...!

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
He good to fight on his own?

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
He said he was.

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
And he promised he'd
come back to me!

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] I won't make the mistake
of letting you live this time!

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
Back then, I know full well
that I made a promise.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
It's just... so much
has changed.

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
And in order to
make Alcia fall,

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
I have no choice but
to break that oath.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] You've got
the brain of an insect!

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
There still isn't enough
food or resources!

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
If Alcia goes down, we all do!

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
I... will never lose again!

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:38.053 position:50% align:center
I don't have a choice anymore!
I'll defeat you!

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
'Cause Hina's counting on me!

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
[DOAN grunts]

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
Doan, surely you've had enough.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
Let's end this.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:51.608 position:50% align:center
[DOAN growls]

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts]

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
What's she doing here?

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Oh, no. Don't tell me...

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Sonohara?

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Did you take the shot again?

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA chuckles]

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Hmph. Whatever.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
So long as you don't switch
sides, you should be safe.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
Rihito. You really are alive.

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
Now then, come kill me
just like I want you to!

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
Die!

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
[gasps, grunts]

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:36.403 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA giggles] Tell me what
a good job I did, Commander!

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
Then gently strike
me down. Please!

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
Brace yourself.
You cockroach!

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
Well, well.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
First there was the Ace of
Heavy Strikes, Taketora Doan.

00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
Then along came the Ace
of Pursuit, Mizuka Sonohara.

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
Can you face them both
at once and win?

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.678 position:50% align:center
We shall see, Licht Bach.

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:37.691 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] I feel like I don't
have as much screen time

00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:38.775 position:50% align:center
as I used to!

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:40.151 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Says the character who's dying.

00:22:40.235 --> 00:22:42.070 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Dying girls need lines, too!

00:22:42.153 --> 00:22:44.030 position:50% align:center
[PELE] Then do something
crazy like confess your love

00:22:44.114 --> 00:22:45.615 position:50% align:center
once this battle's over.
That work?

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:46.908 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps]
But I already did.

00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:48.535 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Oh, then you're definitely dead.

00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:49.994 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Next time, "Unforgivable".
