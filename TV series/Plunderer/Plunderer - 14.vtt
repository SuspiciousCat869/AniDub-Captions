Get lost, you perv!

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:08.545 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Wait, are you serious?

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.047 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Mm-hm. They'll hold us
collectively responsible

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.424 position:50% align:center
and punish the entire class

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.467 position:50% align:center
if the teachers find
the culprit first.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.053 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO grunts]
Fine, just say that it was me!

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.055 position:50% align:center
Why in the world
would we do that?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
It's our only option!

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.601 position:50% align:center
How can we expect to catch this
vandal when even Captain Alan

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.478 position:50% align:center
is calling in for backup?

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.064 position:50% align:center
In order to win,
we need a scapegoat!

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.150 position:50% align:center
You'd really do that?

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
Of course. Anything for the
greater good of our class!

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.530 position:50% align:center
Just blame me.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:39.284 position:50% align:center
Because if I take the heat,
then no one else will suffer!

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.994 position:50% align:center
Rihito...

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.538 position:50% align:center
No! You can't! I won't let you!

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
We don't have a choice! I must!

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
It's for the best.
There's no need to investigate.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
I'll take the fall
when the time comes.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:54.257 position:50% align:center
You are... so selfless!

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.300 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE sobs]

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.553 position:50% align:center
I know. It's a gift and a curse.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
So then, you won't look into
this any further, right?

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.058 position:50% align:center
I swear!

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Tokikaze was
easy enough to shake, 

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:09.022 position:50% align:center
and I kept Captain Alan busy
with Operation Love Letter, 

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:12.275 position:50% align:center
which just leaves...
Second Lieutenant Firenda.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.780 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA giggles]
Oh, when will they come?

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.074 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
She's a one-woman battalion!

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
Should I give up?

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:23.078 position:50% align:center
No! Not when there are
naked girls on the line!

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.376 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] It'll have to
be a frontal assault!

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
I'll enter calmly.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
Blend in as if I'm
meant to be there.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
All natural like.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
Definitely play it cool
while I'm undressing, too.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's it!

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
Just stay calm, cool,
and collected.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO sighs]
It's bath time, baby!

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Yes! This'll work!

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
It's gonna... be... heavenly!

00:03:58.655 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Eh?

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
Got him, come quick!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.033 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO, GILS shouting]

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
Swapping the signs for the men
and women's baths really worked?

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
Wow. That's one of the
oldest tricks in the book.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
Never could've done
it without you!

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
He's caught, so go ahead
and switch them back.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
Roger that. Huh?

What's happening?

Are you gonna be
all right, Mister Jail?

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
[PELE] The poor guy has
no idea how to handle

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
this kind of thing.

Well, whaddaya know?

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
Looks like I caught
myself a perpetrator!

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
No, we did.

[ALAN laughs]

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure he's
in my hands,

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
not yours, and you
know what that means.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center
Collective responsibility!

[ICHINOSE]
Where'd he take us?

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
Kinda feels like we're the first
ones to ever set foot here,

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
doesn't it?

--[STUDENTS gasp, chatter]

Yeah. I travel a lot!

[ICHINOSE]
That's handy.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
So...

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
They really just up and dumped
us in uncharted territory?

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
[grunts] This is too
terrible for words!

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE] I've got a few
terrible words 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
exclusively for you...!

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.294 position:50% align:center
Guessing this is a
survival exercise.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
Though I'm all for blaming him,
at least partially.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
I see.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
Well, if that's the case, we
should start gathering food.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
Water and firewood, too.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
Sure, we could be in charge
of the water, right?

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
Look, there's a
river over here!

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.687 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE] That's awesome!
I could go for a drink!

[GIRLS shout]

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey, what did
you do that for?

Oh, no! You'll catch a cold
if you stay in there!

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center
Hurry and get out
before that happens!

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
We're not stupid! You don't
care about our health,

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
you just wanna see our
bras through our clothes!

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
Fine, I won't look!
I'll hide behind this.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
So come out whenever
you're ready.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
The clock... is... ticking!

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center

Have it your way.

[RIHITO gasps]

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE] If you wanna
look so bad, go ahead.

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
We'll just have
to get over it.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
Because stuff like this
shouldn't matter

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
to fellow soldiers.

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
We won't have the luxury
of being embarrassed

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
when we're in battle.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
And compared to what
you've seen in the baths,

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
this is nothing.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:36.873 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center
I know you seem to think we
have more than enough time

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
to figure out if we
wanna be soldiers or not,

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
but our choice was made the
second we joined this school!

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center
Being a soldier isn't optional!

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.051 position:50% align:center
And seeing as how
we're gonna experience

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:51.513 position:50% align:center
a lot worse than this,
knock yourself out.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
Mm? What, this not
doing it for you?

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
Here, I'll give you something
more exciting to look at.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
I'm sorry.

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE gasps]
Rihito?

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.903 position:50% align:center
Talk about mood swings.

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:10.323 position:50% align:center
Guys? One thing.

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
Do you really wanna be soldiers?

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE, AKUI gasp]

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] You understand that
means you'll be tasked

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
with killing people.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
You have to kill people.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
Is that something you think
you're honestly at peace with?

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
But what else can we do?

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
None of us want to stain our
hands, but there's no other way!

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Yes, there is.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.092 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE]
There's not!

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.719 position:50% align:center
Not with the world being
the way it is now.

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
I should know.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
I have four younger
brothers depending on me.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
Either I join the military, or I
stand back and watch them die!

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
There are no other alternatives!

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
I don't want to kill anybody,

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center
but... that also
includes my brothers,

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:48.695 position:50% align:center
so sacrifices have to be made.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
What do you expect us to do
in this situation? Huh? What?

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
That is quite the conundrum.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
So why don't you all become an
"army that doesn't kill?"

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] You'll still
be soldiers who protect

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.252 position:50% align:center
and provide for
their loved ones.

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
However, when it comes
to the field of battle,

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
you won't cut down your foes.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
That's right, choose to
let them live.

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
A true "army that doesn't kill."

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center
That's a thing?

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
Why do you look
so surprised, Rihito?

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
It was your idea.

By the way,

how was your attempt to

[DAVID] Never made any sense
why Althing banned nukes

would be enough.

It should've gone straight
for the root of the problem

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center

Unknown.

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.807 position:50% align:center

Is it something else?

[NANA]
Eh.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
What was the point of sending
us in the first place?

Beats me!

Come on!

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
Sorry, my future self didn't
tell me about any of that stuff.

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:07.360 position:50% align:center
If I know too much, then I could
end up changing the future 

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
too much, and that's
just asking for trouble.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Okay, then let's
try a new question.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:18.997 position:50% align:center
Is Licht's surgery a success?

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
Yes. They find out people who
share some DNA with Big Bro

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
and me make good
candidates for the operation.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.506 position:50% align:center
Then they successfully
create seven Aces total.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
Licht and his classmates here.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
They want to be an army
that doesn't kill.

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
I thought it was an
unrealistic notion.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
But with the overwhelming
power of seven Aces,

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
it might happen.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
And yet... he somehow becomes
a ruthless killer anyway!

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:46.149 position:50% align:center
What exactly transpired that
caused their army to fail?

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
Would we be able to
change Licht's destiny

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
if we could make
the army succeed?

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
I just don't know.

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:53.990 position:50% align:center
You should know!

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Your future self
told us to change something.

00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
That must mean there's a way.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
It's possible, but...

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:08.046 position:50% align:center
Future me didn't tell
me-me what she wanted.

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Why not?

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
I have a guess. Kinda.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
Even if I do know the future,

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
changing it is a
whole different thing.

[JAIL gasps]

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
It's a big step into
complete darkness.

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
You know?

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
It's scary.

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
So even if you know
what's coming,

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
sometimes all you
can do is watch.

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
Okay! Talking done!

Oh. Guess not.

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
Go now. Or you won't make it.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
Here. Take this.

It's from my future self.
I'm not sure what's on it.

But it's supposed to contain the
reason why I sent you back
