[ABYSS groans]

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]
Mom!

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:23.857 position:50% align:center
[HINA'S MOTHER]
Hina.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
You need to leave.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
And search for someone.
The Legendary Ace.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
Mom, don't go!

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
You need to find them, Hina.
Go find the Legendary Ace!

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
[HINA whimpers]

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
Your mother's full name
is... Tsukina Farrow.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.696 position:50% align:center
[HINA] But, how do you
know my mother's name?

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.991 position:50% align:center
Because she was a
childhood friend of ours.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
When I first saw you,
you looked so much like her.

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.789 position:50% align:center
I had to talk to you.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.959 position:50% align:center
And then I saw your name
and thought, "maybe."

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
But, no, surely it had
to be coincidence.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
Because, like me, she was born
more than 300 years ago.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
So she couldn't possibly
be your mother.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.892 position:50% align:center
But when I learned you had this,
I knew It had to be the truth.

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
That somehow,
the impossible was possible. 

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
That... is an Original Ballot.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
Whoever possesses it can
cast a vote to Althing.

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
Gather all seven,

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
and you can control anything,
even the laws of nature.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
The most important
secret of Alcia.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:26.122 position:50% align:center
How did it end up
in your hands?

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50% align:center
How did it make its
way from Schmerman 

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
and the Special
Service Unit to you?

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:37.133 position:50% align:center
The only person who could pull
that off, would be Tsukina.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.974 position:50% align:center
--[beeping]
--[NICOLA] General, sir?

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
Enter.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
I came to report that we have
successfully located the girl.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.608 position:50% align:center
Her sudden disappearance from
the cabin in the mountains

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:55.193 position:50% align:center
caught us off guard,

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
but we'll be sure to keep a
closer eye on her this time.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
Not to question your intentions,
sir, but I am curious why you

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.244 position:50% align:center
haven't ordered us to
retrieve the Ballot.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
It is, after all, the very one
that was stolen from the SSU

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
five years ago.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
It's a symbol of
our worst mistake

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
and a blemish on our honor.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
Should we not seek to correct
it as soon as possible?

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
You disapprove?

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
[NICOLA] No, of course not.
I'm merely asking.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
Everything is going
according to plan.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
There's nothing for you
to be concerned about.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
More than anything else, Licht
Bach needs someone to protect.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
When he wields his blade for
a person he cares about,

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
that's when he's most fearsome.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
Oh yes, I have no doubt that
very soon he shall return to me.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
And when he does, he'll appear
in his rightful form,

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
as the Ace of Flashing Strikes.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Tsukina told you to
find the Legendary Ace, right?

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.289 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Yes. And I did.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.624 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I'm sorry. But I promise,

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
if she sent you after an Ace,
she didn't mean me.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Why is that?

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Hina, what did
your mother tell you about 

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
your father when you
were growing up?

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Just that he
died a long time ago.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Yes, and I'm
the one who killed him.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center
No...!

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
You met him, in the past.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
In the past?

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
Like I said, Tsukina was
a childhood friend of ours.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Can't be...

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
That's right, the father
you never knew...

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
...was Tokikaze Sakai.

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
Why you?

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Tsukina was Tokikaze's fiancÃ©e.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
Rihito...

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] And the Ballot
he carried as an Ace

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
during the long years of the
Waste War, was named Hina.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I killed your father.
His blood is on my hands.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
Do you see now?

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.987 position:50% align:center
I should be your enemy,
not your hero.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
You should hate me.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
How can I?

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] I wonder how things are
going for our sweet little Hina.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
[LYNN chuckles]
Oh, please, who am I kidding?

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
She'll be fine.
It's Hina, after all.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
Who wouldn't want her?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
And you know what?
I am totally fine with that!

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
You're ridiculous.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me?

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
The non-stop, drunken rambling.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
Come on, you don't even mean
half the stuff you're saying.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Do to.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50% align:center
So you're okay with it?

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
You saw what happened
back at the school, Pele.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:47.532 position:50% align:center
I gave up, but Hina didn't.
She kept fighting.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
[exhales] Are you gonna make
me repeat what I said?

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Said when?

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.539 position:50% align:center
What? You seriously
don't remember?

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
Sorry, no.

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
Well, it was nothing, really.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
I just said there might be
someone out there who likes you

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
the way you are.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
Now cheer up.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
Being relentlessly happy
is kind of your thing, right?

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50% align:center
I, uh. I think I had
a little too much.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
Great. So much for my pep talk.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
[gasps, grunts]

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Whoa! This is a super
pricey vintage thing!

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:25.528 position:50% align:center
Where in the world
did it come from?

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Did he...?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
It's amazing just how much
you resemble Tsukina.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
What you said, that I was one
sprint away from abandoning you.

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
Your hunches? They're uncanny.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.547 position:50% align:center
What did you--

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
You were right, Hina.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
I'm leaving now, to take the
fight to the army on my own.

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I just keep breaking
my promises, don't I?

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I'm sorry... Truly.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Goodbye. Thank you
for everything, Nana.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Are you planning to
take the Original Ballots?

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm still awake.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
I'm shielded by my convictions.
Drugs have no effect.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] You're ridiculous,
you know that?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
As if you have room to talk.

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
Stay for a while longer.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
So we can say a
"proper farewell".

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
[MILITARY OFFICER A]
It's the SSU!

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
I must report to this
Supreme Comman--

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:37.118 position:50% align:center
[MILITARY OFFICER B]
Hm...

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
What?

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
[ERIN] The Director of the
Bureau of Intelligence 

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
and the Deputy
Superintendent-General.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
Both were conducting
investigations into the SSU.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
We've lost some
important allies.

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:58.139 position:50% align:center
Assassination right here
in the royal capital?

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
They can't really think
I'll overlook this.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:04.270 position:50% align:center
The killer's unknown,
according to the SSU.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] They're hardly going to
admit to doing it themselves.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
[ERIN] Would you like me
to look into it, sir?

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
Do that and we'll only be
adding to the body count.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
[ERIN]
But sir.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
Accidents, mysterious illnesses.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
This is far from the first time
people looking into the SSU

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
have died unexpected deaths.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
And once they're neatly out of
the way, their positions are

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
always filled by lackeys loyal
to the Special Service Unit,

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
who do nothing without
the SSU's approval.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.718 position:50% align:center
We're being taken over.
Quietly and secretly,

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.470 position:50% align:center
like a deadly disease
eating away at the body.

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
These recent deaths
are different, though.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
If they're resorting to a method
as direct as assassination,

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
that means the game is changing,

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
and the danger's
never been more real.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
I'll increase your
security at once, sir.

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
Don't worry about me.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
The main threat...
is to the royal capital.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
Schmerman, what are
you playing at?

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
The SSU is demanding we hand
over the Original Ballots?

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
All three of the ones

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
that are under the Supreme
Commander's protection?

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
It's a ludicrous request.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
Heh.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
They think very highly of
themselves these days.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
So, how will we respond?

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
We should obey and surrender
the Ballots as they asked.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
Are you out of
your mind, Lightning?

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
[LIGHTNING] We all know
that 300 years ago,

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
under the General's direction,

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
a unanimous vote to Althing
was used to create Alcia.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
But let's not forget the
limit placed on such votes

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
in light of their
overwhelming power.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
[SHALLOW] Yes. They must be
re-approved periodically.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
[LIGHTNING] Precisely, but since
the SSU lost a Ballot

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
five years ago,
we've been unable to secure

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
approval for the
continuation of Alcia.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] Which means...
that the very existence

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
of this floating
continent is on the line.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
[LIGHTNING] There are already
several cases of large-scale

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
land loss near Linden
and its surrounding areas.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
We cannot afford to lose
any more Original Ballots.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
So, then, you think
they're safer elsewhere?

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
Exactly. They should be kept
behind the Wall of Paradise,

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
where the realm's
security is tightest.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
I disagree completely.

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
What do you suggest?

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
If we gather the Ballots
together, it should be here.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.693 position:50% align:center
After all, the SSU has already
been responsible for the loss

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:17.237 position:50% align:center
of one Original Ballot, so why
should we take the chance

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
that they'll carelessly
misplace another?

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
We should be the ones demanding
that they hand theirs over,

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
not the other way around.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
Don't be foolish.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.832 position:50% align:center
Do that, and we're effectively
at war with the SSU.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
We'll defeat them handily.

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me and
the Third Division.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
There's no need for
you to get involved.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
Conflict like that
will fatigue the army!

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
Any idiot can see as much.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
Your troops are clearly
weaker than mine

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
if they tire so easily, Shallow.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
How dare you!

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
If we don't find the stolen
Original, everything's lost.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
All of Alcia will fall.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
We'll be at war with the Abyss.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
We can't waste our
strength on infighting!

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
Please, You're just
afraid of the SSU.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
Think carefully before you
insult me again, Vanvigh!

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
You cowards insult
the entire nation

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
with your talk of surrender!

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
Shut up! I won't listen
to any more of this!

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
That's enough! You're all
leaders of this army.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
Now act like it!

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.790 position:50% align:center
 I'm sure you have a
plan in mind anyway,

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
Supreme Commander.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:14.544 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
Nothing at all?

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.674 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] I believe our best bet is
to ask for the King's judgment.

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:22.344 position:50% align:center
You really think we
can rely on the king?

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] General. Do I need to
remind you who you serve?

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
Did you or did you not swear an
oath of loyalty to the king?

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:33.897 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] I will report this
to the throne myself,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.607 position:50% align:center
and we'll proceed from there.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.941 position:50% align:center
Understood?

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] That's what
you're after, isn't it?

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
The Original Ballots.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
When you told me
about your goal

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
to take everything
from this nation,

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center
is that what you meant?

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
You're not denying it.
All right.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
As a military officer,
your duty is to protect,

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50% align:center
but you mean to plunder instead.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
That's a crime for which
you must be punished.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yeah, you would think that.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] I do not make friends.
I won't collude with you.

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
But, there are some who
value such relationships.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
Do you truly intend to
leave them all behind?

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
Like you did with Class A?

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
That wasn't what I wanted.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.421 position:50% align:center
But anyone close to me gets
dragged into the fighting.

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:42.215 position:50% align:center
The battlefield
is full of death.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.717 position:50% align:center
If they follow me now,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center
they'll wind up with
blood on their hands.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I can't allow that!

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.476 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
The army that doesn't kill, huh?

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
That was the promise I made.

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:59.607 position:50% align:center
But, in the end,
I couldn't keep it.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:03.903 position:50% align:center
So now, it's even more important
for me to be the one to fight,

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
and to feel pain
that comes with it.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
I know. I know what happened
after we left the past.

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:13.496 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I fought for everyone's
sake, so they wouldn't have to.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.789 position:50% align:center
Idiot!

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50% align:center
How do you think they felt
when they couldn't help you?

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
Do you actually think
they were relieved

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center
to be kept from the battlefield?

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.092 position:50% align:center
Do you think they were
happy that the burden fell

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
on you alone?

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.555 position:50% align:center
If you want to break down,
fine, that's your choice!

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center
But Licht, what will it take to
make you see that you hurt

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
the people you leave behind?

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:40.106 position:50% align:center
Ichinose, Akui, Sumiya,
Suda, Narimiya.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.151 position:50% align:center
The sins you commit were carved
into the hearts of every member 

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:44.277 position:50% align:center
of Class A!

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
Every single time you
killed somebody!

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] That's still better than
them having to actually do it!

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center
No matter how much I wash, the
smell of blood never comes off.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
I don't want them to
know what that's like.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
If they can be the
army that doesn't kill,

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
maybe that's enough.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
It's not much, but it's
the best I can do

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
to make up for not keeping
my promise to them.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.095 position:50% align:center
It's my responsibility
as their commander!

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
If I kill one enemy, it spares
them from killing one!

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
If I kill every enemy, nobody
else has to kill anybody!

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
Don't you see that?

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
Just shut up, you complete
and utter idiot!

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
You say that over and over,
like a mantra.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
But you're just doing it to
make yourself feel better.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
You killed and you killed
like they ordered you to.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
And where the hell
did that get you?

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] 
My friends.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50% align:center
Their hopeful smiles...
are burned into my mind.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] They were betrayed...
by me and by the teachers

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
who were supposed
to protect them.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.677 position:50% align:center
I'm doing this in
honor of Class A.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
You'll fight the whole army.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.515 position:50% align:center
You think you can
defeat us by yourself?

00:16:57.267 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] If anyone gets in my way,
then I will cut them down.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
Even you!

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Jail, I just have one request.

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
Please take care of
Hina and the others.

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Do it yourself.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:26.588 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I can't... I'm not the one.

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I'm grateful... to all of you.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:42.771 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Hina... thank you.

00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I think it
would be wonderful...

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.944 position:50% align:center
...if I could pull you closer,
instead of pushing you away.

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
I'm just so glad to see
you smiling again. Finally.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
But... just keep
one thing in mind.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
As crazy as this sounds, I'll be
waiting 300 years from now.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
But I can't.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center
If you come with me now,

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
I may end up responsible
for the death of someone else

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center
who's dear to me.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Hina... Hina...

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
Hina!

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
Once this is over.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
Once I've stopped them.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
If I could see your
smiling face again,

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
Then maybe you and I...

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] Licht Bach is headed
towards the royal capital.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
We'll intercept him immediately.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center
On your order.

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
That's not necessary.

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
There's someone else
more suited to the task.

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
[NICOLA]
Huh?

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] He's been waiting
so very long to see Licht again.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't deny him
the opportunity.

Licht!

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
Hina! You were with him, right?

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
Yes, I was.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Did he say anything to you?

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.518 position:50% align:center
Tell you where he was going?

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
The capitol.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
He said he was going to
take on the army by himself.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
No.

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.277 position:50% align:center
He can't!

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
Um, sir. What should we do?

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
W-Wait. Where is he?

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
If he's after the army,
he'll be headed for the capital.

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.256 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Why go alone?

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
Idiot! You stupid,
stubborn idiot!

Who's there?

[LICHT grunts]

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] Your power
is the Flashing Strike.

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
It grants you supersonic speed,

00:19:56.946 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
which you can apply to your
sword to butcher the enemy.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:03.495 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] Let's see what
good it does you...

00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
...against someone who
can control gravity!

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
I've got you pinned.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how fast you
are if you can't move at all.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
No more skittering around
for you, little cockroach.

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Hold on. How are you--

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] Did you forget?
My power counters yours.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center
You won't escape me!

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
Doan, no!

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:30.313 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but it's time for
you to say goodbye.

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
Wait! Please just
listen to me, Doan!

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
I gotta admit, you did
well for a weakling.

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
Hurts to say it,
but you're not half bad.

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
You've done enough now, though.
It's time to sleep.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
I can tell.

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
You're one sprint away
from abandoning me.

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
Am I just some pesky
little kid to you?

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
No Hina, you're not.

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:37.982 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] Come here, Jail-boy.
Give daddy a hug!

00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:39.609 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Do not call me "Jail-boy".

00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:41.695 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
Fine, Jaily-pie.

00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:42.570 position:50% align:center
Jaily-poo?

00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:43.488 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
No! 

00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.281 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
Jaily-Jail? Jailybean?

00:22:45.365 --> 00:22:47.117 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] You know,
Jail-boy is fine.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.703 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
Next time, "Father."
