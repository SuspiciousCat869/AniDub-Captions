But I will not lose!

Just because I choose not to
butcher a bear with my hands

does not mean I couldn't
do it if I wanted to!

I'm sure you could but maybe for
now let's focus on the cooking.

[NANA] Our cooking battle is
finally reaching its climax!

Who will be the winner?

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
In this corner we have a white
cream stew cooked by Lynn

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
and garnished with a healthy
dose of love and care.

her newlywed wife vibe,

a perfect balance of
purity and passion!

And then there's Hina.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
She's also made a stew.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
However, this one is a little
more gamey and wild with a dash 

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.128 position:50% align:center
of powerful violence!

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
It's amazing how someone so
adorable could remind us all

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center

a devastating potion!

Yeah, so? I didn't
make it for you,

What an impressive strategy!

Maybe she's trying
to throw him off

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
so he doesn't notice
any uneven flavors!

That kinda contradicts the whole
purpose of this match, though.

[LICHT grunts]

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] If I want to capture you,
I can only do so when you're

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
wielding your power
to the fullest.

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
[LICHT, JAIL grunt]

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
Wow, that was close.

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.603 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
That's quite enough for today!
Look what you've done!

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
Do you think this is appropriate
behavior for grown men?

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
Was your little brawl
everything you dreamed?

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
I suggest you start
cleaning it up,

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
because no one wants to
stand around in your mess.

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
[LICHT sighs]
Can't really say no to Nana.

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

[CUSTOMERS chattering]

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
[CROWD C laughs] Oh, boy.
That was a good contest!

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't mind gettin'
a drink with Hina.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE CUSTOMER A]
What's that honey?

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.346 position:50% align:center
[CROWD A]
Oh! Hello dear!

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
[NANA] It's over, we're all
fine, so go ahead and drink up!

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
Let's just focus on having
a good time tonight.

[gasps]

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Sergeant Major!
Where'd everybody go?

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
Ugh... No more drinks for me.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
It was her! She made me do it!

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
[NANA laughs] Alright,
you're up next Lieutenant!

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
[JAIL gasps, growls]

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:09.352 position:50% align:center
Wake up! We're going after them!

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
[LYNN, PELE grunt]

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.294 position:50% align:center
They won't get away!

00:21:34.377 --> 00:21:35.962 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Wait! Slow down!

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Please! My tummy hurts!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.633 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Stop complaining! Hurry up!

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.678 position:50% align:center
Ridiculous.

[SOLDIER A grunts]

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:01.488 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Hey, look at me! What happened?

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:05.408 position:50% align:center
L-Linden, it's..

00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:09.537 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:11.081 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:23.843 position:50% align:center
It's destroyed.

00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:25.762 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:22:35.814 --> 00:22:37.440 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Is there any way
to defeat the demon 

00:22:37.524 --> 00:22:38.983 position:50% align:center
summoned from the
depths of hell?

00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:40.652 position:50% align:center
Also, Jail tries to out drink me

00:22:40.735 --> 00:22:42.362 position:50% align:center
without any strategy
for winning.

00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:44.489 position:50% align:center
Next time, "Jail Dies!"
Cheers!

00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:46.783 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
That's enough out of you!

00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:49.953 position:50% align:center

the Abyss." Good night, Jail.
