that's every girl's
worst nightmare!

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
[whimpers] How? She's so
thin she can sit down

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
without any muffin
top spilling over!

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
It's not fair!

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
She has a small body and face,

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
yet she's still curvy in
all the right places!

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
She's a living doll!

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
One that can walk, and talk,
and get completely trashed!

00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
Hey, Fa--

00:17:58.536 --> 00:17:59.829 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
I'm not a fatty!

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.915 position:50% align:center
Fine, just stop
comparing body types.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
Hold on. There's one
more I gotta see.

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center
Whose?

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
[LYNN grunts]

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center
Eep!

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
So..no..ha..ra!

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Please put this
bathing suit bottom on!

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.556 position:50% align:center
It's for science!

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
When you wear things
with a tight waistband,

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
your stomach flab spills
over the top, right?

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
It does, right?

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] Um... Sorry...
but it doesn't.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
[whines]

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
Hey. There she is.
Welcome back, Pudge.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Stop it!

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
What, you go for a jog
to lose weight, Tubby?

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
I said stop!

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
You're going to need to
run a few marathons.

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Cut it out!
It's sexual harassment!

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
[LICHT gasps]

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
--[snapping]
--[LICHT] Huh?

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
[LICHT groans]

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
[LICHT gasping]
Clear. Clear. Clear.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:26.541 position:50% align:center
[LICHT shouts]

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
Heya. Sup, Hina?

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
Let's do it.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
Save me! She's a teen!
With raging hormones!

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
[LICHT yells]

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Are those seriously the
only too options I have here?

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
Ah! Somebody, please! Help me!

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Mm?

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
[LICHT yells]

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
Classic Licht. Running off
and leaving me behind.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
It's just like
when we first met.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
You promised to share
a meal with me,

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
but then you left
before we ever did.

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
There was that time
with Pelmo, too.

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
I searched everywhere for you,

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
and when I found you,
you tried to run.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
And ever since we
returned from the past,

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
I feel like you avoid
me even more, Licht.

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
It keeps happening
over and over again.

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.096 position:50% align:center
Even now.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
You're one sprint away
from abandoning me.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
Do you honestly
hate me that much?

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
Am I... just some pesky
little kid to you?

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:33.983 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
When we met,

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
you said your mother told
you to look far and wide

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
for a Legendary Ace, right?

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Huh?

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
This is really crucial,
so please answer me straight.

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:54.212 position:50% align:center
Your mother's full name is...

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
...Tsukina Farrow.

00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:00.510 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Is that right?

00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:38.024 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] I now have the power
to shoot lasers from my eyes!

00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:40.485 position:50% align:center
Behold. Iron Jail Beam!

00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:41.945 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Is that the best you've got?

00:22:42.028 --> 00:22:44.906 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Not even close!
Jail Conviction Beam!

00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:46.282 position:50% align:center
Heh. I was just kidding.

00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:47.534 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Next time: "Rain".

00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:49.452 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] These aren't tears,
they're raindrops!
