[HINA]
What's she doing here?

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Oh, no. Don't tell me...

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Sonohara?

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Did you take the shot again?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA giggles]

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Whatever.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center
So long as you don't switch
sides, you should be safe.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
Rihito. You really are alive.

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.031 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.784 position:50% align:center
Now then. Come kill me
just like I want you to!

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
Die!

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:41.041 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.751 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:48.757 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA giggles] Tell me what
a good job I did, Commander!

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.508 position:50% align:center
Then gently strike me down.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
Please!

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
Brace yourself, you cockroach!

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
Well, well.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:03.355 position:50% align:center
First there was the Ace of
Heavy Strikes, Taketora Doan.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
Then along came the Ace
of Pursuit, Mizuka Sonohara.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
Can you face them both
at once and win?

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:14.115 position:50% align:center
We shll see, Licht Bach.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Whoa, that was close!

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.091 position:50% align:center
[gasps, grunts]

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50% align:center
I won't let you get
away from me!

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts]

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.390 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
Don't forget, Commander.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.602 position:50% align:center
My bullets follow you
wherever you go!

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.396 position:50% align:center
Looks like you've
lost your touch!

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.566 position:50% align:center
Taking on two Aces at
once was a huge mistake,

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.860 position:50% align:center
and I'll show you why!

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.822 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
Those special bullets are what
I like to call "Gravity Shots".

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
Good luck warding them off!

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
[LICHT shouts]

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
Fight through it, Licht!

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] It'll take a lot more
than that to kill you, I know.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
You cockroaches
can be pretty tough.

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
I expected no less from you!

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center
You'd never go down like that

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
when the fun's just
getting started!

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
Fun or not, I'm ready
to end this.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Let's wrap it up.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Not good.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
No matter how
powerful he may be,

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
fighting them both
at once isn't easy.

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:53.858 position:50% align:center
I think he'll be just fine.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
You really aren't worried?

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
I simply believe in him.
That's all.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
But for now, Lynn needs us.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
[PELE grunts]
Come on, idiot.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.456 position:50% align:center
She's gonna steal your man
if you don't wake up soon.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.002 position:50% align:center
Give it up, you little bug!
You're wasting your time!

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] What good is your
"flashing strikes" speed

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
to you now, huh?

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
My gravity keeps
you from moving!

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] You haven't
congratulated me yet,

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center
so feel free to praise me
after this demonstration!

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50% align:center
Die already,
I'm sick of this game!

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts]

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
Oh, Rihito.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
Did you know how glad I was to
be picked for the Ace project?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
It was a like a dream come true!

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
They chose me!

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
There were so many wonderful
kids with potential

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:51.249 position:50% align:center
in our school, and they
chose me over all of them!

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:53.626 position:50% align:center
It must've been destiny!

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] I thought that meant
we could be together forever!

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
Because we were both Aces!

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
you had other ideas.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
I understand why you would
say that, but take me, too!

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Learn to follow orders,
you're a soldier!

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] You ignored my pleas
and left me behind!

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
I chased after you for so long,

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
and the moment I finally
caught up, you pushed me away!

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
Why? Why can't I be with you?

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50% align:center
Why is the back of your
head all I ever see?

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center
Answer me! I'm tired
of being ignored!

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
Do I need to gun down
more people?

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
Do I need to have a
higher kill count

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
before you'll let me
stand at your side?

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.961 position:50% align:center
Is that it?

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] I hope you
understand why Sonohara

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
ended up the way she did.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center
Because of you, dumbass!

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
If you grew some brain cells and
thought to stay out of her life,

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
she would've never
wound up like this!

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.808 position:50% align:center
It's all your damn fault!

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
How is it my fault?

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] There was a day
in middle school.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
I noticed she was a whole
lot perkier than usual.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
Oh, hey, Taketora!

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
Have you heard of a
boy named Rihito?

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] You came to her rescue
when the other students

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
started giving her a
hard time, remember?

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
She said you were the only
person who had her back.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
And from that day on, she
wouldn't shut up about ya.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] It was always Rihito
this or Rihito that.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
She convinced herself that
she was safe with you.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
And that thought alone
made her so damn happy!

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
Rihito is the only one who
took the time to smile at me.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
He's the only one who sees me
and acknowledges that I exist.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
I can't say that about
anyone else. Only Rihito.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center
Surely you get where
I'm coming from!

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
I'm going to stay with you
no matter what it takes!

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
'Cause if I do that,
then no one will bully me,

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
and I'll never be
alone again!

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
I'll follow you until I die,

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center
even if you lead me
straight to that demise!

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] You're stuck, aren't ya?
Well, she is, too.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
She hasn't made a single step
forward since that day.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
She feels safe as long
as she's with you.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
Being separated scares
her half to death.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
She'd be crushed if
she didn't have you!

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
It's unhealthy and
it ain't right!

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50% align:center
Her senses are
blind to everything

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
and everyone around her!
You're all she cares about!

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how
much you push me back,

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
I'll continue to
follow after you!

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
Fight me all you want,
but it won't change a thing.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
I'll kill tons of people
just like you did!

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.819 position:50% align:center
I'll prove that I can keep up so
you'll never leave me behind!

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
You thought you were
helping her back then,

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.783 position:50% align:center
but all you really did was
enable this warped dependency!

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
And she's not the only one.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
The rest of Class A
was the same!

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.206 position:50% align:center
What happened after
your naïve little dream 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
fooled them into believing they
could somehow become an

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
"army that doesn't kill"?

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50% align:center
Do you even remember?

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Of course.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
They killed themselves!

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
Every last one of your
classmates died!

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
I can't decide if it's more
hypocritical or ironic!

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:52.806 position:50% align:center
Either way, there's no
denying it's your fault!

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.933 position:50% align:center
You've got it wrong!
I only wanted--

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
You're the reason all
of them are gone now!

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Is it heavy?

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
Well that's 'cause it's equal
to the weight of every sin

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
you've ever committed!

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
Why'd you break your promise?

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
Tell me!

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center
Please. Stop this!

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Why is it that
children have to suffer, too?

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
Why is it our duty
to take them out

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
the same way we
do trained soldiers?

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Because that's war.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
So what do you say.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.590 position:50% align:center
We make sure that
we're the last ones

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
who ever have to do
awful things like this?

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yeah.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
I didn't forget!
How could I, Doan!

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
But just listen to me!

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
Shut up! I won't waste another
breath talking to you!

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
I won't let you
start a war here,

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
but go do whatever
you want in hell!

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
No more!

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
Please, stop! Don't kill him!

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Tsk. Outta the way, Nana.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
Licht isn't to blame!
And he's suffered enough.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
So please stop--

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.042 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Nana!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
[ grunts] No, I have to finish
this ligation! Or else...

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Do something! Please, Licht!

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
Hina! Everybody!

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] People are going to die
because of you yet again.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:20.018 position:50% align:center
So let's put an end
to this vicious cycle.

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
Oh, no you don't!

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
If you think I'll sit here
and watch you kill them,

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center
think again!

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Get a grip. Damn it! I have to!

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]
No! Don't do it!

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
That's it, Rihito! Give in!
There's no use fighting!

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you finally
decided to drop the act

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
and come back to us!

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
This... is the only way.
I'm sorry.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Idiot.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
You talk so big, yet this
is where you end up.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
You're a Legendary Idiot,
not Ace.

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
Jail's here?

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center
[PELE grunts]
About damn time you showed up.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts]
What're you doing here?

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
Simply because you asked.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Jail, I just have one request.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
Please take care of
Hina and the others.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] I never decline
a request from a friend.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
That's one of my convictions.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Jail.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50% align:center
You four-eyed piece of trash.

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
Die!

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.471 position:50% align:center
[JAIL grunts]

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
Stay out of this!

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
What in the...?

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
Let's make quick
work of them, yes?

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
Why you!

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of Sonohara.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
So Doan is all yours.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're so generous.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
You insects have pissed
me off for long enough!

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Okay. Let's try this again.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
We gotta stop the bleeding.
Kelly clamp.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Uh...

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center
You ready?

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
You bet.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
Time to get serious!

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
You asked for it!

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
How dare you just show up
and interrupt the commander

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
right before he tapped
into his Ace powers.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
He doesn't need them.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] Stop talking as if
you actually know him!

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
Heh! Your weapon's a
tiny piece of metal?

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.630 position:50% align:center
It's more than enough.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
Oh, we'll just have to
see about that, then.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
Starting right now!

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:01.930 position:50% align:center
Careful!

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
Wait... Your Count!

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
It's down to one!

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Yeah, well, things happen.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
But, if you lose...

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
My goodness.
Yes, that would explain it.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
The reason you can only summon
scraps is because that's

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
all your pathetic Count can
muster at its current number.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
You know I'm an Ace, right?

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
And yet you honestly believe you
can beat somebody on the same 

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
level as the commander?

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
You two are far from equals.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
You take that back!

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
It's true that we
were different before,

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
but I changed to
become like him!

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
You don't know anything,
so just die!

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
Is that all?

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.935 position:50% align:center
Impossible! Your Count
is only one!

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
This guy's the enemy! Focus!

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
He came to tear me away from
Rihito, but I won't let him!

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
Useless.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
In your current state, you
won't land a single shot on me.

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
Stay away!

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
What's happening?
Why won't any of them hit?

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
You still don't understand.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Shall I spell it out?

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
Stop it! Just shut up!

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.411 position:50% align:center
If you don't have convictions,
your bullets can't pierce me.

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
I told you to shut up!
I've heard enough!

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Can't you see?

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
I don't even have to dodge,
but your bullets still miss.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50% align:center
Tell me, why do you
suppose that is?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA whimpers]

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
I asked you a question!

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:25.281 position:50% align:center
Just die! Like normal!
Please, I'm begging you!

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
It's because you don't
have any convictions!

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
Don't come near me!

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
Like I told you 300 years ago.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
You must hold a conviction
if you want to get stronger.

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
So what is it you truly believe?

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA whimpers]

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:49.055 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
My conviction?

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
[whimpering continues]

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
My conviction... is...

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
I... honestly...
don't want to shoot you.

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA sobs]

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.586 position:50% align:center
You're gonna pay for
that one, four-eyes!

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
Your fight's with me, not him!

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
I'll eventually crush you both!

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:29.971 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center
To attain my goal, I have to
break the promise that we made.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
Why else do you think
I'm pissed off?

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts]
But still. This world's wrong!

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50% align:center
It's wrong on so many levels!

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
A world that forces us to kill.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
Forces us to take
in order to gain.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
No one in their right
mind would wish for this!

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
So with the help of the friends
I've made along the way,

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:59.334 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna try
one more time.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
And form the
"army that doesn't kill"!

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
That includes you, Doan.

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
You just blabber on and on!

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
Let's see how long you last
against me without your blade!

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:11.179 position:50% align:center
We have to start over! Now!

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
You idiot! Wars don't
end unless you kill!

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
So, get it through
your thick skull!

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
[LICHT groans]

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
We messed up, so we should
correct our mistake!

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:33.910 position:50% align:center
You filthy little bug!

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.620 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
How fresh... are the memories
of the Waste War for you?

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
[pants] Might as
well've been yesterday.

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's because you got
too much of Schmerman's genes

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
that you couldn't bring
yourself to kill children

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
no matter how hard you tried.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
Wasn't long before
the enemy noticed,

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
and once they did, they took
action in the worst way.

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
Brainwashing a bunch of kids
to try and assassinate you.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
Do you remember
the first little boy?

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.331 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I don't think I'll ever forget.

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] He had the clearest eyes.
Not a doubt in the entire world.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
Until the very end.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
After him there were dozens.

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
No--Hundreds more.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
I know. And you had
to kill them all.

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
Before they killed me.

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
You did it for my sake.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
There's no way. Little kids?

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
So stop.

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
And really think about
what you're doing here.

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
See.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
If Alcia falls, a war with the
Abyss would be inevitable!

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
Is that something you
really want to happen?

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
Wanna fight in another damn war
and cause even more death?

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.798 position:50% align:center
That what you want?

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:13.301 position:50% align:center
You know I don't. I never
wanna go through that again!

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.762 position:50% align:center
But, Doan. We have too
much blood on our hands

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
not to be held responsible!

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
We can't stand by and let
their sacrifice be in vain!

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
I won't let this world be
the reason they all died.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:28.316 position:50% align:center
How could I? Doing that
would be unforgivable!

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
Guess that settles it.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
Considering our history, it was
bound to happen sooner or later.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
Us killing each other!

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute! Hear me out!

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Enough!

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.630 position:50% align:center
Go ahead. I guarantee
you'll need it.

00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
'Cause this only ends
if you cut me down,

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
or I crush you like the
bug you've always been!

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
Either way only one of us
is leaving here alive!

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.059 position:50% align:center
I'm not finished!

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:10.984 position:50% align:center
[LICHT gasps]

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
Rihito, run! Hurry!

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't worry.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
It's gonna take a lot more
than that to beat Licht.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA]
No! He needs to run, now!

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] Been a long
time coming, cockroach.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I guess this is one
move you never got to see!

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
Time to die!

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Escaping into the sky
is classic Licht.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
You are so damn predictable.

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.484 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:54.527 position:50% align:center
You might be the Ace
of Flashing Strikes,

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
who can move at
the speed of light.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:20:00.784 position:50% align:center
However, I'm the Ace of Heavy
Strikes, the master of gravity.

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
Did you know? It's possible
to create gravity so strong

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.206 position:50% align:center
that not even light
can escape it.

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Natural opposites.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
We're destined to
be enemies, aren't we?

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
[LICHT shouts]

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:25.725 position:50% align:center
Get outta there!

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
Rihito!

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
Not like this. No...

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:30.313 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] A pit of super gravity
that not even the smallest

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
glimmer of light can
seep through.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
May you finally rest in peace.

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:49.082 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]
But you promised.

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
Licht! Don't leave me!

00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:37.065 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
It's almost the last episode!

00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:38.441 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
That doesn't give us much time.

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:39.442 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
For what?

00:22:39.526 --> 00:22:40.860 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Makin' babies. Come here!

00:22:40.944 --> 00:22:42.404 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Why are you undressing?
W-We're doing this now?

00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:44.698 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Why not? I think
I've waited long enough.

00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:47.200 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Stop! Somebody help me!

00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:49.786 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Next time. "My Ace."
