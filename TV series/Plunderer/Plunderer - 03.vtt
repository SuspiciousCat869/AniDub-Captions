[NANA] You're looking for Licht
Bach? Why? What did he do?

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A] He's wanted for the
crime of stealing a Ballot.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
Right. I haven't
seen him in a while.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
If you do, please let us
know right away. Take care.

You can come out, they're gone.

Sounds like you're in the clear.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center
They still think Licht's
holding onto the Ballot.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.922 position:50% align:center
That soldier was
telling the truth!

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
He really didn't
turn me in! Wow!

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.927 position:50% align:center

if I do say so myself!

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center

You're doing more

Yeah, of course!

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
So you want to build
a park for children?

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.503 position:50% align:center
That's no small feat.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Well, haven't you noticed
there's no place in this town

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
where kids can go
and play safely?

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center

I'll tell you what I've noticed.

catch criminals out here.

been slacking off.

No, we've been running errands.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
Yes! The purpose of a
soldier's entire existence

is to serve others in need!

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
Blah, blah. Look, I get it.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
Your count is based on
how many people you help.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
That is correct!

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
[PELE] Except, It only applies
if the person is in trouble.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center
For instance, all these errands
and favors you've been doing

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
for people haven't
increased your count.

get promoted.

Watch. One day a
criminal will show up,

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
and then I'll arrest them, hard.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:12.182 position:50% align:center

that he will be wearing

Legendary Ace? What is that?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
That's what he is.

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but what's it mean?

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
Please don't say you
honestly don't know.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center
Um, No, I was just kidding.
Yeah, so he's a great ace.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
And let's see, he's legendary.
That right?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
The Aces are how we
refer to the heroes

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
who fought in the
Waste War 300 years ago.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
Three hundred years ago?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
How could someone from that time
period possibly still be alive?

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center
Also, he's probably not
wearing the mask the whole time.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
I mean, how could
he breathe, right?

Stop it! That hurts!

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
I knew it was you!
You're on the poster!

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I most certainly am not!
How could I be on a poster?

Look at me! You're a woman!

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center

hanging anywhere?

Huh...? Um... What...?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] All you have to
do is look at my count!

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center

rejected by a thousand women

A thousand!

That's why I'm terribly
afraid to show my face

around any female.
I need the mask.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
I can't bear to see the look
of disgust on your face!

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
And I'm so hated!

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
Help him out.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
Look, it's not gonna kill you to
go out with the poor guy.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.946 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Are you nuts?

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen anyone
this upset in a long time.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
This is a great chance for you
to really increase your count.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
But, thing is... I've never
actually been on a date,

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
so I wouldn't know what to do.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center
[PELE] 
You need help.

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:45.627 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Hm?

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
What I mean to say is
that I would love to help!

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
This book'll tell you
all you need to know.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
[PELE] Hm... It says the first
thing you have to do

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
on a date is hold hands.

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Hm? Hold hands?
With a stranger?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
What a selfless deed!

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
[gasps, whimpers]

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Here.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
[LICHT gasps]

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
Awesome, your count
already went up!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
We have to keep this going!
Let's do the next step!

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center
[LYNN whines]

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
[PELE] Alright, we've got the
place with the nice view.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
Got a fruity drink. Your task
is to drink from the same glass.

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
Uh... Okay.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
[PELE] Go ahead!
What are you waiting for?

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
Are you worried
about getting sick?

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
You each have your own straw.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center
But do I have to drink it?

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
Come on. You do want
to help him, right?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
Sure. It's just kinda strange.

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps, yelps]

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
[LICHT groans]

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I'm sorry, sir.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.804 position:50% align:center
Sergeant, are you sure
this is the best idea?

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! This is perfect!

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] What does walking
over this creaky bridge

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.812 position:50% align:center
have to do with anything?

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
Trust me. It'll all
make sense later.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
Okay. Fine! Ow!

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
Just walk very slowly.
That's it, be careful.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
[LICHT gasps]
Help! I'm so scared!

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:56.174 position:50% align:center
Stop! You're making
the bridge rock!

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center
Come on, take a breath.
It's not that bad.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yeah... Okay... Huh?

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
[PELE chuckles]

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
[LICHT chuckles]

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
I got you, buddy.
We're just getting started!

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Woops! I fell!
Help me, Lynn!

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
With what? I'd fall, too!

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts]
Hold me close!

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
[LYNN, LICHT gasp]

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
Sergeant!

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
[LICHT hums]

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
Hey. Can we go now?
I'm kinda over the "date."

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
Hey, ah, Mister Pudding?
Does that work for you?

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
[LICHT gasps]

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
Oh no! Why?

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
What cruel fate makes my first
taste of happiness also my last?

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
I don't want to let it go!
It was over way too soon!

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Oh!

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.919 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Now that I know
the wonders of the date,

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
I can't help but long for more!

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
Poor guy. Never seen
anyone more tormented.

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
But, I understand
if you wanna go.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gronas] Maybe one more.
What's next in your book?

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.395 position:50% align:center
That's the spirit!
What do you think of this?

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps]

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
It's called the lap pillow!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
Look! I knew it!

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
The more you commit
to each good deed,

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
the faster you'll see
your count increase!

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
'Kay. I guess that's good
to know. What's next?

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.704 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Let's see.

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're still on
a date, so, be flirty.

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
Wink or something?

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
Maybe throw in a giggle and
some witty conversation?

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
Right. I was thinking...

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
How fortunate we are to have
such lovely weather today.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I guess. But it's too bright.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
I'd like it better if
it were dark.

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Huh?

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
I want to gaze up at the sky.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:12.394 position:50% align:center
And make wishes on stars with
someone sweet like you.

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.688 position:50% align:center
You're doing a great job,
keep it up!

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
You've got the mood perfectly
set for the next part.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
Ready, Mister Pudding?
It's grope time!

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center
It's what?

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center
Time for a little light
thigh squishing.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yeah!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
Squish! Squish! Squish! Squish!

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:34.165 position:50% align:center
Hey! How many hands do you have?
Can you scale it back?

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:35.333 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Way to go, Sergeant Major!

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:38.253 position:50% align:center
Your count is shooting
up crazy fast!

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.172 position:50% align:center
That's not fair!

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
It's gotta be the easiest count
increase I've ever seen!

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
[LYNN grunts] Come on!
That's enough! We get it!

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
The count keeps rising,
so it's time to be bold!

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:50.140 position:50% align:center
Put a hand on her panties!

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:54.561 position:50% align:center
No don't! This date
is over! Please, stop!

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
That can't be the right
procedure written in the book!

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center
Because it is way too
early for that step!

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
So you want to do
the steps in order?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
No. What?
Just stop this. Now. Please.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
Did you hear me?
I said it's too soon!

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.452 position:50% align:center
Let go of me!
It's not time for that!

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
I don't care what the
stupid book says!

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
Ugh. This is not worth it!

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Huh?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Um. Did you just
throw away the book? Why?

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
There's too many steps.
Who has time for that?

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
Gotta admit, it was fun
while it lasted, though.

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps]

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
But enough distractions, it's
time to get back to business.

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
That guy there?
Definitely a Ballot holder.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
He is?

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
U-Uh...

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Huh?

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
Well, usually when you
have a negative count,

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
you're sent to the Abyss,
but this guy's still here.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! You're right!

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
[PELE] Which means he must have
a second count somewhere.

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
Like I said, we're in the
presence of a Ballot Holder.

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
Okay, looks like I'm gonna
have to spell this one out.

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
He's the masked man
on the wanted poster.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps]

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
[LICHT grunts]

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
No way!

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
[PELE] Can't believe
it took you this long.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
What did you just say?

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:03.963 position:50% align:center
Who, me?

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.215 position:50% align:center
[whistles]

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:08.259 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Hey Miss Sergeant Major.
What's this do?

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
That little jerk took my sword!

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Ya know, there's no
need for name-calling.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Swords breed so
much violence, don't they?

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:19.938 position:50% align:center
You don't need this, Lynn.
Let's make love, not war--

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Impressive, right?

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
Hope you didn't think all
soldiers were sword fighters?

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
It's a skill I specialize in.
I suggest you turn yourself in.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
This town is important to me.

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
No! Stop!

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
I don't want to see it hurt!

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
No!

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
Calm down. You might pull
something screaming like that.

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
Just relax and
take a deep breath!

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
You know he's looking
at your undies?

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Huh?

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
[LICHT gasps]

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
What a weird sound!

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
That was the strangest
reaction I've ever seen.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
What do you think, Pele?

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.729 position:50% align:center
Yessir.

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] You're the one who was
doing high kicks in the smallest

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
and tightest skirt
I've ever seen.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
I just assumed you wanted
us to see your panties.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
Yeah, makes sense to me.

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
No! There's nothing I
can do about this skirt.

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
It's my uniform.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yes!

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Huh?

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
There's something else
very strange about him.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center
Who is he? Where is he from?

00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
I've thrown so many
kicks his way.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
And after all that, there's not
one scratch on him.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
No, but you did hurt me.

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
The moment I met you, I knew.

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
But then you slayed my heart.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.522 position:50% align:center
[LYNN gasps]

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
[LICHT chuckles]

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
Ugh. You're really blushing?
Over this guy?

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
No. We can't.
I'm a military officer.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
And you, sir,
are a wanted felon.

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
It won't work between us.
I want to have a baby.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
No. More like three babies.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
Also, do you think
you could get a job?

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
Mm... Actually, never mind,
you don't need to work.

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
Just. Um...

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
Well, as long as you could stay
with the kids and be a good

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
father, then, then that's
all any of us need.

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
I... Um...

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Sergeant Major?

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Huh?

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
Looks like he had to go.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Uh? Huh? He's gone?

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Well, I guess that
means you showed off your

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
naughty-shorts for no reason.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:18:56.636 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSMAN B laughs]
Come on, let's get wasted!

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
For you.

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.018 position:50% align:center
Thanks! I needed that.

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.310 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSMAN A]
Hey, Nana!

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I see you, sir!

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
[HINA gasps]

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
[NANA] You hangin' in there?
Sorry, I know this is a lot.

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
I'm fine! It's just my first
time and I want to do it right.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
Uh... but...

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
But, you're worried
about Licht. I know.

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:21.536 position:50% align:center
[HINA] When can we go
out and look for him?

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't get too
far ahead of yourself.

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
The first step is to save
up money for the trip.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
[HINA sighs]
Yeah, I remember.

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:32.172 position:50% align:center
Hey! Welco--

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:41.806 position:50% align:center
Well, Lieutenant.
What a nice surprise.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Iron bars and
a lion on the emblem.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
What can I get for you?

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
The man on this poster.

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Yeah, I wish. I haven't
seen him in quite a while.

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
He just disappeared one day.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Don't lie to me.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.198 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:03.328 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
My patrol has given me
very accurate reports.

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
You claimed you know nothing.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
I happen to know
that's not true.

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
I don't take kindly
to being lied to.

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER C]
We have to get out of here.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMERS gasp]

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
Alright. I'll let you
try this again.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
Do you know where Licht Bach is?

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Last I heard, he was
heading toward the east.

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
And that's honestly all I know.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
Did everybody hear that?

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS]
Sir!

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
She said he's heading east.
We go west.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.618 position:50% align:center
[NANA shouts]

00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSMAN A shouts]

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
Move out. Time to hunt an Ace!

00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:37.774 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Hey guys, Licht here!

00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:39.734 position:50% align:center
Next time, it's Cosplay
Thanksgiving!

00:22:39.818 --> 00:22:42.487 position:50% align:center
Hey Dominatrix Lynn,
I've been so bad!

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.364 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] I am not going
to go there with you!

00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:47.283 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Just a swift kick!

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:49.869 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Next episode,
"Ballot Holder!"
