[LYNN]
Why me?

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Stop!

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.106 position:50% align:center
Nah. Keep it up!

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
So you and Althing are
"best buds" now?

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Well,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
Fighting can have a tendency to
forge unexpected friendships.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.947 position:50% align:center
It's not that weird.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
Huh, I don't remember it
being so handsy before.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center
Because it wasn't!

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
Is there anything we can
do to make it go away?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
I'm at a deadlock in my
Star Stake with Sonohara.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
There's just one way to finish
it, and I really don't wanna.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.380 position:50% align:center
Eh. It should leave
sooner or later.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:50.717 position:50% align:center
That's right! It should!
I knew you'd get it, Nana.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
So understanding.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
And Althing would like
to take a closer look

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
at that kind heart of yours!

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:59.100 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Easy there.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.771 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Is this necessary?

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.440 position:50% align:center
You have to suffer...
all because of me.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.150 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Keep your grabby hands off!

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.528 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
No!

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:27.712 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA yelps] I'm sorry!
I realize I'm at fault!

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.048 position:50% align:center
I know I deserve this,
but I really am sorry...!

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:33.134 position:50% align:center
So, um. Do you have any
idea where mister Jail

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:34.427 position:50% align:center
happened to run off to?

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.137 position:50% align:center
Yeah, actually I do.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.848 position:50% align:center
He's heading to the
royal capitol, Neue Welt.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
The supreme commander
summoned him.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Hm?

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
Jail, sir.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
I've said it before, but I
wanted to say thanks again.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
How do you feel?

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
Better. Because of you.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Just curious,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50% align:center
but is anyone else wondering
why he was suddenly called in?

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
Don't know, don't care.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] It can't be for
his regular report,

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50% align:center
'cause it's too early!

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.481 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Kinda hard to think
straight at the moment.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
Agh! Let me go!

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
[MIZUKA] I offer you
my most sincere apology!

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
No!

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Stop!

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh! They must've
found out somehow!

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
[PELE]
Found out what?

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:09.791 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
Remember?

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
That little incident
where we kinda,

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
sorta attacked
Althing a tiny bit?

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
Which means we kinda,
sorta broke the law!

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
Oh crap! Everyone involved is
gonna get the death penalty!

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
I'm too young to die!

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:25.598 position:50% align:center
You're too young, huh?

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center
I said there's no way
they found out!

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
And I also mentioned how
incredibly beautiful

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center
you look today!

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
That's really sweet. A girl
does what she can, y' know?

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center
It'd be even sweeter
if I wasn't lying.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
Just think about it.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
The only ones who might've
talked were those smiley guys

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
in the black uniforms.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
But, Mr. Pudding ensured their
silence by taking them out.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.789 position:50% align:center
The other officers who were
there would never turn in

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
a report that would
get them executed.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
[LYNN grunts]

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
And if the townsfolk
decided to rat us out,

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.839 position:50% align:center
we'd still be in the clear.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
First Lieutenant Jail could
deny it and they'd believe him.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
Holy mother
of endowments, Hina!

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
This has to be the most amazing
growth spurt I've ever seen!

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:14.314 position:50% align:center
[HINA] Not growth. I just
stuffed some apples in there!

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
Oh! They're the softest,
warmest, juiciest apples

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.111 position:50% align:center
I've ever wanted
to put in my mouth.

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
Why did your Supreme
Commander summon mister Jail?

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
Oh. You really wanna know?

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
Enter.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
First Lieutenant
Murdoch coming in.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
Greetings, sir.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
Supreme Commander
Alexandrov Grigorovich.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
I have it on good
authority you went

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.903 position:50% align:center
head-to-head with
Licht Bach in Homhough.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
Tell me. Did that
meanie bully you?

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.743 position:50% align:center
Did you stay safe?
Do you have any boo-boos?

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
Jail, my boy!

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
Come on. It has been forever
since we've seen each other!

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
Let's have some father-son time!

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] I'm grateful that you
welcomed an orphan

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
like me into your home.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:28.138 position:50% align:center
That being said, I'm here on
orders, not a personal request.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.556 position:50% align:center
Or so I had thought.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
If this is one of your

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
"I-missed-you-and-tried
-summoning-you" stunts,

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
you should save your breath.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
[ALEX grunts] You never change.
Nope, not in the slightest.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
It figures.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
You've been like that since
you were a kid, though.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
How can you expect
to make friends

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
with that kind of attitude?

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
I have no need for
that sort of thing.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.832 position:50% align:center
So, then. If there is
no other business,

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
may I ask you a few questions?

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
Of course! Ask away!
What's up, my sweet baby boy.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Please refer to me
as First Lieutenant.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
Aw...!

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
Recently, at a town near Linden,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
I encountered some
individuals in black uniforms.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.686 position:50% align:center
They claimed to be Alcian
military like us.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.274 position:50% align:center
But unlike us, they attempted
to massacre the civilians there.

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] I've never seen
that uniform before.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
And their weapons...

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.075 position:50% align:center
They were as bizarre as
the ones who wielded them.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:34.579 position:50% align:center
We were blindsided.
Any idea who they are?

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center
Were they trying to kill
my men under your orders?

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
Supreme commander!
Please tell me!

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:43.672 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
[JAIL gasps]

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
I know them. Those men are
not part of my command.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:50.762 position:50% align:center
There are men not under
your command, sir?

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
That's right. Plenty of 'em.
I may be the supreme commander,

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
but there are still lots
of people above me.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.024 position:50% align:center
Well, It's highly confidential.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
A secret that only a select
few are aware of.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:09.906 position:50% align:center
But, since you're my special
Jail boy, I'll fill you in.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.033 position:50% align:center
The men you saw were
under the direct command

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50% align:center
of the royal family.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN giggle]

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] Espionage.
Abduction. Assassination.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.754 position:50% align:center
You name it, they do it.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] They are the Alcian
Supreme Military Council's

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:37.976 position:50% align:center
Special Services Unit...
Also known as the SSU.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
All this time... I never knew.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
I'd tread lightly, Jail my boy.

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
You'll find those guys
pretty much everywhere

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
you can imagine.
And to top it off,

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:50.238 position:50% align:center
each of them is a
Ballot-carrying super-elite.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
If you see one, you stay
the hell out of the way.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
Because if you don't... you die.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
[JAIL gasps]

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
I shall do as you advise.
One last question.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're, curious about
the Legendary Ace,

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
Licht Bach, right?

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
[JAIL gasps]
Right.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] He acts like a fool,
but he's as sharp as a blade.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:17.140 position:50% align:center
As usual.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
She has hips for days.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] I will have to
choose my words wisely.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
He doesn't seem to
know we broke the law,

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
and I won't be the one
to give it away.

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] While in pursuit of
our target, Licht Bach,

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
I noticed his Count
suddenly increasing

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
at an incredible rate.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
The Count, numbers that
govern our world.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
If that man is capable
of controlling them,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
then he's undoubtedly a
threat to law and order.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
That is the very
definition of an Ace.

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
They're special because
they're specially made.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Made... how?

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
If I only knew, Jail, my boy.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50% align:center
It's a mystery,
but I do know this much.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.182 position:50% align:center
Their ability to synchronize
with Ballots was boosted

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
through surgery.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.685 position:50% align:center
Surgery?

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] These surgically altered
humans, these experiments,

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
were employed in the Waste Wars.
About 300 years ago.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] What?

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
[ALEX] They were
essentially human weapons

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
and one platoon in particular
was comprised entirely of them.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.868 position:50% align:center
That squad was nothing
short of unstoppable.

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
Every enemy that stood in
their way fell at their feet.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
The members of this platoon
were the stuff of legends,

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50% align:center
and thus became the
legendary "Aces."

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
And Licht Bach, the invincible
man behind the mask,

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
was the one who
led them all.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I don't get it!

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
That happened 300 years ago!

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
You even said as much
just now, did you not?

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
There's no way
they'd still be alive!

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
How could that be?

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.526 position:50% align:center
Reports say they randomly
stopped aging out of the blue.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
That's impossible. Right, sir?

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
No, apparently it isn't.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:02.120 position:50% align:center
Even the ones who got operated
on aren't sure how it happened.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:05.540 position:50% align:center
Bottom line is, those Aces
are still very much alive.

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
The war might've ended,
but they live on.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.838 position:50% align:center
Like wandering ghosts.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:15.592 position:50% align:center
Give me your right hand,
Jail, my boy.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
[JAIL grunts]

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:24.601 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
Nothing. It's just...

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
You seem unusually on edge when
you're discussing Licht Bach.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
[ALEX]
"I will never tell a lie."

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
That's a conviction
of yours, yes?

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Dammit.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
Here's a question.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.085 position:50% align:center
Are you, by chance,
hiding Licht Bach from me

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
and the rest of your superiors?

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
Answer me.

No, sir.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I see.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
You don't understand
the gravity of this.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
Do you know what he'll do?

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] Plunder everything
from this nation.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
If that's the truth,
then I'll see it for myself.

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
That, too, is a
conviction of mine.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
[ALEX grunting]
You're an idiot...

We still haven't talked
about the main reason

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
I called you here.

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center

more predictable

I had to see it to believe it.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
Someone actually stood his
ground against Colonel Licht

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
while the commander was
in his more lethal state.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
A first lieutenant, no less.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
Such talent. It'd be a waste if
we didn't put it to good use.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center
And resources are always

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:30.722 position:50% align:center
This face has outgrown
its usefulness as well.

Licht returns to us sooner

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:39.189 position:50% align:center

There are many more

plunder from these people.

So, then... you're one, too?

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
Where you're going is no dream.

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:03.518 position:50% align:center
It's every bit as real as
what's around us now.
