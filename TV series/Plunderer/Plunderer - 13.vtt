I'm so happy that I get
to sit beside you, Licht!

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.694 position:50% align:center
How lucky!

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.196 position:50% align:center
Where'd ya get "Licht"
from "Rihito?"

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.907 position:50% align:center
Well, to me it isn't weird.
It's just your name.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.202 position:50% align:center
What's even luckier is
that we're all here!

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.829 position:50% align:center
[JAIL, TOKIKAZE]
You're joking!

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:01.830 position:50% align:center
Don't copy me!

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:04.082 position:50% align:center
Oh, shut up!

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:05.667 position:50% align:center
So intense.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.212 position:50% align:center
Anyways, do you guys have any
idea who our teacher will be?

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.047 position:50% align:center
[JAIL, TOKIKAZE]
Captain Alan would be nice.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.757 position:50% align:center
I feel like he's the
kind of teacher who can

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.759 position:50% align:center
bring out my true strength.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.052 position:50% align:center
Stop copying me!

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.220 position:50% align:center
I already said that!

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.848 position:50% align:center
[JAIL, TOKIKAZE growl]

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.642 position:50% align:center
I'm more concerned about the
Second Lieutenant's skirt.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
The slit cuts so deep.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.062 position:50% align:center
If I were checking her out
from just the right angle,

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center
I'd have a clear shot
of her panties!

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:32.819 position:50% align:center
[gasping]
Wait a sec!

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
There was more skin showing
than there should've been.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:39.451 position:50% align:center
Which means... She's been going
commando this entire time?!

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.247 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hina. I've been wondering.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.749 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.084 position:50% align:center
Your decision to enroll.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.461 position:50% align:center
This is a military school,

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
meaning you're a
soldier-in-training.

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:55.050 position:50% align:center
--[HINA] Huh?
--[RIHITO] You for real?

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
I get why she's surprised,
but what's your excuse?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.931 position:50% align:center
Well, I like this
place a lot! Hm!

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.768 position:50% align:center
And do you know why?

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
Just look at my skirt!
Yeah, that's right!

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
This uniform rules!
I gained five whole centimeters!

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.529 position:50% align:center
Hike up your skirt more.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.198 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
Because I find your
happiness annoying.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
[LYNN whines]

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.830 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Gained five then lost six.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] I don't care anymore.
Go ahead and look.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am!

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
[LYNN]
It's not fair.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Moving on.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
I was the one originally
assigned to teach your class,

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
but there was a change of plan.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
A very last minute
change of plan.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.347 position:50% align:center
[door clatters]

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
Hello there.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
The headmaster's
gonna teach us?

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
Sure seems like it.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
Try not to kill anyone.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
So that's class A.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
You think it's true?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.002 position:50% align:center
About Althing not being
created here in Alicia?

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
[PELE] Well, the captain would
have had nothing to gain

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
by lying, and everything
he said adds up.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
The Count and the Abyss.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
I highly doubt they're spies.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
They're way too conspicuous.
So that's out.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
But what the heck were
they talking about?

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.023 position:50% align:center
Something to do with
an abyss and a count?

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
And they also mentioned "Alcia".
Is it just a coincidence?

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.906 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
Before we begin today's lesson,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
let's first go over the rules
that govern this school.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
Do you see this star?
Everyone receives two.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
What for?

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] Students who
manage to collect ten stars

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
will officially be
welcomed into the military.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
Of course, with that new status
will come a large salary

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
and a food supply sufficient to
share with family members.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
I'm so ready!

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
Sounds good to me!

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.474 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] On the other hand,
if the number of stars a student

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
has ever reaches zero,

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
he or she will be
considered unfit to serve

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
and will therefore be expelled.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.524 position:50% align:center
Isn't that a little too harsh?

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
Expelled?

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
There's no way!

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
Um, sir? How exactly do we
go about getting more stars?

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
Hm. Good question.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
You'll be given chances
to prove yourself during

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
various activities,

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
and performing well
will earn you stars.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
But if that's not quick enough,

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
there is another way you can
accumulate these tokens.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
And that's by taking them
from your fellow classmates.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
Like, by force?

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] Yes. That is
precisely what I was implying.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
So let's go ahead and
establish some ground rules

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center
for using violence to up your
star collections, shall we?

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
Both parties involved must first
declare they are betting stars.

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
Win or lose, if there is
no confirmed agreement,

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:05.365 position:50% align:center
then there is no star exchange.
And if you do emerge victorious,

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
you can only take the number
of stars you agreed to wager.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
Understood?

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
That sounds just like...

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
A Star Stake.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
Is this where that
tradition started?

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:36.563 position:50% align:center
Ah, Rihito. No stars
for you, I'm afraid.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.107 position:50% align:center
You'll be facing a slightly
different challenge.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
If you truly desire to
stay enrolled here,

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
then you must obtain your
first star from another student.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATES chatter]

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
But why just him
and nobody else?

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.206 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] You have
three days. Good luck.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
[HINA grunts] I can't believe
he's making him do that!

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
You think he's trying
to get revenge?

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center
Y'know, for that stunt that he
pulled at the entrance ceremony?

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center
It's not vengeance,
it's just plain mean!

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
Sure does seem that way.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Unforgivable, even!

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I wouldn't worry
about it too much.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
If there's one person who can
figure this out, it's Rihito.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
Maybe. But you heard
what he said, right?

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't care
if I get expelled.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.364 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
What? Why not?

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
I only came here
'cause of this guy.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.743 position:50% align:center
My goal's to get him out,
not graduate.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
Grandma sent you.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
And I couldn't turn her
down after everything

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
she's done for me. So whaddaya
say we both head back home?

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
Forget it.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Uh! Hey!
You wanna know what she said?

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
That she didn't raise you
just so you could grow up

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
and become a coldblooded
killer in uniform.

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE] I won't be a killer,
so she has n--

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
Yes, you will.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
That's what soldiers are.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.060 position:50% align:center
And besides,

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50% align:center
I really don't think you're
cut out for this--

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
You're wrong!

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
I absolutely have
to be a soldier.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
I wonder why he's so adamant
about becoming a soldier.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
Just seems odd to me.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
But if Tokikaze
is in it to win it,

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.663 position:50% align:center
I guess Pudding will
want to be, too.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
I hope so!

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
Now that we know Licht's
intentions for being here,

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
we have even more reason to make
sure he doesn't get kicked out!

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
I want him to stay.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
I don't have any real
interest in being a soldier,

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center
but I came here because Rihito
came here. It's that simple.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
If he gets expelled or
ever decides to leave,

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
I would leave, too.

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
Oh! I said too much!

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, okay?

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
If we work together,
I know we can protect him!

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
There a method to your madness?

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
I just want to observe how
he handles a predicament

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
such as this. Is that so bad?

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
It sure as hell ain't nice.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
I'm merely testing him.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
He's the one who
gave us expectations.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
Now it's time to see if
he can measure up to them.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
This is just what I needed!

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:19.768 position:50% align:center

The more I think about it,

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
the more frustrated I get!

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center

right here and now!

I've got this!

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
I solved countless
cases at Homhough,

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.136 position:50% align:center
so something like this
should be a cinch!

there's nothin' to count.

Hey.

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
You two should also be a
part of this discussion.

Um. If it's okay with you,

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
we'd rather focus on
helping Licht right now.

get your priorities in order!

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
He was peeking on you too!

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50% align:center

day of his challenge.

That's why it's so important.

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center

posters can help him.

--[SUDA] Guys! Come see this!

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
Who would do such a thing?

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
No! I had my stars in here!

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
They're... all gone!

00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
They are?!

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE] The whole
point of locking them up

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
was so they
wouldn't get stolen!

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
Give them back... Rihito!

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
You're the only one who'd
need to stoop this low.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center

[HINA]
Hold on a second!

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:48.898 position:50% align:center
It's true that he's a
borderline criminal

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.984 position:50% align:center
who mooches off friends
and looks up girls' skirts!

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.737 position:50% align:center
And, yes, he puts his hands
places they have no right to be!

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
But one thing he'd never
do is steal your stars!

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
There ya have it.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
That didn't make him sound
very innocent, but nice try.

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
[ICHINOSE] Well, if he's
not the culprit, then who is?

Doan, let her go.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.175 position:50% align:center
Is there some sort
of problem here?

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center

give me back my stars.

Oh. I get it.

you stars didn't you?

Not at all!

That's enough!

 I bet you're the scumbag
who stole our stars, too?

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
His muscles are big
enough to pull it off

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center

used to do on
your underwear? Haha!

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but still.

But I'm not tired, Tokikaze.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact,

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
I've got just enough energy
to take a few more stars.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
What?

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center

you already have ten?

Come on. Hand 'em over.

You're dreaming if you think
I'd actually do that!

price to pay for the livelihood

Why?

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE] Because my
grandmother's dojo

belongs to Doan's parents.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center

Before, it was just Licht.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
Now even more of
us will be expelled.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
Not if I can help it!

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
I'll challenge that jerk
to a Star Stake my--

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
That won't work. Why would
he agree to a Star Stake?

The guy already has ten stars.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
Better than standing around
and picking my nose!

If we can't get any stars
back from that bully,

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:54.668 position:50% align:center

divvy up our own!

have one of mine.

Nah, I'm good.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
You should give it to someone
who actually wants it.

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
Though, why anybody'd wanna
be a soldier is beyond me.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
There are lots of reasons why!

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
Can you spare me one? Please?

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I can't. What if
something bad happens

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
and I lose the only
star I have left?

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
Come on! Help a guy out.
I just need one!

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center
Here. It's all yours.

Someone please share
their stars with me!

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center

Give yours to him.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
It's fine.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
Dude, you are officially
my hero! Thank you!

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
Well, things are lookin' pretty
grim for you, Tokikaze.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
Last I checked, there weren't
any more star-earning activities

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
scheduled today.

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
If you have a strategy for not
getting expelled, let's hear it.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
[PELE] There's still the option
of taking stars by force.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:14:59.858 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE]
I can't do that!

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
But that's what being a
soldier is all about.

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
And since you
"absolutely have to be one,"

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
you'll have to do it eventually.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
Pele!

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
He's telling it like it is.

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:12.620 position:50% align:center
Though I'm not sure why,
since our help isn't wanted.

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:13.955 position:50% align:center
Leave him alone.

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Don't be like that,
First Lieutenant!

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center

[TOKIKAZE grunts]

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
I think it worked out
for the best.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
I feel the same way
Grandma does.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna see you
turn into a killer either.

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE] She keeps
on losing more weight.

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.406 position:50% align:center
She's always saying
she has plenty to eat,

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
but I know that isn't true.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
How else do you feed
two growing boys?

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
She'd give us her share,
that's how. And starve.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.668 position:50% align:center
You must've known, too, Rihito.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKAZE] Food rations
are getting smaller.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
That's just not enough.
There's just not enough.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
I've begged her to eat,
but she won't listen.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
We can't go on like this.
That's why!

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
I have to become a soldier!

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
Then I can be the one who
provides her with food!

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
I just... want Grandma
to have a full stomach.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
She deserves a full stomach.

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] That chime
means it's six o'clock!

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.960 position:50% align:center
Students who have collected
ten stars, please assemble

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
at the main gate in an
orderly fashion at this time.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:52.345 position:50% align:center
Heh! But I'm the
only one, obviously.

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Listen! You gotta give
Tokikaze back his stars!

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.891 position:50% align:center
Outta my way!

00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO grunts]

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:03.940 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Licht, are you okay?
Talk to me!

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:06.860 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Pfht. You're garbage.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
Stay down and maybe
they'll take you out

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
with the rest of the trash.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:17.370 position:50% align:center
[HINA] That jerk.
He shouldn't get to win.

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center
He's done such cruel
and selfish things.

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
Yet doesn't acknowledge
the suffering he causes.

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
I'm so mad at myself.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
'Cause all I can do
is watch it happen.

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
Don't be mad. It's not over.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
Heh. It's too damn easy.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
It's Jail

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center
What the heck do you want now?

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
[JAIL] I came to
watch you graduate.

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:58.578 position:50% align:center
I've been looking forward to it.

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
Because the moment you
step outside this gate,

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
I'm going to beat
the shit out of you.

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You want
me to bet my stars.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center
Well, tough luck,
'cause that ain't happenin'.

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:12.133 position:50% align:center
[JAIL]
You're wrong.

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:13.301 position:50% align:center
 Am I?

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
How can I wager stars
when I have none?

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
You see, I chose to put my last
star in someone else's hands.

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.521 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
Deep down he's a big softy,
though he's tough as nails!

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
So, please, hurry up
and graduate.

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
Then I'll be expelled
for not having stars.

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
And since I don't
intend to return,

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
I can beat you senseless
without any repercussions.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
You'll be nice and "broken" in

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
for your first day
in the military.

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:43.790 position:50% align:center
Damn you. Bastard!

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
--[LYNN] Take him out, sir!
--[ICHINOSE] Yeah!

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
Teach that dumb punk a lesson!

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
[DOAN] Insects like you have
such short-term memories.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
Did you forget what happened
the last time we fought?

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:53.967 position:50% align:center
You caught me off-guard.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
I wasn't nearly as serious
as I am right now.

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
So you ready for a rematch?

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
You asked for it!
I'll beat you to a bloody pulp!

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
Just a moment.

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
Before you exit the
gates of our academy,

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
I'll need to see
your stars to verify

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
you have the proper amount.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
Well, I do. Take a good look.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
'Cause I've got twelve
of 'em right here!

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
Hm! Right where?

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
[DOAN]
Ya blind?

00:19:21.536 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
The hell?

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Bleh. If you
lost stars, come and get 'em!

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna squash him
like the bug he is!

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.431 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] Looks like you
won't be graduating today.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Please return to your classroom.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:47.187 position:50% align:center
And as for you,
Jail Murdoch of Class A.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
I believe your uniform
is missing something.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
In truth,

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
I initially planned on
giving these to Rihito.

00:19:56.821 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
But it appears he's no
longer in need of them.

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
I'm glad that it worked out.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.872 position:50% align:center
As of now, these stars
belong to you.

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
--Yeah, way to go!
--[PELE] Hooray.

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
Glad he got what he deserved!

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
Jail's pretty impressive, huh?

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
Now everyone in Class A is back!

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
Tokikaze... I've decided that
I'm gonna stay here with you.

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
Although, I still don't
want you to graduate.

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
You wanna stay but not pass?

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:34.901 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO] Yeah. I don't
see any problem with it.

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
This school has a
pretty sweet setup.

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
I know we won't have to
worry about food here.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
Which means our families
won't have to feed us.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
They can eat without
feeling guilty.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
That should be able
to sustain them,

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
at least for a little while.

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:51.459 position:50% align:center
And it'll give us time to figure
out what we wanna do.

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
Maybe we'll become
soldiers after all.

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
There's no need to rush
decisions like that.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
So long as we're here,
we'll have time.

00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:38.149 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Oh, I can't get
this guy out of my head!

00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:39.317 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
What?

00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:40.610 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Oh! Did I just
say that out loud?

00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:41.986 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
Kinda. Who is he?

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.780 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Oh, just your average
pudding-wearing pervert

00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:45.615 position:50% align:center
who sneaks a peek
every chance he gets.

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:47.158 position:50% align:center
[HINA] I don't think
that's very average.

00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:49.911 position:50% align:center
[LYNN] Next time,
"7 Minutes 12 Seconds."
