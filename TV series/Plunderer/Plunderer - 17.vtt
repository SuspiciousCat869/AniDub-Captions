This procedure. It's much
more taxing on you than him.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
It's all right. I'd rather
give it to him... myself.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]
Mm.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
A sword?

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
It's also a replica of a Ballot.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
It will amplify your

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
But in order for it
to properly function,

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
you must first engrave
it with your Count.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
You lost me.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
A Count is an oath you make
that binds you to something.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
It's fairly simple to do.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
Once you have a specific oath in
mind, say, "Authenticate Count,"

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
and declare what it is you
choose to keep count of.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
As soon as your
pledge is complete,

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
it will recognize
you as its master.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
Don't rush this decision.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
Take your time and
think it through.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
Besides, you have more
pressing matters to attend to.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
Um... Okay.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
But I've never used
a sword before.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
That doesn't matter.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.607 position:50% align:center
It's true that you
were very weak.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
Compared to gifted "hares"
like Tokikaze and Doan,

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
you were indeed the
personification of a "tortoise."

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
But now...

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center

can't you?

It goes against everything
he believes in.

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
But he's going to try to
fight this war on his own.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO]

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
I wasn't sure before.

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center
I know exactly what
kind of person he is.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
I know what Licht means to me
now.

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
The simple fact... is that...

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
...I love him.

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
[RIHITO gasps]

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
[HINA] If you want more than
just a kiss, then listen up!

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
Remember this, Licht.
For the next 300 years to come.

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
Hold on to this moment.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
Considering the big
pervert you are,

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
I figured holding on to
something else might help.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
You're going to kill more people

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
than either of us can imagine.

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
And you're going to feel
very alone because of it.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
But, just keep one
thing in mind.

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
As crazy as this sounds,

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
I'll be waiting 300
years from now.

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
[HINA] I know being alone
can feel really sad,

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
so when you're
fighting by yourself,

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center
remember it won't be forever!

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
What I mean is...

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
...I want to have
children with you!

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
[HINA]
If I have any say in the matter,

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
you'll never feel lonely.
You won't have the chance to!

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
Wherever you decide to go,
I promise I'll find you!

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
And I'll give you as
many kids as you want!

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
If it makes you happy,
I don't care!

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.575 position:50% align:center
I will turn your life
upside down if I have to!

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
Just you wait!

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
When you feel lonely.
Remember me!

00:22:36.189 --> 00:22:38.191 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] It's the moment
we've been waiting for, sir!

00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:40.527 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN]
Ah, yes. The birth of Alcia.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:41.861 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA]
What should we start with?

00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:43.822 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] Alcia Buns are
at the top of my list,

00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:45.407 position:50% align:center
but so are Alcia Cookies.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.283 position:50% align:center
[FIRENDA] You are what
you eat, so eat nice buns!

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:49.953 position:50% align:center
[SCHMERMAN] Next time,
"Birth of Alcia."
