1
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,750
I was told to give you this....

2
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,083
So tell me, why do you
want to be a vampire?

3
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,666
Well... because...

4
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,250
"All the Kingdoms of the World,
shall I give unto thee..."

5
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,958
You know, we get
a lot of riff-raff

6
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,791
trying to break into our scene.

7
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,125
Wanting to becomes vampires

8
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,916
so they can escape
their sad little lives.

9
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,625
I'm just...

10
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,750
The card is a ruse.

11
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,250
And any maggot
who dares to bring me

12
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:36,458
one of these cards is an
enemy of the Valentine Brothers.

13
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,916
No! It's not like that!

14
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,125
Britz told me about this place!

15
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,875
Go on...

16
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,708
Thank you for your patience
on this matter Alucard.

17
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,583
I believe you
will be very pleased.

18
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,166
Nice.

19
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,625
The 13mm Jackal;

20
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,833
a semi-automatic,
anti-freak weapon.

21
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,708
390mm long,
weighing in 16 Kilograms.

22
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:18,833
6 round magazines. Too much
gun for any human to handle.

23
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,958
Instead of the modified
rounds from your 454 Casul,

24
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,000
we've custom made an
explosive armor-piercing round

25
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,333
especially for this gun.

26
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,000
Hello...?

27
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,333
Casing?

28
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,500
Pure silver,
macadonium processed.

29
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,500
Ammunition?

30
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,583
NNA 9. Marbel cartridges.

31
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,958
Explosive or mercury charge?

32
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, Mercury, and of course,
they've already been blessed.

33
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,083
It's perfect, Walter.

34
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm glad you're satisfied.

35
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,333
Do you think you could
you even kill the

36
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,416
Paladin Anderson,
with this gun?

37
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,291
Oh, I think so.

38
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,166
Miss Victoria,
very good. I have a new

39
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,458
weapon for you as well.

40
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,375
Oh, what is it?

41
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,000
The 30mm anti-freak
Harkonnen Cannon.

42
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,625
The Harkonnen Cannon,
uses two types of ammunition.

43
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,041
One, Depleted Uranium
shells; the other,

44
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,333
explosive armor
piercing incendiary rounds.

45
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,291
You're not seriously going to

46
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,375
make me carry
that thing, are you?

47
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,500
It really suits you,
police girl.

48
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,458
But, do you really think so?

49
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,333
I don't know if I would
look good carrying that.

50
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,958
I mean the length
is a serious issue.

51
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,583
But even that's
beside the point.

52
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,291
Isn't Depleted
Uranium is illegal?

53
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,083
And anyway, I'm a strong girl,
but I'm not that strong.

54
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,541
Your next mission
should be very interesting.

55
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,291
Miss Victoria.

56
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,625
I thought he was just
encroaching on our territory,

57
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,750
it turns out, this card was
the decoy from Britz' shop.

58
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,750
If Britz is the traitor,
why don't we just cap him?

59
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,416
Don't be so stupid Jann.

60
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,708
What?

61
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,583
The police arrested
Britz, last week.

62
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,958
He got busted?
Man, that's a mind-fuck.

63
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,625
Still, I don't think
a ordinary cop would

64
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,791
bring this card here and
risk his life so nonchalantly.

65
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,083
Any thoughts?

66
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,500
He was undercover.

67
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,125
Did he have a wire on him?

68
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,708
He didn't have anything
traceable on him.

69
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,625
Could be a sign; he may
have known what he was doing.

70
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,166
The only thing he
had on him was this....

71
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,625
It's from a special ops. group.

72
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,125
They claim to be
experts in dealing

73
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,750
with vampires and the ghouls.

74
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,833
Yeah, I saw them on TV.

75
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,125
Was'up with that shit?

76
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,750
It's high time
we stopped all these

77
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,791
territorial pissing
matches once and for all.

78
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,833
Don't you agree Jann?

79
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,583
Looks like we're gonna play
some war games, eah Bro?

80
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:15,208
But first, we're going
to need a few soldiers...

81
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,833
An MI-5 agent, who
was investigating these

82
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,166
artificial vampires,
has been found dead.

83
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,958
That is unconscionable.

84
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,250
When I was young, people
had some respect for MI-5.

85
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,750
No one would ever have
attempted such a brazen--

86
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,500
That's beside the point!

87
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,875
Madam.

88
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,166
Thanks to this incident,
forces all over England have

89
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,375
begun assessing what
sort of action is to be taken.

90
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,583
A round table conference
must be held, mustn't it?

91
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,541
I believe it must, and soon.

92
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,666
Hello? God, help me, please!

93
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,333
There's these vampires'
sucking everybody's blood!

94
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,791
It's true!
I'm not fucking around!

95
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:18,208
It's true.
I'm not fucking around.

96
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,291
It's time for us to leave.

97
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,208
Step it up!
You demonic vampire bitches!

98
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,333
Forget this.

99
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,958
According to reports
by the local police,

100
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,875
Those people being attacked were
some sort of religious cult.

101
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,791
Reconnaissance says they
may have illegal weapons.

102
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,625
No need to be
beat about the bush.

103
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,708
Ghouls or not we're
going to be dealing with

104
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,416
some especially
dangerous scum tonight.

105
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,250
Humbly accept your orders,

106
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,041
and May God and
Her Majesty be with you.

107
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,458
Amen.

108
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,958
Shouldn't I be going with them?

109
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,583
I want the human
troops to handle this first.

110
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,791
You're just going to have

111
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,833
let them take
care of it, Alucard.

112
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,458
Humans are always so willing to

113
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,250
tangle themselves up
in meaningless rules.

114
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:56,375
Besides, the new gun Walter
got me, begs for a field test.

115
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,333
Alucard, the target
they are about to fight

116
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,875
is not just another
inhuman freak.

117
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,125
These vampires have
human characteristics

118
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,666
that may be difficult for a
creature like you to comprehend.

119
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,541
That sounds like a
good to be a lot of fun.

120
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,625
Target Acquired.
Confirmed as NHB!

121
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,791
Fire!

122
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,375
What is this?

123
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,375
There are no targets on scene.

124
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,375
We don't even see any bodies.

125
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,208
Blood. I smell blood.

126
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,833
But' it's not just blood!

127
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,166
All this for just one vampire.

128
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,791
Get out!

129
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,333
I won't let our men die,
not because of me.

130
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,041
It took us too long to
recognize the booby-trap.

131
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:50,041
We still managed to evacuate
everyone. I'm very sorry ma'am.

132
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,000
How dare they underestimate
my organization!

133
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,166
That freaks!!

134
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,375
Come in

135
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,666
Sir Integra.

136
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,625
The knights have arrived and
are ready for the conference.

137
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,166
It's rare these days for the

138
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,291
Knights of the Round Table
to wear their swords.

139
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,750
Sir Integral Wingates Hellsing,

140
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,583
the knights of the
modern world have more

141
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,041
effective weapons that swords.

142
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,666
Now, kindly take your seat.

143
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,375
I doubt any of us
has much time to waste.

144
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,333
Sir Integra, according to your
report, many of the creatures

145
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:48,333
you have been encountering
recently are man-made vampires,

146
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,750
due to these implanted
freak-chip devices.

147
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,625
The mission of the
Hellsing organization is to end

148
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,791
all earthly activity
of non human creatures.

149
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,875
In the process of completing
this mission, we are expected to

150
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,666
have many direct encounters
and battles with vampires.

151
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,333
But it is not our
responsibility to investigate

152
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,041
the mechanism of this chip,

153
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,208
or to determine
who is distributing it.

154
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,708
We are in the midst of
conducting our investigation.

155
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:19,041
And investigation during which
you let the enemy kill your spy.

156
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,625
They even stuck a
Union Jack in him.

157
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,125
You misunderstand your
situation, Sir Integra.

158
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,208
We all attended the
round table conference

159
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,250
to share our power and
knowledge with each other;

160
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:36,208
out of loyalty and
reverence to her Majesty.

161
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,000
I understand.

162
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,083
No, Sir Integra.

163
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,166
I don't think you understand.

164
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,708
You see, your activities have
become a bit too flash of late.

165
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,500
Non-human creatures have
existed since ancient times,

166
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,083
and Great Britain has
managed to keep this quiet,

167
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,166
controlled, and contained,
up until recently.

168
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,083
Your Hellsing organizations
current activities

169
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,458
are leaving a stain on
our illustrious history.

170
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,833
Hellsing has been
too loud, and too public.

171
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,791
One could wonder if your
qualified for your job.

172
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,958
The enemy is armed with powerful
weapons. I have had no choice.

173
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,916
As for Information control...

174
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,958
I believe that's your job.

175
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,583
That's beside the point!

176
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:19,083
There is a limit to how much
information can be suppressed!

177
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,166
So you are telling me that the
round table conference members

178
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,750
are not powerful enough
to handle the situation.

179
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,916
You're overstepping
yourself, Integra!

180
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,708
Your father would
have never been so

181
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,916
irresponsibly brash!

182
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,166
My father; was my father.

183
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,958
So, you won't believe
what he did next man.

184
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,291
It's too fucked up... After he
ran Soho's bar out of business,

185
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,416
he fucking poached all the
girls from his place, man.

186
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,750
So like, Soho totally
fucking snaps...

187
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,875
Oh do, shut up.

188
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,500
Bro, what's wrong
with you, man? Hey!

189
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,791
You always get so
annoying before work.

190
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,375
I've said it before; I know
I'll probably say it again.

191
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,833
Please learn to work quietly!

192
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,125
Yeah, yeah. I've heard
all that before. I know.

193
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,541
Christ!

194
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,125
You have no excuse
to screw this up, Jann.

195
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,500
Screw Up? That's
never gonna happen bro!

196
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,000
This shits gonna be a cake walk.

197
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,500
Excuse me! Sorry Sir,
this building is off limits.

198
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,916
I am gonna have
to ask you to leave.

199
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, I'm sorry.. We're here
on a sight seeing tour.

200
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,416
We're taking a tour of
all the old London mansions,

201
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,833
seeing some famous
castles in the countryside.

202
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,875
This one is our first stop.

203
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,333
What're you talking about?

204
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,750
This place is...

205
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,000
Isn't this place supposed
to be open to the public?

206
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,958
I know all the people on
our tour bus over there

207
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,375
have just been dying
to take a look inside.

208
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,833
This is main entrance,

209
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,375
I have some suspicious
persons here. Please send-

210
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,333
Oh, Jann. I think it's
time to start the tour.

211
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,041
What's wrong?
Give me a status report!

212
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:39,125
Jesus Christ! You suck!
You all fuckin' suck!

213
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,791
As long as I can keep
killing and keep drinking,

214
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,333
whatever works is cool.

215
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,458
Killing Hellsing,
Killing whatever. Fuckin' man!

216
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,583
I'll just kill' em all!

217
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,916
Integra!

218
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,291
What's happened?
What's going on?

219
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,958
We are under attack!

220
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,875
It seems to be an unknown
number of enemy ghouls,

221
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:02,958
all fully armed.

222
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,333
They're disorganized,

223
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,250
so I'm having trouble
predicting their movements.

224
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,208
They have already broken
into the compound

225
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,833
in several key points.

226
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,458
I am so fucking hard right now!

227
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,375
We are smarter than you
bitches, and you can't stop us!

228
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,416
It's a disaster.

229
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,291
Integra! Sir Integra!

230
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,791
Good lord. They're attacking
the Hellsing house,

231
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:39,958
I can't believe it!

232
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,458
What is all this about Integra?
Explain yourself!

233
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,958
Integra!

234
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,666
All outside units
report back immediately!

235
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,375
We must defend the
third floor at all costs!

236
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,291
My God, they're
already this far.

237
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,916
You know, the security in
this place is so fuckin' weak!

238
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,791
What to do?

239
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,125
Old peoples' blood
taste like a shit.

240
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,041
But, it's no fucking
fun if I just shoot you...

241
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,833
Ferguson! Come in!

242
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,291
Ferguson!

243
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,750
Bastards!

244
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,125
I'm Janny.

245
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,291
Excuse me.

246
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,375
And I'm Luke.

247
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,291
Hey...

248
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,791
With the weather report.

249
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,083
Hangon...

250
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,541
Next week, Hellsing
will have a rain of blood.

251
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,958
Again, being silly...
