1
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,583
I am so fucking hard right now!

2
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:12,375
We are smarter than you
bitches and you can't stop us!

3
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,625
We must defend the
third floor at all costs!

4
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,791
God, they're already this far.

5
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,458
You know, the security in
this place is so fuckin' weak!

6
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,416
What to do?

7
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,750
Old people's blood
taste like a shit.

8
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,750
But, it's no fucking fun
if I just shoot you...

9
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,083
Ferguson! Come in!

10
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,875
Ferguson!

11
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,166
Integra, what in hell
is going on out there?

12
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,000
We're under attack by
an unknown group.

13
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,208
Our field units

14
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,291
are pushing them back
at this very moment.

15
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,875
H...hello, is this thing on?

16
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,583
Alright, this is a shout
out to all our listeners

17
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,208
in the round table conference!

18
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,750
And a special hello

19
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,666
to that whoring little bitch
Ms. Hellsing, can you hear me?

20
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:15,250
We are the Valentine Brothers!

21
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:19,625
I'm Jann Valentine! And it's
real nice to finally meet you!

22
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,083
We appreciate you joining
us for this late lunch,

23
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,416
We are currently
enjoying the delicious taste

24
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,416
of the Hellsing membership.

25
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,916
They're eating... my people...

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,458
While you're waiting
for us to kill you,

27
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,583
we highly recommend
pissing yourself.

28
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,583
Followed by a course of
praying to your impotent God.

29
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,125
Then, cowering in the corner
and begging; always good!

30
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,208
But if you act now
there's still time

31
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,583
for an old fashioned suicide.

32
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,750
Good Lord.

33
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you London,
we love you, goodnight!

34
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:58,375
Well, looks like you
get to go first, old man!

35
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,666
What...the fuck...?!

36
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,625
Bloody pig!

37
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,458
Commander! You all right?

38
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,875
How's our unit?

39
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,250
I've been busy
helping the wounded

40
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,083
who won't turn into ghouls so...

41
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,125
I don't know.

42
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,166
I'm staying here.

43
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,875
What are you talking about?

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I believed that men alone

45
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,875
could conquer all the
world's monsters.

46
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,083
I'll listen to your story later.

47
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,708
What the fuck?

48
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,541
I thought that Alucard
guy was the only one.

49
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,083
Now what?

50
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,416
Are we going to allow ourselves
to be slaughtered like this?

51
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,416
No, emergency escape
procedures are already in place.

52
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,125
Isn't that right, Sir Integra?

53
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,041
A helicopter is prepped
and standing by

54
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,666
at the top of the tower.

55
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,833
Then let's go!

56
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,875
We have no time to lose,
and we can't stay here!

57
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,708
We wait!

58
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,708
This room is protected
by 15 mm lead armor.

59
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,166
However, once
outside of this room,

60
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,666
there's no way
I can protect 11 people

61
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,541
from the Ghouls all by myself.

62
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,041
Then what do we suppose to do?

63
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,708
Mr. Ferguson has
probably already reported

64
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,333
the situation to the
proper authorities.

65
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,583
Once they discover that
they can't contact us,

66
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,458
they will mobilize.

67
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,750
W...what was that?

68
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,625
They've just destroyed
our helicopter.

69
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,750
Our enemies must have
really done their homework.

70
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,958
It's inappropriate to
be congratulating them.

71
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,250
Ghoul soldiers tenacity
makes them useful,

72
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,833
But, a special job
requires a special touch.

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,250
Jann, are you there?

74
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,791
Hey man! This is Jann,
captain and leader

75
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,416
of the Hellsing killer unit.

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,875
Oh, yeah!

77
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:20,916
Anything wrong?

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,250
No, nothing really.

79
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,375
But check this shit.

80
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,625
We gotta another undead sucker

81
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,625
to worry about
other than big red.

82
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,625
But she's like gone
underground though.

83
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,666
I understand.

84
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,916
I will take care of that.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,166
Hey! I been working
my ass off bro.

86
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,000
First and second
floors are already clear.

87
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,500
Now all there's
left to take care of

88
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,083
is that stupid little bitch
and the old fucking geezer.

89
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,375
Oh, I guess there still
is one human left alive.

90
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,625
Master!

91
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,125
What are you doing here?
This is an emergency!

92
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,541
I'm waiting.

93
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,875
For the enemy?
They're all on the first floor!

94
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,708
My enemies are not the trash

95
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,708
that you've been
fighting, police girl.

96
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,666
Oh, is that right?

97
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,541
I'm surprised they managed
to get so many Ghouls inside.

98
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,500
The first floor is
completely overran and

99
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,500
now the second is almost lost...

100
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,625
And Sir Integra?

101
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,708
She's up stairs. Third floor.

102
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,166
We have to rescue her!

103
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,625
I was just heading up
there myself.

104
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,750
Would you care to accompany me?

105
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,541
The angel of death,
it's been too long.

106
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,250
The old dog and a new girl...

107
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,541
The two of us
make a perfect pair.

108
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,125
Angel of death?

109
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,291
Miss police girl, please bring
your nice new weapon with you.

110
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,833
Oh. Oh that...

111
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,916
Damn, that is so fucked up shit!

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,375
A country with
this much poverty,

113
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,875
and what does Miss bitch
spend her money on?

114
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,583
These fucking overpriced cigars.

115
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't you boys think
that's pretty fucked up?

116
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,250
Of course you
thinks it's fucked up!

117
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,416
Death's too good for her!
I'm gonna fuck that bitch,

118
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Shoot'er in'na head,
and then fuck her there!

119
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,750
They're getting
closer by the second!

120
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,708
So what do we do? Well? Anyone?

121
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,083
You've let them attack the nerve
center of this organization,

122
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,791
but now is not the
time to place blame.

123
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,250
We assume you have some
way to take care of this.

124
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,750
Of course, you do have
some kind of contingency plan?

125
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,000
Right?

126
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,541
Answer the man,
Integra Hellsing!

127
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,916
Relax gentlemen,
the real power of the

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,833
Hellsing organization
has yet to reveal itself.

129
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,833
Of course you're
speaking of the Vampires

130
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,541
whom you've trained
to kill their own kind?

131
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,625
Despite the fact that
you're true mission

132
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,250
is to kill them all.

133
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,625
This is no time
for you to be vague!

134
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,625
The ordeals of the first
masters of the Hellsing family

135
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,208
in the last century were
much harsher than this.

136
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:25,083
No matter how intelligent
or how strong they are,

137
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,125
they are still nothing
but vampire rubbish.

138
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,625
They will not destroy
the Hellsing family.

139
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,000
These monsters dare
to enter this house

140
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,041
built on blood and honor!

141
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:40,500
I will see all of them roasted
in the deepest pits of hell.

142
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,125
Damn! I don't believe I left
someone breathing on this floor!

143
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,041
Oh dear, I missed.

144
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,833
I suppose I'm not as
spry as I used to be.

145
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,666
Who the fuck are you old man?

146
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,666
Walter Dolnaise,
retainer of the Hellsing family.

147
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,250
And Hellsing organization
member, retired.

148
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,958
Shall we?

149
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,958
Boys, kill him!!

150
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:54,208
Too slow! You're far
too slow! Ghouls are fine,

151
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:58,416
but I have fought against
the true armies of the undead!

152
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,458
Don't push yourself,
Angel of Death.

153
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,291
It's about time!

154
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,583
Shit! Your fucked Gramps!

155
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,833
I most highly recommend
pissing yourself.

156
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:53,000
Followed by a course of
praying to your impotent God.

157
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,625
Oh yeah, yeah fuck yes!!

158
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,250
That's just what I want to hear!

159
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,458
I was getting so bored
of these easy kills, pops!

160
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,291
Ten hut!

161
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:28,208
Miss Victoria, please be a dear,
and lend some artillery back up.

162
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,666
Right!

163
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,708
For your next shot,

164
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,333
aim for the center
of the enemy battalion.

165
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:52,500
Use the incendiary shell
with VT bursting charge, 4 red.

166
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,541
Right!

167
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,291
There you are!

168
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,875
End of the line, Alfred!

169
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,166
Are you all right Walter?

170
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,500
Ouch! Ouch! That hurts!

171
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,916
A little out of practice,
but unscathed.

172
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,833
That was quite the
good tackle by the way.

173
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,708
Oh, well, I used
to be a cop you know.

174
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,791
You're not human neither.
God damn it!

175
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,958
Now, my boy, it's time
for some answers, all right?

176
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,208
Why did you try to
attack us so brazenly?

177
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,250
And who handed down the order?

178
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,750
You won't get shit from me, man!

179
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:50,125
You're late. I was
getting tired of waiting.

180
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,375
I do apologize.

181
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,958
I hope you find my company
was worth waiting for.

182
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,458
Because I've been waiting
for this for a long time.

183
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:04,000
My one on one with
the great Alucard!

184
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:08,333
It's time you found out,
just how good I am!

185
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,666
You're pretty fast!

186
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,708
Well of course I am!

187
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:17,291
I'm nothing like any
vampires you've fought before.

188
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,625
Because I am the vampire who's
going to put you in your grave.

189
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,875
Now why don't we
start on the other one?

190
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,875
May be...

191
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,250
Now you're going to tell
me who gave you your unlife

192
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,625
and who was responsible for the

193
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,500
freak chip implanted
inside your body?

194
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,458
Still think you can resist?

195
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:50,041
Your hapless little undead
army has been crushed.

196
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,125
You weren't trying to kill us,

197
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,791
instead you've turned all
of Hellsing into your Ghouls?

198
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,000
 Great plan, no?

199
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:26,000
No...please, not again...

200
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,541
I don't want to
kill my own people...

201
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,708
Didn't I tell you?

202
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,125
I'm not like anything
you've met before!

203
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,375
I mean really.

204
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,375
What can you possibly do
against someone like me?

205
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,333
I have all of your
vampiric powers.

206
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,916
Actually I have far more
power then even that!

207
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,625
Why don't you fucking
eat this, bitch!?

208
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,583
Everybody...they've
all become Ghouls...

209
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,708
Miss Victoria!

210
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,416
N...no!

211
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,958
What fun! I haven't had
a fight like this in ages!

212
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:40,041
I truly applaud your
skill as a grade A vampire!

213
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,250
It can't be...I shot him
in the head...It's a trick.

214
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:47,458
I mean immortal maybe,
but nobody is that immortal.

215
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,541
Releasing control
art restriction to

216
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:56,125
level three, level two,
Situation A release level one!

217
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,625
The Cromwell approval
is now in effect.

218
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,791
Hold releasedd until
the target is silenced.

219
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:08,125
Now, I'll show you how
real vampires do battle!

220
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,458
Wait a minute...what
are you doing?

221
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,666
Where do you
think you're going?!

222
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,875
Did I say you could leave?!

223
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,458
Oh dear.

224
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,166
Let me go...

225
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,291
Miss Victoria?

226
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,416
Please make it stop!
What the hell are you!?

227
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,000
Stop whining! All I did was
to cut off your stupid legs...

228
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,875
Summon your servant demons!
Transform yourself!

229
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,583
Regenerate your
legs and stand up!

230
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,583
Pick up your gun and
attack on me! Do something!

231
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:05,583
The night is still so young, and
the real fun has yet to start!

232
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,041
Come on!

233
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:14,833
Come on! Come on! Come
on! Come on!....

234
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,958
M...monster! Oh, God!
You're a monster!

235
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:27,500
I see...you're...you're just
like the rest...

236
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,750
Time for you to die,
little Hellsing!

237
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,625
Miss Seras Victoria!

238
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:56,708
You're just like the rest.
Nothing but a disappointment...

239
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,375
You are nothing but dog food.

240
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,708
God damn bitch.
You gave me a hard time.

241
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,458
Stop laughing.

242
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,541
Fucking mercury
ignition bullets.

243
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,250
Give me the name of your master.

244
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,083
I won't allow you
to die until you do.

245
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,625
It's Janny...

246
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:13,458
...Luke...

247
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,625
...with the weather report.

248
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,958
Didn't we lose?

249
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,291
We sure did.

250
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,416
Hey bro, what's that weird
thing eating your head?

251
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,708
Ahhh...

252
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,291
And you're on fire.
