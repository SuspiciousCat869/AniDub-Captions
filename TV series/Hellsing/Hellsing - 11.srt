1
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,791
Hurry

2
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:25,166
Bite my throat.
Drink my body dry.

3
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,208
Is that what you really want?

4
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,333
I want you to do it...

5
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,375
Why?

6
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,791
More...more!

7
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,375
Please just stop it! 

8
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,750
Why are you showing me this?

9
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,125
I know you want it.

10
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,583
What?

11
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,666
You and I are the same, Seras...

12
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,958
We're both the same.

13
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,791
No!!!

14
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,083
No...master...

15
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,250
Master!

16
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,833
A girl's dormitory in Cambridge
was attacked 38 hours ago.

17
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,458
Some of the victims
were drained of blood,

18
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,625
while others were just
horribly mutilated and killed.

19
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,666
The attacker's
decision was based upon

20
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,000
whether the girls had
a sexual history or not.

21
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,750
It seems the freaks are trying
to increase their power...

22
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,500
How many attackers?

23
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,041
We don't have
an official report yet,

24
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,333
but the witness accounts 

25
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,833
place the attackers
numbers at around 60 men.

26
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,333
The evidence is clear.

27
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:46,375
I'm afraid Parker's SAS unit
has been turned into freaks.

28
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,708
Instead of making them Ghouls, 

29
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,583
they changed the
entire unit into freaks...

30
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,916
I have a report stating that
the weaponry used at the recent

31
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,583
Trafalgar Square attack
matches the equipment

32
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,500
Parker's SAS people were using.

33
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,041
Because we're still
concerned about your health,

34
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,291
a round table conference

35
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,208
in Westminster is
being called without you.

36
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,125
They'll be discussing what
sort of steps are to be taken

37
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,416
in retaliation to this
attack on Great Britain.

38
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
There's no need for a

39
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,333
Round Table Conference
on this, Walter.

40
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:23,041
It seems that
Her Majesty has a plan.

41
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,625
Victoria.

42
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,208
Are you all right?

43
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,416
Yes Sir.

44
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,416
I'm here to tell you
your being transferred.

45
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,583
What?

46
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,791
Stand at attention
when receiving an order.

47
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,083
Sir!

48
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,125
I hereby discharge Seras
Victoria from her duties

49
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,250
in the Hellsing
First Action Unit.

50
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,416
I am reassigning you
to information retrieval.

51
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,958
But why...?!

52
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,541
We are in the process
of replacing almost

53
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,250
our entire membership
with new recruits.

54
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,958
Your presence affects the
morale of the new members.

55
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,125
I Understand.

56
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,500
Senior officer Victoria
accepts the assignment!

57
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,291
Victoria.

58
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,250
Yes.

59
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,750
Remember that even if you're
working in a different unit,

60
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,958
you're still an
officer of Hellsing.

61
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,708
Show some pride.

62
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,333
In other news, the Royal
family was apparently the

63
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,458
intended target in the recent
bombing of Trafalgar Square.

64
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,166
Buckingham Palace has
already been put on alert

65
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,166
and the Queens
annual Maundy ceremony,

66
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,416
set for tomorrow,
has been canceled. 

67
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,750
Scotland Yard is on the
lookout for a terrorist group

68
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,291
they believe is still somewhere
in the city of London.

69
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,916
A Royal Order...

70
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:06,041
Humans are so easily
manipulated. Don't you agree?

71
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,791
I've been wanting
to ask you something.

72
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,583
Go on.

73
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,125
Have you ever thought about
asking me to drink your blood?

74
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,375
Have you ever thought about
mixing your blood with mine?

75
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,000
About becoming
more than you are?

76
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,416
Why don't you just
read my thoughts?

77
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:39,166
I have. I just really
want to hear it from you.

78
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,750
You are strong for a human. 

79
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,000
But the enemy

80
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,000
we will be confronting
next is unlike any...

81
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,333
I've received orders
from Her Majesty.

82
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,583
As head of the Hellsing Family, 

83
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,041
it's the first time
I've been given this honor.

84
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,916
I remember your father
performing this same ceremony.

85
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,500
The timing is bad.
It's too much for you right now.

86
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,708
Which is why I have to attend.

87
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,625
I know. 

88
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,666
My contract hasn't
changed since your father.

89
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,708
I belong, as always,
to you and your family.

90
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,333
The ceremony is tomorrow.

91
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,583
Don't you want a taste of
my blood before you leave?

92
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,958
Representatives have been
meeting in Westminster today,

93
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,750
to discuss the emergency
measures put in place...

94
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,291
One moment...

95
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,333
Just in, we've received
news that the Queen

96
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,833
has left the palace
under heavy security.

97
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,666
The Maundy ceremony,
that was until now canceled,

98
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,333
will be taking place
at the Tower of London.

99
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,666
Not only is the choice
of venue highly unusual,

100
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,375
but is the decision
to have the ceremony under

101
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,375
this immediate terrorist
threat raises questions as well.

102
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,583
It is official then,

103
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,000
the Queen is preparing
to have the ceremony

104
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,416
in the Tower of London.

105
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,708
Press and spectators are
prohibited from attending.

106
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,750
Please Sir Integra, you
really should be resting.

107
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,958
Well, should I call the car

108
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,541
and have them take
you to The Tower?

109
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:07,041
Actually, I wasn't planning
on leaving the house, Walter.

110
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,125
The Hellsing family
is an ordained order.

111
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,333
After consulting
with the Queen,

112
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,041
she agreed that it
would be appropriate

113
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,916
to hold the ceremony here.

114
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Does that suit you?

115
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,500
Then, Her Majesty is
on her way here right now?

116
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,083
Hello? This is
Seras Victoria remember?

117
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,791
I've visited you before.

118
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:59,375
Um... I'm not here
on business, I'm...

119
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,833
I need to talk to
someone...Helena...

120
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,875
Helena...?

121
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,166
Helena.

122
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,666
Who's there?

123
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,333
Sir Integra.

124
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,708
Yes Ferguson?

125
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,541
There's something happening
at the Tower of London.

126
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,458
What's wrong?

127
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't have the details yet,

128
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,333
but we've received
a report from an agent.

129
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,041
They're under a freak attack.

130
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,166
Looks like the greedy
little bastards took the bait.

131
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,833
The tower is the
bloody resting place

132
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,875
for many threats to the crown.

133
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,000
Go and spill vampire blood
in the name of Henry the Sixth.

134
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,041
And the security here?

135
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,750
The Secret Service
will handle it.

136
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,375
Our enemy is a trained
division of SAS troops.

137
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,750
Use all available personnel,
I'm leaving you in charge.

138
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,583
May God and Her Majesty
be with you. Amen.

139
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,500
Amen.

140
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,666
Where is Helena?

141
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,041
Your blood is
of Alucard's blood.

142
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,083
Still, you are powerless...

143
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,958
How could you?

144
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,458
I will chew the
meat from your bones.

145
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,625
Go! Go! Go!

146
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,708
You damn monster!

147
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,208
Do you feel regret
for not drinking blood

148
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,166
and becoming stronger?

149
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,583
Never, you filth!

150
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,666
Do you wish you
had stayed mortal?

151
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,875
Is your only regret
that you allowed Alucard's

152
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,916
filthy blood into your body?

153
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,125
Huh?

154
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,750
What?

155
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,458
Helena...

156
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:57,916
Helena!

157
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,666
Stop it!

158
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,083
Helena.

159
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,750
Here in this
holy place of Heledon.

160
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,083
As a Royal Arch of Enoch,

161
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,583
I offer prayer for our country.

162
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,458
Stop it!

163
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:18,125
Total destruction. I
live for nothing else.

164
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,916
Seras...

165
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,958
Helena...

166
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,458
Please don't cry Seras...

167
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,166
Helena.

168
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,791
Even with we supposed
immortal creatures,

169
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,666
when our bodies and
souls are torn asunder,

170
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,416
then our essences are freed

171
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,416
and allowed to
wonder the heavens.

172
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:07,208
Be a loyal and worthy companion
to your master Alucard.

173
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:11,083
Destroy the creature
from the dark continent.

174
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes.

175
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,000
He is like Alucard,

176
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:20,250
in that he is also being
kept by human masters.

177
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,416
His actions are
serving human desires.

178
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,500
You have to hurry!

179
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:36,375
Your compatriots are walking
into a most clever trap.

180
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,166
Please leave me.

181
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,208
My body will soon be gone.

182
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,458
As we speak, armed police are 

183
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,291
forcing their way into
the Tower of London.

184
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,500
For now we can only guess
at what has happened inside.

185
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,291
Very disturbing...Pickman!

186
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,083
The targets are not Ghouls.

187
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,666
The targets are freaks. 

188
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,875
You'll note that
they're wearing SAS gear.

189
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,583
Even so, they're still vampires.

190
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,125
Make sure your men know to shoot

191
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,208
for the head and chest.

192
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:47,125
I've never expected to end
up fighting the SAS, Sir.

193
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,583
Especially in the
middle of the Tower...

194
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:55,416
Remember lad.... both God...
and Her Majesty is with us.

195
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,291
Amen.

196
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,708
Everybody, do you copy?!
It's a trap!

197
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,250
There has been an explosion
at the Tower of London!

198
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,916
We still don't know
what is going on inside.

199
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,958
One of England's
time honored ceremonies

200
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,041
has been halted with
an act of violence.

201
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,125
What motivated this
brash act of terrorism?

202
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,583
From the street
we can hear the sound

203
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,458
of heavy gunfire
coming from inside,

204
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,833
and plums of smoke can be
seen from all over London.

205
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,625
What's going on down there?
Explain yourself!

206
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,416
We're supposed to work secretly?

207
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,333
What are you doing?

208
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,208
Then what is the situation?!

209
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,875
We're traitors staging
an attack on Her Majesty...

210
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,375
Alucard!?

211
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,166
Your Queen will not be coming.

212
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,750
What did you say?
What are you doing?

213
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,666
Your going to
have to keep yourself

214
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,500
out of trouble for awhile.

215
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,833
I'm going out to
have a bit of fun.

216
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,000
Alucard!

217
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,583
Sir Integra!

218
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,333
We've just received word on the 

219
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,666
terrorist group
attacking the Tower.

220
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,333
These are private
soldiers in the employ

221
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,458
of the Hellsing Organization.

222
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,375
Idiots...this cannot
be happening!

223
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,291
Ready, Commander Ferguson!

224
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,291
Victoria, aim to the right!

225
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,833
Right!

226
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,166
Aim to the left!

227
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,541
Yes!

228
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,833
Aim to the top!

229
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,625
That's awful, no one's
going to get that!

230
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,083
Oh, forget it.
