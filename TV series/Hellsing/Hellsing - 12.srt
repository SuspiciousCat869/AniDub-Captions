1
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,833
This is the squad 3!

2
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,000
The enemy has us surrounded
inside the Tower!

3
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,625
We are requesting back up!

4
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,500
We need back--

5
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,291
Everybody, do you copy?!
It's a trap!

6
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,166
There has been an explosion
at the Tower of London!

7
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,875
We still don't know
what's going on inside.

8
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,875
One of England's
time honored ceremonies

9
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,208
has been halted with
an act of violence.

10
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,166
Alucard!?

11
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,625
Your Queen will not be coming.

12
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,125
What did you say?

13
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,541
From the street we
can hear the sound of

14
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,916
heavy gunfire
coming from inside.

15
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,916
Montelbon!

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,250
Head round and back
up Gamble's unit!

17
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,708
Montelbon!

18
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,583
Damn...

19
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,833
What is...

20
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,208
What's going on?

21
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,291
The British army can
hardly overlook a large,

22
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,625
fully armed, military unit
attacking a national monument

23
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,583
while the Queen's
flag is raised.

24
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,291
Nor can they
confirm the existence

25
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,291
of a demonically possessed cult,

26
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,666
or a state sponsored
demon hunting organization

27
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,416
with vampires on the payroll.

28
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,958
Therefor the army
has been authorized

29
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,541
to rescue Her
Majesty at any cost.

30
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,416
But we all know that the
Queen isn't even there!

31
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,250
Why hasn't the
Round Table stopped them?

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,458
The Round Table Conference
gave the order to attack.

33
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,083
There's a Judas in our mists...

34
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,666
We've just received word on the

35
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,916
Terrorist group
attacking the Tower.

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,125
These are private soldiers

37
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,875
in the employ of the
Hellsing Organization.

38
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:55,416
Idiots...this cannot
be happening!

39
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,625
Pardon me!

40
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,083
Excuse me!

41
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,125
My god...

42
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,625
This is Pickman.

43
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,000
We're heading
towards Beacham Tower.

44
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,833
What's the situation outside?

45
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,416
Portnoy, are you...?

46
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,375
Blast!

47
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,083
Damn.

48
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,166
Alucard?

49
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,166
Sorry I'm running a bit late.

50
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,750
I abhor tardiness.

51
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,458
Amen.

52
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,791
After loosing so many men,
I'd better be victorious

53
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,541
Spoken like a true
soldier of Hellsing.

54
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:33,125
The British army has gathered
outside The Tower of London.

55
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,166
I am Sir Integra
Wingates Hellsing!

56
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,375
How dare you make threats?

57
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,333
Not only do they threaten
my men at the Tower of London,

58
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,958
but they dare to try and
rob my family of its honor...

59
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,166
Sir Integra...

60
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,708
Get me Ferguson.

61
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,291
Stop!

62
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,500
Let me go!

63
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,375
Commander!

64
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,500
Don't come near.

65
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,375
Please, you can't...

66
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,333
What's going on?

67
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,041
Please listen to me Sir Integra.

68
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,750
You can't do this,
your not well.

69
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,583
It's all falling apart...

70
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,000
I will not under any
circumstances allow

71
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,875
the Hellsing Organization
mission to be impeded.

72
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,125
Even if you are
British military soldiers...

73
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,375
No!

74
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,041
Stand down your men...

75
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,791
Ferguson! No!

76
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,375
Peter...

77
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,375
Move.

78
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,708
I wish I could have done this
for you before you died...

79
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,916
In the name of God impure souls

80
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,208
of the living dead will be
banished to eternal damnation!

81
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,083
Amen.

82
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,375
Amen.

83
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,833
Halt! Traitor!

84
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,416
The London police have
released the identity

85
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,625
of one of the terrorist leaders

86
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,875
just shot dead
outside the tower.

87
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,125
Former Army Captain Peter
Ferguson, Three times decorated,

88
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,791
was honorably discharged from
the military after the Gulf war.

89
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,791
Since that time it appears
he has been privately

90
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,000
employed by the Hellsing family.

91
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,500
Burn in hell, bastard.

92
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,583
Sir Integra...

93
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,291
Whatever your order,

94
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,750
I, Walter Dolnaise,
will protect you

95
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,500
even if it costs me my life.

96
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,166
We will not surrender.

97
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:38,000
But for now,
we will not resist either.

98
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:43,041
Our forces are not lost,
there is still hope.

99
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,750
Go to hell, Bat freak!

100
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,375
You filthy demons!

101
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,666
Eat Hallconnen, bitch!

102
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,958
The situation at the Tower of
London is still on the brink!

103
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,083
A short time ago,
armed units entered the tower

104
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,041
in a daring attempt
to rescue the Queen,

105
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,333
and stop the terrorists!

106
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,250
Enjoy it, Police girl.

107
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,791
Revel in the massacre!

108
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,916
What does not kill
you makes you strong.

109
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,833
Master!

110
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,666
Alucard.

111
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,500
There's a bullet
in your stomach.

112
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,208
Please...

113
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:17,291
I want to be human...for
Hellsing...Let me...

114
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,416
Incognito!

115
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,500
How much longer must I play
with your pathetic Golems?

116
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:02,208
He said that I would learn.
Learn to enjoy this...

117
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,333
But I'll always hate it!

118
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,708
Damn it...

119
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,666
Let me go you bastard!

120
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,458
You're a servant like me.
Why do you fight who you are?

121
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:44,416
I am, true undead!
Alucard gave his blood to me!

122
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,875
Until you drink blood
of your own free will,

123
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,666
you're just a
servant to your master.

124
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,875
You're not much
better than a Ghoul.

125
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,291
Let go!

126
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,083
The Human body
and the human heart.

127
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,083
No matter how much
you wish otherwise,

128
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,666
you're not human anymore.

129
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,000
Why not try and discover your
new identity? Maybe with me?!

130
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,250
Get off!

131
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,791
We have brought with us a
message from Her Majesty.

132
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,041
Go ahead.

133
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,916
These are times
that test the heart,

134
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,041
Sir Integral Wingates Hellsing.

135
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,250
The Royal Family shall
not forget the contributions

136
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,666
of the Hellsing Organization
over this century.

137
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,041
Please stand strong
through this fierce night.

138
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,208
And take solace that at sunrise,

139
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,416
and your Judas
shall be punished.

140
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,625
Remember that Her Majesty's
prayers, are with you.

141
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,833
Stand strong through this...

142
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,250
It seems we've been abandoned.

143
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:39,500
Now then, let us begin.
He who is nobody, Incognito!

144
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,000
Alucard...

145
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:05,541
Control art restriction
system, release to level 2.

146
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,583
Situation B!
Keeping power restriction

147
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:13,041
unlocked until the target
has been eternally silenced.

148
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:30,000
You look very beautiful
right now Seras Victoria!

149
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,041
You are so my type!

150
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:40,041
My God, you're much more
beautiful when you're angry.

151
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,708
Well that's an improvement.

152
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,166
You can't admit how you
feel until you've been beaten.

153
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,291
That's all right.
I like it that way.

154
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,125
I would advise you to desist.

155
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,208
It's been a while since
I flew one of these,

156
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,333
so please forgive
me if I'm a bit slow.

157
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,958
Hurry up Walter!

158
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,000
Sorry, order received Ma'am.

159
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:39,416
Shoot more! Shoot more Alucard!

160
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,625
Yes! At last, an opponent
that's worthy of my power!

161
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,458
I just don't like
the look in your eye....

162
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,000
Please try again
in your next life!

163
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,333
Go to hell!

164
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,083
While you're on
your way to hell,

165
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:19,500
I want you to beg forgiveness
from the men you've killed.

166
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,416
Before I kill
you I need to know,

167
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,333
since we are both
serving human Masters...

168
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,541
Who is your Master Incognito?

169
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,375
Give me the name of
the one who would make

170
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,666
cheap copies of us
with their filthy bugs...

171
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,458
You just don't
know when to quit...

172
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,000
You've run out of your
puny man-made bullets,

173
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,166
blessed with the
power of your puny God.

174
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,125
Clever bastard...

175
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,208
Master!

176
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,250
Police girl!

177
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,708
Master! Quickly!

178
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,958
Run away! Now!

179
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,416
It has just been confirmed

180
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,416
that the Royal Family
is out of harms way.

181
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
London's own special armed
units have been called in

182
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,000
and are now
infiltrating the Tower

183
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,750
and are attempting to
quell the violence inside.

184
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
In our next
episode of Hellsing...

185
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,458
We finally got peace and
quiet to our fair London town.

186
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,708
Our final episode, "Hellfire!"

187
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,166
Do-dodo-do! Da-dada-da!

188
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,000
Swing it baby!
