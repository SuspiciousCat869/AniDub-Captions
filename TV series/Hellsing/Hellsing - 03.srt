1
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:16,166
I'm sorry Mick. I know it hurts.

2
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,375
It threatens to
engulf me as well.

3
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:28,791
But from now on,
we can share it together.

4
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,583
Forever.

5
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,041
Oh my God...

6
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,208
Lord, Please give guidance
to this poor lost soul.

7
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:47,416
All I wanted, was for us
to always be together...

8
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,958
The Paris bound Euro-star train

9
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,750
will be leaving fifteen
minutes behind schedule.

10
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,416
Thank you for using Euro-star.

11
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:19,166
I'm sorry. Welcome
to London, Father.

12
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,291
Go with god my child.

13
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,000
Our subject is a
20 year old male.

14
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,750
Time of death is
approximately 72 hours ago.

15
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:48,958
However, the subject has been
mobile up until 12 hours ago.

16
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,291
I don't see any real
cell deterioration yet.

17
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,666
I'm making the first incision.

18
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,041
He was the son of
a noble Italian family

19
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,083
attending a local university.

20
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,916
We have to keep
this autopsy quiet.

21
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,416
You'd think his family would've
been instilled some discipline.

22
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,791
"Gentlemen don't drink
other people's blood.

23
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,000
Such behavior is
reserved for peasants."

24
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,958
Let's take a look shall we...

25
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,083
Right.

26
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:48,083
We've got one. The chip
is not functioning, though.

27
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,166
These chips are
becoming a problem.

28
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,541
Is it possible that this recent
increase in vampire activity

29
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,166
is part of some
larger unseen plan?

30
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,416
It still doesn't change the
Hellsing Organization's mission.

31
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,166
Search and destroy.

32
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,458
By the way lieutenant,

33
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,291
may I assume that you will look
into the boys known associates,

34
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,875
and his whereabouts
before the incident?

35
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,583
We've already begun
our investigation.

36
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,875
Right, stitch up the incisions.

37
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,416
Sir, isn't the protocol to
burn all our NHB remains.

38
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,833
This one doesn't belong to us.

39
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,250
He's a foreigner.

40
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,916
Someone from Rome will be
picking up his body later.

41
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,208
We pulled the bug.

42
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,541
He won't be a problem.

43
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,166
Yes sir.

44
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:56,333
God I'm tired. Dead, truly dead.

45
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,958
What do you think
you're doing police girl?

46
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,416
I'm sorry. But...

47
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
How many times
do I have to tell you?

48
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,166
If you don't drink,
you will become weak.

49
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,041
Your physical strength
should be far beyond

50
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,583
that of any normal
human being...

51
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,125
But just look at yourself.

52
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,166
I know that
I need it, it's just...

53
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,416
I hear your voice in
my head, it's not right.

54
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,666
I feel like I'm changing
into something so inhuman...

55
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
Master?

56
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,708
Hi!

57
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,333
God be with you child.

58
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,750
Humans creating vampires.

59
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,041
What do you think that says

60
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,708
about the world
we've created, Alucard?

61
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,166
I think it says that history is
full of man's cheap imitations.

62
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,125
Perhaps that's just your
true vampiric pride talking.

63
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,750
Tell me, what in essence
is the difference between

64
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,041
the true vampires we've
fought for centuries,

65
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,791
and these chipped
human creatures?

66
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,083
I know you're nothing
like those creatures.

67
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,458
It was uncalled for.

68
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,166
Then why did you
feel the need to say it?

69
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,750
You humans are incomprehensible.

70
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,458
You and the police girl.

71
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,791
Yes. I understand. Send them in.

72
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,083
Come in.

73
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:06,333
Mick. I just wanted
to be with you forever.

74
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:11,583
I know you understood,
Mick. Didn't you?

75
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,458
Answer me Mick. Please.

76
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:19,166
I can't see you. Where are you?

77
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,541
Mick, where did you go?

78
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,166
Stop!

79
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,458
Damn the Vatican and
their Section Thirteen bureau,

80
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,708
and damn the
Iscariot organization!

81
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,750
So far the London Police
have kept him in the basement.

82
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,458
But it's only a
matter of time before

83
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,666
the dead police become
ghouls and overpower them.

84
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,125
Even without the chip,

85
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,958
once they've been tainted
they will never human again.

86
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,083
I'm surrounded by idiots!

87
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,125
Hellsing Company A reporting.

88
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,833
We've prepped C-3 and are
now leaving for the crime scene.

89
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,375
May God and Her Majesty
be with you. Amen.

90
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,083
Amen.

91
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,000
GO! GO! GO!

92
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,916
Send over Alucard as well.

93
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,833
But this mission
hardly rates one vampire.

94
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,250
I will not repeat myself Walter!

95
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,208
Understood?

96
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,041
Yes.

97
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,875
This is a Protestant country.

98
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,041
I will not allow the
Vatican to run rampant.

99
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,125
Mick! Where are you?

100
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Victoria.

101
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,125
Yes sir.

102
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,041
I want you to hold
your position here.

103
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,125
P7, going in!

104
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,750
I can do this...

105
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,458
What's going on? Norton!

106
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,208
My god...

107
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,166
Mick!

108
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,000
Mick!

109
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,208
I hate that sound.

110
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,583
P7... they're all dead...

111
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,250
Captain Gareth.

112
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,000
What's it doing?

113
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,166
He's calling out
someone's name...

114
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,375
sounds like Mick...

115
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,000
Mick's body has
already been cremated.

116
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,166
When you fire,
make sure you only aim

117
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,708
for the heart or the head!

118
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,875
Master!

119
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,708
Those men inside that hospital
did not choose to become Ghouls.

120
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,291
And once they've been tainted,

121
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,541
There is no way for them
to ever be normal again.

122
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,958
The best that you have left
to offer them is a quick death.

123
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,375
Don't hesitate!

124
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,750
Yes sir, master.

125
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,083
Mick!

126
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:59,666
Your lover is not in
this world anymore.

127
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:05,166
It just... That didn't
happen...Captain Gareth!

128
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,916
Even with your
little humans friends,

129
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,958
you're still a
corrupted inhuman monster.

130
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,416
Poor Enrico Stivaletti's
soul is lost,

131
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,333
but his mortal remains
will at last find peace

132
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,750
at the hands of
this most sacred blade.

133
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,083
I shall now place
one more soul to rest.

134
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,833
Bastard...

135
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,666
I am the instrument of god.

136
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,041
Messenger of the divine
punishment of Heaven.

137
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,291
What?

138
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,208
You shouldn't have
come here, Catholic.

139
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,041
M-master...

140
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,458
Don't try to talk police girl.
Your body is weak.

141
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,791
Well now.

142
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,750
You must be the Hellsing
family's pet abomination.

143
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:30,291
You're from Iscariot. I see...

144
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,916
Iscariot was
ridding the world of

145
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,375
sacrilegious monsters
such as yourself

146
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,708
centuries before the
Hellsing family ever existed.

147
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,875
You defile this place.

148
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,500
I purify this house
so filthy creatures

149
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:59,083
can't use their
cheap black magic.

150
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,166
Our mission is to
punish any heretic

151
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
who would deny the word of God.

152
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,958
We will crush your unholy body,

153
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:11,041
and salt the earth
with your dust. Amen.

154
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,125
It's time somebody put
you in your place, human!

155
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,541
You've put a blessing on
that blade, haven't you.

156
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,750
This bullet was for a vampire,

157
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,916
But it'll do to send
you to hell father.

158
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,125
Master...

159
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,875
Weird little toy of
his actually hurt.

160
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:16,958
That sort of weapon can be
a real problem, even for us...

161
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:41,250
A Regenerator.
A human Regenerator...

162
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,625
I take an eye for an eye!

163
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,291
This Technology,
God's divine gift.

164
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:50,250
The lord gives us tools to
fight inhuman demons like you.

165
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,166
You're less than
inhuman, a pitiful defect,

166
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,958
a failed science project.

167
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,583
Sending you back to your
maker would be an act of mercy.

168
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,625
Your regeneration
power is very impressive,

169
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,166
But I bet if I put enough
bullets into your skull,

170
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,125
you'll stay down for good.

171
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,416
So let's cut to the chase.
Start begging.

172
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,125
Empty threats of
a coward vampire,

173
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,666
who hides behind
the weapons of man!

174
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,375
That's enough,
Paladin Alexander Anderson!

175
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,916
You don't have the
authority to command

176
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,791
one who's a true servant of God.

177
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,083
I said, "That's enough"!

178
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,458
Now Enrico Stivaletti
has been silenced.

179
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,250
Your mission in our
country has come to an end.

180
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,041
Your business
has been concluded.

181
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,666
Well, that's funny, I thought my
business was killing vampires.

182
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,208
You've already
exceeded your authority.

183
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,833
And you will suffer
the consequences

184
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,958
of your actions today.

185
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,333
New orders from the Archbishop.

186
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,541
The Archbishop has ordered you

187
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,250
to return to
Vatican immediately.

188
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,916
You will leave by the good
graces of Her Majesty.

189
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,250
I look forward to
the next time we meet,

190
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:36,875
Sir Integra Wingates Hellsing.

191
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,625
There's no room in the
Hellsing family for a vampire

192
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,208
that gets pummeled by
a Regenerator, Alucard.

193
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,333
Nor do we need a
half-starved vampire.

194
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,708
who can't protect
her own commander.

195
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,875
Understood?

196
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,791
I'm sorry sir.

197
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,625
Master...Alucard...

198
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,958
Police girl, you
must drink my blood.

199
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,041
Drink my blood,
Only then will you be free

200
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,833
of your servitude to me.

201
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:56,500
Once you are free, you will
be ready to become true family.

202
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,625
You won't,
be my master anymore...

203
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:04,333
No I won't. But you will
become a master of the undead.

204
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,875
You will drink blood and
walk the night by your own will.

205
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,666
Now drink my blood,
Seras Victoria.

206
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,250
So this is what you
choose police girl?

207
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:42,333
I don't know. I'm not ready.

208
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:46,916
Although, right now...I
know, I'm just...

209
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,458
There once was a
priest with a blade...

210
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,666
That's not a preview!
We just saw that guy!

211
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,541
He did weird things to
men and then stopped only

212
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,625
when in the parasite
palace he prayed.

213
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,916
Oooh! I like that place!

214
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,583
Really?
