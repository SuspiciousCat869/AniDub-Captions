1
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,041
I'm sorry.

2
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,083
If only I had gotten there
just a little sooner...

3
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,833
You must pay close attention.

4
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,958
Watch how Integra
fares in battle.

5
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,416
Battle?

6
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,000
Integra tore
through her own throat.

7
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,250
She shed her own blood
and chose to fight for her life.

8
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,541
Giving in is what kills people.

9
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,250
When you refuse to
surrender with all your heart,

10
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,791
only then do you
transcend your humanity.

11
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,916
Even in the face of
death, never give up.

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,291
That is the strength
of our Master.

13
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,958
Master...

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,083
Blood pressure?

15
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,583
Steady at 100.

16
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,833
Right, let's get started then.

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,416
Scalpel.

18
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,958
Scalpel.

19
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,916
Yes sir.

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,583
Intelligence reports
that Boobhan castle

21
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,750
has been destroyed.

22
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,708
However, Sir Islands...

23
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,000
We...No Sir. We still
have not heard from any of the

24
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:34,833
66 members of the
SAS 211th division.

25
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,500
Hemostat.

26
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,916
All right, we're in.

27
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,916
Excellent. Beginning
arterial anastomosis.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,083
Tweezer.

29
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,708
Tweezer.

30
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,500
Oh god, I'm running late.

31
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,041
Morning Father.

32
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,666
You're five minutes
late, Integra.

33
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,875
Well, why don't we
start today's lesson.

34
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,041
Ready?

35
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,708
Yes, Sir.

36
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,750
Now Integra,

37
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,791
what creature is
dreaded above all others?

38
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,000
It's the Vampire.

39
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,375
Correct.

40
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:45,791
And just why is the
vampire so fearsome?

41
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,750
Once the sun has risen,

42
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,416
they may only find rest
in a small, dark coffin.

43
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,833
Nevertheless, vampires are
considered nearly unbeatable.

44
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,166
Now why is that?

45
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,916
They feed on human
blood. Create ghouls,

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,333
and increase their
brood without limit.

47
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,750
An absolutely
terrifying creature,

48
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,291
yet it's not totally unbeatable.

49
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,916
Um, they won't die
unless you stab them

50
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,833
with a wooden stake?

51
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,375
Do not be fooled by old stories.

52
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,708
Their defeat does not
lie in such simple tricks.

53
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,666
Is their power truly that great?

54
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,125
Yes, they have
powers that let them

55
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,791
tear through men like rags.

56
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,833
They are cunning and smart,

57
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,958
and operate with their own
unknowable inhuman logic.

58
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,583
That is the vampire.

59
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,166
Do you understand Integra?

60
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,541
The vampire is an intelligent,
blood drinking demon.

61
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,000
The task appointed to our
family is to protect the Queen,

62
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,041
Great Britain and
the Church of England

63
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,041
from machinations of
these fearful creatures.

64
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,500
We are called upon
to be a holy shield and,

65
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,083
sometimes, a righteous sword.

66
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,958
We have inherited this honor
from the many noble knights

67
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,541
and secret sects
that have preceded us,

68
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,791
and we gladly accept
this sacred office.

69
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,541
I understand.

70
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,000
My hour has come, Integra.

71
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:38,208
My will is that you and you
alone will lead the family.

72
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,708
I call upon you to be the
next head of our sacred order.

73
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,833
Father...

74
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:51,083
Richard, my brother, be a guide
and support to my daughter.

75
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,375
Of course, brother.

76
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,125
Integra, there is so much I want

77
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,750
to tell you if only
I had more time...

78
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,125
The honorable blood

79
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:08,166
of the Hellsing family
flows through you.

80
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,458
Yes.

81
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:15,916
Remember, Integra, be glorious.

82
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,000
Blood pressure
has dropped to 75.

83
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,291
All right.

84
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,708
Lets deal with the blood flow.

85
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,208
Suction.

86
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,833
Father...

87
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,000
Master of my master...

88
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,666
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard!

89
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,125
It's unprecedented Sir,
but this plan already has

90
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,000
the Queen's personal approval.

91
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,333
God Damn it!

92
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,083
There's only three days left

93
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,375
until the succession ceremony.

94
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,541
I have waited 20 years
for my brothers' demise.

95
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,000
I will not have the
organization stolen

96
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,416
from me by that brat!

97
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,000
So why haven't you
found Integra yet?

98
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,333
Do you realize
Walter will return

99
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,875
from South America tomorrow?

100
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,458
Do you realize how difficult
his presence will make this?

101
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,666
But we've checked the
building top to bottom, Sir.

102
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,916
No more excuses.

103
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,166
I want this to end tonight!

104
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,083
The sub levels have
yet to be searched, Sir.

105
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,791
But those sub levels
have already been

106
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,666
sealed off for well
over 20 years, Sir.

107
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,625
In my opinion, she's already
made good her escape.

108
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,041
The sub levels...

109
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,916
Black arts room,
eugenics laboratory,

110
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,833
interrogation room,
autopsy theater, dungeon...

111
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,541
I can think of no
more fitting a place

112
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,750
for trapping filthy vermin.

113
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,875
The brat is hiding
somewhere in the sub levels.

114
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,958
Kill her on sight.
We can forge our excuses later.

115
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,625
Now go!

116
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,333
It's only been three
days since father died...

117
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:09,208
Bastard! Do you have
any human soul left in you?

118
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,875
If you should ever be
confronted with a true crisis,

119
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,166
where all hope is lost...

120
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,750
Make your way to the
forgotten underground prison.

121
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:26,625
There, in one of the cells,
lies your protection.

122
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,375
There you will
find the consummation

123
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,958
of our Hellsing family's
greatest achievement.

124
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,708
You've given us
quite a chase, Integra!

125
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,791
I'm sure you don't really need

126
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,375
to hear the full
explanation for this.

127
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,000
But for the future of
my country, my church,

128
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,041
my Queen, and
my sacred Hellsing family...

129
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,208
...you will die.

130
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,166
Uncle...what kind
of man are you?

131
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,500
Can't you understand?

132
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,958
My father entrusted
Hellsing's future to me

133
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,458
because he feared you
would be reduced to this?

134
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,833
You...damn brat!

135
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,291
Do you think I won't be willing

136
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:13,250
to shoot a little girl,
well, do you Integra?

137
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,916
After all, both of
us are Hellsing's...

138
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,750
I know you don't
want to die tonight.

139
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,541
Stitching up the wound.

140
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,291
We'll just have to wait and see.

141
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,583
Walter?

142
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,041
Miss Victoria, I wish
to apologize for last night.

143
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,458
Despite the dark magic,
it was unconscionable.

144
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,041
I hope you can forgive me.

145
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,000
Please, there's no
need to go on like that.

146
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,666
I'm all right.

147
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,083
But, what's this?

148
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,875
Sir Integra will
want her afternoon tea.

149
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,958
Today's blend comes from
Ceylon and is quite exquisite.

150
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,833
But Sir Integra is...

151
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:57,500
It's been said, that General
Patton would stand alone,

152
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,458
braving the worst of blizzards

153
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:03,166
while watching his
soldiers on the march.

154
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,083
Patton's army was also reputed

155
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,625
to have nearly
unnatural stamina.

156
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,041
Do I make myself
clear, Miss Victoria?

157
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,583
A commander with
an indomitable spirit

158
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,541
can make a soldiers heart...

159
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,666
...burn like fire.

160
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,375
What is that?

161
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:50,166
Well, we seem to
have a guest. Excellent!

162
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,791
It's only proper for
you to have an escort

163
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,000
to take you to see your father.

164
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,708
What's that?

165
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,458
It moved!

166
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,375
Mr. Hellsing, what is that?

167
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,625
I don't know!
There is no record of this!

168
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,916
My brother never mentioned it!

169
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,791
A Vampire!

170
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,333
Is this how you protect me?

171
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,333
Shoot him! Kill him!

172
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,833
Send him back to hell!

173
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,208
My God!

174
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,958
Father, what were you
trying to accomplish?

175
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,416
You are the one who
has disturbed my rest.

176
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,166
Don't come any
closer to me! Monster!

177
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,250
Your sweet blood was the first

178
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:34,750
I've tasted in
over 20 silent years.

179
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,958
Those souls who suffer
their righteousness

180
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:52,208
will know their
eternal inheritance.

181
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,250
Vile demon!

182
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,125
I am the Lord and Master
of the Hellsing family!

183
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,166
Integral Wingates Hellsing!

184
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,333
I would die before allowing
a vampire to order me!

185
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,208
That gun is useless against me.

186
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,791
Give up little girl,
and listen...

187
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,791
Shut up! I'll never give up!

188
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,125
I'll die before giving up!

189
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,625
That is my duty and pride as the

190
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,791
leader of the
Hellsing organization!

191
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,833
Wonderful! Just wonderful!

192
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,541
You make my blood boil!

193
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,291
You are your father's daughter!

194
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:42,083
Forgive my
impertinence Sir Hellsing.

195
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,583
Your orders, my master?

196
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,708
Ridiculous!

197
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,750
The brat and the beast! Damn it!

198
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,875
I am the leader of
Hellsing! Hellsing is mine!

199
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,000
Your blood rots.

200
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,666
You are not the
master of this house.

201
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,583
But I...

202
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,625
What's your name?

203
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,875
Alucard.

204
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,958
That is the name
my last master used.

205
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,833
I was such a child back then.

206
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:38,291
You will always be
that same little girl to me.

207
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,958
Thank you.

208
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,250
Do you know who
I am, Sir Integra?

209
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,666
Doctor Trevelain...

210
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,958
You're going to be just fine.

211
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,916
Al...uca...rd!

212
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,875
Tada! Next, on a very
special episode of Hellsing...

213
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,916
I'll trade you tissue paper
for an episode preview.

214
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,583
What are you
talking about, Walter?

215
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,416
Here's your tissue.

216
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,416
That's not much tissue.

217
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,333
Not much of a preview.

218
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,000
Ugh...
