1
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,208
You just don't
know when to quit...

2
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,583
You've run out of your
puny man-made bullets,

3
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,666
blessed with the
power of your puny God.

4
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,875
Clever bastard...

5
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,583
Master!

6
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,041
Police girl.

7
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,875
Master! Quickly!

8
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,291
Run away! Now!

9
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,250
Not like this.

10
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,000
I can reach it...

11
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,375
Please not like this...

12
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,708
This cursed tower
cries out in hunger,

13
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,208
eager to consume your blood.

14
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,916
This tower is an
old and decrepit ruin,

15
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,625
it suits you perfectly.

16
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,791
Master...

17
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,833
I'll send you to the
deepest pits of hell!

18
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,833
And while you're there

19
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,833
you can lick the
devil's ass, Incognito!

20
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,083
How does it feel Alucard,

21
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:23,208
to have a taste of your
own blessed silver bullets.

22
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,291
Master!!!

23
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,541
Go faster.

24
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,708
I promise we'll be
there soon, Sir Integra.

25
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,333
Attention Hellsing Organization!

26
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,458
Turn around immediately

27
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,875
and follow our instructions!
Do not...

28
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,875
I wish we had
equipped the helicopter

29
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,666
with sidewinder missiles.

30
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,583
We'll talk about it at
the next budget meeting.

31
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,750
Master...

32
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:29,166
Police girl...I
am your master...

33
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,083
you should have listened to me.

34
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,416
Seras...

35
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,958
Don't do that...

36
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:56,958
Alucard, my master...

37
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,666
Even if you lick every last drop
of your master off the tower,

38
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,125
you will never be able
to become a true Nosferatu.

39
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,583
You bastard!

40
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:22,083
You're loosing a lot of blood,
and soon you will run out.

41
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,875
You're already dead and there's

42
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,083
nothing for you to
be afraid of anymore.

43
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:32,833
Run from this place,
Seras Victoria!

44
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,666
That's enough Walter.

45
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,333
I don't want to
risk losing you next.

46
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,083
Orders given by the Hellsing
Organization must be executed

47
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:51,083
even at the cost of our
own lives, Sir Integra.

48
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,291
Please try and
endure the situation

49
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,500
for just a while longer.

50
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,791
Walter...

51
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,041
Walter!

52
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:05,375
Roan Veldai Shukuku
Nebreften Zarzas Zarzas Nerzas!

53
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,541
Oh, it's you.

54
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,583
Agun Dem Dortem Wieden Lar!

55
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,791
What are you trying to conjure?

56
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,333
Are you trying to summon
something from hell?

57
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,291
Rott Gar! Sett!

58
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,541
My God, it's Sett...

59
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,083
You're not really
bringing that demon here?

60
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,625
I will destroy everything!

61
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,375
I was born to bring
ruin to all that is.

62
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,375
Do you really think
I will allow myself

63
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,625
to be a part of your
filthy demonic magic?

64
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,208
Sett will enter me,
and together we shall

65
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,791
send this cursed town
crashing down to hell.

66
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:28,208
And you, my young Hellsing.
You will make my power strong!

67
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,291
You are nothing but
a freakish blood addict

68
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,791
who will soon enjoying
an eternity of pain!

69
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,333
How marvelous you are!

70
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:43,041
I'm going to violate
every part of your being.

71
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,291
I will consume every last
part of your body and soul.

72
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,291
Leaving you in ruin...

73
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,291
Situation A!

74
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:55,375
Unlock limited release
control system to level one.

75
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,708
Activate the
Cromwell initiative!

76
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,041
Your master
Hellsing commands it!

77
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,958
Your servant has long
since been destroyed.

78
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,875
Now it is time for
you to know your death.

79
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,666
I want you to scream!

80
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,375
I can taste your sweet blood
rushing through your body.

81
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:21,958
Acknowledge my
approval! Alucard!

82
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,458
Alucard!

83
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,125
Alucard!

84
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,875
Alucard!

85
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,250
Limited release
approval is confirmed!

86
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,458
Releasing control art
restriction system to level one!

87
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,958
My Master...

88
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,375
Yet another
beautiful moonlit night.

89
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,083
He's not human...

90
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,208
It's you...

91
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,000
I have feasted on the
untold rivers of blood

92
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,666
that has soaked into
this cursed fortress.

93
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,875
The Bloody Tower has revived me.

94
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,208
Now, what technique
shall I use to send you

95
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:36,208
to a purgatory of
eternal pain and torment?

96
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,125
Sett, God of Chaos,
who dwells within me!

97
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:43,708
Consume this vampire
in the flames of hell!

98
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,208
That's the way of
true A-list vampire!

99
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,333
At last I've found a
suitable creature to battle!

100
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:14,000
Alucard! The true
immortal vampire!

101
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,583
Is this all you've got?

102
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,416
Even after you awaken
that dried up hell demon

103
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,250
and take him into your body?

104
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,291
Is this really all
the power you can muster?

105
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,750
I will see you grovel
before me in disgrace!

106
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:39,041
You will become part of me
and serve Sett for eternity.

107
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,416
Master...

108
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,208
Where is Alucard?

109
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,625
He's winning.

110
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,791
No matter what, he'll win.

111
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,916
My Master.

112
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:03,500
It seems that your were not
just another simple braggart.

113
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,583
But no matter,
you cannot destroy me,

114
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:11,250
For I am imbued with the
power of the most ancient god.

115
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,000
I welcome eternal pain!

116
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,958
You have such disgusting tastes!

117
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,916
Is pain truly your pleasure?

118
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,083
Then I will grant your wish.

119
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,833
I'll send you to a world
where all you will know is pain!

120
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,083
But don't let
my fun end too quickly!

121
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,250
Come on! What are
you going to do?

122
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,791
Come on! Show me!

123
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,458
Hurry! Hurry up! Hurry!!

124
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:52,041
The world began before
the vampire Alucard existed.

125
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:56,291
And it would do for the world
to see you die before it ends.

126
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:04,541
Now, disappear forever, Alucard!

127
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,333
Are you really trying
to shoot with a broken gun?

128
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,833
No, it's not! It can't be!

129
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,458
Impossible. Who are you?

130
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,875
Integra, my master!

131
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,458
Your orders...

132
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,041
The decision is yours.
