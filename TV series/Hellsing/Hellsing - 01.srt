1
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,958
Five Three Zero Zero, Roger.

2
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,208
Arial units stand by until
ground troops arrive. Over.

3
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,125
Target is confirmed.

4
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,875
Releasing control art
restriction system

5
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,333
to level three.

6
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,291
Please come in.

7
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,958
Perhaps you would
care for another drink?

8
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,458
Your beauty makes me want

9
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,666
to drop down to my
knees, caress your legs,

10
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,291
and prove how much
I admire beauty such as yours.

11
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:25,416
But that sort of game is
reserved for younger gentlemen.

12
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,583
Still, I feel very fortunate to
have met you at that party.

13
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,916
I just know that you're
the kind of person

14
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,791
who will truly appreciate
my strange, new appetites.

15
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,166
Do you mind? I find
the dark more liberating.

16
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,833
And your beauty
lights up the night.

17
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,375
You smell delicious...

18
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,333
Who's that?
What are you doing here?

19
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:10,791
Situation C. Keeping
power restriction unlocked

20
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,208
until the target
has been silenced.

21
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,625
What are you doing in my home!?

22
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,541
Who do you think you are!?

23
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,666
The Hellsing Organization.

24
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,416
What do you mean?

25
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,458
No, wait! Please wait!

26
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,458
Out of the way, human!

27
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,791
Unless you'd rather become
a miserable little Ghoul!

28
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,791
Vam...pi...re...

29
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,125
Limited release completed.

30
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,583
On 12 June, this priest 

31
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,583
was assigned to a small church
in the Village of Cheddar.

32
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,708
One month later, the first wave
of missing persons reports

33
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,833
began flooding in.

34
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,250
The local police
conducted the investigation.

35
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,750
The day before yesterday,
officers were sent to the church

36
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,750
to apprehend the suspect.

37
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,208
All of them were
reported killed.

38
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,958
It was then that the
London Police Authority

39
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,250
ordered D11 into action.

40
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,375
Yesterday,
special Division 11 sent

41
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,666
in one unit of
their elite troops.

42
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,833
Fifty percent
casualties were suffered.

43
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,625
What's worse, it seems
our men were killed

44
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,666
by the officers reported
killed the day before.

45
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,958
They're no longer human.

46
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,125
What?

47
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,333
These people have
had their blood drained

48
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,583
to feed the vampire.

49
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,750
They've become
cannibalistic Ghouls.

50
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,000
You have taken the lecture.

51
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,750
Well, I didn't know they
weren't human anymore!

52
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,791
Lieutenant, it is
not my responsibility

53
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,125
nor my intention to
dwell on your mistakes.

54
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,291
What are you implying?

55
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,708
You're a lieutenant in the
London Police Authority.

56
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,625
That would lead one
to assume you possessed

57
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,083
the knowledge
and intelligence to

58
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,916
accurately assess the
situation in Cheddar.

59
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,833
And that you would
know the correct response

60
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,333
in these situations.

61
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,166
But somehow, you forgot, 

62
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,166
there is only one way to
resolve these problems.

63
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,708
I imagine you
were quite prepared

64
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,333
for these sorts of consequences.

65
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,666
But it wasn't like that.
I didn't forget about

66
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,500
the proper protocol,
the Hellsing organization.

67
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,833
It's getting dark...

68
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,416
Sir Integra Hellsing...

69
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,250
My organization has already sent
assistance to Cheddar Village.

70
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,125
How many agents?

71
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,833
One.

72
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,708
One?

73
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,833
What a perfect night...

74
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:15,583
The kind of night that makes me
want to have a bite to drink.

75
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,291
Seres...

76
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,791
Try not to talk Jack, 

77
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,458
Reinforcement's
will be here soon.

78
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,916
I just wasn't
ready for this. I...

79
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,083
I Just can't...

80
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,416
It's too much.

81
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,416
I'm trying to be strong.

82
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,375
I don't want to be nicknamed
kitten for the rest of my life.

83
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,916
I'm sorry...

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I swore I'd never cry
at a crime scene, Jack.

85
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,458
Jack!!

86
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,125
Please don't make
me do this Jack...

87
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,375
Sorry!

88
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,833
Your O.K.

89
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,041
But you can't be O.K.

90
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,708
You guys are all dead!

91
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,416
Andy! Eugene! Hey! 

92
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,958
Don't you recognize me?
It's me Kitten!

93
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,666
I'm letting you know
that I'm already

94
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,500
on my way to Cheddar Village.

95
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,958
Please try not to worry,
the Hunter I sent in

96
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,833
is perfectly suited to
this type of situation.

97
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,375
Just leave everything to us.

98
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:25,416
This...this is not the sort
of thing...I expected...

99
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,875
when I signed up...with D11.

100
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,333
A monster...

101
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,083
It's not human...

102
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,250
Beautiful night,
isn't it, police girl?

103
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:27,291
It's especially beautiful of
course, if your a blood sucker.

104
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,916
You're not human...

105
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,916
Why, would you have
shot me if I was?

106
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,625
What on earth am I doing? 

107
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,958
I don't know anywhere to
go that's safe around here...

108
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,666
The church has
always offered sanctuary

109
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,083
to those who are in distress.

110
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,958
Good evening Father...

111
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,666
And a very good evening
to you young lady,

112
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,000
so fresh, so full of life.

113
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,833
So frightened by the evil
creatures that walk the night,

114
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,500
Poor Little thing.

115
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,833
Are you really a priest...?

116
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,500
I am merely a guide,
to the weak of heart.

117
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,500
Well, I'm on a mission.

118
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,750
We were supposed to
deal with this priest who...

119
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,666
But, you're not like
the rest of them...

120
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,458
You're speaking of the
Ghouls that you saw outside.

121
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,791
Ghouls?

122
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,666
They are the undead
slaves of the vampire.

123
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,958
When a vampire
drinks a humans blood,

124
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:40,458
the corpse left behind will move
under the vampire's control.

125
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,500
Vampire?

126
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,208
Of course, vampires
can't turn every human

127
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,583
they drink of into
one of their own.

128
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,750
For example...

129
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,541
Let me go...

130
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,416
Changing you into a ghoul
would be such a waste.

131
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,333
The blood that
courses through your body

132
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:08,250
is warmer and sweeter
than you can imagine...

133
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,875
Let me go... or else...
I'm... going to shoot...

134
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,375
and I'll blow
your brains out...

135
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,166
and then everyone
will find out...

136
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,875
I know you're feeling pain. 

137
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,541
But I will give you pleasure.
And it will last forever.

138
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,791
I had enough of you... 

139
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,125
God damn punk!

140
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,958
And who are you?

141
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,250
My name is Alucard. 

142
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,958
I am but a servant of
the Hellsing organization.

143
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,125
I deal with garbage like you.

144
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,125
Garbage like me? 

145
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,000
Who do think your talking to? 

146
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,791
Have you lost your mind?

147
00:14:55,875 --> 00:15:00,333
No, you're even less than
garbage...you're just scum.

148
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,875
And that ridiculous costume...

149
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,333
You look like some sort
of sad carnival freak.

150
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,833
Just look at you wearing
those priest robes.

151
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,458
Don't you have any shame?

152
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,750
I thought scum could
at least feel shame.

153
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,166
I think you should die now.

154
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,291
Captain...

155
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,666
You are a fool who creates
slaves to do his dirty work.

156
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,291
A coward, and an incompetent, 

157
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,250
incapable of doing
anything on your own.

158
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,833
You're not worthy of
the lowest pits of hell!

159
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,416
Just kill him!

160
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,583
It looks like
somebody was all talk.

161
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,833
What?

162
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,916
Oh God...

163
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,875
Shooting me is not
going to do you any good.

164
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,416
One of us...

165
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,625
You'll need more
than guns to stop me.

166
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,666
Hurry up and kill him!

167
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,500
He's not human...

168
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,958
Stop it! What are you doing?

169
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,458
Both of us are vampires!

170
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,750
You act more like a cockroach
than a proper Vampire.

171
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,750
Left on your own you would
cover the world in filth.

172
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,625
I can't stand your kind.

173
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,916
You don't have the self respect

174
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,500
to be a vampire,
you undead maggot.

175
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,458
You barely know what you are!

176
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:31,375
As for me. I have my own reasons
for serving my human master.

177
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,958
But that's not a story
for trash like you.

178
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,000
This fires a 13mm
explosive round.

179
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,875
A silver cross from
Lanchester church

180
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,250
was melted into the
alloy for the bullets.

181
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,833
Prepare yourself for
an eternity in hell!

182
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,625
You'll have to kill
the girl to get to me,

183
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,458
and I don't think you can,
play thing of the humans!

184
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,791
But come now, we're
both vampires, no?

185
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,208
Humans are less than
cattle compare to us!

186
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,666
Forget your human
masters, let me escape!

187
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,291
You could even come with me!
We could work together...

188
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,750
Can't you understand.
We could be powerful together.

189
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,541
Two vampires.
Two strong vampires!

190
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,250
Police girl.

191
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,583
Yes...

192
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,833
Stop it! Are you
listening to me?!

193
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,708
I'm going to fire my gun now, 

194
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,333
and the bullet will
rip through your lungs

195
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,208
before it hits the
maggot vampire's heart.

196
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,166
I...but...wait a minute!

197
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,875
I know you don't
want to die tonight.

198
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,000
Do you wanna come with me?

199
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,833
No, now hold on...

200
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,625
I can't force you into this. 

201
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:46,000
The decision has to be
made of your own free will.

202
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,333
So make the choice!

203
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,708
Yes.

204
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,416
Alucard...

205
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,208
Remember that the choice was
always yours, Police girl.

206
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,291
This is where you're
supposed to close your eyes.

207
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,750
Mission objective accomplished. 

208
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,625
The target vampire
has been silenced.

209
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,291
The Limited power
release is completed.

210
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,500
It took you far too long
to silence just one target.

211
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,666
I'll have someone
take care of her.

212
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,000
No.

213
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,000
I want you to
transfer the police girl

214
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,416
to the Hellsing organization.

215
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,916
You don't make decisions.

216
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,583
The police girl made
the choice for herself.

217
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,541
It's time for us to leave.

218
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,000
Um...

219
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,916
This was a perfect
night... Right?

220
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,250
No chicks, no romance, no sex.

221
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,000
Who says chicks anymore?

222
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,541
Who are you anyway?
