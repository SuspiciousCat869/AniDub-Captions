1
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,375
Let's go! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

2
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,708
Go! Go! Go!

3
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,000
You there.

4
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,875
Sir?

5
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,291
What is it?

6
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:46,666
I don't think you belong
in a human field unit.

7
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,416
Even though you're a monster,

8
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,833
do you ever feel the
need for a man in your bed?

9
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,833
Has the new commander
reported to his post?

10
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,541
Yes, just transferred
in from the SAS.

11
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,416
He's a first rate candidate.

12
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,000
God and Her Majesty
be with you. Amen.

13
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,833
Amen.

14
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,583
You needed to see me Walter?

15
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:14,083
Yes, Sir Integra. I have
something to show you.

16
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,291
What is this?

17
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,500
This is a snuff-film
I found on the Internet.

18
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,666
There is an underground
market for this stuff.

19
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,333
Films of people being killed.

20
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,750
In the old days it was film,
then it moved on to video.

21
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,041
Now, this type of material

22
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,041
Traffics mostly
through the internet.

23
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,166
That's quite true;

24
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,166
But I called you
down here because this

25
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,875
film has a very
special guest star.

26
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,125
The Hellsing coat of arms.

27
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,500
It's poor dead Gareth.

28
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,375
Local police have the
crime scene area closed off.

29
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,791
A stockpile of illegal
weapons has been located.

30
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,541
Current situation is
B sharp designation.

31
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,958
When was this made?

32
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,291
The film is only
three minutes in length,

33
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,625
And there's nothing
to indicate the time

34
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,750
or location of its production.

35
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:03,291
I assume it was filmed
three weeks ago, in Coventry.

36
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,125
How many people
have seen this film?

37
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,958
There's no way to really tell.

38
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,166
The film has already been
online for twenty four hours.

39
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,458
The first recorded
posting was a link found

40
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:17,000
on a small underground Bulletin
Board system, yesterday.

41
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,291
By now it's managed
to spread the way

42
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,583
things on the
internet usually do.

43
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,416
Who's responsible?

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,125
A TV station and
some tabloid papers

45
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,083
have already tried
to publish this.

46
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,333
I'll have the Media Management

47
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,250
kill the story and
all related information.

48
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,833
Make sure you do.
Hellsing's existence

49
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:39,375
must never be made known
to the innocent masses.

50
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,166
Alright men, you're going in.

51
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,041
You have fifteen minutes.
Follow Steadler.

52
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:58,333
Don't disappoint me!
In and out, in ten minutes!

53
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,708
Victoria!

54
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,125
Planning to hide in the
back of the unit, were you?

55
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,000
No sir.

56
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,291
Then, let's have that door down!

57
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,083
MI-5 has already
taken an action.

58
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,833
There's something so human

59
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:31,166
about finding delight in the
deaths of one's fellow men.

60
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,500
Walter.

61
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,750
What can I do for you, Alucard?

62
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,125
This gun is fine for
killing cheap vampires,

63
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,708
But I want something bigger....

64
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,916
Certainly, sir. I've got just
the thing in mind for you.

65
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,791
I look forward to it.

66
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,833
Alucard.

67
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,416
I can't help you.

68
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,250
I belong to a world
where all is death.

69
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,916
Your world of choices was

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,833
not meant for me
to interfere with.

71
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,375
My world is your world.

72
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,750
And a good evening
to you, Ms. Hellsing.

73
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,416
I'll go in first.

74
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,375
It's a mercy, they
become Ghouls otherwise.

75
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,333
I'll stay in the lead.

76
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,291
Sir Integra.

77
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,000
There's something
I think you should see.

78
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,875
It's H.Q. sir.

79
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,666
Ferguson here!

80
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,875
What, yes sir!
We'll deal with this sabotage.

81
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,583
Steadler!

82
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,625
We go live to Camden,
where a secret branch

83
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,166
of military special forces
is committing an armed

84
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,666
attack against private citizens.

85
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,791
We can't let ourselves be
revealed on national television.

86
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,333
This is a nightmare...

87
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,583
I've just been informed that
the station has been ordered

88
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,375
to cease the broadcast.

89
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,333
Those idiots!

90
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,708
Manipulating... Wait a minute...

91
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,875
The citizens are not only
believed to be criminals,

92
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,250
but, are being
referred to as "vampires,"

93
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,750
by this covert organization.
At this time there is

94
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,291
no evidence to
verify this claim.

95
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,208
Fortunately, an
observer on scene

96
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,750
is taping this live and will

97
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,083
be sending it to us
directly via internet link up.

98
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,375
Our producers have decided that,
whether right or wrong,

99
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,541
our national and journalistic
duty is to air this footage,

100
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,583
uncut and directly to ...um?

101
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,541
Wait a minute, you...

102
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,833
Christ, what a mess.

103
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,041
Engaging the target!

104
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,750
It seems like our targets are
entrenched on the third floor.

105
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,041
Don't worry,
I have it dealt with.

106
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,291
Victoria, we need you to
do a bit of rat catching.

107
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,166
What?

108
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,500
Quite a mess you've made.

109
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,208
My apologies, ma'am.

110
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,208
The cleaning up process
has already started.

111
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,250
Right you are, sir.

112
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,833
We'll take him from here.

113
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:12,833
Captain Steadler.

114
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,166
What do you want?

115
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,416
How did you know
that the targets

116
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,833
were waiting for us
on the third floor?

117
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,458
Why didn't you bother to share

118
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,208
this information
with the forward unit?

119
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,250
You just think you're
the hot inhuman shit,

120
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,958
don't you, Victoria?

121
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,708
How'd you like to suck my blood?

122
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,625
Or do you want something else?

123
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,458
The man taken
into custody is known

124
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,416
only by the alias "Flesh."

125
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,833
It seems our man
"Flesh" is quite a

126
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,875
mover and shaker on internet.

127
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,708
He has been interrogated,
and subjected to polygraph.

128
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,041
And we've even inflicted some

129
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,541
"creative information retrieval"
techniques on him.

130
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,958
Still, he has not given us
any information about himself.

131
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,375
Or any organization he is with.

132
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,208
He states his policy as
"I watch what I want,

133
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,250
And I show others
what they want to watch."

134
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,416
The problem arises
from the hungry market

135
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,583
of consumers for
"his" sort of product,

136
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,000
That demand naturally
creates willing suppliers.

137
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:40,208
I understand reality TV
programs are very big just now,

138
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,083
but this kind of
irresponsible program

139
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,541
makes our stockholders nervous.

140
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,375
I mean Vampires?
We're not the Sun!

141
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,291
What's next? Maybe,
Aliens, or the Loch Ness!

142
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,125
This was supposed to
be a piece on snuff films!

143
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:20,250
So now the Hellsing organization
has a investigations division?

144
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,916
It seems you have
me at a disadvantage.

145
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,291
Look Miss, your lot
handles infiltration,

146
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,625
and we handle investigation.

147
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,750
Now, let's just all stick to
what we're good at? Alright?

148
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,875
You know, there's a hidden
camera set up in here.

149
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,791
The informant must have already
known about the vampire.

150
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:44,708
Young Miss, it's also our
job to evaluate any evidence.

151
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,833
Oh, go pull the other one!

152
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,583
I mean, you have
got to be joking...

153
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,041
You've overstepped
yourself, Miss.

154
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,375
This does not concern you
or the Hellsing organization.

155
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,166
Now please leave immediately.

156
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,791
What does it mean?

157
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,333
Captain Steadler
already knew there

158
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,291
were targets on the third floor.

159
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,125
The answers right
in front of you,

160
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,750
And, you have all the
evidence you need, Police Girl.

161
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,500
Master!

162
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,250
But, then it, has to be...

163
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,875
What's so wrong with
watching people be killed?

164
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,166
We're only watching! And it's
what the public wants to see.

165
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,875
And if you think we shouldn't
see people killing each other,

166
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,083
what about people being killed

167
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,541
by something that
isn't the human being?

168
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,833
Right or wrong, in the end,
who really decides?

169
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,041
I really hope your
on the level friend.

170
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,416
The greatest, longest
high I can imagine,

171
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,458
and no pushers
to deal with, right?

172
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,583
To good to be true.

173
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:22,333
Um, well I'll just have
a tomato juice please.

174
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,125
Now what am I supposed to do?

175
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,666
Thanks.

176
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,250
That was a bloody
stupid drink to order!

177
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,708
Oh god, the bill!

178
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,958
Excuse me, how much do
I owe you for the juice?

179
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,041
I don't know; I just take the
good times as they come.

180
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,583
It's all good as
long as I can get high.

181
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:08,083
Yeah by the way,
why are you taping this?

182
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,750
So, what am I supposed to do?

183
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,666
How long do I have to sit here?

184
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,750
Hey, what are you doing!? Chris!
Get off! I don't like that!

185
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,250
What the fuck are you doing!

186
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,750
Hey, what's this shit?
I'm not into that!

187
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,166
Cut that...!

188
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,833
What exactly is so amusing about

189
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:47,166
exposing your filthy
face to the world?

190
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,500
Who the fuck are you?

191
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,958
Does having an audience

192
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,916
for your sins make you
feel like you are special?

193
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,375
Does it make you proud?

194
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,708
Hey, ah, sorry.
What is this, eah?

195
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:03,458
Are you lads gonna fight?
Cause I'll just be going...

196
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,625
Now look what you've done.

197
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,583
You've gone and
killed your co-star.

198
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,250
Bastard! Fuck you talk too much!

199
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,041
I can only pity such a vampire.

200
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,250
A titan who has been reduced to

201
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,375
a puppet just to give
humans a good show.

202
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,166
Well, it seems
I'm also a creature

203
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,041
in the service of humans.

204
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,000
That's something
we had in common.

205
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,291
I...um... We're just
observing the situation.

206
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,958
He's the Hellsing
organization's Vampire!

207
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,916
Why did you need
to witness this?

208
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,333
I will never understand humans.

209
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,875
Wait, don't do this!

210
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,375
Please don't shoot!

211
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,958
Master!

212
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,750
They need to be judged
and punished by man's law.

213
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,666
Not by us.

214
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,000
Th...that's right!

215
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,083
You are absolutely
right Victoria!

216
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,750
Besides, I was
only doing my duty.

217
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,833
You know, on second thought,

218
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,125
I'd love to kill you.

219
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,583
Victoria.

220
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,583
We'll take care
of him from here.

221
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,750
You've done well.

222
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,708
Don't you ever get sick of it?

223
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,583
You go and risk your life
to protect this country.

224
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,166
But this organization hides and

225
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,708
you're treated
like you don't exist.

226
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:00,625
I think I seriously misjudged
your character Steadler.

227
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,708
I...I just can't
believe what I've seen!

228
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,583
I have a journalistic
obligation to show this

229
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,875
to the world, wouldn't you say?

230
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,208
So you feel no
guilt for watching?

231
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,916
Damned right! I wasn't the one
who was doing the video taping!

232
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,916
It was that pathetic
computer freak!

233
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,875
What do we do with her?

234
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,458
She should be brought to the

235
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,833
London Police.
From there, she'd go to trial.

236
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,875
But I don't think
man's law is sufficient

237
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,541
punishment for her crimes.

238
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,708
If she's beyond man's
Judgement, beyond law,

239
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,583
I guess that means
it's up to me.

240
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,916
I... What?

241
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,583
I've been hungry
for so very long.

242
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,416
But you're going to
help me change that.

243
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,916
Next time my true
identity will be reaveled.

244
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,750
That's enough!
Our next epsiode...

245
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,333
Actually, I am...

246
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:19,958
"Brotherhood."

247
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,666
Wait!
