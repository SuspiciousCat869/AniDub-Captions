1
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,083
Amen!

2
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,416
We'll move in before dusk.

3
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,250
I do wish we had
more intelligence

4
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,583
on this Boobhan Castle.

5
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,208
Can't be helped

6
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,250
Assess the situation
inside quickly.

7
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,541
Subdue the freaks!

8
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,375
Understood.

9
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,375
Walter.

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,916
Sir Integra,
as per your inquiry,

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,291
Boobhan castle is the
property of a Japanese firm,

12
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,541
but it's currently
up for auction.

13
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,166
This castle seems
to be the ideal

14
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,541
home for a mock-vampire.

15
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,458
Running with this
thing is such a bother.

16
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,541
Stand ready!

17
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,333
It's wrong.

18
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,875
Victoria, what was
that you just said?

19
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,291
There's something here...

20
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,291
Yes, sir.

21
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,708
Roger.

22
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,708
We're pulling out!

23
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,208
Why is the SAS here?

24
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,166
I am hereby ordering
your organization

25
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,333
to make a complete withdrawal.

26
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,000
This tainted castle must first

27
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,833
be purified by the
Hellsing organization.

28
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,291
Well, the situation has changed.

29
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,833
We've discovered
that the IRA have been

30
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,375
using this castle
as a weapons depot.

31
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,375
There is a high possibility
that some of the most

32
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:09,000
wanted terrorists in this
country are still hiding inside.

33
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,083
Even if they have
become something inhuman,

34
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,291
that doesn't mean their guilt

35
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,291
as terrorists has
suddenly been erased.

36
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,458
We already know about all
your gear and your strategies.

37
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,625
Just try and remember
you're not the only

38
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,416
outfit trying to
protect this country.

39
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,208
Packing up then?

40
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,875
I will be filing a
complaint with the JIC.

41
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,750
Withdraw!

42
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:51,416
Your intuition is
getting sharp, police girl.

43
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,583
Master.

44
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,166
Police girl.

45
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,458
The battle we are
joining now is unlike

46
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,583
anything you've
ever seen before.

47
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,791
Prepare yourself.

48
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,666
It almost sounds like
you're enjoying this, Master.

49
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,875
Oh, but I am!

50
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,000
Welcome home, Sir Integra.

51
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,125
Young Laura has
been waiting for you.

52
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,541
Laura?

53
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,458
Laura Hellsing...

54
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,708
Integra, it's been too long.

55
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,791
Laura...Hello dear sister.

56
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,958
You should have called ahead.

57
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,291
Though it's good
to know you still

58
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,875
haven't mastered
basic etiquette.

59
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,291
All of the family living
in Avon are doing well.

60
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,625
That's good.

61
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:11,666
Don't you ever get
lonely living here, Integra?

62
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,333
Why don't you stay here tonight?

63
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,500
I'll have Walter
prepare a room for you.

64
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,375
Thank you, sister.

65
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,791
There's no way I can
sleep before taking a bath.

66
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,375
What's... that?

67
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,041
Miss police girl?

68
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,166
God, don't scare me
like that! I mean...

69
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,250
I know I may not
be human anymore,

70
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,708
but nobody no
matter what they are

71
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,791
likes to be
frightened like that!

72
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,166
Christ!

73
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,125
My apologies for startling you.

74
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,875
So who is that girl?

75
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,041
That would be Miss Laura.

76
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,041
She is Sir Integra's
younger sister.

77
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,625
Her sister?

78
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,416
But they don't even look alike.

79
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,708
Well, I guess their family
does have a complex history...

80
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,875
...so I suppose things
like that could happen.

81
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,041
Walter...?!

82
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,166
Excuse me.

83
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,458
I sometimes forget I not
as young as I used to be.

84
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:40,250
I believe I must take
my leave for the night.

85
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,041
Have a good evening.

86
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,125
Something's...not right.

87
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,583
How do you manage to get
lost in a castle this small?

88
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,541
Reminds me of a
ghost story I read once.

89
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,625
Near the end of World War 2,

90
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,166
the Nazi's invaded Transylvania.

91
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,958
They were stationed
at an old castle,

92
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,750
and there was a
demon in there with them.

93
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,500
Hey, are you listening?

94
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,666
Your Name?

95
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,708
Paul...Paul Wilson...

96
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,625
Do you want to live?

97
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,083
To live...of course...I...

98
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,750
Do you want to live forever?

99
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,375
Forever...I don't know...

100
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,958
Do you want to stay
in the form of a man,

101
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,333
broken and imperfect?

102
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,666
Imperfect?

103
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,166
Or do you not want to
become a perfected being?

104
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,000
I want to be perfected...

105
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,208
that's why I've
been training myself.

106
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,875
I even joined the SAS,

107
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,250
although it hasn't
been working out.

108
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:09,083
Do you want to live forever?

109
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,833
I want to live... forever.

110
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,541
What are you doing here?

111
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,000
Has your hunger
driven you to this?

112
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,500
I don't know your name yet,

113
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,250
but I think we have
a lot in common.

114
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,541
You've also put aside your pride

115
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,583
and learned to bow
before human masters.

116
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,916
How utterly...pitiful.

117
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,833
What are you... doing?

118
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,125
Laura...

119
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,583
Walter! Sir Integra is...!

120
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't you dare try
to disturb Sir Integra!

121
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:16,000
God damn it! I... oh god...
I don't have a sister!

122
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,166
I've never had a sister!

123
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,250
I knew something was wrong.

124
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:31,250
You evil bitch!
How dare you do this to me!

125
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,875
I do hope you have
some power to back

126
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,041
your enormous pretension?

127
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:50,208
You're Alucard.

128
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,375
What shall I call you?

129
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:57,125
I'm Incognito!

130
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:01,500
So you're nobody?
I can live with that.

131
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:05,333
My name's a bit
of an Enigma as well.

132
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,583
We're both originals
who were bound by humans.

133
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,416
Let's take our time
and have some fun.

134
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,666
Laura...is your using that
name part of some sick joke?

135
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,166
Is it?

136
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,083
There was a Laura who was
taken by the Countess Karnstein.

137
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:37,666
Tell me your true name
Buvanshee. Are you Carmilla?

138
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,916
Did my ancestors in the Hellsing
family destroy your people?

139
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,875
Is that it?

140
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,500
You really came here
for your petty revenge?

141
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,916
I wouldn't bother to
waste my soldiers time

142
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,083
sorting out a sad
she freak such as you.

143
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,583
Your nothing but a...

144
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,250
Stop it Walter! Please wake up!

145
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,750
Please!

146
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:29,666
You have such a
dirty mouth, big sister.

147
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,375
What are you
waiting for, Incognito?

148
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,291
Don't you carry
any human weapons?

149
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,583
An Armscore
40mm MGL, how quaint!

150
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,333
I wonder what kind
of projectiles it fires?

151
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,750
Explosive rounds?

152
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,333
Sorcery from the Dark Continent?

153
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,250
Perfect. Let's begin.

154
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,041
The two of us. We're different.

155
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,708
What did you say?

156
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,916
The difference between us...

157
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,541
Is you don't have
a master, anymore.

158
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,500
Alucard...

159
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,791
What have you done!

160
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,791
Walter please...

161
00:18:56,458 --> 00:19:07,833
I'm going to fill your flesh
with my Jackal's bullets...

162
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,208
Your blood is
delicious sister...

163
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,833
Do you think
you're torturing me?

164
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,833
On no, I'm only doing
what I was told to.

165
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,250
They told me that I shouldn't

166
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,875
make you into a
ghoul too quickly.

167
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,541
But I think it's just about
time to take care of that.

168
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,666
Now dear sister, I am going

169
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,333
to chew my way
through your neck,

170
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:45,500
and drink up every last drop
of blood until your dry.

171
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,000
Your delicious blood...

172
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,833
Then I will give you just
a little bit of my blood.

173
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:57,791
Just a taste though, since
I can't make you one of us.

174
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:06,083
You will become nothing
but a mindless ghoul.

175
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,083
So sorry.

176
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,416
What was I doing?

177
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,916
God...

178
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:43,250
I've had enough of
your mockery, Buvanshee!

179
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,375
Stay Back!

180
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,916
Sir Integra!!!

181
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:42,083
There is impure
blood in my veins!

182
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:52,083
There is impure
blood in my veins!

183
00:21:52,166 --> 00:22:02,083
There is impure
blood in my veins!

184
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:12,083
There is impure
blood in my veins!

185
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:22,083
There is impure
blood in my veins!

186
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:32,125
There is impure
blood in my veins!

187
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:42,125
There is impure
blood in my veins!

188
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:52,125
There is impure
blood in my veins!

189
00:22:52,208 --> 00:23:02,125
There is impure
blood in my veins!

190
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:09,541
There is impure
blood in my veins!

191
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,958
I'm the fairy that lives inside
your Hallconnen cannon

192
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:13,833
Oh?

193
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,791
Actually the trigger is in here.

194
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,291
Do you wish to test
my Hallconnen cannon?

195
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,166
I'm not touching that.

196
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,666
Wait! It's very strong.
