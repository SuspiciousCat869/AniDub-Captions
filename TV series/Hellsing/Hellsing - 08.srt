1
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,625
What do you want
on such a night?

2
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:07,166
Wha...what're you doing? Don't
come in without permission!

3
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,333
Bastard! What kind of
right do you people have

4
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,125
to enter somebody's
territory so rudely?

5
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,500
Who's the leader?
Give a proper greeting!

6
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,000
We secured the scene.
We're also holding evidence.

7
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,333
Stop! You can't touch it!

8
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,500
What is so illegal about it?

9
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,708
There are 74 candidates
up for membership.

10
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,416
Times being what they are,

11
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,458
we've extended offers
to foreign specialist

12
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:23,000
with good references as well
as the usual D11 and SAS crowd.

13
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,500
I trust you.

14
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,958
We found a report from
one of our embassy men.

15
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,666
They found a
factory in Hong Kong

16
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,791
that has been producing
quantities of the freak chip.

17
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,875
The Hong Kong Police
executed a compulsory

18
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,750
investigation into
the matter, but...

19
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:03,250
Everything was destroyed,
including any possible evidence.

20
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,500
Once again,
our hand is blocked...

21
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,791
Allowing heathens
and atheists membership

22
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,458
into our honorable organization.

23
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,125
Such a thing is without
precedent in the family,

24
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,875
but I do understand
we have no choice.

25
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,541
Even drawing from the SAS,

26
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,125
we won't acquire many skilled
soldiers worthy of our trust.

27
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,750
However, at the present
time, a show of force is

28
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,625
more important than trust.

29
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,583
Yes, Sir Integra.

30
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,583
I hope at the very least,
this group will be

31
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,166
strong enough to
avoid becoming ghouls.

32
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,458
I'll see to it personally.

33
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,500
Right, group seven.
Let's move on to you lot.

34
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,458
As you heard in the
briefing, when you encounter

35
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,000
threatening targets,
shoot only for the head.

36
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,041
Hits to other parts of
the target won't be counted.

37
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,875
If you shoot a
non threat target,

38
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,625
you will fail immediately,
and the test will end.

39
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,458
The arrows will help
guide you through the course.

40
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,416
Questions anyone?

41
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,916
Hey girl!

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,291
What is it then?

43
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,750
We heard some crap about there

44
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,916
being a real
vampire in this unit.

45
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,375
Have you?

46
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,208
Oh, it seems there's
something wrong with your MP5.

47
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,500
Uh...What do you mean?

48
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,166
Hullo, the barrel's bent.

49
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,458
You'd better go have
it replaced quickly,

50
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,625
or else you'll miss
your chance to test.

51
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,458
Chopper-1 to headquarters.

52
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,416
We found the suspect's vehicle.

53
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,375
It got rolled out in
the middle of the desert.

54
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,333
Our suspect looks
to be pretty dead

55
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,250
and still in the front seat.

56
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:25,666
"Artificial vampirisation
catalyst semiconductor.

57
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,291
The Freak Chip".

58
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,958
The semiconductor
hardware combined

59
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,291
with biotech theory and
what can only be described

60
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,541
as "A low amperage current
transmission device".

61
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,958
Thus far, the actual human to
vampire metamorphosis process

62
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,291
remains a total mystery.

63
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,208
So elusive is this process,

64
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,541
a hasty person would say it
borders on the supernatural.

65
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,291
Yes...well...

66
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,791
So potent is the elusive
"Freak effect" that one chip

67
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,291
is all that is necessary
to effect a single organism.

68
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,083
Our present leading theory
is that the chip somehow acts

69
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:03,458
upon information
latent in human DNA.

70
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,916
Er...Bear in mind,
however, this is all theory,

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,791
and not the only one
currently being considered.

72
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,791
Your findings are irrelevant!

73
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,333
Throughout history our
Hellsing organization

74
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,541
and Hellsing family,
have been detecting,

75
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,791
hunting and destroying those
creatures that have posed

76
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,666
a threat to Her Majesty,
the country and it's citizens.

77
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,208
And now, we face
these artificial freaks.

78
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:33,708
A freak is a freak whether they
were made artificially or not!

79
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,083
But consider this. The enemy
gave up their own factory.

80
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,166
The enemy sacrificed
the chip designer's life,

81
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,000
All because they feared that any

82
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,833
physical evidence would
eventually lead us to them.

83
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:48,125
Therefore...the enemy is human!

84
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,333
They're on the run now

85
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,375
that they sense a
predator at their heels.

86
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,041
We have only one
command and one mission!

87
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,875
To search and destroy!

88
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,291
Sorry daddy. I can't eat
these things anymore...

89
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,291
It's all wrong.

90
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,125
I finally became
a police officer...

91
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,500
And now...

92
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,583
God. Daddy?

93
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,916
Who's there?

94
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,916
I've come a long way to
see you, Seras Victoria.

95
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,500
Here.

96
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,875
Thanks.

97
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,208
I eh...missed tea
and supper today.

98
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,625
How did you know
to find me here?

99
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:02,041
Investigating things is
my job. As you well know.

100
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,791
Actually, I have know
idea who you are!

101
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,333
I apologize. My name's
Harry Anders. I'm with MI-5.

102
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,000
But why don't you
just call me Harry.

103
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,291
And what do you want with me?

104
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,791
Yeah, well before that...

105
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,500
would you mind if I had a
bite of that pie over there?

106
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,833
Go ahead.

107
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,041
Thanks, I love steak and kidney.

108
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,541
You understand this meeting
is not supposed to happen.

109
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,041
Despite the fact that
both of us is in or own way

110
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,541
are sworn to protect
Queen and country.

111
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,500
The differences are immense,
our agencies, our genders.

112
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,625
I'm human,
you're something else.

113
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,041
We're very different.

114
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,833
Exactly. This is delicious...

115
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,166
Cut to the chase.
What do you want with me?

116
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,875
You're observant.

117
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,750
A Copper thru and thru,
but then, so was your Dad.

118
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,250
How on Earth do
you know my father?!

119
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,791
Well... It was a long time ago.

120
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,041
I'll tell you about
it all some time.

121
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:08,250
But right now, there's a
place I need to take you.

122
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,916
No, no, you won't
be needing that.

123
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,041
I was just checking
mine because...

124
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,666
well being human
leaves me a bit vulnerable.

125
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,458
Who's there?

126
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,583
Helena, excuse me.

127
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:01,416
My name is Harry Anders,
and I work for MI-5.

128
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,958
May I come in? I just want to
ask you a few questions.

129
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,208
Just questions,
nothing more. I promise.

130
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,125
What are you doing?

131
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,583
Helena.

132
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,083
Good evening.

133
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,375
Good evening Helena.

134
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,958
Thank you for
making time to see me.

135
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,208
What?

136
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,958
Normally I do not entertain.

137
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,666
As I'm sure you know.

138
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,833
Your...one of us...

139
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,583
You've not been a
child of the darkness

140
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:52,541
for a particularly
long have you my dear?

141
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,375
You brought this
girl in the hopes that

142
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,083
she would shield you from me.

143
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:01,916
I must applaud you on
your cleverness, Mr. Anders.

144
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,666
Please forgive the ruse,

145
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,708
but I really wasn't
left with much choice.

146
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,416
Were you reborn
through carnal means,

147
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,000
or have you yet to
discover all the pleasures

148
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,166
of being a woman my dear?

149
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,916
Miss Helena,
you're...well...I mean...

150
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,833
when exactly did
you join the undead?

151
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,750
Far too long ago.

152
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,041
And you've always been
the way you are right now?

153
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:38,750
Yes, just as I am.
For forever, and forever.

154
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,333
Mr. Anders, I am a
very private individual.

155
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:48,416
And passive both by inclination
and ability, I am no threat.

156
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,875
As I'm sure your
investigations have shown.

157
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,041
So tell me why do you
insist on this harassment?

158
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,083
Yes, we're aware
that you're undead.

159
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,416
And while I wouldn't say

160
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,125
you're on the side
of the angels exactly,

161
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,250
you are a member of a
small Cabal of creatures

162
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,583
that don't threaten
the night world.

163
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,375
But, around 18 months ago,

164
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,083
a new breed of
night children appeared,

165
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,666
lacking the morals
and pride of your people.

166
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,583
They rampaged and
attacked my people,

167
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,083
turning many of
them into ghouls.

168
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,416
This girl,
Seras Victoria belongs

169
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,583
to the Hellsing organization.

170
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,791
No, but I only kill... I mean...

171
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,666
I...I've only disposed
of artificial freaks

172
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,833
like the ones Harry
was just mentioning.

173
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,000
Through all my long years...

174
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,250
Can you imagine how many friends

175
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,375
I've lost to your
Hellsing club's butchery?

176
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,541
I'm so sorry.

177
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,833
Unfortunately that apology
is not yours to give, child.

178
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,125
Now I understand...

179
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,916
the one who made you is

180
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,875
being kept by the
Hellsing Organization...

181
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:02,958
It's him...

182
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,208
Your speaking of my master?

183
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,875
You are much blessed,
Seras Victoria.

184
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,375
We've come to talk to you
of the dangers England faces.

185
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,541
Humans are using
machines to create

186
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,500
this new breed
of freak vampires.

187
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,333
They are not elegant
creatures such as yourself.

188
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,666
They are vapid greedy
things whose dark desires

189
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,291
are a twisted farce of humanity.

190
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,000
They are uncontrollably
violent and loud. Still...

191
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,166
Their power is not
even close to the

192
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,833
source of a true
vampire such as you.

193
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,291
This prattle wears
on my patience.

194
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,291
However, I will be willing
entertain your subject,

195
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,791
on the condition
that you will allow me

196
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,375
to return to my solitude.

197
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,416
Whenever you research
the chip design,

198
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,666
or discover a manufacturing
plant, it is destroyed.

199
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,666
As if someone is impeding
your investigation, correct?

200
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,583
Let's get to the point.

201
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,083
I may be with MI-5,

202
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,041
but I didn't come here on
any sort of official request,

203
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,791
and doubt they
would approve of it.

204
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,291
On the other hand, I believe
that God will forgive me

205
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,375
for noticing that our
interests run parallel,

206
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,833
and that maybe we
can help each other

207
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,750
work for the greater good.

208
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,166
Helena, I need
information you can provide

209
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,166
about you and your Cabal.

210
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,166
They may be
artificially created,

211
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,166
but they're still honest
to goodness vampires.

212
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,208
This investigation has been
leading me to the conclusion

213
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,208
that there might be
some sort of traitor,

214
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,458
amongst your compatriots.

215
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,833
Enough, Mr. Anders.

216
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:54,583
We have no such Cabal!
We are all individuals.

217
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:59,458
We are free from land,
country, religion.

218
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,375
All your petty forms
of human bondage.

219
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:12,041
Eternity is, however...a
very tiring existence.

220
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,583
I do not wish to leave
my home. As old as I may be,

221
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,750
I still have many books I am
looking forward to reading.

222
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,666
Anybody who disturbs this,
I do not count as a friend.

223
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,500
Humans forget the
nature of the world,

224
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,875
they treat it as property.

225
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,291
You must find
the Magna Mater...?

226
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,041
The first...um The Eve?

227
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,000
The primordial mitochondria?

228
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,291
Science was never
my strong-suit. I'm sorry.

229
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:45,250
My point is that man's
will alone is not enough.

230
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,791
Raw materials are
necessary for any creation.

231
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,666
To make a forgery, they must
have an original to forge.

232
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,958
An original vampire...

233
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,958
I've lived on this dark
Island for time out of mind.

234
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,708
It's my home.

235
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,208
No English Vampire is involved

236
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,875
in this madness,
of this I'm sure.

237
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,750
I understand...

238
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:13,541
Good evening, Ms.
Seras Victoria, Mr. Anders.

239
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,375
She seemed so
lonely didn't she...

240
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,833
Thanks a lot for coming with me.

241
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,958
I wish I could return the favor,
take you to dinner maybe...

242
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,000
Thanks for the thought.

243
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,666
So, I've heard you
don't drink fresh blood.

244
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,375
Just transfusion blood for me.

245
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,916
Christ if I was
twenty years younger...

246
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,291
Harry!

247
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,958
What?

248
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,708
Releasing control art
restriction system to level two!

249
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,416
Alucard!!!

250
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,125
Alucard...

251
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,458
Unlocking the power!

252
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,875
What the hell is going on?

253
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,625
Have you gone mad?

254
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,208
Haven't you ever
wondered Master...

255
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,000
how it feels to be hunted.

256
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,333
What's so damn funny?

257
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,875
Explain yourself!

258
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,791
What are you laughing about?

259
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,083
All the time I've
served you I have been

260
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,333
pitted against
pretenders and frauds.

261
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,000
But this time it's different.

262
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:01,791
A real enemy, a strong enemy

263
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,541
has finally come to
our tiny little island...

264
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,208
The true undead...

265
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,375
Perfect!

266
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:16,333
A battle unlike any other
before. Two genuine monsters!

267
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,375
Let him come!

268
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,291
All right, next
time on Hellsing is...

269
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,750
Meaty bullet battle!
Hallconnen and Jackall and

270
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,166
Walter goes shopping
for the first time.

271
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,625
Integra eats Fugu
sashimi and drinks 3 beers

272
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,625
I thought we talked
about your behavior?
