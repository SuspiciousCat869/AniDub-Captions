1
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,875
I had a fabulous time tonight.

2
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,041
Seven and a half seconds
to set up the stock.

3
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,583
You're slow.

4
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,208
You won't be using that.

5
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,375
Why?

6
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,041
We both aware of what you are,

7
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,458
and won't you
be needing a scope.

8
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,916
Kim?

9
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,625
Christ, don't do that!

10
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,458
You alright?

11
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,041
There's something odd
about that woman over there.

12
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,416
Bit filthy, but not
hard on the eyes.

13
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Wouldn't you say so, Kim luv?

14
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,791
I don't like the look of her.

15
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,250
Don't worry about it.

16
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,750
We're keeping Packstone
and the others waiting.

17
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,708
Please just humor me by trying
to have a good time tonight.

18
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,125
It's attacking civilians, sir.

19
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,375
In the name of god,
impure souls of the living dead

20
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:08,000
shall be banished into
eternal damnation. Amen.

21
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,500
Fire!

22
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,000
Gareth, Take the shot.

23
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,958
Mission completed.

24
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,333
Let's start cleaning
up the crime scene.

25
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,916
Roger.

26
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,125
I'm sorry sir.

27
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,083
Some say that failure
in your first battle

28
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,916
is a sign you'll live longer...

29
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,625
But I suppose you'll
live as long as you like,

30
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,458
or at least till your
sick of it anyway.

31
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,666
I suppose...

32
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,458
In the name of god,
impure souls of the living dead

33
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,375
shall be banished
into eternal damnation.

34
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,500
Amen.

35
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,250
Amen!

36
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,083
Victoria!

37
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,125
Yes sir?

38
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,416
I understand that when you were
an officer with Division 11,

39
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,750
they may have handled
you with kid gloves.

40
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,958
Well here the gloves come off.

41
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,500
I can't risk another
mission, therefore...

42
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't need any
special treatment!

43
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,833
Mission or not!

44
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,000
I would like to
believe that, but...

45
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,750
Maybe you're too
highly strung for this.

46
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,125
Highly strung?

47
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,166
Ms. Victoria...

48
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,791
We will be taking care
of your day to day needs.

49
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,625
Huh? I... Well I...

50
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,208
This way please.

51
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,958
Excuse me...

52
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,041
We haven't been introduced,
my name is Walter.

53
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,166
I'm a retainer to
the Hellsing family.

54
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,583
Sir. Integra has asked
me to look after you.

55
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,166
Do I come off as
being highly strung?

56
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,833
Highly Strung? Well, that's
the least of your worries.

57
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,875
You've more to fear
from using a silver spoon.

58
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,541
Well, I've never used
real silverware before,

59
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,958
so I guess that
won't be a problem!

60
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,208
That didn't come out right...

61
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,333
I recommend that
you also refrain

62
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,583
from going out in daylight.

63
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,833
This is your room
for the daylight hours.

64
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,666
There's nothing quite
like a room with a view.

65
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,333
God, when I was a little girl,

66
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,916
I dreamed of having
a bed like this.

67
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,666
It's moving...excuse
me...what is this?

68
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,791
Oh, this is just a little
something to help you

69
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:42,416
sleep soundly during the long
daylight hours. Pleasant dreams.

70
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,750
A four poster coffin!
Bloody hell...

71
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,791
No more sleeping
at night I guess.

72
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,291
They work for me,
so don't feed off them.

73
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,166
I'm not like that!

74
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,666
I hope this doesn't
become a habit.

75
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,958
You and your little toy.

76
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:39,375
My toy? The police girl
made the choice on her own.

77
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,708
You just better
train her well, Alucard.

78
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,625
Here, take a look at this.

79
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,208
We've been tracking
some Hooligans

80
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,375
heading north
through Birmingham.

81
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,166
They've been murdering whole
families, drinking their blood,

82
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,208
and then using the
left over to scrawl

83
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,625
blasphemous
messages on the walls.

84
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,083
We're assuming there's
at least two of them.

85
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,208
They don't make vampires
like they used to.

86
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,083
I don't recall anyone
asking you for your opinion.

87
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,625
Well ... till tomorrow then.

88
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:38,416
This beats Ecstasy to
fuck-all, yeah Jessica?

89
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,583
Almost there baby...

90
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,708
Yeah.

91
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,833
Just nine more to go.

92
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,583
After we do nine
more of these cockers,

93
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,166
we're gonna be so much stronger.

94
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,833
And we can stay young forever!

95
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,333
Leif baby...

96
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,500
Yeah?

97
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,375
Want to?

98
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,875
The family's gonna
be ghoulies soon luv.

99
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,666
Who cares? Let'em watch.

100
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,958
Look at you, the bloods
got you fucked up!

101
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,666
Like your not?

102
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,208
Oh hell yeah...

103
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,291
This one just
might suit you better.

104
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,625
But, there's no way
I could even lift that thing!

105
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,375
Oh, I get it...

106
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,291
That's strange. What's
it made of? Is it plastic?

107
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,416
It weighs in 15 kilo's.
Plus a couple for ammo.

108
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,583
It's really that heavy?

109
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,875
The shot's no good.

110
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,583
That's fine for
dealing with humans

111
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,916
but for what we're
hunting, you aim for this...

112
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,291
...And nowhere else.

113
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,208
Capt. Gareth, prepare
your Unit for deployment!

114
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,625
Gareth's unit has set up a
blockade on the M6 motorway.

115
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,833
They should have our little
"Bonnie and Clyde" problem

116
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,666
dealt with inside of two hours.

117
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,875
Those two have no
idea what they've become.

118
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,791
Vampires, hardly
touched by the curse.

119
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,291
This is something the
world has never seen before.

120
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,916
Yes, I would have to agree.

121
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,375
Do you, wish you were out there?

122
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,708
I don't. I appreciate
the offer but

123
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:31,458
nothing satisfies me more
than serving you, Sir Integra.

124
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,625
Leif!

125
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,750
Whot?

126
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,708
You and me.
Together forever, right?

127
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:55,875
This is fuckin' super!

128
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,625
I never want this
feeling to stop! Ever!

129
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,875
We can love each other forever!

130
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,125
Whot?

131
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,833
Forever!

132
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,250
Target is confirmed.

133
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,125
Release the control
art restriction system

134
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,083
to level five.

135
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,291
We should be thankful for all
those stupid bloody meat-sacks,

136
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,625
They helped us get this bent up!

137
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,458
What?

138
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,958
What happened?
Leif baby, where are we?

139
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,875
Bloody Hell!
I don't know, all right?

140
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,041
I'm scared Lief!

141
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,041
Take me somewhere
else, right now!

142
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,166
Shut up! Just shut up!

143
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,666
Who the, hell?

144
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,708
Shit!

145
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,666
You're fuckin dead!

146
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,791
Children without faith.

147
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:14,208
If you had any control you
would travel as fog or as a bat.

148
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,791
Who the fuck, are you?

149
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,833
You've gone and
taken all those lives,

150
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,875
and not even because
you were thirsty.

151
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,541
Is it fun? Huh?

152
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,625
Is that what it takes for
filth like you to get off?

153
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,041
Cheap little two bit terrors.

154
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,208
What's it to you?

155
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,958
Eternity is wasted
on the likes of you.

156
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,166
Try as you might,
immortality slips away.

157
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,125
And you remain,
with only your shame.

158
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,458
Christ, Who is
this fuckin' cocker?

159
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,500
No! I don't like this!

160
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,000
That's enough for this shit!

161
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,708
Don't fail me this
time police girl.

162
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,750
Target B Acquired, and it's on
a clear path to your position.

163
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,791
500 meters and closing.

164
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,500
You should be able
to see her by now.

165
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,916
Sir... it's 500 meters...

166
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,791
My god...I can see her...

167
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,416
But she's... she's just a girl.

168
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,083
She can't be a vampire...

169
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,083
In the name of god,
impure souls of the living dead

170
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,750
shall be banished into
eternal damnation. Amen.

171
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,125
Shoot her Victoria.

172
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,625
It's time to prove
you're not just a monster.

173
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,083
Target acquired sir!

174
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:25,291
Now, Officer Seras!
Take the shot!

175
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,583
Target has been silenced.

176
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,791
Alucard shot and
silenced target A.

177
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,000
Senior officer
Seras Victoria, shot target B.

178
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,625
Roger, withdraw the unit.

179
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,291
Victoria!

180
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,083
Welcome to the
Hellsing organization.

181
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,208
Not bad, police girl.

182
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,666
I have a name.
It's Seras Victoria.

183
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,000
Not police girl.

184
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,666
You know that you
are now and forever

185
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,750
a child of the
darkness, police girl.

186
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,541
Drink the blood.

187
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,875
If you refuse to drink,
your body will become weak.

188
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,041
Do as I say.

189
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,500
Yes, Master.

190
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,958
Money falls...

191
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,583
...on the trees like leaves.

192
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,416
Hah!

193
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,625
So spend your money wisely.

194
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey! Who the hell are you?
