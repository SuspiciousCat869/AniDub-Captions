1
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,833
Defending God,
Queen and Country,

2
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:03,541
Our brave knights fell;
while in service to Sir Integra.

3
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:07,708
All praise to these
our fallen brothers.

4
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,541
This responsibility
rests squarely with you.

5
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,250
These men were
under your command.

6
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,666
For me there is no forgiveness.

7
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,791
This is all my fault.

8
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,458
Let us now consider
what personnel

9
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,416
we have still available to us.

10
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,583
Of the 192
personnel staffing the

11
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:33,041
London Head Office,
we have 57 that have survived.

12
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,375
Of those, 24 are wounded.

13
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,833
Mason Fox's unit of
25 men remain active,

14
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,291
having been dispatched
to Ireland earlier that day.

15
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,000
Eight other men who
were not at headquarters

16
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,333
are also ready for duty.

17
00:03:56,375 --> 00:04:00,000
Why are Alucard and Seras
not included in this report?

18
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,708
Well, I imagine
listing them among the

19
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,791
dead would be redundant.

20
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,875
And what is
Ferguson's condition?

21
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,791
His lower jaw is broken.

22
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,083
It should take about
three weeks to heal,

23
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,291
But, he'll be fit
for duty in two days time.

24
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,666
Victoria here.

25
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,541
Mark the target.
I'll take care of it.

26
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,666
Get back!

27
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,625
Sir, the target
has been silenced.

28
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,083
Leave cleanup to
the district station

29
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,625
and proceed immediately
over to Hyde Park!

30
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,500
It seems like the
host is on the move.

31
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,041
We'll rendezvous with you there.

32
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,333
Right!

33
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,833
Hellsing's information
retrieval department

34
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,000
is now totally committed
to our investigation

35
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,208
of the Valentine brothers'
background and associates.

36
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,375
Through the round
table conference,

37
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,333
MI-5 has been asked to
assist in this research.

38
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,500
Maintain the investigation.

39
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,041
I want nothing overlooked.

40
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,666
This is...

41
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,625
Vengeance!

42
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,708
And they will pay
a thousand fold!

43
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,875
The Vatican's
special section thirteen,

44
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,375
It's from the
Iscariot organization!

45
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:12,250
To the most worthy
Sir Integra Wingates Hellsing,

46
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:16,000
as a prelude to the
approaching autumn season...

47
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,875
...a little outing to
the National Gallery is,

48
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,083
perhaps, in order?

49
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,708
Pardon me, so sorry
to keep you waiting.

50
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,958
Very well.

51
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,750
If you're too upset
for pleasantries.

52
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,541
Enrico Maxwell,
Head of the Vatican

53
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,666
special section thirteen;
the Iscariot organization.

54
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,000
To what do I owe the pleasure?

55
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:22,708
I'm here to offer my condolences
to you and your organization

56
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,000
135 dead in the line of duty,

57
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,208
and 24 injured, correct?

58
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,000
Rumor has it that a
rather brash Ghoul attack

59
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,875
has left your lot teetering
on the brink of collapse.

60
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,625
I've come today with my
sword sheathed, Sir Integra.

61
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,083
Oh shut up!

62
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,166
Your people have already
shattered the peace between us!

63
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,500
You sent Mr. Anderson
to attack us

64
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,250
and he has slain
one of my best men!

65
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,541
Don't pretend you've forgotten,
for we certainly haven't!

66
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,708
I will not indulge in this
ridiculous farce of civility.

67
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,083
Now get out of my country!

68
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,791
Or you'll what?

69
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,833
I offer you our kindness
but you insist that we be cruel!

70
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,750
So just shut up
and pay attention!

71
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,375
Father Ronaldo.

72
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,833
Recently, we've
had a bug infestation

73
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,583
spreading within Eternal Rome.

74
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,958
Through our laborious research,

75
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:38,208
we've concluded that these
bugs originate from England.

76
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,416
But because your sad little
club-house is in such disarray,

77
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,625
this infestation goes unchecked.

78
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:56,333
And your bug problem,
becomes our bug problem.

79
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,166
Make no mistake,
we have as little regard

80
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,291
for your Hellsing
Organization as we do

81
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,791
for the Vampire
filth we obliterate.

82
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,291
However, if you
insist on showing such

83
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,000
disrespect to the
Vatican's section thirteen,

84
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,208
We will not hesitate
to wipe you,

85
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,291
your organization and
your vampire problem

86
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,500
off the face of the earth.

87
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,708
Do you understand,
you squealing English sow?

88
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,375
English sow?

89
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,791
No wonder section thirteen
commands such respect.

90
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,125
What strong language!

91
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,458
To reign over the
kingdom of the world,

92
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,958
to make it's peace,
and write it's laws.

93
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,708
To be generous to the
obedient, and merciless

94
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,958
to all those who
would stand against you.

95
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,750
Nothing ever changes.
Two thousand years and you

96
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,708
still act like
the world is yours.

97
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,541
The Nosferatu... Alucard...

98
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,541
Damn monsters!

99
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,666
God it never ends!

100
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,041
Come in Victoria!
Report on our Target!

101
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,208
What's happening to the host?

102
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,750
Sir, the host has gone
underground into the tube,

103
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,458
attacked the passengers
and then escaped.

104
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,083
I've confirmed that
he's on the train

105
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,791
heading towards Queensgate,

106
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,625
but if the train
redirects at Notting Hill,

107
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,541
the situation's going to
be hard to contain, Sir.

108
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,791
Contact the main office, now!

109
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,458
Close every station
it's supposed

110
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,041
to pass on its main route.

111
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,791
Then order an emergency
stop for the train.

112
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,750
We've already dealt
with the Transit Authority.

113
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,500
Commence a thorough
sterilization of the premises.

114
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,666
Walter...

115
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,041
May god and Her Majesty
be with you, Amen!

116
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,208
What is it?

117
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,750
Please take a look at this.

118
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,666
This was taken an hour ago
at the Kensington Garden.

119
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,500
Code 00767!

120
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,416
ALERT the National Gallery!

121
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes sir!

122
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,958
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Maxwell,

123
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,250
and now we should say Good bye.

124
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:40,833
What nerve. You dare
call my master a sow...

125
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:47,083
Really. I don't see how
I can let you leave here alive.

126
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,166
And now, O kings, be ye wise,

127
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,583
be admonished,
ye judges of the earth.

128
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:25,666
Serve the LORD with fear,
and to rejoice with trembling.

129
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,000
Kiss the Son,
lest he be angry...

130
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,375
...and ye perish in the way,

131
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,458
though his wrath
may quickly kindle.

132
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,458
Amen.

133
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,625
Captain Hook is moving to engage
Tiger Lily and the Lost Boys.

134
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,833
Maxwell! You didn't!!

135
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:59,041
Things being what they are,
you'd better hurry, Wendy.

136
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,583
This may be the
end for all of you.

137
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,375
Captain Hook
didn't come all the way

138
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,708
to London just
to kill Tiger Lily.

139
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,541
He'll be dealing with
the rest of London's

140
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:24,583
little lost boys and
fairy filth while he's at it.

141
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,041
Oh my god...

142
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,750
It can't be...

143
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,000
He'll dispatch
Tiger Lily and the others...

144
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,583
Then pay a surprise
visit on Peter Pan.

145
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:09,083
I see. Well then,
he's already here, isn't he?

146
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,333
Then Peter Pan should be
off to entertain his guest,

147
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,875
before he becomes upset.

148
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,375
The Vampire, and those
who ally with such filth,

149
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,166
all stand equal
in the eyes of God.

150
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,791
Sinful, dirty heathens,
to a man.

151
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,500
I act as God's own
wrath upon the earth;

152
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,416
raining down the divine
punishment of Heaven.

153
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,458
I will purify them all!

154
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,958
In the name of The Father,
The Son and the Holy Ghost...

155
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,875
Amen!

156
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,833
Fire!

157
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,833
Master!

158
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:17,416
How about a duel to the
death, Oh Judas Priest!

159
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,500
It's about time, Vampire!

160
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,125
What the...?!

161
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,666
I won't be killed
by anyone's lap dog.

162
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,041
Gotcha!

163
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,416
Master...

164
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,125
Master!

165
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,458
How pathetic.

166
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:31,083
Is This THING the best
that Hellsing had to offer?

167
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,458
I'd say that's a
little sad, really.

168
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,500
What am I going to do?

169
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:07,125
I...I mean...Master's gone and
all I have left is his...head?

170
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,125
What am I supposed
to do with it?

171
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,791
Dust to dust. Amen!

172
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,958
Master!

173
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,666
You foul monster!

174
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,166
I get that a lot.

175
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,291
But then, what's that make you?

176
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,375
A man?

177
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,875
A dog?

178
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,375
Or a monster?

179
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,875
And now you die.

180
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,625
You're fun!

181
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,583
Stop it! Why do you
have to be like that?

182
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,625
You Bastard!

183
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:50,416
Poor Vatican whipping boy!
I've had enough fun for tonight!

184
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,708
Oh, What? Are you going
to chew me to death?

185
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,625
Shut your hole you cheap
black magician of Hellsing!

186
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,291
I may not be able
to finish you today...

187
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,458
but next time...you die.

188
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,625
We'll meet again, vampire!

189
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:23,500
Master...Alucard...are
you all right?

190
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,833
He will never be
able to kill me.

191
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,958
That dog is neither
man nor monster--

192
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,875
Only a man can truly
hope to kill a monster.

193
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,750
Her Majesty's right honorable
Hellsing Organization will never

194
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:17,833
yield to anyone, grinding to
dust any obstacles in our way.

195
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,208
Should you wish to
live to see the morning,

196
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:28,250
run home quickly;
you degenerate...worthog.

197
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,083
What a beautiful day.

198
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,458
Young Miss, would you like
to go museum hopping with me?

199
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,291
Eh?

200
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,291
Then how about the library?

201
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,125
Huh?

202
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,458
You'll find secret treasure!

203
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,958
How dare you say that to me?

204
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,750
Such a difficult girl, right
Father Ronaldo?
