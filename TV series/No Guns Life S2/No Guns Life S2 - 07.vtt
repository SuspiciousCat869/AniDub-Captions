00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:10.635 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] You knew Five?
Stop yankin' my chain.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.848 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Yes, I remember him.
We have history.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.683 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Have you seen him lately?

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.935 position:50% align:center
You have to tell me where he is!

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
I can't sleep until he's dead!

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.524 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Then I've got news for you.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.362 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You can rest easy.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
'Cause six years ago,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.784 position:50% align:center
I took care of him
with my own two hands.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] So, bud, you're
Five's doppelganger.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.883 position:50% align:center
A Gun Slave Unit, that right?

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.553 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I've got a name: Juzo Inui.

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] You gonna tell me
why you eliminated my partner?

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
After all, he was
the same as you.

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.238 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Hey, kid!

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.582 position:50% align:center
[MARY] So that intense guy was
one of Juzo's acquaintances.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
Why am I not surprised?

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
Yeah. And Juzo told
me to head back home

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
since they had some
things to talk about.

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:56.718 position:50% align:center
Nice throat you got
there. That's new.

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
I take it you got that worked on

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
while Spitzbergen was
holding you prisoner.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
Huh? I... Yeah.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Thought so.

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
After all, I'd recognize
Victor's craft anywhere.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
But how can you be sure?

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.651 position:50% align:center
I couldn't work on your vocal
cords easily because of Harmony,

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
but my brother's another story.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
There aren't a lot of engineers

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
who can do a procedure
that complicated.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.161 position:50% align:center
Victor, huh?

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:27.332 position:50% align:center
Um, Mary, you were
able to meet him, right?

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
So, after learning more
about your past with him,

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
do you feel like
you got answers?

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
For now, at least, it's enough.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
Apparently his real body
is hidden away somewhere.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
But all that counts
is we were able to talk,

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
and I could ask questions
that had been on my mind.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
Honestly,

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.814 position:50% align:center
I'm still wrapping my head
around a lot of what he said.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.858 position:50% align:center
The important thing is
I know what I need to do.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
Find out where
his actual body is,

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
and fire another round of boob
rockets at that jerk's face.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, boob rockets?

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
Heh. So, yeah,
I do feel better now.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
The war ended years ago,

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
but your brother must still
feel guilty for his role.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
I mean he's working alongside
Spitzbergen after all.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
[MARY] Mm, well, that
was more of his puppet

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
than the real Victor,
so I'm not really sure.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
But I can't help imagine
being in his shoes

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
and watching helplessly

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
as my life's work
killed so many people.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
I would've ended up
regretting my actions as well.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
I wonder... how Juzo feels.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
I just wanna make this clear.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
I'm not blaming you for
what happened or anything.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
The fact that you did Five in
just caught me off guard.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
He was my partner.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
If anyone was gonna do it,

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
I figured it'd be me.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
So you were a Hands.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Yeah, long ago.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
It was me and
Gun Slave Unit Five...

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
...up until that day...

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
It was six years ago.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
Soldiers started saying
the war was ending soon.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
I remember because
it was the last time

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.897 position:50% align:center
I ate my favorite
meal as a human,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
a crawfish boil.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
The orders came from the top

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:21.696 position:50% align:center
to hand over my
partner immediately.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
Their reasoning was since
the war was almost over

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50% align:center
it was time to turn
the Gun Slave Units

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
back to normal Extended.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] But of course,
that was a cover story.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
Their real intention was
to dispose of the GSUs.

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
I followed orders
like a good soldier,

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
even though I knew the truth.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
I mean, that was our job.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
Do what your superiors tell you.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
But... he had other ideas.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
[FIVE] Since my Hands
discarded me like scrap,

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
that means I'm no longer
a tool for him to use.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
I have no master.
I'm finally free.

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] That's why Five
held a grudge against me

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
and wanted me dead.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
Thing is, I never
regretted my decision.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.916 position:50% align:center
I did whatever it
took to come back home...

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center
...for Emma.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] What happened
to Five after all that

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center
is still under wraps.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
So you gonna tell
me the real story?

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
At the very least, I think
you owe me an explanation

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
why you snuffed him out.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
He went AWOL from the military.

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] Sounds totally
in character for him.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
There's more.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
Afterward, he
started a rebellion

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50% align:center
with other Gun Slave
Units and their Hands.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
A rebellion?

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.784 position:50% align:center
And you put a stop to it.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Long story short,

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
you don't have to worry about
him showing up on your doorstep.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.460 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Does Juzo regret it?

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
Do you think he
would take them back--

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
all the things he had
to do during the war?

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Yeah. I imagine he does.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
You serious?

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.846 position:50% align:center
Obviously. It's hard
to make a living

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
when you've got
a huge gun for a head.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.726 position:50% align:center
That's not exactly what I meant.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong,

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
Gun Slave Units probably made
a huge difference during the war

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.815 position:50% align:center
and could've carved
their own paths after.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:24.277 position:50% align:center
Juzo doesn't have it in him
to be famous like Armed was,

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
but if he had played his cards
right, I'm sure he could've

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.532 position:50% align:center
wound up with a better
job than what he's doing now.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
The worst part is

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
I could've been hired on
as his personal engineer.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.789 position:50% align:center
And spent the rest of my days
getting paid serious cash

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
just to mess around
with new extensions.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
Man, talk about a waste!

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
You know, I thought a resolver

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50% align:center
was a job that
helped people out.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I see.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.926 position:50% align:center
That's why Juzo...

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Hm?

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center
Mary, did you know
that there were other

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
Gun Slave Units besides Juzo?

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
Well, the average person on the
street wouldn't know about that,

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.604 position:50% align:center
but this is a proper
engineer you're talking to.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
At the end of the war,
when they were active,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.443 position:50% align:center
there were 13 acting
Gun Slave Units including Juzo.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] They were split into
teams of two with their Hands.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
So thirteen pairs in total.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
Together they formed a unit

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center
and were collectively
known as the "Noble Rot."

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Back in the day,

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
there used to be a unit
called the Noble Rot.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
It was comprised of soldiers
who dropped to rock bottom

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:33.054 position:50% align:center
for the sake of their country.

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50% align:center
By giving themselves to
the rot, they seemed noble.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
What they lacked in numbers,

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
they made up for with
sheer firepower and range.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
The course of the war
changed 'cause of them.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
But that was then,

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
and nowadays there
are just a handful

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
of Gun Slave Units
still in existence.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
Only four have been confirmed.

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
Two of them are
imprisoned at Wunder Bender.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
One's under the
supervision of Beruhren,

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
and finally, there's Juzo.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
I take it the other nine
were killed during the war?

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
You'd think, but the fact
is they made it out alive.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
All of them.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
They died afterwards.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
So, how'd they bite the bullet?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
The military tried to
quietly dispose of them.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
But that's crazy!

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
This county wouldn't
have even won the war

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
if it wasn't for everything
the Gun Slaves did!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
But once it was over with,
overpowered weapons like them

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
became a source
of public backlash

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
and they had to
be decommissioned.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
All right, but that doesn't
explain why they let Juzo live.

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] Looks like
I owe you big time for this.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.751 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Don't worry about it.

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
One more thing.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Hm?

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
That partner of yours...

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
I remember him well.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
Said his brain
must be misfiring,

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
giving his Gun Slave a name.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.433 position:50% align:center
But now I understand why.

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
He was different.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
The guy really viewed
you as his partner.

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] We'll be
seeing you around, Juzo.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] Don't know about you,
but it rubs me the wrong way

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:18.702 position:50% align:center
calling you a number
like some tool.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
We'll use my grandpa's
native language to find a name.

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
Thirteen translates to... Juzo.

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] You were only following
orders from the higher-ups.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
Wasn't your fault.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
It was me. I was wrong
to treat you like a person.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.949 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Didn't see you there.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
They used to call
you Verrat Dreizhen.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
Device Thirteen,
the brethren slayer.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50% align:center
There were Gun Slave
Units that deserted,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
nine in all, and it
was your job to hunt down

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
and eliminate each of them.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.852 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Oh, yeah?
Where'd you hear that from?

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.937 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
I know you regret it.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.067 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] You turned
against your comrades.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
You executed them.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50% align:center
And ever since then,

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
you've used your power for other
people, not your own benefit.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
The guilt was too much

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
and you were searching for
a way to atone for your sins.

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
So you became a resolver to help
strangers.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.709 position:50% align:center
Lemme ask.

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
Who's been loading your
head with these ideas?

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
I came to the
conclusion on my own.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
Ever since we've met,

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:04.474 position:50% align:center
I've depended on you while
you've never asked for anything!

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.726 position:50% align:center
You fight for those in trouble

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
and put their needs
ahead of your own.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
No matter how
selfish the request!

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
Just like the job today!

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
It may have been
to find her husband,

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
but she was still using you!

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
You're always risking
your life for someone else!

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
And what do you fight for?

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.496 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
At first, I thought
I knew the answer to that.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.419 position:50% align:center
Then I learned the truth.

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
I used to provide
funding to Spitzbergen.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You what?

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
I was helping out
the terrorists!

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.387 position:50% align:center
Colt's death and so many others.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
Their lives might've
been lost 'cause of me!

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter
if I had amnesia!

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
The people Beruhren victimized--

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
I wanted to help them,

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
and it turns out I was
working for another oppressor.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
Now, I don't know what to do.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
How I'm supposed to feel
anymore or what I should do.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:05.326 position:50% align:center
How can I atone for the
suffering I've caused others?

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
I can't. There's nothing.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.790 position:50% align:center
I'm not as strong as you!

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
I almost wish

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.919 position:50% align:center
I had never discovered
my past and who I used to be!

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.755 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
If you hadn't found out,

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
do you think it
would change things?

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
Make the scars go away?

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
If you don't remember your past,

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
how're you supposed to grow?

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
Even so.

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] What's important
is the path you end up

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
taking after learning the truth.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:34.356 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You're lucky,

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
'cause you have a chance
to make those decisions.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] You get the freedom now
to determine your own fate.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.240 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
[HONEST]
I look forward to your results,

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
Chief of Security, Cunningham.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
Yes! On my life, I guarantee
the success of this mission!

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
[HONEST]
An interesting proposition.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
I'll remember those words.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
If you prove to be useful,

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
we may keep you around
a little while longer.

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:11.601 position:50% align:center
[CUNNINGHAM]
I won't disappoint!

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER sighs]
Whatta pain.

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN]
What was the hold up, Pepper?

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
Oh, you know,
that pig, Cunningham,

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
just kept squealing on and on,
but I scored these for you.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN] Are you kiddin' me?
You got four?

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
Just don't eat 'em all at once.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN]
Deal! [chuckles]

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
And when you're done,
we've got a job.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN] Judging by your mood,
it must be a good one.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:43.341 position:50% align:center
Sounds like your
pretty standard mission.

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
Although the pig said something

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
that might make this one
a little more interesting.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:49.931 position:50% align:center
Guess it wouldn't
hurt to play the role

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
of a good soldier for a sec.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Hard to believe...

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
...it was 25 years ago
when I began my research.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
Back in the early days,

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
there was hardly anyone who took
extension technology seriously.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
And now, Beruhren uses
it to remain in power.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
Even someone as godlike
and imposing as him

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
was merely a tool
for their bidding.

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
What an utter joke.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
You're surprised?

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.184 position:50% align:center
Throughout history,
no matter the era,

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
gods have always
served that purpose.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
By the way, are we still in the
dark as to Victor's whereabouts?

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:42.817 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
Yes.

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] There's no
denying he's a dangerous man.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
However, as long as he focuses
on exterminating the Extended,

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
he won't interfere.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.871 position:50% align:center
He's of no consequence
at the moment.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
We should target him.

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
He was critical in developing
extension technology.

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
To say he's the embodiment
of everything Spitzbergen

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:06.216 position:50% align:center
wishes to destroy would
be an understatement.

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
And while I have no desire
to speak out of turn,

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
it was a mistake to let him join
our ranks in the first place.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI chuckles]

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
Really? Do you plan on
getting rid of me as well?

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
Be honest.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.563 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
Please don't jest.

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
Without you, Spitzbergen
would never have existed.

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
But I can't lie, sir.

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
Some in the organization
believe your recent decisions

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
go against our goal of
eradicating extensions.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
And your methods have grown

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
increasingly
difficult to accept.

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI] Even though we
managed to capture the boy,

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.711 position:50% align:center
it was far from easy

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
and I thought crucial
to our overall goal.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
Yet, you willingly freed him,

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
preventing us from
retrieving the data,

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:55.265 position:50% align:center
and we lost a useful
asset against Beruhren.

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
So you can see why our
soldiers in this fight

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
might question your intentions.

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.480 position:50% align:center
Or, perhaps, there
is another objective

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
you haven't shared
with the organization?

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
I knew you'd make the right
decision and show up tonight,

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
Master Tetsuro.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.497 position:50% align:center
I'm a man of my word.

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
We'll call our surveillance
off of your friends.

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
Additionally, you have my
personal assurance

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
no harm will come to them.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.049 position:50% align:center
So, please, relax.

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
Your body is
important to us as well,

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
and we'll treat it
with the utmost care.

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
However, first things first.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
That's all the proof I needed.

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
Based on that reaction,

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
I know for certain
Harmony's been activated.

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
The device we installed
in your throat

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
isn't merely for vocalization.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.161 position:50% align:center
It also locks Harmony
in its current state,

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
preventing it from
being deactivated.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
As long as it remains on,

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
it's impossible for
control over a target

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
to be switched or
terminated by you.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.257 position:50% align:center
Poor Device Thirteen.

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
Even though Master Tetsuro

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:15.178 position:50% align:center
is the one who's currently
operating your body,

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
I take it you can still
hear my voice though.

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
I imagine there are
questions you wish to ask.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center
Like, for instance,
"Who is this old man?"

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.608 position:50% align:center
"What are his motivations?"

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
Seeing how the
night is still young,

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
why don't I pass the time
by sharing a story with you?

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
I had an older twin brother.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
Let me tell you about Lawrence.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:44.332 position:50% align:center
While I was born with weak legs
and a servile personality,

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:47.752 position:50% align:center
he came out strong,
full of life.

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:49.421 position:50% align:center
Back when I was a child,

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:53.466 position:50% align:center
I looked up to him as
the ideal human specimen.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
In the winter of our 17th year,

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
as the war cast
a darker and larger shadow

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
and seemed even more hopeless,

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
my brother was drafted to
fight in the bleak conflict.

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
I was lucky, but back then,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
I remember being disappointed
my legs kept me out of the war.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
It felt as though I
was a broken person

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
devoid of something crucial,

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
and the world was
leaving me behind.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
However, he soon returned.

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
The train that was
transporting my brother

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.876 position:50% align:center
had accidentally derailed,

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
and while his life was
spared, his legs were not.

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
Hello, Lawrence.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
The universe has got
a sick sense of humor, huh?

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
I mean, just
because we're twins,

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.974 position:50% align:center
we shouldn't have
to share the same fate.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
[LAWRENCE]
Your legs are useless.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
It would've been better if
you'd lost yours instead of me!

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
You'd still be
confined to that chair

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
and everyone wouldn't
have to be so damn sad!

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
[FATHER 19A]
There's no choice.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
We'll have to send one
of them to an institution.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER 19A] Shame he
wasn't injured during the war.

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
We could've seen some
government compensation.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
[FATHER 19A] It would have
been better if he had died.

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:07.874 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.460 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
And that's when it dawned on me.

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
[LAWRENCE cries]

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] There wasn't
any reason to despair.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center
I wasn't the one who
was lacking anything.

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
It was the rest of the world

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
that was born
with missing parts.

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
From that day on,
I immersed myself in research.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
I developed a system to
make up for such deficiencies

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
in what eventually became
known as extension technology.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:40.198 position:50% align:center
And thus,
the Extended were born.

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
A monstrous version
of humanity created by

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.662 position:50% align:center
replacing the elements
they desperately needed.

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:49.666 position:50% align:center
Terrifying, yes,
yet somehow beautiful.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
I see all of you as the children
I helped bring into this world.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
My name is Andy Wachowski.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
Together with Beruhren,

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
I developed the basic theories
extension technology relies on.

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
And as its progenitor,

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:10.937 position:50% align:center
I refuse to sit
idly by and do nothing

00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
while that company
operates with impunity.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
With you, and the
brethren slayer's, naturally,

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
we'll bring Beruhren
to justice for their crimes.

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
Built within every
Gun Slave Unit

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:27.120 position:50% align:center
is a limiter they're unable
to release by themselves.

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
It requires the
authorization of their Hands.

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
As I've mentioned,

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
that's where you
enter the equation.

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.338 position:50% align:center
Using Harmony's hacking ability,

00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:39.090 position:50% align:center
we should have no problem
removing the limiter.

00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
Only then can Device Thirteen
reach his full potential

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:43.928 position:50% align:center
and defeat Seven.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Now, then...

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
If you wouldn't mind unleashing

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:56.649 position:50% align:center
his marvelous power
for me, Master Tetsuro.

00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:28.825 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Such a foolish child.

00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:30.326 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] From the looks of things,
none of you get it.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.870 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI] Why are you
having so much trouble?

00:23:31.953 --> 00:23:33.413 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] But, there's still
a way to fight against them.

00:23:33.496 --> 00:23:35.415 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] Why don't we
begin with the negotiations?

00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:40.170 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
