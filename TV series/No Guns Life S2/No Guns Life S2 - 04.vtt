After witnessing today's
events, I may need to rethink

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
our position
regarding Gun Slave Units.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.629 position:50% align:center
Hmm. With the
sub-brain obliterated,

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:13.258 position:50% align:center
it'll make tracking down his
original body more difficult.

Hm?

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:19.055 position:50% align:center

Looks like this one's equipped
with an average sub-brain.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.509 position:50% align:center
Since you don't have
a parallel sub-brain,

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
I can assume this isn't
your real body either.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:05.518 position:50% align:center

You're breaking my heart.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
Seriously, though,

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
this is why capturing
Extendeds is so bothersome.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.769 position:50% align:center

They're receptors

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center

emitted by living creatures.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center

type of sensor installed,

I'll do whatever's necessary

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
to better allow me
to perform my duties.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.966 position:50% align:center

Yeah, guess so.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.885 position:50% align:center
Now, if we have
an understanding,

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
can we finally talk business?

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center

However, we both have
something the other wants.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
So, in my eyes,
this is the perfect chance

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
but since you're not
in position to do anything,

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
I suggest you take a
more hands-off approach.

Oh, wait, you are.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center

to get the procedure

remember what anymore.

What did I tell you?

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
Don't get involved
with Extendeds.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
You and Victor.

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
You share a brain, which
means you have his memories.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Even so, what of it?

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
You know what happened!

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
When he left the workshop.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
What happened between you two?

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] I told him I was
going to enlist in the war

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
as an engineer.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
Back then, the only way to
research extension technology

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.106 position:50% align:center
was through the military.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
He didn't like
the sound of that,

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
since I was supposed
to be his protege.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
That's when he made a threat.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
Said if I left,
he'd sell your body.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] I don't remember
much afterwards. It's a blur.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
By the time I came to,

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
he was hanging
from the winch, dead.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.385 position:50% align:center
That's all I can recall.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] I never intended
for it to happen,

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
but I don't regret
how things turned out.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
There's no way.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Victor.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:34.861 position:50% align:center
I wanna know why you walked away
without telling me anything!

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
Why did you leave me
behind to fend for myself?!

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
I loved you... very much,

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
but at the same time,

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
I was completely enthralled
by extension technology.

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
I felt it was my mission

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
to advance and spread
it across the globe.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
In short, to give
power to the powerless

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
and replace whatever it
was they might have lost.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.016 position:50% align:center
But soon I discovered
it was a forbidden power.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
Extensions not only
changed a subject's body,

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:12.232 position:50% align:center
but their soul into
something inhuman--monstrous.

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
They lose themselves
and fall into madness.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
You're an engineer.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
Surely, you've seen it.

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] I hunger for answers.

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
What the significance of this
type of technology is.

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
The true nature of the Extended.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:30.125 position:50% align:center
You're telling me that's why
you're helping Spitzbergen

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
and kept provoking Juzo to
full-out attack you just now?!

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Ironic, isn't it?

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
Before I realized it.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
I had become a monster myself,
known as the Dismantler.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
It's too late for me.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
I'm past the point of return.

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
I can't stop until
the Extendeds I created,

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
the product of my sins,
are all eliminated!

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
But why?!

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50% align:center
Why were you trying
to look inside of Juzo?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.784 position:50% align:center
You said your goal was
to kill of all of them!

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
That's different...

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
But you don't know,

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.332 position:50% align:center
because you only took part
of Victor's thought patterns

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
and expanded on them!

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
I am a copy.

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
He is me and I am him.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
We are the same entity.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.217 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
You're wrong!

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR gasps]

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
[MARY] It's true you and my
brother may share a brain,

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
but you are not Victor!

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
While there are times I think
I never really understood him,

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
there's one thing I am sure of!

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
[MARY] After he disappeared,
I wanted to know why...

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
...so badly that
I became an engineer.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
I imitated him the best
I could from memory,

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
so I could feel what he felt.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
[MARY] And there were times
I took pride in my work.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
But one day,
I realized the truth.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
Even if a person
is drowning in sorrow

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:07.389 position:50% align:center
over what they've lost,
they have the strength to heal.

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
To make up for
whatever they're missing.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.520 position:50% align:center
All we can do is
give them a small push.

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
That's the responsibility
of an engineer.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
When Victor looked
out on that battlefield,

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:21.111 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it made him realize

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
the dangers of
extension technology.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.451 position:50% align:center
But after what Lefty,
after what Victor said to me,

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:29.744 position:50% align:center
I'm positive...

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:34.082 position:50% align:center
...he realized his mistake
wasn't the Extended.

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.917 position:50% align:center
It was his arrogance.

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
The belief he had the power
to make people stronger.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
He doesn't.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
You're a human!

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.385 position:50% align:center
Only flesh and blood.

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
What makes you think you
can understand an Extended?

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
I look at their faces.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
And somehow, I just know.

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:04.529 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] You really
have nothing better to do

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
except cause me trouble.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
What am I going to do with you?

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Aw, crap.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
Surprisingly, you're not the one

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
I've got business with tonight.

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
[AVI grunts, gasps]
What happened?

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
Couldn't wait.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
You'd do whatever it
took to arrest Victor.

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
Perhaps even conspiring
with Spitzbergen,

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
which is a serious offense.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:36.644 position:50% align:center
I'll hear your excuses
once we return to my office,

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:40.732 position:50% align:center
ex-substitute EMS
director, Avi Cobo.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.610 position:50% align:center
[AVI] Olivier! You bitch!
Where's your evidence?!

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
Take him away.

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
[MARY] You should get out
of here while you still can.

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
We can't afford
to let EMS catch you.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, they'll
use your sub-brain

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
to locate your
body before we can.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
But don't think this
conversation's done.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.383 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I also messed
with the wiring in your arm,

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:09.302 position:50% align:center
so you're gonna have
problems doing anything shady.

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
You did? Just now?

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
Also, there's one more thing.

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
My friends, where
are you holding them?

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
They better not be hurt.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] Rest assured,
the hostages are fine.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:26.945 position:50% align:center
Honestly, the boy would probably
be safer staying with them,

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
rather than anyone else.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
From the looks of it,

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
you can braid your
hair on your own now.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
I meant what I said--

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
how I wish you never
became an engineer.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
you're better at it than me.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Victor!

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
I swear... one day...

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
...I'll set things straight.

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
What're you so nervous for?

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:15.493 position:50% align:center
I just wanna take a
little peek inside a' you!

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
Prepare thyself, Lefty!

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
--[thud]
--Hey! Where're you--? [yelps]

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Engineer down.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I'm almost afraid to ask.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to take a look
inside Lefty, but he's shy.

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
No doubt about it.

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
You and Victor are
definitely siblings.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
Not sure that
I catch your drift.

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] What're you hoping to
figure out by examining him?

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
[MARY] It stinks but,
we can't go over his data logs.

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
It'd be a different story

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
if Lefty had a sub-brain
of his own but--

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
Uh! [gasps]

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
Intelligence wise,
he's about as smart as a dog.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
So don't expect
to talk with him.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
Plus, it may be
almost impossible for him

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
to lead us to Victor. [giggles]

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
What really fascinates me is how
he moves independently, though!

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.675 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
There's that look.

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Uh, ah...

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
Welp, guess we're gonna have to

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
look for Victor
the 'ol fashioned way.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Mary, there's no "we"
until you let yourself heal up.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
A human body can't be
easily replaced like mine.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
Just want 'em
back home, you know?

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] You don't have
to worry about them.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
You got somethin'
up your sleeve?

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:49.421 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:50.505 position:50% align:center
The door's open.

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
Tell me, how are you feeling
today, young Master Tetsuro?

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
Confused actually.

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
I was told Harmony
would interfere with

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
my ability to speak,

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't
seem to be the case.

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
How's that possible?

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] It must've proven
to be quite inconvenient.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
I'm very thankful
we were able to

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
get the best engineer available

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
to oversee the
procedure for you.

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:18.116 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] There's something
else I wanted to ask.

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
By all means.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] While I barely
have any memory of you.

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
I know who you are.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
Then again,
I imagine everyone does.

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] You're the father
of extension technology,

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
Professor Wachowski.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
During the Great War,

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
you were responsible for
advancing Extended tech

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
and ensuring this
country's victory.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
It's an exaggeration to
hold me in such high regard.

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
I was merely one
researcher out of several

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
who helped to develop
the base theory of extensions.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
Regardless, sir,

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
why is a man in your
position helping terrorists?

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] I might pose
the same question to you.

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
After all, you
are Master Tetsuro,

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center
the son of Beruhren's
Chief Executive Officer.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
I would never work
with Spitzbergen!

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
While your memory
loss is regrettable,

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
it doesn't change the fact
you were assisting our cause.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
All right, let's
pretend for a minute

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
that what you're saying's true.

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
What were my
reasons for joining?

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] While I don't claim
to know your exact motivations.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
I believe the company's
mistreatment of you

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
would be sufficient provocation.

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Whatever the reason,

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
the fact is you
supported Spitzbergen.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
And the role you play
within the organization is...

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
How do I put this?

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
Most critical.

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
There is a Gun Slave Unit

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
working alongside
Beruhren, known as Seven.

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
Over and over again,

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
he's proven to be an
obstacle in our activities.

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
The only way a Gun
Slave Unit can be defeated

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
is if another Gun Slave
Unit fights against it.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
That's why you needed hostages.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
Whoever this Seven guy is

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:59.050 position:50% align:center
you want Juzo to be
forced to eliminate him, huh?

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
For the most part,

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
you've done brilliantly,
except for one small error.

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:08.184 position:50% align:center
Presently, Juzo has no chance
of beating Beruhren's GSU.

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
You don't seem convinced.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
However, I know everything
about Juzo Inui,

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
or should I say,
Device Thirteen.

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:20.405 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:23.408 position:50% align:center
Such as... Well, in order
for a Gun Slave Unit

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
to become fully
functional, there's a price.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:30.165 position:50% align:center
They would have to give up
their will and become a tool.

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:31.833 position:50% align:center
A tool?

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
With your help
and using Harmony.

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
I'm certain that
we will succeed in

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
coaxing out Thirteen's
true form, Young Master.

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:43.928 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
I should also mention,

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
we've been keeping tabs on
the people you're close to.

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.059 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
And as long as you fully
cooperate with our demands,

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
I can assure you they
will remain unharmed.

00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:28.616 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] You have the
data on you, don't you?

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.951 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
...take 'em by surprise.

00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:31.453 position:50% align:center
[ANDY] So, um, did
you want to get a cut?

00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:33.496 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
I mean, Juzo is super dense.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.331 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE] Just a shampoo.

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:39.753 position:50% align:center
