Yes, with one caveat.

First, you have to receive

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center
The problem is the unit

But, based off tests,

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
you're somewhat compatible

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
To put it simply,

Juzo?

[JEAN CLAUDE]
If it hadn't been for you,

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
my wife and son
would still be alive.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
They got crushed
by falling debris.

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:34.778 position:50% align:center
They died suffering.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
[JEAN CLAUDE]
Just accept it.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center
The only way to atone for your
sins is by paying in blood!

Cool your jets, old timer.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center
It's your fault!

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for you

00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:57.592 position:50% align:center
Why you?

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Huh?

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER] Why'd you make it
out there instead of Seven?

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
Against him, there's no way
you could've won unless...

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50% align:center
...after I was shot,

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
you gave in and became
someone else's weapon!

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
I wanna know the truth!

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
If I wasn't good enough to
pull your trigger, then who was?

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:21.366 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER gasps, shouts]

[PEPPER gasps]

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
Like I told this guy, relax.

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
I'm worthless.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Huh?

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.673 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER] I'm nothing
without my Hands unit!

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
And now that it's gone,

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
all of you are
looking down on me!

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
Even Seven!

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
So just drop me already!

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I can't.

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:48.226 position:50% align:center
It would go against
what he hired me for.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER]
Uh?

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
The job from Seven.

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN yelling]

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:14.002 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Don't do it! You know
what'll end up happening.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You're pushing yourself too far.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
[JUZO grunts]

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Huh?

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN] Whoever that girl is,
she's got nothing to do with me.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
But she was the reason you...

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN]
No matter what she tells you,

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
this was my decision.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN]
What happened here, everything--

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
it was my wish.

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:02.425 position:50% align:center
That's what matters...
more than anything.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Juzo Inui?

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:06.596 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Damn it, kid.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN]
This is the worst.

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I'm
asking you for a favor.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN groans]

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN]
I have one more wish.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN] Promise...
you'll take care of her...

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
[SEVEN]
...for me.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER] And you said they were
a pair of twin female Extendeds?

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
Those are the secretaries
of Beruhren's top officials.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
I met them once before.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER]
I guess...

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:56.563 position:50% align:center
...they took back Seven
since I'm no longer a Hands.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Gun Slave Units
were made to be weapons.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
That much is true.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
But Hands don't
control them mentally,

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
or tell them what to think.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
It's just, after the amount
of extension work done,

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
our memories are lost and
feelings are easier to control.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
You thought he was something
you owned--a sidearm.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:22.589 position:50% align:center
But he was the one that
decided to stay by your side.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.216 position:50% align:center

Jeez, this is so dumb.

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:36.644 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Hm?

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER]
I thought you needed someone.

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center
Clearly, you've already got 'em.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER]
Come to think of it,

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
I said if you beat Seven,
I'd give you something.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
I swore I'd tell you where
that partner of yours is.

[OLIVIER]
The man you captured on the roof

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
is named Jean Claude.

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
He's a member of
the Security Bureau.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
Lost his family when
the Armed Statue collapsed.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.929 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I see.

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] I listened
in on your conversation...

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
...and now I know.

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
No. I've always known.

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50% align:center
The size of this leviathan that

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
I'm going to end up
facing off with.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
It's obvious my superiors have
been colluding with Beruhren.

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
After all they've done,
I can't remain silent.

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:35.412 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Olivier.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
Go home, Juzo.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
Nice coat.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
Apparently, you're more of
a womanizer than I thought.

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.507 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Huh? What?

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.093 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Uh?

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER grunts]
I'm so pissed off right now.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
My clothes smelled all fresh.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:47.192 position:50% align:center
Now they reek of gunpowder
because of that moron.

[SUISO]
Once we get through here,

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
you'll reach western HQ.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Why are you doing this?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
You know, don't you?

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
What'll happen if you go back
to the military after running?

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] They're goin' to
dispose of me either way.

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
You didn't have to
bother coming back.

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
[SUISO]
Couldn't do that to a partner.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
Treat 'em like he was some tool.

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Just wouldn't feel right.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] I guess you can chalk
it up to my own selfishness.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
We fought in a war together.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
That time should mean something.

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I was your shooter,

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
but I should've done a much
better job of aiming you.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] As for the military,
I wouldn't be too concerned.

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:30.378 position:50% align:center
Can't imagine they'll
treat you too harshly.

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] It's what comes
after that's important.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
[SUISO]
Go out and live, Juzo.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
Laugh.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.228 position:50% align:center
Act like an idiot.

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
Struggle and suffer...
like a normal person.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
Then make friends,

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
so you can have someone
to laugh about life with.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] It's important to have
people like that in your life.

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] One day, as the seasons
change and the snow falls,

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
we should meet
back at this spot...

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:12.420 position:50% align:center
...when we're
both able to laugh.

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.633 position:50% align:center
--[SUISO] Hey, Juzo.
--[TETSURO] Hey, Juzo!

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Hm?

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
We came to get you.

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] Chris was worried
you got into more trouble

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
since you were so
late coming home.

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
I can't be the
only one who thinks

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:31.606 position:50% align:center
it's weird for a hospital
to have this many steps.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] It's unlikely they
would do anything rash

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
given recent events.

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
But still, is it smart going
outside with Beruhren after you?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.575 position:50% align:center
I admit, it's a valid point,

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
but I do need to
get accustomed to

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
this new sub-brain
inhibitor Mary installed.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
It's called rehabilitation!

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:52.293 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
It seems like you've got
something weighing on your mind.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
It's because I know the truth.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
The size of the monster I'm
gonna have to go up against.

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER] I swore I'd tell you
where that partner of yours is.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.033 position:50% align:center
Stop trying so hard
to act so cool.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:26.494 position:50% align:center
Especially when you're rocking
a cutesy patch on your tooshie.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.496 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
She's right. That is lovely.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
The ladies are falling
for you left and right!
