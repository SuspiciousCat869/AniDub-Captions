00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.637 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Heard you
got your position back.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
To be precise,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
I'm still considered
a substitute director.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
Now then, if you'd
hand over the data...

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Sorry, but like
I told that Avi guy,

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
I sold it to make up
for some other jobs

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
that didn't end up paying.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
Don't get the wrong idea, Juzo.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
This isn't a social
visit to catch up over tea.

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:42.208 position:50% align:center
You violated
Extend Law yet again.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
Not only did you
completely destroy

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.004 position:50% align:center
a highly wanted
criminal's sub-brain,

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:49.007 position:50% align:center
making it difficult to
track his whereabouts;

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.718 position:50% align:center
you assisted with his escape.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] Even with that
soot-filled head of yours,

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you understand.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:00.643 position:50% align:center
I could ship you off to
Wunder Bender this instant,

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
and not even you could
make a case in your defense.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.690 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You got me there.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:08.985 position:50% align:center
Truth is, things aren't
so great at the moment.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.821 position:50% align:center
You won't get any
resistance from me.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] But before you
send me away for good,

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.537 position:50% align:center
there's something I gotta do.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:24.376 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] Why didn't you say so?
Then let's get it over with.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:25.710 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Sorry.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:28.505 position:50% align:center
Even if I had the
data you're looking for,

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.964 position:50% align:center
I'd need to hold on to it

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:33.426 position:50% align:center
to fix this little
problem I'm dealing with.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.309 position:50% align:center
Know what I hate?

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:47.857 position:50% align:center
People with causes they see as
more important than themselves.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.275 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Hm?

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.655 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Tetsuro and Chris!

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:56.199 position:50% align:center
You saved them from Spitzbergen?

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.495 position:50% align:center
I wish I was able
to take the credit.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.542 position:50% align:center
But it's simply not the case.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.378 position:50% align:center
Apparently, they were let go.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.588 position:50% align:center
Not a scratch on them.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.841 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Why would Spitzbergen do that?

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:15.010 position:50% align:center
We have them both
in our custody,

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.178 position:50% align:center
and we're trying to figure
out if any kind of deal

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:20.682 position:50% align:center
was made in exchange
for their freedom.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:24.352 position:50% align:center
They'll be released
in two or three days.

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:25.937 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
You have my word.

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:28.940 position:50% align:center
I personally
guarantee their safety.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
[JUZO grunts]

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] So, you see,
there's no longer any reason

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:38.283 position:50% align:center
for you to keep the
data all to yourself.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE]
They call me Podpie.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.965 position:50% align:center
I'm one of the many
Extendeds living in this city.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE]
When the trail goes cold,

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
you give me a call.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
I don't miss a thing.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
Thanks to these eyes,
I've been solving crimes

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
and maintaining
peace from the shadows.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE]
I wonder if it's enough, though.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
No matter how hard you work,

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
there's only so much that
can be done by the book.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
Fine by me.

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
The job's all that counts.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.873 position:50% align:center
And I'll continuing
honing my skills...

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:53.168 position:50% align:center
...by walking these
streets every night...

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
...for one purpose:

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
Satisfying my true objective.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
Isn't that...?

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
[SPITZBERGEN HENCHMAN 17A]
We can confirm.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center
The individual visiting
Juzo is EMS's director.

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.187 position:50% align:center
[SPITZBERGEN LEADER]
Then we can assume the data's

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
already been destroyed.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
And along with it,
any chance of proving

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
the government knew the dangers

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
associated with
extension technology!

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
It may not be too late.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
Order the attack.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
This time, we won't hesita--

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE howls]

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
[SPITZBERGEN LEADER]
What was that? The enemy?

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU] No. Looks like
just a drunk causing problems.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
They're of no consequence.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
[SPITZBERGEN LEADER] It may be
a surprise attack set up by EMS.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
We can't be discovered!

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
Let's kill 'em!

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
[SPITZBERGEN LEADER]
Shimazu! Do not engage!

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center
Stand down. We'll report
back to the elder.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.685 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
Understood.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
[MARY laughs]

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center
[ROSA] Please, Mary. Would
you mind not laughing so much?

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
[MARY] The way you
described Juzo just now--

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
you've gotta be talkin'
about the wrong guy!

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
He's the opposite of cool.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.378 position:50% align:center
[ROSA] You don't think
he's kind of amazing?

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:22.465 position:50% align:center
What about how he braved danger
and came to my rescue?

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
And... after I said
such terrible things.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
Nah, don't worry. The guy's
emotionally bullet proof.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
[ROSA]
Even if it didn't bother him,

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
I was thinking...

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
Remember the coat
I borrowed from Mister Juzo?

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
How it got tattered?

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
[ROSA] I thought maybe
I could fix it myself...

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
[MARY grunts]

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
[ROSA]
...to thank him.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
I read in a magazine that men
value handmade presents more.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
Is that a fact?

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:55.832 position:50% align:center
[ROSA] I mean, I could
always send him a new coat.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
My only concern is, it wouldn't
properly convey my feelings.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, so this is
more than a thank you gift?

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
What? Of course not!
I just wanted to--

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.848 position:50% align:center
[MARY] The only problem
is Juzo's super dense.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
Be upfront!

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
Be direct!

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, he'll
never pick up on it.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
[ROSA]
Hmm...

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
These days, I'm free
to do whatever I please.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
I'll try my best.

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center

be up in his office.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
[ROSA] Who is she?!
I was wrong about you!

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center

with the help of
extension technology,

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.081 position:50% align:center
there're some things

Don't care who you are,

[JUZO grunts]

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
You want me out of your sights,
hand over the data.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center

daughter. How about that?

is interrogating them,

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
at least those two
are out of danger.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
Not like I'm in a rush
for Chris to be released.

The longer they hold her,
the longer till rent's due.

Isn't that right?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
Dad, be quiet!

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
After all the recent commotion,

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
I haven't had any
customers come in.

[SCARLET, JUZO]
Uhh...

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
At this rate, my cutting skills

Hm?

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
Especially me.

When I heard you were
going to see those terrorists,

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:18.118 position:50% align:center
I was so worried about you.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
Come on!

Those arms you're using--

I take it that's
Mary's handiwork?

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
No, actually--

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center
[ANDY] That girl's certainly
popular.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
I hear her work keeps getting
better and better.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
Impressive for someone her age.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking of
getting a checkup myself.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
While I'm at it,

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.814 position:50% align:center
maybe I should see if
she can upgrade my look

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.774 position:50% align:center
to something a
little more trendy.

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Great idea.
You should also ask her

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.778 position:50% align:center
to do something about
that big mouth of yours.

I'd ask if you want
a haircut, but, uh...

Stop being rude, Dad!

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm busy with another

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50% align:center
but if you don't
mind waiting a bit,

I can fit you in afterwards.

Mm. Please do.

Did I do something wrong?

to lower your seat now.

turn back over this way.

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center

a warm towel over your eyes.

coming home from work?

[JUZO gasps]

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
So here's the deal.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.395 position:50% align:center
Our perv's using an
image scanning device.

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
One known as the MALS system.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.566 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Huh?

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
[MARY] Stands for Multiple
Alternative Light Sources.

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
It's a system that uses
ultraviolet and infrared lights

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
to see beyond the
limits of the human eye

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
and find hidden evidence.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
It was originally developed
for the Security Bureau

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
and other government
research facilities.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.752 position:50% align:center
Our little voyeur here
had the tech installed

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
directly into his eye sockets.

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] I'm still lost.
What exactly did he do?

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Weren't you listening?

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
He has the ability
to see what's hidden.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
Basically, x-ray vision!

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
X-ray vision?

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET squeaks]

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Of course, this technology

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
hasn't been approved
for public use.

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
It's an illegal extension.

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
[MARY] Even so,
it's a fairly cheap one.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
So, if you don't mind the risk
involved with the procedure,

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
it's relatively easy to
get on the black market.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Meaning, this guy...

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
My guess is he's lying about

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
being part of
the Security Bureau.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE] I'm not lying!

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET, JUZO, MARY gasp]

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE]
For your information,

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
I really used to
be a data analyst!

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center
However, after having these
optic extensions installed,

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
my desire to use
them for personal gain

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.135 position:50% align:center
became too much to handle,

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:52.846 position:50% align:center
and I wasn't able to control
my impulses any longer!

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:57.225 position:50% align:center
That was the only reason
those fools decided to fire me!

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center

Uhh...

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
In other words,

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
the noble cause you
were talking about...

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE] I must document
and show the beautiful bodies

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center
that've caught my
eye to every man.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
Not just here,
but all over the world!

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
My name's John Podpie! The

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center
That's nothing to go around
braggin' about! You perv!

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
I managed to
extract all the data.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
Let's turn this guy over
to EMS and be done with him!

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE]
What? EMS? Truly a foolish move!

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:33.887 position:50% align:center
But I shouldn't be surprised.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
Your heart must be
as tiny as your chest!

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.932 position:50% align:center
Comment on my
chest one more time,

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
and see what happens, pervert!

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE yells]

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE]
Like I expect a woman

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
to comprehend the
importance of my work!

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
It's your fault!

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
You're the ones who took away
my job, my family! Everything!

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.031 position:50% align:center
As if this flimsy
bucket is enough

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
to contain the light
of my all-seeing eyes!

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
My gaze penetrates
the impenetrable!

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
I'll bring your darkest
secrets into the light!

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
And with it, your complete
and utter humiliation! Uh--

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE]
Your... body.

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
What's going on in there?

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Shut up.

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.314 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE grunts]

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] You talk about
as much as the old man.

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.319 position:50% align:center
You oughta be ashamed.

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:33.405 position:50% align:center
You're old enough
to be her father.

00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE whimpers]

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] If you're an adult,
start acting like one.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
Admit your faults instead of
blaming others and lashing out.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE whimpers]

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
Uh, Juzo?

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Here.

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
What happened just now?
What happened?

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
What happened just now?
What happened?!

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
His mind's out to lunch.

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.515 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
[ANDY gasps]

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE gasps]

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET]
Whatever his reasons,

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they were
important to him.

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
And thanks to Mary,
we got the images back.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
So as long as he promises
not to do it again,

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
we should let him go free.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Huh?!

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
You're being way too
lenient on this creep!

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET] But he seems
to have genuine regret

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
for what he's done.

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:24.831 position:50% align:center
[MARY] We can't just
slap him on the wrist!

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
Otherwise he'll go
and do it again!

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] What do you
think? Got an opinion?

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:32.088 position:50% align:center
I just work here.

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
Can't even use that head of
his to practice cutting hair.

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE whimpers]

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
--[SCARLET] Yes, I do!
--[MARY groans]

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE] What happened
just now? What was that?

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:46.227 position:50% align:center
What happened just now?
What was that? What was that?!

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
What was-- [sobbing]

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Almost forgot something.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE gasps]

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Some parting advice:

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
Why don't you try
using that power of yours

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
for something you
actually believe in?

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE gasping]

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] 'Cause I'm only
gonna tell you this once.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
You abuse that
ability of yours again,

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
and my fist is the last
thing you're gonna see!

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:09.959 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
[PODPIE whimpering]

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Just remember...

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] ...if you're not careful,
you'll end up becoming a tool.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:27.143 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you're talking
to yourself more than him.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.397 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Think so?

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Yeah, I do.

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Verrat Dreizehn!

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
Device Thirteen,
the Brethren Slayer!

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
Your legacy is written in blood!

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Back in the day,

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
there used to be a unit
called the Noble Rot.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
[MARY grunts]

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
It was comprised of soldiers

00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
who dropped to rock bottom
for the sake of their country.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
By giving themselves to
the rot, they seemed noble.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
Do you mean that...?

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] His abilities still have
ways they can be used for good.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] He and I are
two different calibers.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Now then...

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
...old man, let's get
this wrapped up.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
Hey! Wait...

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.630 position:50% align:center
[MARY] Juzo... you know
there're people out there

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
who've been saved by your power.

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
Don't forget.

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:28.742 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] You aren't
surprised? Seeing my face?

00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:30.243 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] I need you to
find my husband Edmund.

00:23:30.326 --> 00:23:31.786 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] What an utterly
unexpected turn of events!

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.996 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 17A] I've never seen
you in the military register.

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:35.582 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
I'm sorry. Please forgive me!
