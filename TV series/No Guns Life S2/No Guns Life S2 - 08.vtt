00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.802 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] And thus,
the Extended were born.

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:13.847 position:50% align:center
A monstrous version of
a human created by replacing

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.142 position:50% align:center
the elements they
desperately needed.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
Terrifying, yes,
yet somehow beautiful.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
My name is Andy Wachowski.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
Together with Beruhren

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:32.574 position:50% align:center
I developed the basic theories
extension technology relies on.

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
And as its progenitor.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
I refuse to sit
idly by and do nothing

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.874 position:50% align:center
while that company
operates with impunity.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
Built within every
Gun Slave Unit

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
is a limiter they're unable
to release by themselves.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:49.841 position:50% align:center
It requires the
authorization of their Hands.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:53.219 position:50% align:center
As I've mentioned, that's
where you enter the equation.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
Using Harmony's hacking ability,

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
we should have no problem
removing the limiter.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.434 position:50% align:center
Only then can Device Thirteen

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.729 position:50% align:center
reach his full potential
and fight Seven.

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.612 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Now, then,

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
if you wouldn't mind unleashing

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
his marvelous power
for me, Master Tetsuro.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.255 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Hold your fire.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.257 position:50% align:center
We have the main body here.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.968 position:50% align:center
He won't be able to
put up a real struggle.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:37.847 position:50% align:center
Take care not to
injure him too much.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.307 position:50% align:center
Though some amount of discipline

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:42.102 position:50% align:center
may be unavoidable
at this point.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU chuckles]
Who would have thought I'd have

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:31.211 position:50% align:center
my rematch with you
under these circumstances?

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
Makes no difference if you're
being controlled by that child.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.801 position:50% align:center
Don't expect me
to show you any mercy.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
I'll have my vengeance.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
You bastard!

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI] I realize they're
up against a Gun Slave Unit.

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
However, it's only
being piloted by a child.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center
Imagine when we
harness that power.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
Go join them.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
But, sir.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
I doubt our guest here
will give me any trouble.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
Fine, then.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
How foolish can one be?

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
I offered a hand
to the pitiful boy

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
and this is how he
shows his gratitude?

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center
A shame.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
Seems we've no choice but to
find a way to extract Harmony.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
Yes. Carve it out.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Be quiet.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
If you call for help,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.863 position:50% align:center
I'll unplug the life support
system connected to your chair.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] Impossible. I
haven't disengaged Harmony yet.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
At this moment,

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center
you should be possessing
Device Thirteen.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Harmony is active.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
I used it to hack
into my own sub-brain.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Hm? You mean this entire time.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
I never controlled Juzo.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
Your men are fighting
the real deal.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU yelling]

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
[JUZO grunts]

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
The hell?

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50% align:center
You're him!

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
Which means that brat
never used Harmony on you!

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Yeah, right.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
About that. Tetsuro asked
for my help handling you guys,

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
so he could settle his
own problems in peace.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] He always needed
me to hold his hand,

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
but now he wants to take charge.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:38.838 position:50% align:center
You have the freedom now
to determine your own worth.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU grunts]

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.050 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
He's accepted his weaknesses

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
and wants to take
responsibility for his past

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
to keep moving forward.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Damn.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
How'd that little
punk get to be so cool?

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
It may have been deceptive,

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
but I needed to have
a discussion with you

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center
in private one last time.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
Now, let's begin negotiations,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
Professor Wachowski.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
I have a single demand for you.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
From this point forward.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
I want Spitzbergen's
terrorist acts to stop.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] Don't tell me this
is your idea of negotiating.

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI chuckles]

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
My apologies.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
Such a lofty demand would affect
the very basis of our group.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
You'll have to match
that price of course.

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
So what do you offer in return

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
for making such
a drastic change?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine you have

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
anything of equal
value to trade.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Myself.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
I will surrender and
work with Spitzbergen.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
You wanted me to
eliminate a target.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
Seven, right?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
There is a Gun Slave Unit

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
working alongside
Beruhren, known as Seven.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
Over and over again,

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
he's proven to be an
obstacle in our activities.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
I can neutralize the
powers of a Gun Slave Unit

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
on my own by using Harmony.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
There's no need to involve Juzo.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
Heh. What should we call
this act of self-sacrifice?

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
Martyrdom, perhaps?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
Seems the guilt of aiding
terrorists has radicalized you.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
Made you a reflection
of your former glory.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
I've no intention of sacrificing
anyone, including myself.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Such noble ideals.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
Do you think they
can instigate change?

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:54.599 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] I may have lost my
memories as Tetsuro Arahabaki,

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
the son of Beruhren's CEO...

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
...but I remember what they do
in the shadows perfectly well.

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
Their heartless
experiments have to stop,

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
and I'll make sure they do,
as soon as possible.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
By handing yourself over to us?

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
I'll work with you

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:15.078 position:50% align:center
until Seven is defeated.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI chuckles]

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
On the subject of
Beruhren's crimes,

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
there's gotta be a way to expose
them

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
without using terrorism.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center
Whatever the method is,

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
I want Spitzbergen
to start using it!

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.634 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] When you were
released a few days ago,

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
you were quite fortunate.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
I let you go with all
your limbs still intact.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
There are many in the
organization who would have

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
preferred to see
you mercilessly killed

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
to serve as a
warning to Beruhren.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:47.277 position:50% align:center
At best, others view you
merely as a bargaining chip.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.113 position:50% align:center
I'm curious, what do you think?

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
Will people with those ideals
be willing to listen to you?

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] It looks as
though you've considered

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
that possibility, however, in
reality, you understand nothing.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
For example,

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
do you know why we
commit acts of terrorism?

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center
The answer is we simply
have no other choice.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50% align:center
After the conclusion
of the Great War,

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
Beruhren gained control
over half of the country.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
The government
is their loyal dog,

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
the press, their mouth
piece, and the economy,

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
manipulated to be
dependent on extensions.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
I don't need a lecture about

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
how far reaching
Beruhren's grasp is.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] So, you know
their final objective, then?

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
Tell me, why do they insist on

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
conducting their
cruel experiments?

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
Surely they must serve
some specific purpose.

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.793 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Because, they...

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
My dear boy, it's time
I shared something important.

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:55.553 position:50% align:center
The reason I'm collaborating
with Spitzbeargen.

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
More specifically,
the reason I created it.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
What'd you say? Created?

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
That's right.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
I wanted to see
my original visions

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
for both extension technology
and Beruhren achieved.

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
Long ago, years before
you were even conceived,

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
things were different.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
Beruhren focused solely on
research and development.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
Worthwhile things.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
It was founded by Wurzel,

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
a board consisting
of four members:

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
There was CSO Strange,

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
CTO Dreamy, CMO Timid,

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:38.388 position:50% align:center
and COO Honest.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
At the time, I was an engineer
working directly under them.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
It was us against the world,

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
fighting to develop
extension technology,

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
so people could live full lives,

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
despite the hand
fate dealt them.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
Honest, she was
the core of Wurzel,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
and together, we worked
toward the same dream.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] However, as the
years passed, there was a shift.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
And the ideals
we once strove for,

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:10.045 position:50% align:center
that I thought we shared,
slowly began to erode.

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
Their research became
less about how to live

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
and more about
how to avoid dying.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
Until finally, it
was the sole objective

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
they poured their money into.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
Now, here we are.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
Beruhren Corp has mutated into
a giant life support system,

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center
meant to keep a select
few alive indefinitely.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
And what about my father,
Souichiro Arahabaki?

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
All the illegal
human experiments,

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:40.617 position:50% align:center
wasn't he the one
who gave the orders?

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Arahabaki? He has no real power.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
His name's just
a cover for Wurzel.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:49.250 position:50% align:center
They've been using it for years
to conceal their involvement.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.503 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO gasps]

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.588 position:50% align:center
As we speak,
your father is still

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
working directly
underneath COO Honest.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
After the war,
I escaped from the company

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
and created an
organization in response.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
Thus, Spitzbergen was born.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
My intention was
to monitor Beruhren

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
and warn the rest of the
world about their activities.

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:17.612 position:50% align:center
However, most of our members
were victims of Extended crime.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
And gradually, we turned
into a refuge for anyone

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.575 position:50% align:center
who opposed the government.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:26.746 position:50% align:center
Like Beruhren, our original
principles became distorted.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
Today, we're just
a terrorist organization

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
that wants to end Extended.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
I can't stop them.

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
Spitzbeargen has
grown beyond my control.

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
Yes, you can!

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
Of course... there is
a plan that would work.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
In order for it to
be a success however,

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
I require Device
Thirteen's body.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.605 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU groans]

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
We're not done...

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
As long as I'm breathing,
the match continues!

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
You haven't beaten me.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] You got heart,
but that's the problem.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
Even though your armor's
improved since our last go,

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
you're still guts
and bone underneath.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:14.002 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU groans]

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU groans]

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] If we keep
going at it like this,

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
I can't guarantee
you'll survive.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.513 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
What was that?

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:30.560 position:50% align:center
[JUZO groaning]

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You gotta be kiddin'!

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.285 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI] I can hit any
trigger point on an Extended

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:48.661 position:50% align:center
with my needle rounds.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
Once they're embedded,
I'm in control of the target

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
and can make them
suffer random seizures.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Yeah, save your breath.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:00.674 position:50% align:center
This ain't exactly
my first gun show.

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:02.842 position:50% align:center
That's right. Now I remember.

00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
You and Kronen have met before.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
Even worked together,
from what I hear.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
It's a pity a peer of mine
ended up being such a failure.

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
Kunugi!

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
The brat isn't operating
Device Thirteen!

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
His mind's still in his original
body with the Professor!

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
You don't say?

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
I figured as much.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
Uh?

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.159 position:50% align:center
For someone being controlled
against their will.

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
I wasn't detecting the
number of disturbances

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
expected in his neural system.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.707 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU]
You idiot!

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
What've you done?

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
You knew all along and
left the elder's side anyway?

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
If something happens to him,

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
your hands are
stained with his blood!

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
One kid with Harmony on
lockdown is no danger to him.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
The old man can handle himself.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.057 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Meaning what?

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:56.563 position:50% align:center
Let's just do our job
and hold this Extended back.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.606 position:50% align:center
[JUZO groans]

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Hold... me back?

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
That's cute.

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
Looks like none of you
get it... once again.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
It's the other way around.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
I'm holding all of you back!

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
You're still able to move.

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
Now I see why Kronen
had trouble handling you.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
What a nuisance.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] The kid was never
counting on my power

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.718 position:50% align:center
to begin with!

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.472 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] He's trying to do
something none of you can

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
with all your weapons.

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:38.104 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] And I won't
let you get in the way!

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:40.106 position:50% align:center
If there's going
to be any real change,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center
I need dominion
over Device Thirteen.

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
The one you call Juzo Inui.

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:46.363 position:50% align:center
Seven--

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
he's the only GSU Beruhren
has control over.

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
He's the muscle behind
Wurzel, their enforcer,

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:55.747 position:50% align:center
and once he's removed,
Honest and the rest of the board

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.375 position:50% align:center
will see the
error of their ways.

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.795 position:50% align:center
I'm not following.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
Thirteen is special.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.090 position:50% align:center
That's because I was involved in

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
every level of its
production process.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.803 position:50% align:center
Thirteen has
a particular setting.

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
Something truly unique...

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.767 position:50% align:center
...that none of the
other twelve GSUs have.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50% align:center
You see, it represents
the fundamental difference

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:21.398 position:50% align:center
between Wurzel and
Honest's world view,

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
and my own philosophy.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
I'm sure once activated,

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
that disparity will become
painfully obvious to them.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
No. Only Honest will understand,
but she's the one that counts.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.165 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] There's one
way to destroy Wurzel.

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
By crushing their delusions and
proving them wrong.

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
I'll drive the
heathens out of Beruhren

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.966 position:50% align:center
and return it to
what it was meant to be.

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
Once that happens, putting
an end to their activities

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
will no longer be just a dream.

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
Do you understand what
I'm trying to accomplish?

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:59.310 position:50% align:center
Why the two of you
are integral to the plan?

00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
By using Harmony,
we can awaken the true potential

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
that lies dormant
within Device Thirteen,

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center
and usher this country into a
new era of peace and prosperity!

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] After its noble
sacrifice is concluded,

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
both of our dreams
will become a reality!

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
Will you join me?

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO gasps]

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
On behalf of the organization,

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
thank you for your
assistance, Master Tetsuro.

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.928 position:50% align:center
We are grateful.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
I see.

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.858 position:50% align:center
So that's why.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
At the time,

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
I took your hand to right
the wrongs of Beruhren.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] Sounds like you're
finally starting to remember.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
I didn't know who I was.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
It took losing my memories
to figure that out.

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.997 position:50% align:center
Back then, I needlessly
put others' lives at risk

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50% align:center
to accomplish my own goals.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Thank you.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
Without your help, I wouldn't
be able to take the first steps

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
to becoming a better person.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
As for your plan,
I'm sorry to say,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
but I cannot be
a part of it anymore.

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
Helping someone who's willing
to sacrifice another so easily?

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.770 position:50% align:center
It's not in me.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
Professor.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:27.023 position:50% align:center
I won't give up on my ideals

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
or hurt anybody else
to make them a reality.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
And that includes Juzo!

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
I won't let you to
lay a finger on him!

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:42.414 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] I didn't expect
you to be this stupid.

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
Obviously, any
further discussion

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.917 position:50% align:center
would prove pointless.

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
It'll be difficult
finding someone else

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
compatible with Harmony.

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
But no matter.

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO gasps]

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] We'll just be
careful when we decapitate you.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
And remove Harmony from
that empty skull of yours.

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] All this time,
you were an Extended?!

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
Is it really so shocking?

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:15.864 position:50% align:center
Like I told you, I created
extension technology

00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:19.659 position:50% align:center
as a means to combat
this planet's injustices.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
So what will you do now?

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
Call out for Device Thirteen,
begging him to help you?

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
The nerves of this old man

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center
aren't able to fully
control this body.

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
But in combat against someone

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
who's only equipped
with legal extensions,

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
I'm confident it'll
prove more than capable

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:39.012 position:50% align:center
of overpowering you!

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.598 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO grunts]

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] You might have
stood a chance against me,

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
if only you could use
that ability we gave you!

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.065 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO groans]

00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center
How ironic you possess
the ultimate weapon,

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
only to die while
using it on yourself.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
Until I give the command,

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
it'll remain locked
within your sub-brain!

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:05.872 position:50% align:center
[JUZO yells]

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
What's the matter?

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.875 position:50% align:center
How do you plan on
protecting the boy

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
when you can't land a punch?

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:16.841 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Protect him?

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:20.220 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's true
I made that promise.

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
But only so he could
start learning to walk

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
on his own two feet.

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
At the moment,

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
that means keeping
you guys off his back.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
So let's you and I dance.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:37.779 position:50% align:center
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
till you're outta steam!

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO yelps]

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] No matter
how noble your intentions,

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.371 position:50% align:center
it doesn't alter this fact,

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
this world's reality:

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
Idealism will
only get you so far.

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
Blood must be spilled
and the weak must die

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
in order for there
to be real change.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
You may have a point.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.470 position:50% align:center
Right now, my goal's nothing
more than wishful thinking.

00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:05.432 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Achieving justice without
putting your life on the line,

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
that's a pipe dream.

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:11.104 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO chuckles] Thank you
for telling me that, Juzo.

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
It would appear you've
become disoriented.

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
Device Thirteen
isn't here to save you.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center
You have no way of defending
yourself, Master Tetsuro.

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
It's hopeless!

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI grunts]

00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
But even so...

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
...my dream is
worth fighting for,

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:47.515 position:50% align:center
and I can't help but be
enamored by the beauty of it!

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:50.518 position:50% align:center
If that means putting
my life on the line,

00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
it's a small price to pay!

00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:28.867 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU] This is the end,
profane existence!

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.326 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] Every action causes
an equal or opposite reaction.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.578 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI] I told you he ended
up being a disappointment.

00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:33.204 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Bastard,
what did you do with Tetsuro?

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.707 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER]
You will become mine.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:40.295 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] <i>No Guns Life</i> .
