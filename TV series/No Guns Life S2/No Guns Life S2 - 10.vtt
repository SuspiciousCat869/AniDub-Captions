[KRONEN] I followed the hit
squad over here from Beruhren,

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.972 position:50% align:center
and look who they led me to.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
My old pal. Been a while.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
It astounds me
how we went through

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center
the same training together,
both hating the Extended,

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:27.777 position:50% align:center
yet here we find ourselves,
fighting for opposite sides.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
Makes me wonder...

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
Is that car of yours
still the only hunk of metal

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
close to your heart?

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
[KRONEN]
My job calls for the elimination

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
of all criminal Extended.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
Not dirtying hands taking
out terrorists like you.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.257 position:50% align:center
However,

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
in this case,
I'll make an exception--

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
seeing as how I am uniquely
qualified to take you down.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.037 position:50% align:center

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.804 position:50% align:center
If you plan on taking me down,

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
you better hurry
and close the distance.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.895 position:50% align:center
At this range,
I have the advantage.

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:09.356 position:50% align:center
For someone so focused
on slaughtering Extended,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
this must be a change.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.776 position:50% align:center
You probably don't even
know the trigger points

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
on another human body, do you?

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
If I get any closer you're done,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
yet for some reason
you're encouraging it.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.078 position:50% align:center
Also couldn't help but notice

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:26.539 position:50% align:center
you were reluctant to fire

Strange, it's almost as
if you're low on needles.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
Things are finally starting
to look up for me, Kronen.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
You don't actually believe
that I'm going to let you

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
capture me and
take all of that away?

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
Furthermore,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.472 position:50% align:center
don't you have a
far more pressing place

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.349 position:50% align:center
you need to be right now?

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center

Inui? No.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
Take me to him.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
I have to help Juzo!

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:28.727 position:50% align:center
Saving that thing?
You're not serious.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
Yes. Now!

I know him.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
He's me.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Acts like I did
when I was just a tool.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
Unaware of what
impact my choices had.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
That's why.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] I can't see
this mission through.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
It ain't right
killing your comrades--

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
no matter what they did.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
You're not a tool. Not my gun.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
And certainly
not command center's.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
You have the power, Juzo.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
You decide.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
So choose.

You're wrong. I'm just a weapon.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.633 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I exist only to follow orders.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
And to take out the enemy.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
Won't argue with you,

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
because that's your
decision to make, partner.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I'm not a mindless gun.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center
That's why I can't
let Seven defeat me.

the military gave me.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
It wasn't my choice.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
I figured as much.
Same old Juzo.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:20.323 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know by now
what our next mission is.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:22.575 position:50% align:center
We're supposed to
eliminate eleven GSUs

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
along with the three Hands

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
that're opposing
the disposal order.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
They're being
led by Number Five.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] The targets are being
holed up in a town called Tabal.

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
Got themselves barricaded
inside of a church.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
They're not going anywhere.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
We got soldiers
surrounding them.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.556 position:50% align:center
They won't take
direct action, though.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
No one else is to make a move.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
That responsibility is yours.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
You must take out
the targets alone.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] Your combat program
will be active for 48 hours.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
Spend the time wisely.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
Make sure you finish the job.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
This is gonna be the final time
I pull the 'ol trigger, partner.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
Now I'm out, but don't forget

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:18.048 position:50% align:center
that no matter what,
I'll always be behind you.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] If you abandon
the mission and run,

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
you do know what
will happen to you?

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
[SUISO grunts]

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.021 position:50% align:center
Thing is,

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
knowing the consequences is
what makes my escape so stylish.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
These are Juzo's memories.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Back then, during the war,

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center
I didn't know how to be
anything other than a soldier.

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
I knew eventually you'd show up.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] Jumpy, aren't
we, Number Thirteen?

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
You can relax.

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
I'm alone and have no
intention of attacking you.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.790 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
It's a pleasure.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
I'm Device Twelve, but you
can call me Twelve for short.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you and I would get
to have an opportunity to talk.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
We're in a bit of a bind.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
The last Hands that
sympathized with our cause

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:53.268 position:50% align:center
just bit the bullet
not too long ago.

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] On top of that,
Four Gun Slave Units

00:14:57.439 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
have already been taken out.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
And our leader, Five,
is barely functional.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
Can't move half of his body.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:07.282 position:50% align:center
Bleak to say the least.

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.828 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
As you know, without a Hands,

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
we can't even repair ourselves
using the Devil's Backbone.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.293 position:50% align:center
All of us are
in pretty bad shape.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
We don't even have the
strength to break through

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
that perimeter you got set up.

00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
Don't get me wrong.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
We're soldiers at heart,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.221 position:50% align:center
not like we're afraid
of dying or anything.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:35.518 position:50% align:center
Thing is, we survived that
horrible war against all odds.

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
My philosophy is,

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
what's the harm in
enjoying life a little bit?

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center
We've earned it.

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
Whaddaya say, Device Thirteen?

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
Come with us.

00:15:56.873 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
We all share
the same first name,

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
and there's not many out
there with faces like ours.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't be that far
off to call us brothers.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Brothers.

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not the same as you.

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
You got a point.

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:18.770 position:50% align:center
From what I hear,

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50% align:center
your settings are a bit
different from the rest of ours.

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.692 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] That's probably
why they sent you

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:26.277 position:50% align:center
to handle all of us
in the first place.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
But the way I see it,

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
that's even more
of a reason for you

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
to make your own decision.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
How <i>you</i> want to live.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
We all die.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
And when the end finally comes,

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
your choices will
measure your worth.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
It's not too late! Come with us!

00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] After this,
I don't have any more sedatives.

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] If you're content
being a tool for the military

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
the rest of your life,
that can't be helped.

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] Still, it
doesn't change the fact

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center
that I can't let
you get to my people.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
Regenguss Faust!

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
Your end's coming
sooner than you thought,

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
'cause I'm gonna take you out

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
faster than the speed
of a lightning strike!

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Southwest of town,

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
there's an abandoned
construction tunnel.

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
A transport route.

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
The military
doesn't know it exists.

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] You're telling
me there's a way out?

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] Come on.
Just a little bit further.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
See the light?

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:17.639 position:50% align:center
Pretty soon we'll
reach the surface.

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
[FIVE]
This is risky.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
What makes you think
we can trust this guy?

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
If we find ourselves surrounded

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:29.109 position:50% align:center
the second we step foot outside,
it's not gonna be funny.

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:30.944 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
You worry too much, Five.

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
We're almost out of here.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
When we get through this,
it'll be like we're born again.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
[FIVE gasps] A newborn,
with a body like yours?

00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE laughs]
The fatter the baby, the better!

00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
[FIVE]
We did it.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
We actually
cleared the perimeter.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
Happy birthday, everyone!

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:03.143 position:50% align:center
[FIVE]
The hard part's done.

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
Now that we're free,
what's the next step?

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
We'll lay low for a while.

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
Our faces don't exactly
blend in with a crowd.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] But still,
time'll fix everything--

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
always does.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] As for the
brother we left behind,

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
all I can do is hope.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
Maybe his life
will end peacefully.

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] Speak of the devil.
So that's your answer.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
Should've known.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center

Targets eliminated.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:07.582 position:50% align:center
Even though they were comrades

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
and shared the
same model as him.

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.460 position:50% align:center
This thing's heartless.

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:12.128 position:50% align:center
You'd know by lookin' at him.

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
He really is just
a crazed Extended.

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] And there's
not many out there

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
with faces like ours.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center

What've I done?

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] Because that's your
decision to make, partner.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You're wrong.

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center

That's not it.

I realized for the first time.

[JUZO]
Until that point,

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
I never made
a decision of my own.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center

no matter who I was aimed at,

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center

who pulled the trigger

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
was responsible.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
