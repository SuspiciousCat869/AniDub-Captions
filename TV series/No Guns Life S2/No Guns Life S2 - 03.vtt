00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:14.639 position:50% align:center
[MARY] A long time ago, you told
me you found where you belong.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.725 position:50% align:center
I don't know for how many years,

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
but as long as I can remember,
it was just the two of us.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
No matter what we faced,

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
your hands were
always holding mine.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Thinking back on it now,

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
they weren't much
bigger than my own.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.872 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
But the warmth they had

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
helped me confirm
my own existence.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
You were where I belonged.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.717 position:50% align:center
But soon after we started
living at the old man's house

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.388 position:50% align:center
and you discovered extension
technology, you said...

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.723 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
If anybody's lost something

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
valuable in their life,
the technology's available

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
to give them back
what was deprived of them.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:04.481 position:50% align:center
Maybe something even greater.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
And that power's mine.
I found where I belong, Mary.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
Finally.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.989 position:50% align:center
[MARY] As you gazed into the
distance and said those words,

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
your eyes were so beautiful.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.745 position:50% align:center
I wasn't able to
say it at the time,

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
but the place I belonged
was next to you.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
When you left me

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.712 position:50% align:center
and everything else behind
to go fight in the war,

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.173 position:50% align:center
part of me was scared.

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
[MARY] But at the same time,
I was so proud of you.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.766 position:50% align:center
I knew that the
next time I saw you,

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center
this was something
I needed to tell you.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.023 position:50% align:center
I'm a full-fledged
engineer now,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.568 position:50% align:center
and finally found
somewhere I belong.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.155 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
And yet...

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.639 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
That power Victor's using...

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
[MARY] It has to take
a serious toll on his sub-brain.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.148 position:50% align:center
Without sedatives,

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.193 position:50% align:center
I don't see how he could
use it over and over again.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:57.737 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
If that's the case,

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center
it's hard to imagine
Juzo losing to him,

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
even if he only has one arm.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
But...

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] Since you're
an old friend, Juzo,

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
let me give you one
small piece of advice.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
If you really want
to take me down,

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
you'd better not
hold anything back.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Is that right?

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
I asked this before, but you
do know I'm a Gun Slave Unit?

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
What're you talking about?

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.435 position:50% align:center
Of course I do.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center
I was your personal
engineer after all.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
I think there's something
you don't fully grasp.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
Take a look around.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
How many Extended do you think

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
I've personally slaughtered
up to this point?

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Yeah. That's gonna stop today.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR yells]

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Mm?

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
[JUZO groans]

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
What the hell are these?

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
Remote controlled.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
Then that means... [gasps]

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
Juzo, listen!
Spitzbergen didn't leave!

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
They must be hiding nearby!

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
They're the ones who're
operating those Extended!

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50% align:center
[JUZO grunts]

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Clever deduction, but not quite.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
Didn't you know?

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
It's curious.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
When you stuff an Extended
into a headless body,

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
they often lose their free will.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
They become puppets--

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
mindless soldiers

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
who follow my every
order without question.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You mean dummy rounds.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Funke Faust!

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
[JUZO yells]

00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I've had enough of your games.

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] You're right.
Let's get to business.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
Besides, you would never
go all-out on empty shells.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
Juzo! Get back! Now!

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
[JUZO groans]

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.754 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR giggles]

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Bastard.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
What the hell did you do?

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
My other name...

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
Did it happen to slip your mind?

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
The Dismantler, hard to forget.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
In more ways than one.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
As long as you're
within my reach,

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
using only my hands,

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:45.822 position:50% align:center
I can instantly
disassemble any Extended!

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
[JUZO grunts]

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
[JUZO groans]

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Are you kidding?

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
[JUZO gasps]

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]'
How deep must I go

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
in order to catch a
glimpse of the real you?

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
Victor! Stop!

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
[JUZO groans]

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
There's no use.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
Shutting down your pain
receptors won't help.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
Or maybe you need reminding.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:31.826 position:50% align:center
Back in the war, you were feared
by both enemies and allies.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50% align:center
There was a reason you
refused to show off that power.

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Victor... You bastard!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] Out of all
the 13 Gun Slave Units,

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
you were the only
one given that role...

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:49.511 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Verrat Dreizehn!

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center
Device Thirteen,
the Brethren Slayer!

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
Your legacy is written in blood!

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
[JUZO grunting]

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.730 position:50% align:center
The Brethren Slayer?

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] The war's over,
has been for years,

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
but no matter how
much time passes,

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
it still haunts you.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
And you see...
I can't have that.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
[snap]

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
[JUZO groans]

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
[JUZO screams]

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] I'm going to shred
all of your outer layers!

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR cackling]

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center
Is the Victor I knew
even in there now?

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
Somewhere deep inside?

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.442 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR continues cackling]

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
Hey, up here!

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR gasps]

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
How about you see
what I'm made of instead?!

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
All right, boob rockets.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.411 position:50% align:center
Fire!

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR grunts]

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:10.508 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Funke Faust!

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.304 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR grunts]

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I didn't wanna do this,

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
but it looks like I don't have
any more hands to play!

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR groans]
There's no way!

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
You sacrificed your remaining
arm to hold me in place?

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
I have no idea anymore...

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
...if the old Victor
is the real you...

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
...or if the real one's
in front of me now.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
Guess it doesn't matter.

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
[MARY] What does, is that
I have the power to stop you

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
from hurting any more people.

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
And that's enough for me.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.583 position:50% align:center
Your pain receptors are
there for a reason, you know.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
Stop shutting them 'em off
and pushing yourself too hard.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:32.424 position:50% align:center
[JUZO grunts]
Mary, why?

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
You idiot.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
I had to. It was right.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.185 position:50% align:center
[LEFTY]
Correct.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
[MARY, JUZO grunt]

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
[LEFTY] Don't blame yourself
for what you had to do, Mary.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
Got that?

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
You're okay, and you can talk!

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
[LEFTY]
Yes.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
I've freed up some space
in my sub-brain for now.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
Since that Victor's unconscious,

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:02.162 position:50% align:center
we finally have
a moment to speak.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
This vocalization
device should be

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
plenty sufficient for me
to communicate with.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Then start.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
I wanna know who you are.

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
[LEFTY] Juzo, I appreciate
what you've done.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
You kept your promise

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
and have been protecting
Mary all this time.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[JUZO] Then you're...

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
No... Victor?

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] That's right.
I'm the real Victor.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
Wait, then who is that?

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Just a puppet--

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
a body controlled by
a darker version of me.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Enough games.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
Explain.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but...

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center
...I'm gonna
borrow your voice box

00:11:57.175 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
For now, let's put aside
whether or not we can trust you.

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:06.726 position:50% align:center
If you really are Victor, then
who the hell was that other guy?

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Like I said before...

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
He was just a puppet.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
And the one pulling the
strings is my shadow self.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.323 position:50% align:center
Like a double? No way.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Higher, please.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
[MARY gasps]

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] Juzo, I have
one more job for you.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
Destroy the shadow I've created.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
How should I begin?

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
Let's go back to the time when
I was your personal engineer.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] As you know, I joined
the military as an engineer

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
and was sent to
an R and D facility

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
far from the front lines.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] I had thought
that my research would

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
protect soldiers and
lead us to victory in the war.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.653 position:50% align:center
That our pursuit was
a worthwhile endeavor.

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Back then, I was an optimist

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
who believed advancing
extension technology

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
would benefit everyone.

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Eventually, we tried bypassing

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
the Limitation of
Drone Weaponry Treaty.

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.087 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] Countless days
and nights we toiled,

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
committed to figuring out
remote extension control,

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
and making it a reality.

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:24.679 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] If we were
able to reach that goal,

00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
soldiers could be
kept out of harm's way.

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center
We could save lives.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
However,

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
we encountered a
substantial barrier.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
It was the intense feedback
coming from the remote body.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
You mean Resonance.

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center
[MARY] Just like what
happened to the kid.

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
When controlling a body,

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
pain's a crucial
source of information.

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
Shutting down the pain receptors

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
resulted in a huge drop
of systemic control.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] Even the newly
developed sub-brain,

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
with all its advancements,
wasn't fast enough to keep up.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.556 position:50% align:center
Despite our advancements,

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
there was too much
data being transferred

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
for it to correctly
process it all.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.231 position:50% align:center
So I proposed something new.

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center
A parallel sub-brain.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
We'd connect two of them,

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
simulating the left and right
hemispheres of the human brain,

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:28.993 position:50% align:center
and thereby dramatically
increasing the processing speed.

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of that before.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.540 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] It was never
released to the public.

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
The project was
deemed top-secret;

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center
not to mention,
eventually terminated.

00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
Meaning the system must've
had some kind of flaw.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, if it had
worked the way you intended,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
the whole issue of remote
Resonance

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
would've already
been solved by now.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Yes, right again, Mary.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
I felt it was my responsibility

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:01.943 position:50% align:center
to volunteer as a test subject.

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:03.945 position:50% align:center
After several trial runs,

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
we did our first test
on the front lines.

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] And then.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
I saw life through the
eyes of my remote extension.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:23.882 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR grunts]

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] I witnessed the
results of my research.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:33.683 position:50% align:center
[gunfire]

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR gasps]

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS groaning]

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Stop it!

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] My research should've
been used to save people.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.307 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
But on that battlefield,

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
there wasn't
a single soul spared.

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
This is all my fault.

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
What have I done?

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
When I woke up in the lab,

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
my heart felt broken

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
and I was shocked at
what I saw around me.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:36.121 position:50% align:center
The research facility
and my fellow engineers

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
were all beyond saving.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:47.382 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] Also, the one
responsible for it all,

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:50.510 position:50% align:center
was another version of myself.

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Meaning what?

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
That you slaughtered them
while you were unconscious?

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
It's exactly how it sounds.

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
A sub-brain contains
a program that assists

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:05.859 position:50% align:center
with an Extended's
functions, understand?

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.819 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Mm-hm.

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] However,
it's also a two-way street,

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
because the user's
thought patterns

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
can also affect how
the sub-brain operates.

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
Incredible.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] That's precisely
what happened to me.

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50% align:center
After seeing the carnage
on the battlefield,

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
I was emotionally damaged, which
hurt my mental capacity as well.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] The dual
sub-brain then took over

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.927 position:50% align:center
and operated based on
the trauma I felt.

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:37.766 position:50% align:center
A sub-brain operating
independently?

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
I know this is hard to believe.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
However, there's
no doubt in my mind.

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
That Victor is
operating based on

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
my thought patterns
from the battlefield.

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
He's come to this conclusion:

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
Extensions must be
purged from the world.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:59.829 position:50% align:center
No one can
convince him otherwise.

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
Additionally, he believes

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.375 position:50% align:center
he's responsible
for its existence,

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
and that by advancing
extension tech, he has sinned.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
Now the only way to atone
is by eliminating all Extended.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
During the fight, that
other Victor seemed like

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
he was more interested
looking inside Juzo

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
than destroying him.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] He's like
my shadow, and like me,

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
he's interested
in extension technology.

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
Juzo,

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
the hatred he has
for you is real,

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
and once he's done
examining your parts,

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:37.158 position:50% align:center
he will eliminate you.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
Then the actual
reason that Victor's

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
working alongside Spitzbergen...

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.416 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
They both share a goal:

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
ridding the world of Extended.

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
[MARY gasps]

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Can't pretend I
understand, but basically,

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:55.635 position:50% align:center
sounds like your body's been
taken over by a sub-brain.

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:58.179 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Perfectly summarized.

00:18:58.263 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Doesn't sit well with me.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
If that's the case,

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
then the Victor I was
fighting was a fake.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
Some kind of experiment
that got outta hand

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
and now he's running amok.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Correct.

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
And now there's you,

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
controlling this
hand extension remotely

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.581 position:50% align:center
from some other location.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Well, the short answer is yes.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
One thing's obvious:

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
you've got yourself
in a real jam.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
So, let's hear it.

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.719 position:50% align:center
Where's your real body located?

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] You'll have
your answer soon enough.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Huh?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
And when you find my body,

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
I'll need another
favor from you.

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
I want you to destroy
the parallel sub-brain.

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Huh?

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
What you saw must've been awful.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] I won't deny I felt
despair on that battlefield.

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
Everything I believed
in vanished in an instant.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
Still, I don't want Extendeds
to disappear entirely.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
I know there are
facets of the technology

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
that can help people,
so I'm begging you.

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
Stop him.

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Victor?

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
His consciousness is returning.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
It looks like our conversation

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
will have to
come to an end soon.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
Don't go.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] I'm sure he has
another puppet somewhere.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Sorry, but this
whole doing jobs for free--

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
I'm over it.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
You're saying no?

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center
I'm saying Victor's
not getting out

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:02.679 position:50% align:center
of paying me for this
or the first job.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
The invoice won't be pretty.

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:12.605 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Juzo.

00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:14.649 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
[MARY grunts]

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
[JUZO groans]

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
No, Juzo!

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:38.173 position:50% align:center
[AVI] My deepest apologies,
but I can't have

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
you people taking custody
of Victor's real body.

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:45.472 position:50% align:center
[AVI]
That's my duty.

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:48.767 position:50% align:center
In accordance with the law,
he's my prisoner....

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
...for I'm Avi
Cobo, EMS director--

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center
upholder of order!

00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:28.324 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
As a personal engineer...

00:23:28.408 --> 00:23:29.826 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Why'd you leave me behind?

00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:31.369 position:50% align:center
[AVI] So you're the
other Victor, I presume?

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:32.871 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] What in the
world are you thinking?

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:34.289 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
That joke isn't funny.

00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:35.623 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Victor...

00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:40.503 position:50% align:center
