[JUZO]
The name's Juzo Inui.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:11.970 position:50% align:center
Since the Great War,

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.680 position:50% align:center
this city's
overflowing with people

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:17.767 position:50% align:center
who've had parts of their
bodies replaced with extensions.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
I make my living resolving
problems they cause.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Took a case and ended
up saving a kid named Tetsuro,

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.360 position:50% align:center
making me the
enemy of Beruhren--

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
the company that runs
everything 'round here.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.198 position:50% align:center
With the help of my
personal engineer, Mary,

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
Olivier, head of EMS,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.077 position:50% align:center
an Extended countermeasures
department,

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
and even Tetsuro,

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.082 position:50% align:center
I've managed to get by so far.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
One day, a man named
Danny walked in my office,

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.172 position:50% align:center
and hired me to protect
a girl named Rosa.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.923 position:50% align:center
When I resolved the case,

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.510 position:50% align:center
my payment was
a small data capsule.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
After that, it was
back to the office.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Thanks for the light, Tetsuro.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.731 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
What are you talking about?

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.232 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Hm?

[EMS OFFICER 13A panting]

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:25.794 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
I'll ask one more time.

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.838 position:50% align:center
What is an extension to you?

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.965 position:50% align:center
[EMS OFFICER 13A]
What are you, stupid?

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.509 position:50% align:center
They're weapons!

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.012 position:50% align:center
Used to destroy scum like you!

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.555 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
A weapon.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.016 position:50% align:center
How lovely.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.728 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] Since you've
answered my question,

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:47.357 position:50% align:center
I'll disassemble
the rest of you!

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.206 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Final warning.

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Quit eating snacks
on my head, ya brats!

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
You're gettin' crumbs
all over me! Hey!

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
Don't think about touching my
trigger with your greasy hands!

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
Juzo's weakness is junk food!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I don't have a weakness!

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
Now get off me!

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
You're boring anyway.

[JUZO]
Damn.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
There didn't used to be
this many kids in the shop!

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
And why aren't they
afraid of me anymore?

00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
Can't find what I need in peace.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.200 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I need to use this player.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
Let me borrow it for a bit.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Side note,

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
you might wanna reconsider
your clientele, granny.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
[SHOP OWNER 13A] Thanks, but
my business isn't any of yours.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
And no smoking in here.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center

Huh? It's not lit.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
No peace.

calculated pains to push Gondry

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center

Smooth as a baby's tushie!

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
It's good to be young.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
You're so lucky.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
I wear bug bites for weeks.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling all right, Mary?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
I'd have thought you'd
wannna go with Juzo.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
[MARY] Yeah, thing is,
I don't really care

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
that much about
whatever data's inside.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
My other reason for staying

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
is there's more
interesting matters at hand.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
[CHRISTINA] You should
get rid of that thing.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50% align:center
I don't like the looks of it.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
It'd be different a story

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
if it had a pretty face
like yours, hon.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
Even a strong bicep,
but it's just a hand rat.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
There's more to him.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
I mean, what we've got here is
a remote-controlled extension.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
In other words, the main body
must be off somewhere else.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
If it's remote controlled,

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50% align:center
does that mean
the user is like me?

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Not quite!

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
The reason Harmony is special is

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
because it can hack
directly into the sub-brain.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
The ability to control
a detached appendage

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
remotely is nothing unusual.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.693 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.861 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Well, for us it is.

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
There! That should do it!

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
I gave you a quick tune up,

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
since your joints were
getting kinda worn out.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50% align:center
[whirring]

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
[CHRISTINA]
You truly are a strange girl.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
Always taking on
work that doesn't pay.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:21.047 position:50% align:center
Now I see why you and
Juzo get along so well.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
This engineer told me
something a while back.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
"The Extended are people who've

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
lost something important
in their lives.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
That's why it's wrong to
take anything more from them."

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
Still, the first
rule of this world

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
is you can't
survive without money!

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
In my case, I take whatever
cash I find lying around.

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
Mostly from Juzo!

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
For some unexplained reason,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
I suddenly feel
ashamed of my existence.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
I wonder why.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
This is Juzo's personal
engineer, I assume.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
Ooh, tell her I want some
new guards posted outside!

Don't ask any questions,

just get everybody
out of there right now.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
Mary! Where're we going?

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
Those soldiers have Chris!

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.801 position:50% align:center
We can't leave her behind!

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center
I want to help her,
but they're fully armed

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
and in case you didn't
notice, flesh and blood!

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
Harmony won't work against
anyone without a sub-brain.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.773 position:50% align:center
We don't stand
a chance against them,

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
so going back now
won't solve anything!

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.112 position:50% align:center
It's far too dangerous.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
Also, we don't have
a clue who they are

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
or even what their objective is.

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
One thing I know...

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
...I'm positive Chris
wasn't their target.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
For now, we need
to go find Juzo.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:52.258 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] That explains
what happened to the guards.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
It was a massacre.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
[EMS OFFICER 13B groans]

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
Looks like this
one's still alive!

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
Hang in there!
You'll be all right.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
These injuries aren't fatal.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
I'm going to borrow his body.

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.693 position:50% align:center
And use it to save Chris
from whoever those guys were.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
Stop talking crazy!

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
Tetsuro, can't you see
he's been heavily wounded?

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.115 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you've noticed by now,

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
but the stronger
Harmony resonates

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
with the extension
it's controlling,

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
the greater the
effect it has on you!

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
If the body you're piloting
sustains a fatal injury,

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.959 position:50% align:center
chances are you will, too!

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
The feeling I experienced...

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
...of Colt disappearing
from existence.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
He died, and the
only reason is because

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
I wasn't able to
control my power sooner.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
His death is on my hands.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] If I can avoid
feeling that way again...

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
...I'll do whatever it takes!

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
I won't hesitate to use my
powers, or whoever I need to!

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center

You have me, so leave
the others alone!

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 13A]
Huh? Wait, you've got the data?

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.884 position:50% align:center
Then hand it over.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
That's what you want?

No, kid. Look again.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:04.724 position:50% align:center
They're the anti-extension
group, Spitzbergen.

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Spitzbergen?

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
And I think they're trying to
steal the data Juzo's carrying.

hears what happened,

But not the data.

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:58.695 position:50% align:center
Seems the Resolver
has it, as we expected.

Don't start. Like we
need that bastards help!

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center

down the woman ourselves.

ahead, isn't there?

stay far away from them.

[JUZO]
Mary.

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.807 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER] This was a
stupid idea, even for you.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you announced

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:54.144 position:50% align:center
the location of
the data in public.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
So why did Rosa's father have

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.816 position:50% align:center
a recording of
Army's confession?

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:04.988 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Because I was
the one who sent it to him.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
I knew George McMahon.
He was trustworthy.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.786 position:50% align:center
One of the best
prosecutors I've ever met.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
The original data I had with me
was destroyed during the attack.

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:18.126 position:50% align:center
Along with our star witness.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] In other words,
the copy you sent McMahon

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
is the only physical
proof that's left.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.426 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
Yes.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
He realized how significant
that recording was

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.264 position:50% align:center
and sacrificed his
life protecting it.

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
I'm sure its importance
isn't lost on you, either.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.520 position:50% align:center
That was Tokisada Mega Armed,

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
living embodiment
of the Extended,

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
confessing to a past crime.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
Everyone knows extensions

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
dramatically propelled
this country forward

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
and made a lot
of people wealthy.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
We've all been told
the technology is safe.

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
Whenever an
Extended goes berserk,

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
it's because of a
problem on a human level.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
It's a lie desperately concocted

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
by Beruhren Corp
and the government.

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
And then propagated
by Tokisada Mega Armed.

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
If his confession gets
thoughtlessly released,

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
it won't affect just Beruhren.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
This whole country
will be shaken.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.558 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
The stakes sound high.

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
You're not planning
to holster this, are you?

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
All I'm saying is...

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:24.984 position:50% align:center
[OLIVIER]
...we have to tread carefully

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:27.529 position:50% align:center
and use the law to punish them.

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
But that won't happen until
you give me back the data!

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] I got the gist.
We'll talk later.

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't hang up!

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center

Forgive me, you look exhausted,

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
but would you mind if
we ask a few questions?

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Who are you?

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center

Additionally, I'm serving
as the acting director

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center

our previous director

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center

[AVI] The man you met earlier.
I believe this is him?

00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
[MARY grunts]

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
[AVI] We'd like to know
what he said to you.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
Tell me first--just who is he?

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
His name's Victor Steinberg.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
Age and background,
completely unknown.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center
What we do know is that

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
he works closely
with Spitzbergen--

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
very rare for an Extended.

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
And what's more,

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
we believe he's a part of
their terrorist attack unit.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
He's with Spitzbergen?

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
The man is a hardware expert,

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
which allows him to rip an
Extended apart in seconds.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
He's so quick, the victims
don't realize what's happening.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
His calling card's so brutal,
he's earned a nickname:

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
Dismantler.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:07.170 position:50% align:center
He truly is the
Extended's natural enemy.

turn against them!

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
I know it.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.433 position:50% align:center
I've seen his work up close.

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
We've been investigating
him for some time now.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
We received information
that the outfit he's with

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
has a base somewhere
in the Kyusei Pit.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
The Kyusei Pit?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
We haven't pinned down
their exact location yet.

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
Furthermore,
without solid evidence,

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
it would be quite difficult
for us to enter the district.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
Sadly, the fact is common sense
doesn't work on Spitzbergen.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
It's unfortunate,
but I highly doubt

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:50.588 position:50% align:center
anyone will ever see
those hostages again.

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
Most likely they'll be executed.

This isn't your agency's fault.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
And your apologies are as about
useful as an empty chamber.

I understand your pain.

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
Although, if you had
something in your possession

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
we might be able
to negotiate with,

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
then that'd be
a different story.

care of this situation for you.

[JUZO]
Your concerns moved my heart.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
But I sold the data to cover
the expenses from my last job.

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
Didn't fetch much
of a price, though.

that Over-Extended clearly
still had the data on him.
