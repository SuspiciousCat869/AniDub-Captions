[JUZO]
The name's Juzo Inui.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.470 position:50% align:center
Ever since the Great War,

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.431 position:50% align:center
this city's been
overflowing with people

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
who've had parts of their
bodies replaced with extensions.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.103 position:50% align:center
We call 'em Extended.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.479 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:22.981 position:50% align:center
Same spiel, right?

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
You've heard it all before.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.445 position:50% align:center
But this job's different
than my usual fare.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.488 position:50% align:center
Trust me.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
After all, it's the
reason I became a Resolver

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.287 position:50% align:center
and fell into this line
of work in the first place.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
I've got something to ask.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
Protect my sister.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.345 position:50% align:center
So Victor's been
in the Kyusei Pit.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.807 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
My brother--

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
you met him for the first
time during the war, right?

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Yeah, at one point
he was my personal engineer.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.317 position:50% align:center
He was a good guy,
even to us Extended.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.653 position:50% align:center
Something we weren't used to.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:39.409 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] I didn't
think he was still alive.

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.495 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
I did.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.873 position:50% align:center
The Victor I knew was kind.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:50.337 position:50% align:center
Always going out of his
way to help other people.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
That's why--

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.464 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Yeah.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.383 position:50% align:center
Him working alongside a
terrorist organization?

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.552 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it myself.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:00.180 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
There's no way.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Hm?

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
It's been years
since I saw him last,

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
but I know he would
never hurt anybody...

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
...I thought.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
Juzo, did I ever tell
you that we were orphans?

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
Me and him, we were both taken
in by this engineer named Emmet.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
He was on the hunt for
someone to be his successor.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
Victor was always
good with his hands,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
so he was given jobs
right outta the gate.

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:32.921 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Looking back,

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
I'd say that was
probably when my brother

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
first got interested in the new
field of extension technology.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
But before long,

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
things started
going downhill fast.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
[MARY] Emmet was losing his
temper more often,

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
and Victor was pretty much
running the shop by himself.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
[MARY grunts]

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
My guess?

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
The old man had an
aversion to extension tech.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
Sometime afterwards,

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
Victor disappeared
from my life entirely.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
He left me on my own.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Are you saying
Victor killed the old man?

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Later on,

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
I got a letter telling me he
became an engineer in the war.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
And that was it.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
Part of me thinks
that I never really

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
understood anything
about my brother.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
That's why I have
to know for sure.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
Listen up!

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
This is a family matter
between me and Victor.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
I get you knew him, but this is
something I gotta do alone.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Uh, Mary!

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
That's final. I don't
care if you're upset.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
You need to focus on
saving Chris and the kid!

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.556 position:50% align:center

[SPITZBERGEN LEADER 13A]
Even if you hadn't gotten

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
involved in our business,

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:18.068 position:50% align:center
we were destined
to become enemies.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
You have no one to
blame but yourself

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
for undergoing the extension
procedure, blasphemer!

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU grunts]

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I always am.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
[SPITZBERGEN LEADER 13A]
That's far enough.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
All I have to do is press this
button

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
and our people will execute

[JUZO]
Hm?

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
[SHIMAZU] Ye, who distorts
the providence of God,

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
you're up against
anti-Extended full body armor,

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
made from compressed
diamond nanofilaments.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center
It may be the same material
used in your artificial muscles.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
But there's three
times the amount used

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
in a normal combat Extended!

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
You're no match
for its toughness...

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
...or its resilience! [yells]

Thanks for sharing.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
Even though you're
flesh and blood,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
turns out I didn't
have to pull my punches.

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
Truth is it was kinda
hard holding back,

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
even before I knew.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center

You monster.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center

You have no idea.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
Where are the hostages?

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center

[SPITZBERGEN LEADER 13A groans,

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
We don't negotiate
with your kind.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:12.057 position:50% align:center
You're an Extended!
Your very existence is a sin!

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
And those you've trampled
will be the death of you!

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center
So go ahead and kill me,
'cause your threats won't work.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:22.734 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Hah. What makes you think
I was planning to negotiate?

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
Here's my terms:

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
You want the data, you better
treat my friends well.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
Because if you don't,

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.535 position:50% align:center
you'll regret you ever
laid hands on my family

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
after I send you all to hell!

We're leaving, Mary.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
Uh, what do ya mean by "we,"
and where are you headed?

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
The Kyusei Pit.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
That's where Victor's hiding,

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
so we're going in
the same direction.

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] There's something
I need to ask him myself...

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:55.975 position:50% align:center
...about a case--

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
one I've been working...
for a long time.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.774 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Victor hired me.
Told me to protect you.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
That was the first
job I ever accepted.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
Protect me?

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
That means...

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.415 position:50% align:center
Wait, how come you never
thought to mention that fact?

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
There wasn't a need.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center

What kinda answer is that?!

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.383 position:50% align:center

I've got something to ask.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
Protect my sister, Mary.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:34.180 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
If my client and his friends

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
are putting you in danger,
I can't stand idly by.

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
It's a breach of contract.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] I have no idea
what the hell happened,

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
but when I find out,

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
I might have to kick his ass
to set his aim straight.

Juzo Inui, was it?

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center
He's quite something.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
Managed to defeat
our attack unit.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI] They were soldiers
who lived only for battle.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.389 position:50% align:center
Yet were unable
to slay a monster

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
that surpassed the realm of men.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
Does your hatred for the
Extended genuinely run so deep?

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:27.567 position:50% align:center
You should get out more.
Extended aren't evil.

Forgive me.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center

it's been far too long.

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50% align:center
Let me be the first to say,
welcome back to Spitzbergen.

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
On behalf of the organization,

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
thank you for your assistance,
Master Tetsuro. We are grateful.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.974 position:50% align:center
Have we met before?

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
Then it is true, and you
really have lost your memories.

please call me Wachowski.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
That name sounds familiar.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
I was worried about you.

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
Especially when
the word got to me

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
that you were sent to
the Beruhren facility

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
for funding our righteous cause.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
However, you've managed
to find your way home.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
And not only are you back,

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50% align:center
you've returned with a power
to bring the world to its knees!

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
What do you mean
funding your cause?

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
Was I helping Spitzbergen?

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
You don't remember?

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
You're lying!

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
No.

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:43.935 position:50% align:center
You're a criminal who betrayed

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
his father's corporation
to aid terrorists.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.065 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
And that, Master Tetsuro,
is the incontestable reality.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
You're with us.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Victor, was it?

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Yeah.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] You do realize
I'm a Gun Slave Unit, right?

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Yeah, of course I do.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center
I am your personal engineer.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
Have you lost your mind?

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
Anyway, during the procedure,

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
you won't have
the ability to speak.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
And I can't exactly read
your expression either,

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
so if the pain
gets too severe...

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
Ah, let's see...

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
Gunhead.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center
Gun... head.

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
Gun to the... That could work!

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center
Listen up.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
Use your right hand
and make this signal.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
It'll mean help, all right?

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Hey, Juzo.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
You okay over there?

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Mm?

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
I recognize that face.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Is there something
different about you?!

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
[JUZO gasping]

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
Meaning?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Uhh... It's nothing.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
Just wondering why an
anti-extension group

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:25.578 position:50% align:center
like Spitzbergen would take
refuge in the Kyusei Pit,

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
a place crawling with Extended.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.167 position:50% align:center
[MARY] Wouldn't that
make it the last place

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50% align:center
anyone would think
to look for them?

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
[MARY] Not to mention
the law doesn't reach here.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.427 position:50% align:center
Even so,

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty surprised
the Kyusei Family

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
agreed to allow you
to come back in.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Can't imagine they're too happy

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
having terrorists
sneak past them

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
and setting up
shop on their turf.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
By the way, just now,

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
you said I was making a face,

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
like I had some kinda
expression or something.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
What're you talking about?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you've got expressions
like everyone else.

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
How could you not know that?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.917 position:50% align:center
[whirring]

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
--[JUZO] Hm?
--[MARY gasps]

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] I figured
you'd show your... face.

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Lefty! Where'd you run off to?

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I'd say he was following us.

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center
Out with it.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
Who are you working for?

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center
[MARY sighs] You do realize
Lefty doesn't have a voice box,

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
so there's no way he'll
be able to answer you.

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
That gesture.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
How do you know it?

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:45.325 position:50% align:center
So, is this, like,
some sort of signal?

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
Uh? Lefty!

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.037 position:50% align:center
Wait up!

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
My guess is he's leading
us right to Victor again.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Huh. Makes my life easier.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Mary, you stay here.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.726 position:50% align:center
What for? Victor
should be up ahead.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.020 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
And possibly not alone.

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
I know you want
answers from him,

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
but there's no need for you
to put yourself in harm's way.

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Also, before anything goes down,

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
what I said earlier--
about taking care of things--

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
I think you
understand what I meant.

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Depending on what happens,

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.418 position:50% align:center
I might end up
killing your brother.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.169 position:50% align:center
No way around it.

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
Just want to prepare you for
that possibility.

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
[MARY grunts]

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:45.802 position:50% align:center
Do what you have to.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Good kid.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
Hey! Oh, ugh...

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
Sheesh.

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
[JUZO grun ts]

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Empty Extended bodies.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.862 position:50% align:center
Terrible décor.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Unfortunately,

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:52.619 position:50% align:center
the hostages are being
held in a different area.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
Couldn't keep them here

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
with the Reconstruction
Agency watching.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.752 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
No surprise.

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] You haven't changed
at all, Device Thirteen.

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
No, you go by a different name.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
These days, it's Juzo.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:14.265 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Looks like you've
changed quite a bit, Victor.

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Or should I refer
to you as the Dismantler?

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Why are you
cozying up with terrorists?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
You idiot.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
You hired me to
protect your sister,

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
and here you are
putting her at risk!

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Same old Juzo.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center
Like I said, nothing
about you has changed.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
Some would call your honesty
foolish, but I admire it.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
You could say I'm
helping with their efforts

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
to atone for my past sins.

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] But I never meant to
get Mary caught up in it.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
That's the hand fate dealt.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Speaking of.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
That extension up there--

00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.020 position:50% align:center
you're the one controlling
'em, aren't you?

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] You had it
lead me here for a reason.

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
Maybe 'cause you're in over
your head and need my help.

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Very perceptive.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
But you're wrong about me.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
I haven't changed since the
day I hired you, either, Juzo...

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
Well, then. [gasps]

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
[JUZO gasps]

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
[AVI]
How do I put this?

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
You couldn't have picked a more

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
obvious terrorist
hideout if you tried.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
Would it have killed you to be
just a little more creative?

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
The Reconstruction Agency.

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
You were tailing me?

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.273 position:50% align:center
Finally, we meet face-to-face.

00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:48.276 position:50% align:center
Though I'm sure you're going to
find this difficult to believe,

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
I've been fantasizing
about this exact moment

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
for more years
than I care to admit.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
The day I finally capture you!

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.245 position:50% align:center
Years of pursuit
and investigation,

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
all leading to this!

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
Victor Steinberg.

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:08.463 position:50% align:center
You are under arrest
on 32 charges of murder

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:11.257 position:50% align:center
and attempted murder!

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.268 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I feel bad you made such a trek,

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
but before he was a terrorist,
this guy was my client.

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm afraid I'm
a bit lost, Mister Inui.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
He belongs to the group
that kidnapped your friends.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
You're a victim
of his actions, too.

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
Why help him?

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:37.951 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I know.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Doesn't make
a lick of sense, does it?

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
[AVI] Have it your way.
We'll arrest both of you.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
You're a person of
interest to us anyway.

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:53.967 position:50% align:center
Juzo Inui, you're charged
with aiding terrorists

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
and obstructing justice.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
As the substitute director
of EMS, I'm placing you both

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
under arrest.

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Sistivas Skopendra.

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Uh?

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.482 position:50% align:center
[JUZO groans]

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You pushed me outta the way?

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
[AVI]
What are you?

[VICTOR cackling]

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Juzo!

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:30.712 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Mary!

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
I was waiting for you.

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
--[MARY gasps]
--[JUZO] Stop!

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
--[MARY groans]
--[JUZO] Mary!

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Victor, you bastard!

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
What're you doin'?!

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
What timing!

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
Now the stage is perfectly set.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
My hunch was right.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
Looks like the Victor
I used to know is dead.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] You didn't
let me finish earlier.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
I haven't changed.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
Since the day I hired you,
I always wanted to know...

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
...what lives
inside the Extended

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
and allows them to
become more than human.

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:12.754 position:50% align:center
I'll find out by studying a body

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
at the peak of the
extension process!

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
Oh, how I've longed
to disassemble you!

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
You wanna take me apart,
knock yourself out,

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:27.060 position:50% align:center
but leave Mary out of this.

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
That's not good enough.

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
It's not.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
You don't have a Hands
to unlock your potential.

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
That means I can
only see your true form

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
when you put your
life on the line.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.616 position:50% align:center
And I know how.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.159 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
What's this about my true form?

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Yes, Juzo.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center
You really haven't
changed since we last met.

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
Against your better
judgment, you saved me.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
You can only use your power
if it's to help somebody else.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
You'd even sacrifice yourself

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
if it meant protecting
the ones you hold dear.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.394 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR] The time has come
for you to complete the job

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:10.895 position:50% align:center
I requested of you

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
and finally fulfill
your purpose.

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:20.238 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
We understand each other, right?

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You got it wrong.

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
I wasn't protecting you.

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:29.164 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
What I was guarding...

00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:31.332 position:50% align:center
...was Mary's dream of reuniting

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
with the good-for-nothing
brother who left her.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I was protecting her feelings!

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:42.677 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
One more thing--

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:44.721 position:50% align:center
don't go barking orders!

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I ain't takin' requests.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:52.270 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I'm doin' the job...

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
...and taking you out!

00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:28.366 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Quit jokin' around.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.242 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
If I could meet you again...

00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:30.243 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
Did you forget?

00:23:30.326 --> 00:23:31.494 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You coward!

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:32.787 position:50% align:center
[MARY]
Victor!

00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:35.457 position:50% align:center
[VICTOR]
I'll strip it down to nothing!

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.835 position:50% align:center
