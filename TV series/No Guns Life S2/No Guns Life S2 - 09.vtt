[WACHOWSKI] No matter
how noble your intentions,

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.347 position:50% align:center
it doesn't alter this fact--

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.975 position:50% align:center
this world's reality.

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.227 position:50% align:center
Idealism will
only get you so far.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.646 position:50% align:center
Blood must be spilled
and the weak must die

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
in order for there
to be real change.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
You may have a point.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
Right now, my goal's nothing
more than wishful thinking.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
So, what do you plan on doing?

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
Sure, your thoughts
are admirable,

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.081 position:50% align:center
but I hope you're not
asking me to risk my life

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
just because you can't
do anything yourself.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Juzo!

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Achieving justice without
putting your life on the line,

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center
that's a pipe dream.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO grunts]
Maybe.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.726 position:50% align:center
But even so...

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center
My dream is worth fighting for,

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.696 position:50% align:center
and I can't help but be
enamored by the beauty of it!

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.699 position:50% align:center
If that means putting
my life on the line,

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.535 position:50% align:center
it's a small price to pay!

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.350 position:50% align:center

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.774 position:50% align:center

Master Tetsuro.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
You chose to strike an
old man with no hesitation.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
In light of recent events,

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
it appears that
I underestimated you.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO groans]

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] However,
as you're no doubt experiencing

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
at this moment, there's
always a price to pay.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
Every action taken
has a reaction.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
Additionally, the more
significant it is,

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
the larger the ripple
effect ends up being.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
Did you think you were
making a difference?

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI]
The only thing you're doing

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
is running away from making
the most important decision.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
Lashing out, without
any fear of reprisal--

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.674 position:50% align:center
that doesn't
validate your ideals.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
It makes you a tool.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
And because of your
actions here tonight,

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:10.226 position:50% align:center
even greater sacrifices
will have to be made.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
Sacrifice, huh?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
There was a young man named Colt

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
who knew a little
something about that.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI grunts]

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] He worked hard
to provide for his family.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Your organization lured him in

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
by promising to help them,
only to use him as a scapegoat.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.918 position:50% align:center
Did you know he died?

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
Right in front of me.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] I felt the
warmth leave his body.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO groaning]

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
You had no idea. How could you?

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
You don't know anything about

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
the victims your
terrorism creates.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.938 position:50% align:center
Nothing!

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:02.445 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] That's why
you can throw the word

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
"sacrifice" around so easily.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
Aren't you the one
who's really running away?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50% align:center
Turning your back so
you don't have to see

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
the consequences
of your actions?

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
You're a fool if you're
sparing my life!

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
I promise you, Harmony and
Device Thirteen will be mine!

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
I won't stop till
they're in our hands!

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
If you plan on stopping me,

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
then you better
take this opportunity

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
and kill me right here and now!

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
That would mean judging you,

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
which isn't my job.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
One last thing...

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center
...didn't you tell me how
a person's ideals can change?

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
In my opinion, that's
not always a bad thing.

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.561 position:50% align:center
You're a heartless wretch.

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50% align:center
[WACHOWSKI] All those years
of my life spent researching,

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
were not in vain.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center

long enough for him to
finish his business.

going shot to hell like this.

Dammit, Kronen.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
You should've taken
care of your own people

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
before you went around
chasing after Extended!

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
Like I said, he ended up
being a disappointment.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
But still,

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
faced with an Over-Extended
that survived the war,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.423 position:50% align:center
you can almost excuse him.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50% align:center
You're a different caliber,
and honestly, you scare me.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
But I digress.

I might've forgotten
to mention my needles

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
aren't only effective
against Extended.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
Just watch.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
They aren't exclusively
used to limit one's movement.

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
They can also unleash power
in flesh-and-blood humans

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
that rivals the
strongest extensions.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
Of course, that ends up taking
quite the toll on the body.

Hey, now...

and look who they led me to.

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
My old pal.

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
Been a while.

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:16.860 position:50% align:center
It astounds me how

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
we went through the
same training together,

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:21.322 position:50% align:center
both hating the Extended,

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
yet here we find ourselves,
fighting for opposite sides.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
[KUNUGI]
Makes me wonder.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
Is that car of yours still

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
the only hunk of metal
close to your heart?

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
[KRONEN]
My job calls for the elimination

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.756 position:50% align:center
of all criminal Extended--

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
not dirtying my hands
taking out terrorists like you.

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
[KRONEN]
However,

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:49.517 position:50% align:center
in this case,
I'll make an exception,

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:54.022 position:50% align:center
seeing as how I am uniquely
qualified to take you down.

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:28.700 position:50% align:center
[PEPPER]
What the hell's wrong with you?

00:23:28.783 --> 00:23:30.076 position:50% align:center
--[KRONEN] Just now...
--[MARY] Juzo.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.453 position:50% align:center
--[KRONEN] ...was that Inui?
--[SEVEN] I hate you.

00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:33.621 position:50% align:center
[SUISO] Well, I guess
that's your choice, partner.
