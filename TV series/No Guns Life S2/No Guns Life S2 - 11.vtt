you've rejected the

use your power for one goal:

to help the people around you.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center

But I guess that's
the stubbornness

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
that comes from being an adult.

a lecture a while back.

True, it's kind of ridiculous.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:44.652 position:50% align:center

[JUZO] After the Great War,
I became a Resolver.

fix their problems,

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center

while ignoring my own.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] What you don't realize is
when you make a wish come true,

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center

Thing was, I never had
any resolve of my own...

...till now.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
He may be a runt,

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:36.246 position:50% align:center
but he never stopped
pushing me forward.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center

are they worth her life?

Thing is,
