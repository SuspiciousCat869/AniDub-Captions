[EDMUND]
It's time to settle the score...

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
...partner.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:07.335 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO sniffs] It does
have an interesting smell.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.046 position:50% align:center
But I'm still sticking
with plain old milk.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.675 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] So, you're saying
the boy managed to get away

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:17.846 position:50% align:center
before EMS could finish
interrogating him.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.307 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Right, what can you do?

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.894 position:50% align:center
Sorry to ask, but could
you let me handle this?

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.732 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I owe you one, Olivier.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.735 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Huh?

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
Where did Mary go?

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50% align:center
I haven't heard a peep
from her the whole day.

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.700 position:50% align:center
Or Lefty...

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
She's still at the doctor.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
Patching up flesh wounds
isn't exactly in her wheelhouse.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.543 position:50% align:center
you gonna explain
how you're talking?

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
Spitzbergen arranged
the procedure for me.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
I think they must've really
wanted me to get my voice back.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
But I was surprised.

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:58.511 position:50% align:center
They say they hate
extension technology.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50% align:center
Yet they have engineers who
are just as skilled as Mary.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm glad I don't
have to lug around

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.603 position:50% align:center
any more severed
extensions heads.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.979 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Gotcha.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.985 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Oh, and about Chris.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
She was still pretty shaken up.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
They're keeping her hospitalized
for a few more days.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
But overall,
she's doin' all right.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.997 position:50% align:center
She's okay. Good to know.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
[gags, coughs]

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
C'mon Juzo!
What's gotten into you?

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Well, in any case...

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
...I was being careless.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
And you all got caught up
in the crossfire 'cause of me.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout that, kid.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] I can't imagine
what you guys went through.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
But you saved the old lady.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50% align:center
You must've gone
out guns a'blazin'.

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
Which is exactly
what I would've done

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
if I'd have been there.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Smart call.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Tetsuro.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO grunts]
Anyway...

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
So, I...

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Pardon? Don't mean to interrupt.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
But have I stumbled
into the right office?

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
I'm looking for a
consultation with Mr. Inui.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Thanks, my name is Emma Kurtz.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Sorry. We've been having
some wall issues lately,

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
so it's a bit drafty.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
Please. The coffee is keeping
me warm, so I haven't noticed.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Good.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't help but notice

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
you didn't recoil
when you saw my mug.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
You do look distinctive.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
I suppose that might
surprise someone else.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
But I've heard the rumors
about the kind of man you are.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
And actually, I'm close to
someone who's much like you.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:49.998 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
Truth is I'm scrappy.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
And I do have some
scars to prove it.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
Did I make you uncomfortable?

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO] You, uh--
no, it's not that! I swear!

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Tell me.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
What's your
business here, ma'am?

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:04.637 position:50% align:center
...it's about my husband.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
I need you to help me
find my beloved Edmund.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
It was the war.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
And like so many other men and
women in these turbulent times,

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
I lost someone I loved.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
He was a casualty of
that senseless conflict.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
My Theodore, my fiancé.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
The man I cherished
with all my heart.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
We weren't together very long.

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
Even so,

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
the time I spent with him
brought me so much happiness.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.543 position:50% align:center
Later on,

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
when I received the terrible
news that he'd passed away,

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
I was driven to despair.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
I tried kill myself.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] But then, a hand
reached out to rescue me.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
It was Edmund.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
My current husband.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
He looks like you.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
No, he doesn't!

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
Ed had severe injuries.
Most of his body was replaced.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
Countless extensions.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
By some feat of chance,

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
Edmund and Theodore happened
to be in the same detachment.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
They were both part of
a bomb disposal unit.

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:16.292 position:50% align:center
One sent out after
the war was already over.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.336 position:50% align:center
But there was an accident.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50% align:center
The two of them got
caught in an explosion.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50% align:center
My poor fiancé's body
was completely destroyed.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
But Ed miraculously survived.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
It's strange.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:34.019 position:50% align:center
When I realized that
they knew each other,

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
I felt like Theodore sent
Ed to save me from myself.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
Like he was still
trying to protect me

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:42.569 position:50% align:center
from beyond the grave.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
I understand that this may
sound heartless of me to admit.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
But I was finished playing
the part of the faithful widow.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
We had mutual
feelings for each other.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
And once we finally
confessed them,

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
we got married soon after.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
Uh... Juzo?

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.628 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
Need a break?

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I'm good.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
Stories with romantic twists
give me an itchy trigger is all.

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Things changed
about a month ago.

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
I noticed Ed wasn't
behaving like his usual self.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
He would disappear for days,

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.897 position:50% align:center
and be off without a word,
nowhere to be found.

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
And then, three nights ago...

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
...my husband
returned one last time.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
Someone had installed
a new arm extension for him.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
He held my face and
gently kissed my forehead.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
Then he whispered,

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
"Emma,

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
there's something important
I need to take care of.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
I promise, dear,

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:47.342 position:50% align:center
I'll come back home to you
as soon as I'm done."

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.973 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
He's over extended.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.184 position:50% align:center
That extra augmentation.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center
Maybe the reason he
was gearing himself up

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
was because he was getting
ready to snuff someone out.

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:05.443 position:50% align:center
Thought you'd say that,
but still, tragic.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
Mr. Inui, if you would humor me,

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
do Extended retain
their memories?

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
As in the ones from
their lives as humans?

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Who knows?

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
I can't recall squat
from my time as a meatsack.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
Why do you ask?

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
See, I've only touched
one Extended before.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
I'm referring to my
beloved husband, of course.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
But when he holds his
body against mine,

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
I feel a deep
sense of nostalgia.

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:33.471 position:50% align:center
--[JUZO grunts]
--[TETSURO] Hey, let go of me!

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you, detective.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
Please find Edmund and
bring him back safe and sound.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
I'm worried sick.

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
I'm scared of what will happen
if we're already too late!

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
You're sure I can tag along?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Like I have a choice.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
EMS isn't watching us anymore.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
So leaving you home alone
is out of the question, kiddo.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
With your help,
and using Harmony,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
I'm certain that we will

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
succeed in coaxing out
Thirteen's true form,

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
Young Master.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Chop, chop.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.229 position:50% align:center
If you think I'm gonna
babysit you, think again.

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
I'm coming. Lead the way!

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Say, Juzo,

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
do we have any idea where
Edmund might've run off to?

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Nope. Not a clue.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
That's why we're
gonna snoop around

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.746 position:50% align:center
and see what we
can dig up first.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 18A]
Please use the third window

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center

regarding bereavement pay.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.587 position:50% align:center

[JUZO]
You kidding me?

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
Why can't you
show me the records?

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean
the whole register.

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
Just the person
you're looking for.

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
Let's see. According
to the database,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
Edmund Baker is
a restricted file,

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.936 position:50% align:center
which means that
access is denied.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
I didn't know we even
retained records like this.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
Anyway, sir, aren't you
some kinda Over-Extended?

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You need to see my license?

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
[CLERK 17A] That means you
must be a military veteran.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
How peculiar.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
Now, when you've been doing
this for as long as I have,

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.787 position:50% align:center
you definitely don't
forget anything, and yet,

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
I don't ever recall seeing you
listed on the military register!

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
My bad.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
I should've shown
you this sooner.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
What'n the world? It appears
you really do have an exemption.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
Why haven't I seen this before?

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
I don't understand; my memory
has never failed me once!

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Sorry for troubling you, ma'am.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec! I didn't
get to ask you about

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
donating to the
disabled veterans fund!

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
Are we just giving
up on this lead?

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Nope.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
We got what we came for.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] She confirmed that she
has no idea who Edmund is.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
Uh, and how exactly is
that knowledge useful?

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] A civil servant just
told me she's never seen me

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
on the official register, right?

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
Why's that? Much
like our friend Edmund,

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50% align:center
it's because our military
records are restricted.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.670 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
And that means...

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.005 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
It means we're both assets

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
the higher-ups wanna hide.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.217 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:18.178 position:50% align:center
we're cast from the same mold.

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:21.306 position:50% align:center
Two bullets from
one long bandolier.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
He's similar... to you?

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
Can you stop making
a fuss? I told you,

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
it doesn't hurt as long
as I don't push myself hard.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50% align:center
Besides, there's
nothing more painful

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
than the emptiness
in my pockets.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
It would be super nice if there
was a rich customer somewhere

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center
we could bump
into right about now.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
Uh. You don't have
to give me that face.

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
I know I could
never be that lucky.

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
Let a woman have her dreams.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
We've searched high and low,

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
but our guy still
hasn't turned up.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.855 position:50% align:center
Guess we'll have to
start pokin' the dealers.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
Or if I have to,

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
I'll reach out to some of
the retired vets I know.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
Where the hell
did you run off to?

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
Throw us a bone, Edmund.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center

This is nuts!

[EDMUND]
You saved me, Doc.

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
You've got serious
engineering skills for a kid.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
You're a prodigy!

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
I get it. You're welcome!
You can stop shaking my hand!

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND laughs]
Sorry 'bout that.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
Now listen, there's a good
reason you can't gobble up

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
a whole month's worth
of painkillers at once.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.221 position:50% align:center
That's risky business!

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center

Hell yeah.

I love playing with danger.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center

get myself pumped up.

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center

you're still alive.

You fallin' for me, Doc?

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center

Where'd you get that idea?

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, Juzo.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Huh?

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:01.322 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Wanna tell me
what you're doin' here?

Huh?

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] Me, oh, my. Things
keep getting more interesting.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
I found this guy doubled over
in a heap on the street.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.081 position:50% align:center
I wasn't about to leave him,

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:11.958 position:50% align:center
so I brought him back
here to patch him up.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] You're lucky
I'm not the kinda joe

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center

guardian angel's home.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50% align:center
Technically, this isn't
my house, so that doesn't--

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
Wait, wreck what now?!

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center

Catch me outside.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
You got business with me, right?

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the help, Doc.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to
repay the gift someday!

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center

So there's a ghost?

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
[BOY 13B]
Yup. It's haunted,

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
so nobody's allowed to play
near the basement anymore.

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.077 position:50% align:center
We should totally check it out.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center

from the man I was expecting.

this mess over with.

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
My engine froze
down to my boots.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] I knew it
was a message from you.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.447 position:50% align:center
Even if I changed
my name or my face,

00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
you'd never stop hunting me
till you got your revenge.

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
No. You've got the wrong--

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Either way!

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.748 position:50% align:center
I refuse to let myself
go down without a fight.

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:41.376 position:50% align:center
That's why I got
myself good and ready!

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna finish you off
with my own two hands!

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Just hear me out!

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Spare me the wailin'!

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Damn, do you
ever stop yammering?

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
Stubborn motormouth!

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:54.889 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] You Gun Slave
Units are so defensive.

00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
You're literally
covered in insulation.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You know about that?

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.396 position:50% align:center
So you are off the grid!

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:03.648 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Amateur!

00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
This might come as a shock,

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
since my electric needles
can bypass your skin!

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:10.780 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Damn!

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] At last, things
are moving with a bang.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
Let's spark up that
powder-keg noggin of yours

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center
and see what happens when we
add a huge jolt of electricity!

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
[JUZO grunts]

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
--[BOY 13A] Juzo!
--[JUZO gasps]

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
We bought you some chocolate.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.343 position:50% align:center
You should split it
with that guy.

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Get outta here!

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.930 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Lightning and Thunder!

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
Unstoppable Strike!

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.526 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
This way!

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
You again.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
I thought I told you to
steer clear of this place.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center
Now scram.

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
[BOY 13A]
Okey-dokey. See ya!

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
What was that?

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
You could've struck
me down, but you didn't.

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
I could ask you the same thing.

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
You threw that boy at me.

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
What kind of a move was that?

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] I didn't want
him to get electrocuted.

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
I figured a shock jock like
you would also have insulation.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] Oh, I see.
You knew I'd catch him.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
So you chose to protect
the little gremlin

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
instead of saving yourself.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] That's weird.
Five wouldn't do that.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:45.709 position:50% align:center
You really aren't him.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
That's what I've been saying!

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
You've gotta start double
checking your targets

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
before pulling the trigger.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.590 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Sorry, my bad.

00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
If I'm being totally honest,

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:56.678 position:50% align:center
all of you muzzle heads
look exactly alike to me.

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Juzo! You okay?

00:18:58.179 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND, JUZO]
Uh?

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.306 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Tetsuro?

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Emma.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.810 position:50% align:center
[JUZO] Why are you here?
What's going on?

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
It's the client. She knew
all along that Edmund

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
was searching for you
when he disappeared.

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
It was a phony investigation

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
she designed to
set you up as bait.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Huh... That checks out.

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
So you were flushing me out
on your husband's behalf.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.454 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] Is that true?
Why would you do that?

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
I needed you.

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND grunts]

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
Sometime after you went missing,

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center
I was combing through the news
clippings you left behind.

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
You were hunting for a man
with a gun for a head,

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
like Mr. Inui.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] Oh, yeah. I did
leave 'em all over the place.

00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
You've always been the
wild and unpredictable type.

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
Who knew when you'd come home?

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:50.065 position:50% align:center
I was so worried that
I'd never see you again.

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
I had enough.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
I didn't want to
be lonely anymore.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
I'm sorry...

00:19:58.031 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
Edmund.

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
My love,

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
I know that you're my Theodore.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Wha--? That's ridiculous, Emma.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
He died!

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
Every night you make love to me,

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
you take my face in your
hands and gently kiss my scar.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:16.299 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
B-Babe. Pipe down.

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
Don't talk about our private
time around other people!

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
Jeez, I'm not even
into stuff like that!

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
Excuse me?

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
No! That's not what I'm saying.

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
I-It's 'cause you get insecure
about your criss-crosses.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to show that
I love you, scars and all.

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
And Theodore used to tell
me the exact same thing.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
I can't forget those words.

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
Because they're the reason I
started holding my head up high.

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
Haven't you noticed?

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
As long as we've been together,

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
not once--

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
Not once have I ever had
to hide the woman I am.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ed!

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND] I just can't win
against you. Can I, Emma?

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center
I messed up. Sorry
for deceiving you.

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.137 position:50% align:center
You never fooled my heart
for a single minute.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.888 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND chuckles]
That's some flattery.

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Is it now? Silly goose.

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Silly goose?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
Why'd you pretend to be
another person to begin with?

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Well...

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I know. You were the one hiding.

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
You created a fake identity

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:20.155 position:50% align:center
to keep your old
partner off your trail.

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
You didn't want to
risk him finding you.

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
You knew that Five would stop
at nothing to exact his revenge.

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center
That's scary.

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
You knew Five?

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
Stop yankin' my chain.

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
I remember him.

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:35.670 position:50% align:center
We have history.

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Have you seen him lately?

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
You have to tell me where he is!

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
I can't sleep until he's dead!

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.557 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
Then I've got news for you.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
[JUZO]
You can rest easy.

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
'Cause six years ago,

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
I took care of him
with my own two hands.

00:23:27.824 --> 00:23:29.200 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Juzo.

00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:30.869 position:50% align:center
You're always fighting for
someone other than yourself.

00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:32.203 position:50% align:center
[EDMUND]
Why did you murder my partner?

00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:35.582 position:50% align:center
[TETSURO]
Tell me. Do you regret anything?
