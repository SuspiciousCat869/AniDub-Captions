00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
Right now, you seem
like you're in pain.

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
It's not worth it.
You shouldn't doubt yourself.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
I have to!
My writing must be perfect.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
If people don't acknowledge my
music, what worth do I have?

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
You're more than
your music, Mia.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't forget that. Ever.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
Impossible. You see,
the truth is...

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
Writing songs
is all I have left.

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
I'm part of the Taylor Family.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
I have to be successful
in the music industry.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
When I was little,
I loved to sing.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
It made me happy,
so I did it constantly.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
Eventually, I was asked
to join my family onstage.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
It was my debut performance
and I couldn't wait.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
But I had no idea how
popular our name was.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
Or that people expected
excellence from us.

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
Thousands of eyes were watching,

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
waiting to see the
birth of a new diva.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center
It was too much.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
I loved music and singing
because it was fun.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
I couldn't live up
to what they wanted.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
I don't add anything to my
family unless I succeed.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
That's what drives me.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Why I have to excel
and be the best composer

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
writing songs today.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
I thought with Lanzhu, everyone
would recognize my talent.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Hey, you're here right now,

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
still composing amazing songs.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
So maybe this is where
you're meant to be.

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
Come on. I want to
hear it. Your song.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
But she said "no!" You saw.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
That's not what I mean.
I want to hear your voice, Mia.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
[RINA] I don't know what
the Taylor Family

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50% align:center
is supposed to mean.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.910 position:50% align:center
But if you love to sing
and it makes you happy,

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:45.914 position:50% align:center
then that's what I want you
to do. It's what life is about.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Try to embrace the things
that bring you joy.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
Do that, and I think you'll
find the thing you desire

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.842 position:50% align:center
at our school.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
What I desire?

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Yeah.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
I... I want to sing!

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
I know.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
Making your dreams come true
is what being an idol's about.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.779 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
Yes. You're right.

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:18.780 position:50% align:center
[MIA laughs]

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center
Maybe... this is the place
I needed to be all along.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
No matter how hard I try,

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
my dream will remain
just out of reach.

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
The club proved that to me.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.882 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center
[MIA] Thank you, Rina. I'm
finally starting to see my path.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
New plan.
I'm rewriting the song.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.978 position:50% align:center
[phone chimes]

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What?!

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
She's going back home today?

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
Yes, and she's already
heading to the airport.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
I'm torn, there's
something I need

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
to tell her in person
before she leaves.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
It's not just you!

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
Mia's writing her
a special song.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
She's off working on it
right this second.

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.226 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu has to hear it!

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mia! There's bad news.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
I know. I'm almost done.
Stall her somehow.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
Let's all go! We'll track
her down at the airport.

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:21.528 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
[MIA panting]

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
Lanzhu!

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Uh?

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Shioriko.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Finally. We found you!

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
Uh? But why? What is this?

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
[YU] Please. Hold off
on leaving for now.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] Mia's on her way
with a song composed for you!

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
You can't go!

00:14:56.104 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
Sorry. She can write
a masterwork. I'm still leaving.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Blocked!

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.364 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
We won't let you leave!

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Please listen to Mia's song!

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center
I told you, I did everything
I could. I have no regrets.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
[MIA] Since when does
Lanzhu Zhong give up?

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center
[MIA] Do you know what I've
thought ever since we met?

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
That there is no school idol
more perfect than you.

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
Your singing and dancing,
your pride...

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
Not to mention your hard work.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
Despite that, you're unable
to reach your dream.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.477 position:50% align:center
Instead, you're throwing
in the towel.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.355 position:50% align:center
That's not like you!

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter what
kind of song you write me.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
My mind's made up.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
This song isn't for you.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
Because, you see, I have a dream
I haven't reached, either.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
And I'm going to stop
ignoring it now.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
Just like you should.

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU grunts]

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
[MIA] I loved singing,
but I lost confidence

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:59.209 position:50% align:center
and tried to forget about it.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
Then I met this club.
They taught me that

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.047 position:50% align:center
as long as you desire
to be a school idol,

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
there's a place for you.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.637 position:50% align:center
So now, I'll reach out
my hand, too.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
I'm going to grab my dream!

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
Well, then? Your choice?

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu. Please stay.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:07.170 position:50% align:center
I want you and I to be
school idols together.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
Stand beside me on stage.

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
I can't!

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] Forget about me!
The truth is...

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
I'm the person everybody leaves.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
It's always been like that.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
I want to get along with people,
but something always goes wrong!

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
But not with me!

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
'Cause you're different.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
You're the only one who ever
bothered to stick around.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
Others like me at first,
but then eventually,

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
they start to pull
away and disappear.

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
I sorta understand.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
Your attitude can come off
as pretty annoying.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
Why? I always try my hardest.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
Am I just cursed?
What makes me so bad?

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
I don't get why
people abandon me,

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
so I figure I'm
better off by myself.

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
The reason I came here

00:18:57.429 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
is because I thought
I could be a solo idol.

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
That way even if I
didn't get people,

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
I could still make them
acknowledge me.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu.

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center
Everyone is confused by how
others think, it's not just you.

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
You're my one friend.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
But I didn't know you.
I'm a failure.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
See? It's best for me
to be alone.

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
Is that why you declined our
invitation to join the club?

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
It is. Of course, your club
is extra confusing.

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
I can't believe what intense
bonds you solo idols have.

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
You believe in each other
and can perform as units

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
like it's nothing.
If that's what it takes

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
be a school idol,
then I can't do it.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
Could you open your dumb eyes

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
and actually look
around you for a second?

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.106 position:50% align:center
They came for you.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.776 position:50% align:center
Not because I was
composing a song.

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
They wanted to stop you because
they believe in you, too.

00:19:57.572 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
If you can't let
go of your past,

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
you'll break the hearts
of every girl here.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
Is that really what
you wanna do?

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
You and I are so alike, Lanzhu.
Our baggage holds us back,

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
so we've never been able
to achieve our goals.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:15.507 position:50% align:center
But this place isn't like
anywhere else we've been.

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Did you know?

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
The reason we decided to form
our units is because of you!

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
You're the one who
made us better idols.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
It's because of your honest
words that I moved forward.

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:30.021 position:50% align:center
You inspired me to
try harder. Thank you!

[LANZHU]
Shioriko?

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:41.616 position:50% align:center
I know. Why don't we
try again together?

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
If we do, I think we'll
be even closer friends.

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
Really? You think?

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center

Mm-hm.

[MIA] You're no longer
my business partner.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.384 position:50% align:center
You're something else. My rival.

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
Wait, you haven't
even debuted yet!

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
You've got some nerve, newbie.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu. Mia.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:12.355 position:50% align:center
I think we make a strong team.

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.190 position:50% align:center
Sure. Okay.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:20.739 position:50% align:center
But, uh, if we're rivals,
can we still be friends?

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
Softie.

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center

Oh, please. You're one to talk.

[EMMA laughs] Lanzhu decided
to move into the dorms with us.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.164 position:50% align:center
I bet you won't
oversleep as much now!
