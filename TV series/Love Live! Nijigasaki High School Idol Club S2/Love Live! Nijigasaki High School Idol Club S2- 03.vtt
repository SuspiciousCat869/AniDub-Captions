00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.181 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Don't be afraid.
You're not alone.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.101 position:50% align:center
We're right here
with you. Always.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.103 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] You don't have
to look very far to find

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
what's important in life.
It's standing right beside you!

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Nijigasaki. Fight on!
Fight on! Fight on!

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Fight on!

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Hey! Your timing's off, Kanata.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Whoopsie. My bad.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
They sure are working hard.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.040 position:50% align:center
Are they maybe pushing
themselves too much?

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
The joint concert's almost here

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
and performing as a quartet
is a whole thing.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
If the four of them
want to go this route,

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.883 position:50% align:center
then it's our job
to support them.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
And what better way than for
us to break a sweat, too!

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.268 position:50% align:center
You girls are just the best.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.520 position:50% align:center
I love watching you
challenge yourselves.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Nijigasaki.
Fight on! Fight on...

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.732 position:50% align:center
I need to work on myself more.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:08.360 position:50% align:center
Otherwise I won't catch up
to the rest of you.

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:09.444 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Never mind.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:16.409 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Onward.
The joint concert awaits!

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Listen up. I've been
thinking about the concert.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
And I know what we need to do.
Get cute matching outfits!

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
Aww! That's a great idea!
We can wear kigurumis!

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.848 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure about that.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:06.269 position:50% align:center
Here's a thought. We could hold
a virtual concert instead.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
That way we can transform
into anything.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
You can also turn into anything
when you're dreaming.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.279 position:50% align:center
Let's put four ridiculously
soft beds on stage

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
and drift off with our fans!

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
You're suggesting we
nap during our show?

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
Everybody loves a
good night's sleep.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Okay, fair point.
But this is a performance.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
Kanata, are you even
listening to me?

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering]

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
[sighs] We're going in four
different directions.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.631 position:50% align:center
It's so hard.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
I'm having déjà vu.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
Have we had this exact
conversation before?

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center
We only have one week
to prepare our song

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.224 position:50% align:center
for the joint concert. At this
rate, we won't get through

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
to Lanzhu, or even put on
a show worthy of the fans

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
who come to cheer us on.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
Maybe the quartet was a bad
idea. It's so much more work.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
[RINA] No. We can't give up
on this yet.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:03.827 position:50% align:center
A week is a lot of time. We'll
split it up. One day apiece.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
When it's your turn, you can
explain what you're envisioning

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
for our performance. Sound good?

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
If we do that, maybe we'll
understand each other more

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
and become a stronger group.

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
Love it! So smart.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Let's do it!

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
Way to go, Rinako!

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
We won't have enough spare time

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
during normal club
hours. So instead...

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
The four of you are
doing a training camp?

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
Mm! We're going to spend the
night at each other's houses!

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
Starting with Kasumi's.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Mm!

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
I won't be able to wake you up
in the morning like usual,

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
so do you want me
to call you instead?

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
That's kind, but I'm sure
I'll be just fine on my own.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry about me.
Focus on the quartet.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
Great! Bye now! See you later.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
[KARIN laughs]

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.839 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Oh! Karin! Hiya!

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
Oo, drinking coffee, huh? I got
some piping hot tea to sip.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
But I'd rather
spill it. [laughs]

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
Ai.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
Yeah. What's up?

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] Could you call me
at seven tomorrow morning?

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Huh?

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.111 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Sleepover Camp begin!

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.822 position:50% align:center
How we look is super
important, so we need

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
to decide on the perfect
outfits pronto!

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
I happen to have some options
to try. They're cute.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
Straight from the Costumes
and Accessories Club!

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
--[RINA] Ta-da...
--[KASUMI] Oo, Sparkly!

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Take that!

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Magical!

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
--[KANATA] Boo!
--[KASUMI chuckles]

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Aw! We're next-level adorable!

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
You think?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
Hey, I know.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
We'll do quick changes
and wear all the outfits!

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] Well, that might be
a bit more than we had in mind.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
And a little
embarrassing.

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:59.275 position:50% align:center
I'm still pushing for kigurumis.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Aw, I thought for
sure you'd agree with me.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Sorry.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
--[KASUMI whines]
--[EMMA, RINA laugh]

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
So, what I'm hearing is
that you want each of us

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:10.995 position:50% align:center
to look as good
as you do, right?

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Well. Yeah.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
The three of you are
insanely cute already

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
but I want you to look
even cuter up there!

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:20.046 position:50% align:center
That way everyone will see
what I see when I look at you.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
Oh I see!

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Don't smile like that.
Take me seriously!

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
I swear we are.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
Oh! What's down here?

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
These must be your photo
albums, huh, Kasumi.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:39.107 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] That one's not finished
so you should drop it right now!

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI screams]

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
You're so cute!

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
Put that horrible picture
away and forget about it!

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
It's the best thing
I've ever seen.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Then get your eyes checked.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
[MUSIC TEACHER] Today's the
last supplementary class

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
for our new music students.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:55.832 position:50% align:center
For your final assignment,

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
you'll use everything
you've learned thus far.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
You'll write a song,

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
and then perform it
for the whole class.

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chatter]

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
Compose a song?

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
Regarding the festival,

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.767 position:50% align:center
I have a proposal
I'd like to present.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
We streamline and combine that
event with the cultural fair.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
Create one big festival?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
That would solve most
of our issues, sure.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
Do you think the school
would be on board with that?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't think
anyone will complain.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
Just think. Students are
buzzing about the events.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
And this way we'll guarantee
they don't miss a thing.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
That's right. Though,
there's still much to plan.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.126 position:50% align:center
Like how to book idols
from other schools.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center
Then there's the scheduling.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.505 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
No problem. Leave it to me.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.548 position:50% align:center
But first let's get
this approved.

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
Mifune. This is a stellar plan.
Thanks so much.

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT A] You must be
a huge fan of school idols, huh?

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:55.975 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT A laughs]

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't say that.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.981 position:50% align:center
I'm simply trying to run
the best events possible.

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
Uh?

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.535 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
How are your idol
activities going?

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
I heard you held
a small concert.

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! I've actually done
quite a few at this point,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.752 position:50% align:center
they were huge successes.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50% align:center
Of course, I'm not shocked.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU laughs] And my next
one'll be even bigger.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
Something my fans won't forget.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
You'll come see me, won't you?

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'd like that.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center

Speaking of.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center

to that concert, as well.

Yeah.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] I think the most
important thing to do is come up

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.706 position:50% align:center
with something that
our fans can join in on.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.458 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
Without further delay...

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
Take a look at this plushy
stage design! Ta-da!

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
You have got to be kidding me.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.760 position:50% align:center
That's a gigantic pillow!

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
It's a cozy set where we can
enjoy sleepy times with fans.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
It does look super comfy!

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center

No way. Sit down.

[KANATA] Sorry I couldn't
help you with the cooking.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.592 position:50% align:center
[MIA] Hm? That? I've been
done for a while now.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
Huh? You are such a pro.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.096 position:50% align:center

anywhere with mine.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.974 position:50% align:center

That so? Well, bye.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
[YU] Don't you have advice?
C'mon, help a girl out!

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
Hey. Let go.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
My brain can't come up
with new music because it's

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
overflowing with the stuff
we learned in class.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
All the melodies I've tried
to write have been failures.

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
Every time I start
humming a new song,

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
I immediately get
frustrated by it.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
You don't have to love the
melody. There's more to a song.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Huh?

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:45.997 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
Music is about

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:49.250 position:50% align:center
creating something that
others want to hear.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:52.170 position:50% align:center
You're writing for the teacher,
so just show her you understand

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
the lessons she taught you.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
That's how you
approach composing.

00:11:56.675 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
[MIA] Enough advice for one day.
See ya. Little baby.

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
First Question.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.939 position:50% align:center
What comes to mind when
you hear "red fruit"?

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Apples.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
Berries.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
Cherries here!

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
I think passionfruit!

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
What is this?

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
[RINA] A game I came up
with that should help us

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
synchronize our
brainwaves better.

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Say what now?

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Next, what does
"Nijigasaki High School"

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
make you think of?

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
The School Idol Club.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
Courses of study.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
The pretty campus.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center

Jeez, we're all over the place.

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] This game's
surprisingly difficult.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
We're not done yet. Next!

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
[RINA] What does "Odaiba"
make you think of?

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.226 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
The Rainbow Bridge!

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center

Venus Fort!

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:50.478 position:50% align:center

I am!

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
Why're we hopeless at this game?

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
It's about time we took a break.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
I'm with you.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
Not a single match out
of countless questions.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
And we've spent the last
three nights together!

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
Maybe it would be better
for us to do solos

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
at the joint concert instead.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
There's a lot riding on this--
not just with impressing Lanzhu.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
If we don't put on a
performance our fans enjoy

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
there's no point in
getting on the stage.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50% align:center
You're definitely
right about that.

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
What's something the four
of us can only do together?

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
That might be the key.

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
Music people want to hear.

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:52.165 position:50% align:center

some advice, but...

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
I haven't been able to come up
with anything too good.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center

the students in class

seem to have no
problem with this.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
You're on track. And I
agree that it's important

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
to write something that
people want to hear.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
[AI] Yeah, it's a nice starting
point, I'm pretty sure

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
there's way more to music
than that, though.

[YU]
Huh?

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Mm-hm. I think you
should follow your heart

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
and compose the
kinda song you want.

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
What if it's bad?

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
Who's to say?

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
The most important thing
is that you're satisfied

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.141 position:50% align:center
with what you've created.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
I agree with them.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
Try not to think about a song
being "right" or "wrong."

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
That won't help.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:01.609 position:50% align:center

work out, you can start over.

Know what I'd like?

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
A song that somehow
reminds me of you.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
Kind of a tall order.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure
where I would begin.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
which helps you support
us in every way.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
Well. I guess so. You all agree?

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.777 position:50% align:center
Have you never realized that?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
[YU]
To be honest, no.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.989 position:50% align:center
--[AI] What?
--[GROUP laughs]

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
Thank you. I understand now.
This means a lot to me.

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
I feel extra motivated,
and I just know a song

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
will come to me!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Glad to hear it!

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I'll do my best. Promise!

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.298 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] I'm so happy
Yu is feeling better.

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same, but honestly
I was surprised to hear

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
that she didn't consider
herself special.

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Seriously.

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
It might not just be Yu
who's in the dark.

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.227 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Who else needs a pep talk?

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] I suspect everyone in
the club can easily pinpoint

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
what makes others special,
but maybe we're not

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:26.361 position:50% align:center
very good at reflecting
on ourselves.

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
Are you saying that we do
the exact same thing?

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center
I think we might.

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
If it's true...

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
Why don't you point out
good things about me?

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.996 position:50% align:center
Go on. Don't be shy.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI laughing]

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] Hm? You talk about
yourself a lot but in actuality

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
you're always
thinking of others.

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
You do.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
Even when you were pitching
us show costumes before,

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
you looked out for everyone.

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:55.181 position:50% align:center
I appreciate that you're so
concerned about us feeling cute.

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Aw... Okay,
and you actually take

00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
really good care of everybody,

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
despite how much of a free
spirit you are, Kanata.

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
You're just teasing me.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
[EMMA, RINA]
No way!

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:06.609 position:50% align:center
And when we were
spending the night,

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
it felt like there were
two moms in the house.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:09.904 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Really?

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
[EMMA, RINA]
Mm-hm!

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
This is nice but embarrassing.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
Okay. Me next!

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
You can come off as laid back

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
but you're full
of determination.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] I appreciate how
straightforward you are.

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
She hit the nail on the head!

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
Aw, gee, thanks.

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
Rina, you excel whenever
you take the lead.

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] For example,
you suggested sleepovers.

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:35.096 position:50% align:center
Classic Rinako!

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.932 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Aw. Embarrassed.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.603 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] The whole point
of this extra training

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.980 position:50% align:center
was to explain our
ideas to the group.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
I never expected that
we'd end up learning

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
so many good things
about ourselves

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
by looking through
each other's eyes.

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
You're right. I bet that's
a sign of a strong quartet.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
When we perform solos, we don't
get this outside feedback.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
By working as a unit,

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
we can discover new truths
about who we are.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center
By joining together, we can
create a brand-new color.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
[JENNIFER] Sorry to keep you
waiting! Who's ready, to rock?

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Okay. We've got this.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.490 position:50% align:center
[CROWD A]
It's Rina!

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
Ah. There you are.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
[CROWD C]
Kill it, Kasumi!

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
[EMMA gasps]

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU laughs]

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
Hi there!

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
We are psyched to see you!

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
Hope you're excited!

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
We're QU4RTZ!

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:50.417 position:50% align:center
What do you think?
Did we get through to her?

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm positive we did.

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS laugh]

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO] So, this is
the Nijigasaki High School

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
Idol Club. Impressive.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] Hmph. I couldn't
replicate that performance

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
even if I wanted to.
I'll give them that.

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:09.602 position:50% align:center
For now.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
Wow, amazing.

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I know, right?

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.399 position:50% align:center
[AI, JENNIFER]
So good!

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
It feels like those girls
just leapt ahead of us.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
Who knew a performance
like that was possible?

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
They're having so much fun!

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
Next up to play is Yu Takasaki.

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
[YU] The girls in the
School Idol Club helped me

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
discover my dream.

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:45.555 position:50% align:center
[YU]
The reason I'm pursuing music

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
is because I want
to be like them.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
Someone who's able to express
myself through a song.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
Through those girls,

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:59.235 position:50% align:center
I've learned there's
just one me in the world.

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:02.113 position:50% align:center
This doesn't have to be perfect.

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
Because it's something
only I can do.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
[piano plays]

00:23:27.907 --> 00:23:35.206 position:50% align:center
[YU] We don't know what life
has in store from day to day.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.710 position:50% align:center
Hopefully, there's an
exciting future awaiting us.

00:23:38.793 --> 00:23:42.464 position:50% align:center
If we can all
smile about that...

00:23:42.547 --> 00:23:44.382 position:50% align:center
...I'll be happy.

00:23:46.801 --> 00:23:47.886 position:50% align:center

Next time!
