Aw, Kasumin. Your star
barrette is adorable!

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.858 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I know,
isn't it super cute?

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
I had to break it out for
the final day of the festival!

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
We can't hold anything back!

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.325 position:50% align:center
Time has sure flown
by this week.

[JENNIFER]
The sets don't start until noon,

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
so we can relax a bit.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
Let's walk around the fair.
Explore together!

[FANS chattering]

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
So, you girls chose Lanzhu

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
to kick off the performances?

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.174 position:50% align:center
Yes! She may be new here but
her popularity's off the charts.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
Which makes her the perfect idol
to get the audience pumped up.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
I've got this in the bag.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

[AYUMU grunts]

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] I've been watching
everybody perform.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
You've all done great,
but don't get it twisted.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
You're not the stars
of the lineup today.

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.741 position:50% align:center
That role belongs to me.

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
As I promised
from the beginning,

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
I'll show you what a
real idol looks like.

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:22.707 position:50% align:center
My number will be the one
everybody talks about tomorrow.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
[KARIN chuckles]
I'm looking forward to it.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.672 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm not gonna
give up so easily either.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.967 position:50% align:center
We'll all do our best.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.469 position:50% align:center
It's up to us.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:37.305 position:50% align:center
We have to make sure everyone
who participates has fun.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.683 position:50% align:center
That goes for the idols
and the audience.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.560 position:50% align:center
Maybe this'll be the
best day of our lives!

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:43.937 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Hmph.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.606 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Huh?

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.734 position:50% align:center
Huh? The last space is empty.

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:52.153 position:50% align:center
What's up with that?

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:53.613 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh nervously]

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
We sorta still don't
have a song ready.

[SAKURA]
Huh...?

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:00.078 position:50% align:center
Yu is writing something special
from the heart for us.

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:03.206 position:50% align:center
A song the entire club
will be able to perform.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.960 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] But she's got a
stubborn case of writer's block.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:13.299 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] Oh, yeah, I guess she
isn't here. Well, good luck.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.970 position:50% align:center
[YU grumbles]

[AI]
Over here, Sis!

00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
Hi, Ai.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Where should
we go first?

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
Why not start with
your homeroom's booth?

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah! I think you'll
find it especially classy.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
Get it?

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
Attendees. Lend me your ears.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
At this time, the rainbow
jet slider attraction

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.298 position:50% align:center
is now starting!

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.135 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the Nagashi
Somen Club's guidance,

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
we've set up a track for
the Niji High Express

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:23.471 position:50% align:center
that runs throughout the school

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
as part of a special
morning event.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
Ready, set... Launch the boat!

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
[CLUB MEMBERS cheer]

[VICE PRESIDENT A] It'll sail
past the main entrance

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
before heading toward
the West Tower.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT A] What's this?
It's changing direction

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
and traveling toward
the East Tower.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
That boat seems
like a lot of work.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
Whenever the dinghy
reaches its destination,

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
it's a signal for Lanzhu
to begin her performance.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50% align:center
We need to make sure we're
backstage to cheer her on.

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.017 position:50% align:center
But first, more cake!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Right away.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
Here. Hope you all enjoy it.

[KANATA, EMMA]
Ayumu, you look so cute.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
Aw, thanks. I'm trying my best.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
Say, has anyone heard
from Yu lately?

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Nope.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
Well darn, I hope
she's not struggling.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
What a shame. You can't stop
by since you're working.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
But we'll happily say hi
and make sure she's good.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Please do!

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
Aye-Aye.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hi, Shioriko.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
Hey! Is everything okay?

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
I heard that Takasaki was
running into some trouble.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
So you came to help!

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
Uh, just checking in.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yu!

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu's performing soon
if you wanna join us.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.864 position:50% align:center
I can't find my thrill!

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
What is this?
Where's my passion?

[groans] Music doesn't
make sense anymore.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
No matter how much
I agonize about it...

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.420 position:50% align:center
...I'm just not
feeling the thrill!

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.963 position:50% align:center
[YU groans]

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
Wow, this problem is way worse
than I expected it would be.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50% align:center
Agreed. She definitely
needs a fresh outlook.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
Delish!

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.563 position:50% align:center
Why did I have to
come along again?

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
'Cause yummy things
taste even better

That's how it works?

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
On this point, she's right.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
Stop staring.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.668 position:50% align:center
Hey, look.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Here. Drink this and relax.

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
That sounds nice.

[AYUMU]
Yu!

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
How's everything going?

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
It goes. You don't need
to look so concerned.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
Sorry. You've given me
such great advice

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
about this piece already.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
It's our pleasure.
We're always here for you.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
So talk.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
It's just that this is
an important song.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
The festival almost fell apart,
so I want this to be a triumph.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center
Which means...
it needs to be perfect.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:40.669 position:50% align:center
Something that showcases
each of your amazing talents.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.922 position:50% align:center
Plus, I have to make sure the
fans are wowed by it, too.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
And there's...

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
...something else.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50% align:center
I want this song to prove
that I'm truly worthy.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.680 position:50% align:center
Not just that I belong
in the idol club,

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
but that Lanzhu's
wrong about me.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
So, yeah.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
[YU] Trying to figure out if
this one song checks all those

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50% align:center
boxes kinda made me lose
confidence in myself.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
The more I thought
about all of it,

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
the more my head
started spinning.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:11.449 position:50% align:center
Know what?
You're way too tense.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
And you are definitely
overthinking this.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
Though that part
isn't very surprising.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
I know this may sound
ridiculous coming from me, but

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.335 position:50% align:center
perhaps you're
attempting too much.

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
Don't pressure yourself.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
[YU gasps]

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.339 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she's right.

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
The fact that we get to
sing a song you composed

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
is good enough! I swear!

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
Try to think of everything
else as being a bonus.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
I'm really happy we get
to perform something

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
you wrote just for us.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
It makes me feel special.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:39.769 position:50% align:center
We'll do ya proud.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
I know we'll be filled
with confidence

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50% align:center
since it came from you!

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.530 position:50% align:center
[YU] In that case,
the goal is to write a song

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
that'll thrill the School
Idol Club and our fans.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
It's as simple as
that in the end.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
And it's something I can do.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
Okay. Thanks so much, everyone!

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center

be done real soon.

Heh. The boat's
not even an issue.

My only concern is
conquering the stage.

beyond a shadow of a doubt--

It's hard to put into words.

But you could tell from
her singing and dancing,

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
from everything, that she
was laying herself bare

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
for the audience.

my heart swelled.

But it's not just her.

are killing it as well.

they've got on the stage.

No hesitation.

So let's trust her.

But I think there's still
a spark missing from it.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center

just come from the song.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
Or the dancing.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
