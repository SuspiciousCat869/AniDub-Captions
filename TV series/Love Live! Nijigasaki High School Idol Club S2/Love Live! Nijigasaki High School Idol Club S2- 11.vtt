That slumber party sure was fun!

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center line:84%
And we wrote an awesome song!

[LANZHU]
If you're down, I'd love to do

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
something like that again.

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:23.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
Totally We should start
keeping a list

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:27.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
of the incredible things the
13 of us can do together.

[EMMA, KANATA laugh]

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is huge, girls!

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.872 position:50% align:center line:84%
Big news! This unofficial little
school idol club of ours

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center line:84%
is about to go through some
unexpected changes.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center line:84%
The school is
making us official!

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
At least, I think
that's what I overheard.

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you sure you're
not confused?

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
You have to put in a request
if you want to be official.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Eh?

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Hm...

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:00.643 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Heh! Oopsie.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.688 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah, jeez. You had me
scared there for a sec.

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you wanted,

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
we could easily become
an official organization.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're well established
and have the reputation.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.323 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we did that,
would anything change?

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
We could ask for
a bigger club room

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
and start reserving
spaces to practice in.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:20.330 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perhaps more exciting,
we'd be eligible to enter

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
school idol competitions that
require institutional backing.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP gasps]

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.961 position:50% align:center line:84%
I feel like I'm
missing something.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.131 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's a big national
competition for school idols.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.633 position:50% align:center line:84%
Lots of girls compete.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:34.594 position:50% align:center line:84%
Like Touou, Shinonome,
Y.G, and Shion.

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:37.347 position:50% align:center line:84%
Haruka's doing it, too!

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.808 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, that makes sense.
Sounds fun.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:43.186 position:50% align:center line:84%
When we were just getting
started, we were actually hoping

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
to make it all the
way to Love Live.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.066 position:50% align:center line:84%
[yawns]

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:52.862 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah... The club's
been through a lot.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.823 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA]
Do you want us to compete?

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:58.702 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm good. Singing with
you is enough for me.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.078 position:50% align:center line:84%
I agree.

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
This club taught me that
there's far more to being

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center line:84%
a school idol than
competing in Love Live.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:06.626 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU]
Hm.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's so sweet.

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:10.964 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whether we try for
Love Live or not,

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
we should really decide
if we want to go official.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.344 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't know. Should we?

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:19.848 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, there isn't a real reason
to rush things, is there?

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yu is right.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.435 position:50% align:center line:84%
Plus our exams are
right around the corner.

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.770 position:50% align:center line:84%
We should probably
focus on those for now.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wha--? Our exams?

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.400 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please don't worry.
We'll study together.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.111 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA]
Everybody passes!

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:34.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's smart!

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let's split up into our
separate grade levels.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.075 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we start now,
we'll ace those tests.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
We've got these exams!

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.580 position:50% align:center line:84%

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH]

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
Kasumi?

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:27.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA] Looks like she's
entered sleep mode.

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why don't we take a break?

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes! Please!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah, jeez.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center line:84%
You know, if we do decide to
become an official organization

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center line:84%
at the school,
then we'd have resources!

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center line:84%
We might be able to
pull off a performance

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center line:84%
we never could before.

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
What are you envisioning?
A concert?

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center line:84%
Something that fuses
together singing, dancing,

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
and our feelings.
It'd be so cute!

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
That'd be nice.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
Group numbers would be
much easier to rehearse.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Mm-hm!

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA] Mm, I get it. That's
why you're so spaced out.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI chuckles]

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center line:84%
But if you don't start
studying right now,

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center line:84%

--What?!
--[SHIZUKU] Let's do our best.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center line:84%
Has she been hanging
out with Ai?

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
Maybe. The pun was
pretty bad, right?

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SETSUNA] You must have dreamed
about Love Live. Huh, Lanzhu?

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your eyes seemed to light up
when it was mentioned earlier.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, I wondered if maybe
it was your goal.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU laughs]
You're not wrong.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've always liked the idea.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I also think performing
with a group onstage

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
is still something
I need to work on.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll get there, but it's
going to take a ton of work.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center line:84%
Makes sense.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
And when you're a
girl-group pro, you'll be

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
the best school idol
in the whole world!

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU] Without a doubt.
I bet you could put on

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center line:84%
an amazing performance
with anybody!

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
Keep training.
You'll get there.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just make sure you don't forget
about us, when you make it.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:12.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh? Huh...

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center line:84%
Earth to Karin,
are you in there?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA] If you're tired,
I highly recommend a snooze.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center line:84%
Here, use this.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
No thanks, I'm fine, really.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center line:84%
I just zoned out thinking
about the future of our club.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's definitely
a lot to consider.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
But we need to focus
on the exams at hand,

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center line:84%
especially since you barely
managed to pass the last round.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.940 position:50% align:center line:84%
You don't test well?
That's too bad.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:41.901 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hold on. Shouldn't you
be studying as well.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nope! No need to.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was actually already in
college back home in the States.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.995 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait, you are fourteen, right?
So how is that even possible?

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:55.248 position:50% align:center line:84%
A child prodigy.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, I suppose. I could
help ya out some. You in?

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh? Much appreciated.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm suddenly feeling
extremely motivated.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nice work!

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why don't we reward ourselves
with something sweet.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Uh? Not done?

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good job. A group study
session is just what we need.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
No yawns!

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're very skilled when
it comes to tutoring.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks, but now I'm
exhausted. Jeez...

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Okay! No more exam talk.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's time for a delicious
change of pace!

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center line:84%
This chocolate crepe
is so buono!

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't be shy! Dig in, girls!

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center line:84%
Here, you should have a bite
of my ham and cheese one.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
How strange.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.804 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've never had a crepe
that wasn't sweet before.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh. Why do you look so sad?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll gladly take yours
if you don't want it.

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? Think again.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll eat this! It's just
that I keep getting lost

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center line:84%
in my thoughts. Darn it!

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey!

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why don't we decide our
fate right here, right now?

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, it's not like I have
a clear answer as to what

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
we should do myself, but
we can at least talk it out.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perhaps we should take more
time to consider the issue.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI] But listen, what if
we're overthinking

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center line:84%
when we should be doing
something instead!

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
She might just have a point.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
The problem is we're
not always performing

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.805 position:50% align:center line:84%
as a single group unit.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
You each have very
different hopes and dreams

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center line:84%
you want to achieve.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's true. But we're
driven by the same passion.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
We want to reach our goals.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:45.900 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even if we sing solo,
when we stand on that stage,

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know that we'll be
school idols together.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center line:84%
And we all love the
same thing about

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
being performers,
isn't that right?

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's what defines us as a group.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center line:84%
I love school idols.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I love you girls
for welcoming me

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center line:84%
into your club with
support and enthusiasm.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
Honestly, if I didn't
go to our school,

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center line:84%
I might never have pursued my
idol dreams in the first place.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, same. This feels
right. I like it here.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:14.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aw, it's great to hear
that. I'm so happy.

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center line:84%
In that case, I'd like us
to stay as we are now,

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
for the sake of our
future members!

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then we're set.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.734 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah! We won't go
official after all.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our amazing group will
continue to be just that!

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.407 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Nijigasaki High School Idol
Club remains as it is!

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Mm!

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
I feel like myself again.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA] Now we can
concentrate on our studies.

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh! I'll try to stay on topic.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:50.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kay. Once we're done
with our exams,

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:53.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
we can take a closer look
at what's next for the club.

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Mm-hm. I look forward to it.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whatever happens, I wanna
have fun with you girls!

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.225 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AI]
That's the idea!

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ringing]

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN grumbles]

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
Oh. Morning, Haruka.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
Morning!

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center line:84%
You leaving already?

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Tokyo prelims
are coming up soon.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center line:84%
Every little bit
of training counts.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
Remind me, the prelims
are online, right?

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HARUKA]
Mm.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA] Then I'll be planted
in front of my screen

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
and cheering you on that day.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aw, yay! Thanks, Sis.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AI]
Heya!

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
Uh?

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center line:84%
Karin!

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please, Ai. Slow down!

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.474 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AI laughs]
G'Mornin'!

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA panting]
Just let me catch my breath.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hi there, you two.
Out for a jog?

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you exercise like this
every single morning?

00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's my training. I want
to improve my stamina,

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center line:84%
that way I can keep up with
everyone who supports me.

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see. How noble.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AI] Come on! Gotta keep
that blood pumpin'!

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA]
Yeah!

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIA exhales]
I can't believe

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have to help out
with your homework, too.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI] Well, Shioko's
busy today, so, please?

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh? So tell me, what are you
working on, Li'l Puppy?

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who are you calling "puppy"?

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is the new budget
application for our club.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're going on break soon,

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center line:84%
which is the perfect
time to set it in stone.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow. You actually do real work?

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center line:84%
Heh! Feel free
to praise me more!

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aren't I amazing? And smart?
And super adorable?

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center line:84%
Part president, part puppy.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, I was wondering.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center line:84%
You transferred here on a
short-term exchange, right?

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
How long are you here?

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? Short-term?

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
Does that mean you
have to go home soon?

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not a chance.

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.507 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI, SHIZUKU grunt]

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm finally able to reach
for my dream at this school.

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN laughs]

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center line:84%
What are you talking about?
You're perfect, Ayumu.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aw, thanks! You're so nice.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU]
Uh! Karin!

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
Uh.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your timing is impeccable!

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's going on here?

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:20.407 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was just having a little
chat with Ayumu and Yu.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.158 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want to know how I can put on

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
outstanding performances
like all of you do.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'll have to be more specific.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU] Like how you
always lift each other up.

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or seem to commune
with your fans.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's been asking everybody
the same question.

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, keep working hard.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center line:84%
If there's any way I can help
out, just say the word, okay?

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perfect. [speaking Chinese]

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure it will all
make sense in no time.

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just think. Each of
you will be unique,

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
but your hearts will join
together and beat as one.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.858 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'll be the ultimate
12 school idols.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU, LANZHU]
Uh?

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're not 12, silly.

00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're 13! Duh!

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
Yikes. A little too tight.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP laughing, chattering]

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
They're all growing so much.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center line:84%
As you know,

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center line:84%
the student council elections
are soon after our exams.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] Very soon.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you bring it up because you
plan to run for office again?

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mm-mm. I think not.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a good time for me
to retire that role.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
Huh?

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was able to achieve
everything that I wanted.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm happy. My days as
president were fulfilling.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's best for me to move on now.

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll have much more time
to focus on being an idol.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
I understand. And thanks.

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
If it weren't for you,
I never would have realized

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:49.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
I had it in me to be
an idol, as well.

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I still like supporting
our whole school.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's something I
feel I'm good at.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I like it. It's gratifying
to help others.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center line:84%
So that's why...

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've decided. This election.
I'm running.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
Great. If that's what you want,
then create the future

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center line:84%
where you're president
of the council.

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow, you did it!
You're amazing, Karin!

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let's move on to
the next one. Huh?

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hello, Karin?

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh! Oh. Sorry, Emma. Thanks.

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
In some ways, I'm also changing.

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMMA] Thanks for coming
shopping! This'll be fun.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, please, it's my pleasure!

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.681 position:50% align:center line:84%
Too bad, though.

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wish Karin could've
come with us.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, I agree.

00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center line:84%
She said she had
something else to do.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:01.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I am a little worried.
She's been acting weird lately.

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:03.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
Hm?

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
--Hm?
--Uh?

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA, EMMA]
It's her! Karin!

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.846 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN exhales]

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT A]
What's your dream school?

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT B] Don't laugh,
but I'm definitely applying

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
to Niji High next year.

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT A]
What? No way! Me, too!

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[STUDENT B] Really?
--[STUDENT A] Yeah!

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT B] Wow! I hope
we get to go together!

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT A]
That'd be perfect!

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMMA, KANATA]
There you are, Karin!

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
Emma. Kanata. Why're you here?

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center line:84%
We saw you walk by
our train window.

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
This seemed like the
likeliest place for you to go.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center line:84%
So we booked it from
the next station over.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you two okay?

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
Totally peachy.

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
Yes?

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? Nothing, just
standing here.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
Out with it, already.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA, EMMA laugh]

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let me take a wild guess.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
You came running 'cause
you're concerned about me.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
I knew it. You're so nosy.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center line:84%
Were we that obvious?

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN] I've only been in the
club a little over six months.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center line:84%
But it's been more fun than
I could've ever imagined.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center line:84%
Singing alongside you,
it's given me such a purpose.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
We've managed to bring so many
fantasies to life on stage.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
Each one of us has transformed.
For the better, I would say.

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center line:84%
With every step we take, the
future becomes the present.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center line:84%
And things are going
to continue to change.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, I can't help
but keep thinking,

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
what happens after this?

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because Third Years like us
will be the first to leave.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMMA] You're afraid
you'll end up lonely.

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because the fun days we've spent
together will be in the past.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center line:84%
I feel the same.
The future can be scary.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.034 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's so cold out here!

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, it is winter.

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center line:84%
You know what? We can't worry.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you spend too much time
concerned about the future,

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
you'll end up missing
out on the present!

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.674 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN gasps]

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's got a point.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center line:84%
As long as you can enjoy
each day to the fullest,

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
you're doing great. Cheer up.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure our tomorrows
will be full of more

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
good times and good friends.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hope you're right.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:29.651 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's hard. I love the School
Idol Club so much.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center line:84%
Performing alone.
Or singing as a unit.

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:37.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or even with everyone.
It's the best!

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we have to do something
else when we move on,

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center line:84%
then we should
shine bright today.

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP gasping]

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're right. I feel better.

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're all very different here.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:59.723 position:50% align:center line:84%
And our uniqueness
is what makes us "us."

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
When we open our eyes, we need
to see a future of possibility.

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:16.364 position:50% align:center line:84%
If the world's a blank page,
then we must add

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
more color.

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
And we're off.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:28.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALL gasp]

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's it!

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:40.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
Karin, Kanata, and Emma
are at Seaside Park!

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're almost there.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:04.079 position:50% align:center line:84%
Heya! Awesome idea!

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU] I think our first Live
with everyone is going to be

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
a blast. I can't wait
to put it together.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SETSUNA]
Solo, unit, and club songs.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center line:84%
Performances that
show off exactly

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
what the 13 of us excel at!

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.050 position:50% align:center line:84%
You know what?

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center line:84%
We haven't really had a
Live with just our club.

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
This'll be extra, extra special.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center line:84%
You nailed it with
this one. Nice work.

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, it sounds decent.

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center line:84%
[laughs] Thanks.

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
Next up, we'll want to start
brainstorming logistics.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hope we'll be able
to thank our supporters.

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center line:84%
We wouldn't be here
without the fans.

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Let's give it our best!

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH laugh]

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
[laughs]

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay, girls! We're going to
make this the best Live ever!

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Ta-dah! Look who did very okay!

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm so proud of you, Kasumi!

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.861 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI giggling]

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIA] I tutored you through
every piece of homework

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
and that's all you could manage?

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, now, what she
managed was to not fail!

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.662 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll get an even better
score next time!

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center line:84%
Go, go, Kasumin! You can do it.
Go, go, Kasumin! You can do it.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
Go, go, Kasumin...

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh wow. We passed.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.632 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI] Go, go, Kasumin!
You can do it, yeah!

00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN laughs]

00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:20.233 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh? Hey, Ayumu.
You've got a message here.

00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:24.738 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Huh? Thanks. Let's see...

00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:30.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh...?

00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:32.954 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
And... done.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU laughs, gasps]

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU, AYUMU]
Next time, Cheer!
