your dream. What gives?

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
She spoke the truth.
When I was a child,

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
I used to put school idols
on a shiny pedestal.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.003 position:50% align:center
My goal was to be
like my sister.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
Back then, she was an incredibly
skilled singer and dancer.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
Only, none of that
mattered in the end.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.929 position:50% align:center
Despite her passion,

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:41.891 position:50% align:center
she simply wasn't meant to
be a successful school idol.

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.185 position:50% align:center
Her dreams crumbled because
she couldn't achieve

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
the results she wanted.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
The pain must
have been terrible.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
As such, I changed my dream.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
My new objective is
to excel at the things

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
I know I'm good at.
Which means

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
I'll support you while you
chase after your goals.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
I no longer want to
stand on the stage.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.123 position:50% align:center
You talk as if you
can't do both things.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
You told me I can be
an idol and presid--

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
Because you have
the talent to do both.

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:13.506 position:50% align:center
You're devoting yourself to
two things you're suited for.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
I don't have those skills.
It's not worth trying.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center
This way I can be useful
and make people happy.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
I won't be wasting time.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're all smart
enough to understand that.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.729 position:50% align:center
Let's consider this
topic closed now.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
I still have lots of work
to do. I'll see you later.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.870 position:50% align:center
Oh, fancy meeting you here.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
What's up? You look bummed.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
I'm just fine.

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
This is where you go to school?

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
You seem lonely ever
since Lanzhu moved away.

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
And as your big sister, I'd say
it's my duty to cheer you up.

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO] Hey, Sis. What does
it feel like to stand onstage?

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:26.830 position:50% align:center
[KAORUKO]
Want to find out?

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
Huh? No. I couldn't.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
Because I'm not
an idol like you.

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.672 position:50% align:center
[KAORUKO]
Yet.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.133 position:50% align:center
You can become one
in the future.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.761 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.932 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
My older sister was dazzling.

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
The coolest person I'd ever met.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
And my inspiration.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
But she wasn't perfect.

00:12:57.861 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
If she had known
from the beginning

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
that she wasn't meant
to be a school idol,

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
she never would have failed or
had to regret her club years.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
I will not make the
same mistake she did.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
It's just too much.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
No one on earth should
have to go through that.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] Okay, she refuses to do
stuff she thinks she's not good

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
at and instead wants
to focus on what

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
she thinks are her
strengths. Tricky.

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
I can see how that
might be a safe,

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
comforting way to
go through life.

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
We can't just force her
to become a school idol.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yes, but... This isn't over.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
I can see what her logic is.

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.615 position:50% align:center
She thinks she's
better at support.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.576 position:50% align:center
So on the surface it makes
sense to pursue that.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center
And yet, she'll still fail.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
Regret will consume her.

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
So she needs help.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
What an impossible bunch
of softies you are.

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
Let's try again.
We'll rekindle her dream.

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
And get her onstage!

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mm!

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
[AI]
There you are, Mifune!

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
Miyashita. And you're not alone.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
Our calls weren't going
through to you,

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center
so it took forever
to track ya down.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:27.492 position:50% align:center
Oh. Apologies.
Did you need something?

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
We realized you haven't
had any free time

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
since the festival started,
isn't that right?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
So let's go n' have some fun.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
But I'm in charge of making sure

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
everything runs smoothly.

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
Seeing through
the eyes of the audience

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.047 position:50% align:center
is an important part
of that job.

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
You'll be surprised
what you learn.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
--Come on! Over here!
--No "Buts."

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
--Come on!
--Let's go!

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.220 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
Ah, what a blast!

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
Did you pick up
on anything new?

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.824 position:50% align:center
I guess. It seems
like people are having

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:12.203 position:50% align:center
the best time doing things
that interest them.

00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
We're not finished yet.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.875 position:50% align:center
There's one more place
we wanna take you.

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
--[AYUMU laughs]
--[SHIORIKO] Uh.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center

This way!

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
[AI] Just keep putting one
foot in front of the other.

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA laughs]
We'll lead the way.

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.805 position:50% align:center
This is...

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yup.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
It's where you first realized
your dream, isn't it?

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Mifune. Follow your
heart. There's still time.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
We know you prioritize using
the skills that you've mastered.

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
Because of that, this festival
has been truly remarkable.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
That's why we're switching.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
Take a break. Give us the
opportunity to support you.

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
Honestly, the only reason
I'm able to perform

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
both my roles at school is
because of the School Idol Club,

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
the student council,
my fans, and you.

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.892 position:50% align:center
I couldn't do it alone.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
You've worked so hard to do
nice things for the school.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
Please give us the opportunity
to return the favor.

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
Let's swap. It's only natural.

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Hey!

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
You do know what
today is, dontcha?

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course, it's the
fourth day of the festival.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
[AI] That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
It's the day when
everyone's dreams come true.

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:42.127 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] You put all your heart
and soul into this event.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
Reward yourself!

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
Otherwise this was for nothing.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
And the festival
wasn't a real success.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
My dream can come true?

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
But... My sister was so sad.

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
She did everything she could.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
For three years
she tried to make

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center
her dream a reality.
And for what?

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
I had to watch her cry!
She was full of regrets.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
[KAORUKO] That's not true.
I regret nothing.

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:27.797 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
Sis?

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong,
I was disappointed then.

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
Looking back on it, though?

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
I'd happily do it again.

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
The spotlight's
warmth on my skin.

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
The joy of singing with others.
Not to mention the pride I felt

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
every time my sister
was in the audience.

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't trade my experience
as a school idol for the world.

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:52.822 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO grunts]

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
I'll second what
the others have said.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
I owe you for the support
you gave me in school.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
It's probably the
reason I was able

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
to have such a good time.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center
And it's why I became
a teacher. To help others.

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
Not just my students--
I want to lift you up, too.

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO gasps]

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
If you think back,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
I bet when you watched
your sister perform,

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center
it filled your entire body up
with happiness, didn't it?

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
Yes, it did.

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:29.275 position:50% align:center
I have so many memories
where my heart is racing

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
because I'm watching
my sister sing and dance.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
I thought that didn't matter

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
when compared to the
possibility of failure.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
And yet, here I am.

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
The reason I decided
to promote this festival

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
is because I wasn't
able to ignore

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
my love of school
idols completely.

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:52.340 position:50% align:center
Do you think that I can do this?

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:55.510 position:50% align:center
You'll be fine.
We're here with you.

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
Embrace the thrill you feel
inside, and let it shine!

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
If you feel a longing,
then you're meant to do this.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
Don't fight it.
Step into your dream.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.184 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
How was I?

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:11.521 position:50% align:center
[KAORUKO] Heh. Well, you've
still got quite a ways to go.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
I know that much.

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
[KAORUKO]
But I loved it, Sis.

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
Everyone, I'm grateful for
your help. Maybe. Um...

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
How about you perform
with us tomorrow?

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:32.042 position:50% align:center
I can't.
I'm in charge of things.

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
I still wanna make sure
the festival goes well.

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
To the end. But I
wonder if, after,

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:41.885 position:50% align:center
I could accept your invitation
and join the club.

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Of course you can!

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.388 position:50% align:center
We would love that!

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:48.141 position:50% align:center
[AI] It'd be great to
have you, Shiotte!

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Don't worry,
I'll teach you how to be

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:52.812 position:50% align:center
a cute school idol,
no prob Shioko.

00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
Shiotte? Shioko?

00:21:55.899 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing, chattering]

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.712 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Hm...

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.799 position:50% align:center
So what's my thrill?

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:50.680 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] Next time! "The Place
Where the Rainbow Begins."
