[YU] Let's build a bridge
beyond the endless sky!

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.438 position:50% align:center
One that connects us
to the future.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.953 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Let's go to tomorrow!

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.794 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] The Second School Idol
Festival is happening soon!

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
Great work, Director Osaka!

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.635 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you like it. Thanks!

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
Props to Rina and Yu as well.
The editing looks professional!

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:38.515 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs]

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.891 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Embarrassing.

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.559 position:50% align:center
You girls made it special!

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:44.562 position:50% align:center
The fans will love it, too.
I can't wait for them to see.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.981 position:50% align:center
Same. When are you going
to post it online?

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.234 position:50% align:center
Well, we're actually in
talks with the council

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:51.736 position:50% align:center
about showing it to the
whole student body. Soon!

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.241 position:50% align:center
And since I'm the president,
things should go smoothly.

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:59.452 position:50% align:center
[YU] My hope is that we can get
more idols from the area,

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
and even some new fans to
participate this time around.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
Everyone had a blast last time.
People're gonna be pumped!

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.502 position:50% align:center
Sure will, and our
uploads from the festival

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.379 position:50% align:center
are racking up a ton a' views!

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.506 position:50% align:center
Lots of high schools
have reached out to us.

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.552 position:50% align:center
And I don't just mean
Shinonome and Touou.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.554 position:50% align:center
That makes my heart smile.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.139 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs]

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.808 position:50% align:center
Let's practice hard today so
we don't let our fans down.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.978 position:50% align:center
I wanna see total cuteness
overload, got it?

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.397 position:50% align:center
Oh, but there's one more thing.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.316 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] I'm treating
you dear club members

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.237 position:50% align:center
to my yummy specialty buns!
Eat up, everybody!

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.780 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering]

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.918 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrates]

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.674 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.641 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.396 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
School idols, huh?

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] I listened to
the song. It's good.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:17.447 position:50% align:center
[MIA] Of course it is.
I did write it, after all.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.240 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU laughs]

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
Well. Let's go.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
[YU grumbles]

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
[yawns] Good morning.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:52.273 position:50% align:center
Backatcha. Were you up late
practicing the piano again?

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
Guilty.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Getting used to
the music course yet?

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
Well, it hasn't been that
long since I switched over.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
The first term'll
mostly be catchup.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
I need quality time at
the piano every day.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50% align:center
Make sure that you're not
pushing yourself too hard.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
Don't worry! This is what
I want to do! I'll be fine.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI grunting]

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
You've got this, Kasumin!

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
No pressure, this just decides
if we get to sing or not.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Why do you wanna
make my nerves even worse?

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
[AI] Aw, cheer up.
I'm sending you a fortune

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
of my good luck points.
How's that?

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
Yep, good vibes.
Transferring now.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
Would you two please
take this seriously?

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50% align:center
No more stalling.
Don't let me down, Hand.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
Reach in and draw a winner!

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
Looking ahead. The second term
is overloaded with big events.

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:53.626 position:50% align:center
First thing on the agenda?
Nijigasaki's Open Campus.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
That's when middle schoolers
get a chance to visit us

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
and explore everything
we have to offer.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
Our clubs will be front and
center showing their stuff.

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center
The executive committee
plays a vital role in this.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
It's our job to make sure

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
everything goes off
without a hitch.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
With your help,
it'll be a success.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
[COMMITTEE MEMBERS]
Yes, ma'am!

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
There's been a
huge amount of buzz

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
surrounding our
school idols recently.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
That should bring in a
bunch of new students!

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
Um. Yes! I think I
heard about that, too.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, I'm from
general studies.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.784 position:50% align:center
I'm Shioriko Mifune.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Go ahead.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
What exactly will the School
Idol Club be presenting

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center
to our visitors?
A performance of sorts?

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
I heard they're going to
announce the commencement

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
of another festival, even
bigger than the last one.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's what my sources
told me as well.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
An event where your
dreams come true.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.054 position:50% align:center
I must say, it sounds wonderful.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
If this will involve girls
across our campus,

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
I'd like to offer my help.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.143 position:50% align:center
Whatever the club needs,
I'm there.

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
That would be incredible!

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.440 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT A]
Someone's excited.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.566 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Uh--

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] So. No concert
at the open campus?

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
[AI, KANATA]
It's our fault!

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
I'm super depressed.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
There's no use crying. We've got
a bunch of clubs at school.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
Everybody wants
the chance to shine.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
The lottery was a bust,

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50% align:center
but we've got a booth
in the west tower.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
We can hand out fliers to
everyone who passes by.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Oh, that's not
the only thing we can do.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
Get this. We're premiering
our festival promo

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
on the huge screens in the
east tower for everyone to see!

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasp]

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
We have a pretty small timeslot,

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
but it's sure to have
people talking!

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.310 position:50% align:center
That'll be awesome.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU grunts]

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
Is something on your mind?

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
Just thinking.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
With another week of work,

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
we can get the video
to look even better!

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
Since so many people
are gonna be there,

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
it needs to be perfect.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Mm.

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
That's smart.
I have faith in you!

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
The rest of us can't relax.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
We have to do everything
we can to pull off this event!

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
True.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Let's rock this thing!

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.733 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
How's it going?

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.276 position:50% align:center
A work in progress.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
We make one fix--and then we
have to change something else.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
That sounds rough.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Hm? There's a lot goin'
on here. What's in these?

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
[RINA] It's just some footage
and outtakes we're not using.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
Really? Can I see?

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Yes. When we're done.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:41.002 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs]

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY B] Hello! Welcome
to the open campus ladies!

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A]
Hi! Come in!

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.686 position:50% align:center
Here ya go.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
Thanks! I'm so excited!

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:00.980 position:50% align:center
We're thrilled to have you.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:01.940 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Thanks.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Can I get one of those?

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.361 position:50% align:center
I'm back, Shioriko.

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
Oh. It's been a
long time, Lanzhu.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
I wanna talk to some
of the students.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center
Would you be a darling
and point me

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
toward the School Idol Club?

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
Did you come for them?

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
[YU] Wow. This place
is totally packed.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:27.173 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Why didn't we
come to this thing

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
whenever we were in
middle school, huh?

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
Guess it didn't seem necessary.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
We already knew the school
since we lived so close.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
Good point.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
And everything worked
out for the best.

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
It took a sec, but we
found our place here.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:44.816 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we did.
What's next on your agenda?

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
Final touchups for the video.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
You're still editing?

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
Don't freak out.
We're almost finished.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center
But you're already busy
with the music course.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.077 position:50% align:center
You're not burning
yourself out, right?

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.371 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Though I
did kind of fail

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
an important quiz
the other day.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
What?!

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
I'll make up for it!
Seriously, I'm good.

You're sure?

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
I found you!

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.883 position:50% align:center
Please, don't run
in the hallways!

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] You must be Ayumu!
I'm finally meeting you!

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU,YU]
Huh?!

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
Hi. I came here from Hong Kong
as an exchange student

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
just so I could become
a school idol!

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you!

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
An exchange student?

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
So, you went through all that
paperwork, to be on stage?

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.537 position:50% align:center
We've got stuff
in common already!

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU speaking Chinese]

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
I'm Lanzhu Zhong.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
Did you met the new student

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
from America who
enrolled with you?

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] Yeah, but she doesn't
exactly have the same passion

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
for school idols that I do.

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.342 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she's somewhere
around campus.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.176 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
Huh?

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
[CAT meows]

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:58.098 position:50% align:center
Understood. I should probably
head back to my post

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
before somebody looks for me.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU speaking Chinese]

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your help!

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center
Our childhood friendship
is totally paying off.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO] I'll see you
in the east tower later.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
For now, I'll take my leave.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
Buh-bye!

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
Hold on, there are plenty of
other schools that are famous

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
for their school idols,
so how did you end up

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
landing on Nijigasaki High?

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
Because I saw the videos
from the festival, obviously.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.875 position:50% align:center
They grabbed my heart
right outta my chest!

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
[YU, AYUMU laugh]

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
I was moved.

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
Each of you expressed yourselves
and your desires so clearly.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
It made me want to be
on that stage!

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.388 position:50% align:center
And, you know, I'll only be a
high school student for so long.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
I have to do this while
I have the chance.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
And that's why...
I decided to transfer!

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
Wow! I don't know what
to say! It's settled.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.651 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the Nijigasaki
High School Idol Club!

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
Awesome!
We're actually announcing

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
the next festival today.
Don't miss it!

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.867 position:50% align:center
No way! I'll be there for sure!

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
We should mingle and
hand out more fliers.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
That tower needs to be packed.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
It's a shame Setsu won't make it

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
since she's scaling a
mountain of admin work.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
That's true. But where have
Shizuku and Rina been?

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
They still haven't
finished the video.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
I should go see if there's
any way I can help them.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.302 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Absolutely not!

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
If the three of you
get together again,

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center
you'll start changing more
stuff and it'll never be ready!

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe you've got a point.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.728 position:50% align:center
Stay here. I've got this.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
See you at the screens
when it's time to go!

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I suppose we can
stay on flier duty

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
and let Kasumi handle the vid.

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Hi! We're the School Idol Club.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
[AI, KANATA]
Don't miss our promo!

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C]
I recognize you!

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D]
We saw your videos!

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
That's so neat.
Hope you liked em.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
We're going to have another
festival real soon!

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
Make sure you come see us!

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
Cool!

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
Um... You're the
Ayumu Uehara, right?

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
Could I maybe take a picture
with you, pretty please?

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'd be honored!

00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Okay, say cheese!

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
[KANATA, AI]
Cheese!

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Catch ya later!

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
[gasps] We should start heading
toward the east tower soon.

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
You and Ayumu go.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
And take Lanzhu so she doesn't
get lost finding her way.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
We've only got one
stack of fliers left,

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
so we'll walk over as
soon as they're gone.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
Smart. Will do. Shall we?

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
[YU] We want to make the next
festival something that anyone

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.578 position:50% align:center
can participate in,
regardless of what it is

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
they're interested in or
love to do on their own.

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
They can belong to
any club or no club.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
As long as they're passionate.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
They don't even have
to go to this school.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
Our actual goal is to allow
people to express their hearts.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's an interesting
way to look at it.

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
Hey, I've been wondering...

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Huh?

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
Are you a new recruit
to the club?

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:52.605 position:50% align:center
I didn't see you in
any of the videos.

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's because
I'm not a school idol.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
What? I don't get it,
why bother joining the club

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
if you don't want
to sing and dance?

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
[YU] Cause it's through school
idols that I found my dream.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
As a thanks, I want to
do my best to make sure

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
the club shines.
I'm here to help them out.

[gasps]

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.171 position:50% align:center
Being an idol takes
a lot of support.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
I couldn't do any
of this without

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
the other club
members at my side.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
And of course all our fans.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
School idols supported
by fans. Huh.

is the right file.

Yeah, but... It's still
pretty cute if you ask me.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna close my eyes for
a little bit and take a nap.

Oh. It's you! Could we change
to a different timeslot?

any special treatment.

As you know,
the prospective students

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
didn't come here just to see
you. There are other clubs.

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
See I plan to perform at
the School Idol Festival,

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
so I simply refuse to let it
face any more setbacks.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
The whole point was to get
people's attention, right?

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
Mia.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah. I'll handle it.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
Wait, what're you doing?

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
[speaking Chinese]

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:16.184 position:50% align:center
I guarantee you don't
wanna miss this.

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
I'm Lanzhu Zong. And I've
travelled far to sing for you.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
This is your first look at
your school's newest idol.

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
[speaking Chinese]

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:10.507 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS murmur]

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.640 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT G laughs]

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laughing]

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Here's the right one!

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
[YU] Let's build a bridge
beyond the endless sky!

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
Lanzhu, there's no singing

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
outside of the auditorium.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
That's a rule? But the
audience loved me.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO] Irrelevant.
And since you're now a student

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
at this school, I must request
a formal apology.

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
What?!

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
You have a week to
submit it in writing

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
or you'll face
further discipline.

00:18:58.096 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
Listen, thank you
so much for the save!

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Your performance was amazing!

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] Glad you enjoyed. Now
that you've seen me perform,

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
I can be in the festival, right?

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
Well, duh, of course you can!

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
It'll be a highlight!

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the club!
We couldn't be any happier!

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
Oh, I won't be joining.

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:21.244 position:50% align:center
It's unfortunate, but our goals
don't align with each other.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
Huh? What're you saying?

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
There you are.

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.250 position:50% align:center
President.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter?

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
Perhaps.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
I want to be a school idol who
captivates the entire audience

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
more than anybody else.

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
Idols give people
something to dream about.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
That's why we have fans.

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
But I don't need their help.

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:47.187 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I think idols who
need support from other people

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
in order to perform
are pathetic.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
Watch it!

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
I'll still apply
to your festival,

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
but I'll be doing
so as a solo act.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.406 position:50% align:center
This club isn't going to
help me achieve my dream.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
That's apparently something
I'll have to do on my own.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] Yu. Let me ask you
one more time.

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
Why are you in this club?

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
I came all this way
because seeing school idols

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
touched my heart and
I realized performing

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
is what I wanted to do.

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
But your dream isn't
to be up on that stage.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
You should leave
this club right now.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
It's getting in the way of
you pursuing your goals.

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu. You are amazing.

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
The way you express
yourself through words

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
and performances
is truly impressive.

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
But you see... When it comes
to doing what I love,

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
I'm not being held back
in the least. Really.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU laughs]

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
I know I've still got
a long way to go,

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
but I'm certain I'll
achieve my dream.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
And I want to do that
as a member of this club.

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
She speaks for the
rest of us, too.

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
Yup. We're here because we want
to chase our goals together.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.929 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU laughs] Then I'll just
prove you wrong onstage.

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
You'll see you've made a mistake

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
at the second
School Idol Festival.

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
I know without a doubt
I'll be the one

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
who gets all of the
attention that day.

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
Try not to cry.

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
Make sure you don't hold back.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
I do love a good challenge!

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
Good performances
speak for themselves.

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
You'll see. Bye now.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
You done?

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
Ugh! What's that
stupid brat's problem?

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
Thing is, she did put on
an incredible performance.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI grumbles]

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's obvious she put
in an awful lot of training

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:37.213 position:50% align:center
before she transferred
to our school.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:40.467 position:50% align:center
You know what that means?
We'll have to work even harder.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yu.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
Even if our dreams
are different,

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
I'll always be there
in any way you need.

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:47.891 position:50% align:center
Yeah! You just say the word

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
cause I've definitely got
your back. For sure!

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
Safe to say the rest
of us feel the same.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:58.443 position:50% align:center
Thanks everyone!

00:23:31.244 --> 00:23:33.371 position:50% align:center
[JENNIFER]
How'd it go?

00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:35.540 position:50% align:center
Pretty good.
Nijigasaki High has some

00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:37.625 position:50% align:center
interesting school idols
in their ranks.

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:39.502 position:50% align:center
I agree with you on that point.

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:42.380 position:50% align:center
The girl I met the other day
happened to be one of 'em.

00:23:42.464 --> 00:23:44.716 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll run into her again.

00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:50.305 position:50% align:center
[EMMA, KANATA]
Next time, "Overlapping Colors."
