Making-of footage?

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.314 position:50% align:center
You got it! Since it's
a joint event,

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
people want to know what kind
of planning and prep work

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
went into the unprecedented day.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center
That rings a bell.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.781 position:50% align:center
I think the council got
a request about this, too.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
The idols are the symbol of
this school-wide spectacular,

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
so we wanna do a huge
feature on the club!

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
Also, we're hoping to
uncover the true identity

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:44.586 position:50% align:center
of our very own school idol
Setsuna Yuki. Whaddya say?

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA gasps]
That absolutely cannot happen!

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] C'mon, Setsuna.
Gimme a big smile.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.603 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer to stay off camera.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.772 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I don't think
you have that option.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.691 position:50% align:center
The Motion Pictures
Studies Club helped us

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:32.694 position:50% align:center
during our online concert,
so we owe 'em big time.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.362 position:50% align:center
The least we can do is
supply them with some

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:35.697 position:50% align:center
behind-the-scenes footage.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.657 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll cut
anything that makes it

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
super obvious you're
our council president.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:44.748 position:50% align:center
Poor thing. I get your
concern. This is tricky.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.959 position:50% align:center
You haven't even told your
family your secret, have you?

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50% align:center
The fans go absolutely wild
trying to figure out

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.464 position:50% align:center
who Setsuna might
be in real life.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I've heard they
get pretty intense.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
Some think she might be a
famous actress in disguise.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Or possibly even an alien!

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
You'd tell us if you
were an alien, right?

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.477 position:50% align:center
It's more likely
that she's a spy.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
I assure you I'm quite aware
of these ridiculous rumors!

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.900 position:50% align:center
I thought this would be a game
but people have latched on

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center
to the mystery. Now I don't want
to let anyone down by the truth.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
Which is...

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.575 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] There's a big
difference between being

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
a school idol and the
council president.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
I love both my roles and
want to continue with each.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
That means things
need to stay as they are.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs]
Makes sense.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
Well, the joint event is
just around the corner!

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
Now let's do our best
and have no regrets!

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
You know what you're
playing at the recital?

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS gasp]

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] Shouldn't you be
getting school idol footage?

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
Technically, but everybody's
working so hard!

You obviously forgot I'm
a grade higher than you.

Hello?

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:45.785 position:50% align:center
Hi, there. I'm Rina,
a first-year student.

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
Mia Taylor. I'm two
grades above you.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
I know. You've uploaded
a lot of videos lately

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
showing your music.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center

Mm-hm. They're racking up views.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center

need to be nervous.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
I may technically be a teacher
but I'm just a college student.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
I didn't even graduate
from this school.

Huh. Really?

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
[KAORUKO] Mm-hm. But I
wanted to teach somewhere

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
with a strong music program.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
Combining the cultural
fair with an idol festival

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
is such an interesting concept.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
I'm excited to see
how it plays out.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
It's a great idea, huh?

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
Shioriko Mifune is the person
who came up with it.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
Did she? Wonder why
she didn't mention that.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center

the same last name.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:10.078 position:50% align:center

Huh?!

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50% align:center
I hope that doesn't
mess up your friendship.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] If there's
nothing else to discuss,

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
I'd like to adjourn
the meeting early.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
I'm double-booked, so I'm
afraid I have to be going.

have anything to do

the Kokeshi Club.

Looks like they missed a page.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.569 position:50% align:center
I can stop by and see
that they're filled out.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center

head to the club building.

[SETSUNA]
Sorry I'm late.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.578 position:50% align:center
You've got two jobs.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
Your life must be so busy.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
The last few weeks I've
been extremely motivated.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
Setsuna and Nana each
play different roles

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:05.967 position:50% align:center
at this school, and I'm
happy to perform them both.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
My time as president will
end with the second term.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center
After that I doubt I'll ever get
a chance to be a school idol

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
and council president
at the same time again.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
Which means, I've got to make
sure that I go out with a bang--

[gasping]

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO] So that's it. The
president is also Setsuna Yuki.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
No...

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
What would make you say
something so preposterous.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
I am-- Uh... Nana!
Nana Nakagawa!

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.672 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Truth! Just look
at those glasses!

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
She's totally Nana.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
And I'm the real Setsuna!
Setsuna Scarlet Storm!

See? Whew.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center

the world yet again.

So I'm begging you,
please keep my secret!

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
It would mean
the world. Will you?

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.072 position:50% align:center

Mm-hm...

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
Don't be concerned.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center

anyone about this.

Look at what you've done.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
You've enriched this school
as an idol and an officer.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
You're well-suited
for both jobs.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.921 position:50% align:center
That's why our
students are so happy.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for me
to stand in your way

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
or force that to change.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center
Just continue doing your
best, and we're good.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:36.224 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you serious?
Thank you so much!

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
I swear, I won't let you
or the school down.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center

We're over capacity?

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.122 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO] We knew that
the number of school idols

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
interested would be high.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
But this is beyond
our estimations.

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
We got a flood of
performance applications

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.130 position:50% align:center
right before the deadline.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
It would be impossible to let
every entry take the stage.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.926 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Oh, no.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO] Perhaps we could
hold a sort of lottery to see

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
who gets the chance
to perform their songs.

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
But we want everyone to
be able to take part.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
If we keep talking like this,

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
she might figure out
who Setsuna is.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
She kinda already knows.

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
Huh?! What the what?

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing]

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Back to the matter.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
If our school is too small,
we could rent outdoor venues.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.534 position:50% align:center
That worked out
for us last time.

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
You're right! Good idea!

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
We already thought of that
but... Every place declined.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
There's not enough time.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Aw, darn.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Wait a sec!

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
What's this I hear about the
festival not happening now?

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
Everyone at school's already
freaking out about it!

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C] Well, what if
we cut some fair booths

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
and add more stages.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
We can't do that.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
Our classes have all
put in such hard work.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT A]
From what we can tell,

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
the students are split on
whether the school idols

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.360 position:50% align:center
or cultural fair
should take priority.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
I fear there's nothing
else to be done.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.206 position:50% align:center
We'll cancel the joint event.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center
The cultural fair will
go on as it was planned.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
The idols will have to wait.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--President.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
I wish this weren't the case.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
You've done your best
to make this happen.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I agree with you.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, this is
the best decision

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
the council can make.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
Why did I think this
would go smoothly?

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Setsuna!

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
Everyone's trying to find you.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
I-I'm sorry.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
So, how are things looking?

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:06.916 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty positive our
festival will be delayed.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
Now that we know how big
the event is going to be.

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:13.715 position:50% align:center
We don't know when we'll
have the resources to hold it.

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
Later today, I'll personally
apologize to the school idols

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
and fans who were looking
forward to participating.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
And I'll need to tell Lanzhu
that I'm extra sorry.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
I know this is the last thing
she wants to hear, but...

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
...it's the least I can
do as president. [gasps]

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
Why are you smiling?

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
You're smart, so why
do you keep talking

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
like this capacity
issue is your fault?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
I promise, no one is blaming
you for this, Setsuna.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:46.206 position:50% align:center
Sure, but someone has to
take the responsibility.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
It's still possible the
festival will take place!

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] We've got time
to problem solve.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:54.923 position:50% align:center
I've thought a lot
about this, though.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
And I just can't see
any viable answer.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
[YU] Well, yeah. You can't
fix things yourself.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Everyone...

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] You dummy.
Why do you always insist on

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
doing the work all
by yourself, huh?

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I guess, I...

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.319 position:50% align:center
What else could I
do in this case?

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
I'm the student
council president.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
Weird, I thought
there were lotsa people

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
on the council, not just you.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA gasps]

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
I know you pretty well.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
I'll bet you saw this problem
and made the decision yourself.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
You should rely on
the other officers more!

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
And on us, too!

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
You're not alone.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
Think of how many amazing
friends you've got between

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
the student council
and our club.

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
I dunno how one girl
got to be so lucky.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] If you wanna
put on both events...

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
Let's see this through
to the end. Okay?

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
Do you think there's
still a way we can?

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
Let's look at some options--
as a group!

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.836 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Please lend me your wisdom.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to!

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
First things first.

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
We need idols from every school
to sit down in one room.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:29.267 position:50% align:center
They'll help us. Together
we can figure this out.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Sorry to suddenly call you here.

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.443 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Please don't apologize.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
[JENNIFER] This is something
that concerns each of us.

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:46.242 position:50% align:center
Yeah, exactly, I simply refuse
to let this festival die.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
Thanks to everyone who's
joining us virtually as well.

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
With your support,
we should be able

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
to find a solution
to this problem!

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
I give up. It's not gonna work.

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:08.056 position:50% align:center
Wo lèi le! I need to recharge.

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:10.642 position:50% align:center
Our enthusiasm seems
to have vanished.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
Well, it's seems pretty
obvious we won't be able

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.647 position:50% align:center
to hold the event at Nijigasaki.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
I wish we could use our campus,
but it's just not possible.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
And our cultural fair is
also happening next week.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
Besides, Nijigasaki
has the most space

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
out of any of our schools.

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:30.370 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
But even it's not big enough.

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
Did you think of something?

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.749 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] So Y.G. International
Academy is having

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
their cultural fair
the same week we are?

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
[RAKSHATA]
Yes. Though it will be on

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.380 position:50% align:center
a different day than yours.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI]
Same with us.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Shinonome, too.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
Girls. Tell me everything.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.849 position:50% align:center
We've got four schools
and four fairs.

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
This may not end up working,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
but I do believe
it's worth exploring.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.024 position:50% align:center
And there are other schools.
Those not participating.

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
You mean...

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
Yes. We'll have
a joint festival.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
Not just with our cultural fair,

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
but with every other school
that will agree to join us.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What?!

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
[RAKSHATA]
Could we pull that off?

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
We've got less
than a week to plan.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.875 position:50% align:center
Well, we won't know
unless we try.

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
Home turf has its perks.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.838 position:50% align:center
I bet our performances
would be even better. Nice!

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
Yeah! That sounds like
it'd be way more fun!

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
I should be able to run this

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
by our school's
officials immediately!

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:29.429 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.197 position:50% align:center
We got the okay from
Y.G. International, too!

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Hurray!

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Does that mean we're all set?

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
No. We still require
a little more space

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
to accommodate every idol.
We need one more school.

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:58.625 position:50% align:center

Who are you two?

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
Sakuya Kurobane from
Shion Girls' Academy. And...

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
Sakura Kurobane.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.139 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Lanzhu explained the situation.

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
I will obey the voices
within me and request

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
permission to join
this fearsome festival!

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
The voices within you?

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
Please ignore her. It's
just how she always acts.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
But this is good news for you.
You can use our school.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
Count Shion in.

have to thank Lanzhu, too.

Oh. Nana. Isn't your
cultural fair soon?

the preshow. But Mom...

[SETSUNA'S MOTHER] Hm? You look
concerned. What's wrong?

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center

important to tell you.

Hi there, everyone.
I'm Nana. From Nijigasaki.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
Thanks to this event, I've
bonded with all my peers.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
And I've learned
to put more trust

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
in those who support me.

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
A good president
trusts her team.

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
One thing saved this festival,
and that's love.

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
The kind that lifts you up.
It also saved me.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
Now I realize something.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
I have no reason to hide
my passions anymore.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
It's time to be honest.

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
That's why I'd like to
introduce someone...

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
I am the student
council president.

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
But I'm a school idol as well!
Nice to meet you at last.

[gasps]

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
You may know me
as Setsuna Yuki.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
The mystery's solved.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
Did she just... What?!

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
It's showtime!

[KAORUKO]
You're not joining in, Sis?

00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:37.709 position:50% align:center
I thought you always say you
wanted to be a school idol.

00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:40.378 position:50% align:center
Isn't that why you helped
this festival take off?

00:23:40.462 --> 00:23:42.797 position:50% align:center
So you could be one of them?

00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:50.847 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO] Next time,
"The Memory of Dreams."
