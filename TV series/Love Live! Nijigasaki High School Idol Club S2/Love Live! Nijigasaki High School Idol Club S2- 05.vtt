00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Sometimes,
life acts like a dream.

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:19.436 position:50% align:center
You can be anyone you want.
Whoever you imagine.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
And it's better with friends.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50% align:center
You're suggesting
a kinda pre-show?

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center
One that will take place
the day before

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
the combined cultural fair
and School Idol Festival.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
We're thinking it would make
sense for the Drama Club

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
to be in charge of the event.
If you agree, of course.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
Does that mean we'd
have the freedom

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.209 position:50% align:center
to choose what kind of
performance to put on that day?

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course you can.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] We should probably
decide exactly what songs

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
we're going to do
at the festival soon.

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:55.930 position:50% align:center
We'll obviously have
solo performances,

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.432 position:50% align:center
but we could do units, too.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
If anyone is
interested, that is.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
I am! That sounds like fun.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
I'd be game to do it again.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
Don't forget the most
important thing--

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
Karin and I will emcee
with a super-punny script!

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.446 position:50% align:center
There is no way
that's happening.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.656 position:50% align:center
Puns are hereby banned.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.826 position:50% align:center
Aw, I'm simply asking
you to be more karing.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.454 position:50% align:center
Whaddya say,
isn't that hilarious?

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.374 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs]
Karing instead of "caring"

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.209 position:50% align:center
'cause her name is Karin,
oh gosh. So good...

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
Don't take focus away
from the music.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
This isn't a comedy show.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.007 position:50% align:center
I expect the festival
will be very interesting.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.008 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:35.720 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs]

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:40.016 position:50% align:center
I was wondering--are you
free later? For a quick chat?

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:52.737 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] Hey Mia. Oh, it's
that girl from the idol club.

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.114 position:50% align:center
Color me shocked.

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:57.367 position:50% align:center
You don't usually listen
to other people's music.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.161 position:50% align:center
It's nothing. Just research.

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:04.457 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Huh. Not bad.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.085 position:50% align:center
So what's up?
Concert this weekend?

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:09.045 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm taking a break.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.631 position:50% align:center
There's a place I've
been meaning to visit.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.300 position:50% align:center
[YU]
What?

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.720 position:50% align:center
So the drama club will
put on some kind of play,

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.847 position:50% align:center
and we'll be helping them out?

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.141 position:50% align:center
That's right, and
there's more, too.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.476 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking of
forming a new unit.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.396 position:50% align:center
One with Setsuna and Ayumu.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, could you
repeat that for me?

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:05.078 position:50% align:center
[YU yawns]
G'morning. How'd you sleep?

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
Better than you, I think. Try
not to push yourself too hard.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but I'm good.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
Hey, I know.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
Would you be interested in going
shopping for a change of pace?

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I've already got
some plans lined up.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
Let's plan the trip
for another time.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'll hold you to that.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Huh? Yu.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
I wonder where she's going.

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
Back up. Following her
would be totally weird.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Sorry! Were you waiting long?

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Nope! I just got here myself.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Shizuku...

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs]

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
What are they doing together?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen you out of your
school uniform in a while.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
Same goes for you.
That skirt is so cute.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
Looks great on you!

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
Aw, you think?

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
They look like
they're having fun.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.184 position:50% align:center
Uh, Ayumu?

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh, that's me.
Uh. Good to see ya?

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
What a coincidence!

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
You seem kind of
flustered, though.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.654 position:50% align:center
Setsuna! This isn't, um...

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] I'm excited
we get to hang out...

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
So that's why you're
being a stalker?

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
[YU] Same! Plus it's
the most beautiful day.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
Well, the thing is...

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
Yu's been really tired
from lack of sleep,

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
and I'm constantly concerned
that she'll pass out.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
Stranger things've happened.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center
So I have to help!

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
Come on. Let's go!

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
Huh?! What are you doing?

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
Okay. It's a little
embarrassing,

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center
but this is the dramatic
script I've been working on.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
You have Ayumu and
Setsuna in mind

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
for the main characters, right?

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
Yes. I was hoping
we can form a unit.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
Then we can do the
play--and incorporate

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center
the story into our
song performance.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Whoa...

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
Those two girls
are so inspiring.

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
It made writing a piece of cake!

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
Because the beast
looks terrifying,

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50% align:center
they're afraid to tell the
maiden how they truly feel.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, the maiden is
oddly drawn to the monster.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
The tension's palpable as they

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
join hands for
the first dance.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
Even though they cannot
confess to each other,

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
their heartbeats betray
how they truly feel.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
This story...

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
Do you think it's too weird?

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
It's incredible!

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU gasps] I'm so glad!
I knew you'd understand

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
what I'm trying to get
across! You know...

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
I bet Ayumu could play the role
of the beast as well as Setsuna.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I can picture that.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center
I got sidetracked
with casting,

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
so I haven't figured out
an ending yet.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
Well we can take
care of that today.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the place we're
going will inspire you.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center
If you want, we can
plot the story together.

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
That sounds perfect!

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50% align:center
Tell me whatever
comes to mind. Kay?

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Got it.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:27.364 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Hmm. They're looking
awfully chummy over there.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center
I'm going to get to the bottom
of what's going on!

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
It's like we're detectives
on a big case!

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
Don't let them out of sight.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Wow. I had no
idea this was happening!

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
[YU] Yeah. And it's way more
popular than I anticipated.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
Follow me. I'll grab us tickets.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.312 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
What an interesting
special exhibition!

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:09.364 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] It's odd. Why is
it just the two of them?

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A laughing]

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Look out!

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Are you okay?

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50% align:center
Here. Saved this.

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch for helping me!

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.045 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
Oh, this is turning
into a club meeting!

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:33.054 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh. This is a surprise.
I didn't expect to see you.

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
Why are you all
the way out here?

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50% align:center
--[GIRL B] Cosmos Flash!
--Um, well. Funny story.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER A] That's great.
Make sure to be careful, Maria.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
We actually came here to see
the superhero show, right?

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Yes. Totally that.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! What are the odds?

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
Would you like to go with us?
It'll be a real fun time.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
Yes! I'd love to
see what they do!

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
You can do it! Go, Jackal!

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
That was surprisingly touching!

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
Since we're here, we should
check out the rest of the park!

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center

Yeah!

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I-It'll be okay.
We'll get through this together.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
Yes? What's the issue?

[SHIORIKO]
Do you have a moment to talk?

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
Correct. Yes, I see.
Right. That's not a problem.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
My apologies. Thank you
for taking the time to help.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shioriko! I haven't
been here in forever.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
Let's blow this joint
and take a joy ride.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
I told you, I don't have time.
There's far too much to do.

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
You're in drastic
need of a break.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
I forgot to mention,
I'm going to start

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
student teaching at
your school soon.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
Huh?

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
Sorry to keep ya waiting.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
You're sure fast at switching
into presidential mode.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
It's nothing, really.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
Hey. Since they're here,

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
why don't you tell both of
them about your proposal?

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] What? You want a new
unit with you, me, and Setsuna?

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
Yes. I've been brainstorming.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.663 position:50% align:center
That notebook's full
of my ideas for us.

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
I get it.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
So these characters were written
for the two of us to take on.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for letting
my imagination run wild.

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.300 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'm not done
writing yet, so...

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
It's probably hard to envision
the story I have in mind.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
The thing is. I sense
star quality in both of you.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I've felt
that way for a while now.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
Please say yes.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
I want nothing more than to
see you perform together.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
To tell the truth,

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
forming a unit isn't
something that's ever

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
interested me much in the past,
but I like this idea!

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
Same, I think it
would be super fun.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
If I can find
the confidence. Uh?

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
Hold on, is this the big thing
you wanted to talk to Yu about?

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
Yep. Guilty. That's why she
brought me out here today.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center
Ah, nice. That makes sense.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
I had actually assumed you
two were on a date together!

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
Ha! Come on. [laughs]

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What's the time? We
don't want to miss our window.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.936 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good call. I'm pretty sure

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
up to four people can
go in with one ticket.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
It's a school idol exhibit,
so it should be pretty awesome!

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Wow.

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
There are so many
different idol types.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
Samba and big jazz numbers.

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
A rainbow of genres!

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.038 position:50% align:center
They have so much freedom.

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
Boundless self-expression.

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
And because of that, every idol
gets to be one-of-a-kind.

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.046 position:50% align:center
Freedom.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Wow! Check out all this merch!

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
Careful, make sure
you don't buy too much.

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
Don't be like that girl.

It's Lanzhu!

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:59.112 position:50% align:center
Uh... Oh, hey there. You girls
came to pay a visit, too?

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
[YU] That was informative
and kinda overwhelming!

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
After seeing all those
different performances,

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
I'm just buzzing
with creative energy!

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.958 position:50% align:center
Agreed. I found it
to be quite moving.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
We have to bring
the rest of the club.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
They're sure to love it.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU laughs]

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU] I see you haven't
changed. What a shame.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
Looks like you must have
plenty of free time

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
if you're out at the park.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
Are your grades that good?
Tell us.

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
Did Mia mention something?

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
I have managed to improve
my grades recently.

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
But I'm still
barely getting by.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd say that.
It's infuriating.

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
You're not serious about music.

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
Truth is, the smartest
thing for you to do

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
is drop out of the club.

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
Give your dreams
the focus they deserve.

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
Don't assume
what's best for her.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
Exactly, she's free
to do whatever she--

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
What's worse is that
the rest of you spoil her.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
You said you'd make
your dream come true

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
from within the club.
But right now you're bowing

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
to the dreams of those around
you and ignoring your own.

[SHIZUKU gasps]

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center
You can pretend to
be satisfied by that,

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.727 position:50% align:center
but you've created nothing.

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Lanzhu. I think you're
actually trying to be nice.

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:21.528 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:25.281 position:50% align:center
[YU] I am motivated by
what you've said to me.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.325 position:50% align:center
I've still got work
to do, I know.

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:32.622 position:50% align:center
Just watch. I'm going to
work hard and be positive.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:36.418 position:50% align:center
So I appreciate that
you're worried about me.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
But could you gimme a
little more time to shine?

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
Uh! Wha-- Whoever said
I was worried about you?

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
Whatever. [speaking Chinese]

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.767 position:50% align:center
The passion you two
have is amazing.

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
[YU] Hm? Yeah, I guess
that was intense.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. You look sad.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll forgive me.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.611 position:50% align:center
Why, what's the matter?
Are you okay?

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
I think I'm the problem.

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
I trampled over everyone else's
dreams. I formed a unit

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
in my head, but didn't care
what my friends wanted.

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
But wait--Lanzhu
was talking about

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
Yu here and the music program.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:21.546 position:50% align:center
For real. There's no reason
for you to be concerned.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
When I wrote this play,

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
I was feeling so satisfied,
even though I haven't even

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
figured out how
it's going to end.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
Which means... our only option
is to workshop it. Now.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:36.394 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right! Uh?
Wait, what are we doing?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.440 position:50% align:center

a gorgeous gown--

approaches the beast,
who wears a dashing tuxedo.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
You do know I haven't
memorized any lines.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
Neither have I.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.170 position:50% align:center
Let's keep the ball
rolling, though.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:10.887 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Um, uh... Hi. Hello.
Beast. Um. You're looking?

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.806 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Hmph! I'm sure
you're frightened

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
of my grotesque appearance!

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center
All are terrified
by my cursed face.

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
Mm-mm! Not true. I won't
run away, Beast!

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
It's just... I don't understand
why you look like this.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
Now, hear my tale.

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
I was the prince
living in this castle.

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center
But a wicked witch
placed a hex on me,

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:34.244 position:50% align:center
changing me into
this hideous animal.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:35.578 position:50% align:center
That's so sad!

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
Whoa! If only I could
regain my handsome form.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
Um, not really sure
where we go from here.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
Time to break out the adlibbing.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
Adlibbing?

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey. Know what?

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
I think it's totally fine
if you remain a beast.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
Don't worry too much
about appearances.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
Just try to be the
best beast you can be.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
Take one step at a time
and do the right thing.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center

matters is my actions?

all the evildoers who
threaten this world!

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
We're a good match!

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
Because I want to heal
everyone who's hurting!

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
In that case,
let's do our best together.

Mm-hm!

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
This is nuts.

right before our eyes.

We set off on a
perilous journey.

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:35.055 position:50% align:center
Monsters feared us.
Townspeople cheered our names!

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
And yet, there was
something the maiden

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
was still concerned about.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.644 position:50% align:center
Uh? What weighs on your
mind, my dearest love?

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
Uhh... That was when an
army of monsters appeared

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.150 position:50% align:center
before them hungry for revenge!

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, this simply
will not stand!

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
Let us flee for now!

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What do you think'll
happen next huh? Huh?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
Uh, Shizuku?

00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I'm not sure
what we should do next.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.874 position:50% align:center
I'm out of ideas, too.

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
My, it's been a while.

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
And, uh, you are?

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
I am the witch, the very one
who cursed you long ago.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see now.
That's where we're heading.

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
Fiendish woman! I would
never forget your face.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
Know this:

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
I do not regret turning you into
the horrible creature you are.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
Because now, you have a kind
heart that never would have

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
existed inside of
a handsome prince.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
That's quite poetic.

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] This maiden must've
transformed your soul.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
Observe, all of
these evil monsters

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
are actually human beings.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
They became beasts,

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.877 position:50% align:center
because they made the choice
to squander their lives away!

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
Huh? So what should we
do with them, then?

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
Sing of course!

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
It's still my dream to
save those who're hurt.

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
Be they man or beast.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.346 position:50% align:center
A song?

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.808 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course. And you'll
sing with us, Witch.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:04.769 position:50% align:center
What? After all that I've done?

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
If not for your dramatic magic,
just think,

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
none of us would ever
have found each other!

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:13.111 position:50% align:center
She's right. Join us!

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU laughs]

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA laughs]

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Such free spirits.
How can I resist?

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
Earlier, I learned that
freedom is what makes

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
being an idol so precious.
And right now, the both of you

00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:39.179 position:50% align:center
remind me so much of the girls
we saw at the exhibit today.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
You're expressing yourselves.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
Refusing to be trapped
inside any mold.

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
Which makes the things that
you create absolutely unique.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center
[laughs] That's so sweet!

00:19:58.156 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:12.754 position:50% align:center
Heads high, girls,

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
this is just the beginning
of our life on the stage.

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
Jeez. I was on the edge
of my seat the entire time!

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
That was an incredible story!
I can't wait to see what's next.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
We should probably head home.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Yeah, you're right.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.193 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Mm-hm.

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
I had so much fun today.

00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
Hey. How about you and me
go on one last ride.

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasps]

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
This is great. Thank you!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
No worries. I was really
looking forward to this one.

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
You were a great maiden.
You're born to play the part!

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU laughs]

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
It's funny.

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
I was pretty convinced there's
no way I'd work in a unit.

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:13.481 position:50% align:center
But the more I got lost in the
story with Shizuku and Setsuna,

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
the easier and more fun it was.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
Then I thought of my fans
and how much I wanted them

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
to see me up there
performing like that.

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
They'd love it. Just imagine,

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
you could touch their hearts
the same way you touched mine.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.497 position:50% align:center
I'm happy for you.

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:31.207 position:50% align:center
Aw, thanks!

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Hey. If there's ever
anything I can do for you,

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:41.217 position:50% align:center
I want you to tell me.

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:42.677 position:50% align:center
Of course I will.

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:46.556 position:50% align:center
But no. You already
do plenty for me.

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
Now it's my turn,
so let me support you.

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:33.788 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I got a little
too wrapped up in the play.

00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:37.417 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:41.296 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO exhales]

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:49.554 position:50% align:center
