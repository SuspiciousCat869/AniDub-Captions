Whenever I'm with the club,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.643 position:50% align:center
even the most familiar places
feel exciting and new.

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] I want our colors
to mix together,

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
forming a brilliant new shade.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Here's what I suggest.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
We use the last
festival's framework

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
as a starting point
for the new one.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
I'm on board!

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
That sounds perfect!

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
Plus, I've got tons of ideas

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center
for how we can take
it to the next level.

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Me, too.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
The weather might cause
some issues for us again.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.875 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Sad agree.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.545 position:50% align:center
The safest solution would be for
us to move everything indoors.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:49.716 position:50% align:center
To do that, we'd need to rent
out a much larger concert space.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.635 position:50% align:center
Especially since we'll have
more participants this year.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
That's true. And not
a bad problem to face.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea, let's put
this up in the window.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI gasps]

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Haruka and I made her together,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
so she'll definitely
bring us good luck!

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.024 position:50% align:center
Adorable!

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
For real! We should totally
put it on display!

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.155 position:50% align:center
By the way, Shinonome
and Touou both confirmed

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.032 position:50% align:center
that they'll be
joining us again!

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
We should set up a
meeting with them soon.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:16.493 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.372 position:50% align:center
A message from one of my friends

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.291 position:50% align:center
who's an idol at another
school not far from here.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:26.336 position:50% align:center
They want us to do a
joint concert with them!

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.172 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Wait a sec, a joint concert?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
[JENNIFER]
We're from Y.G. Academy.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.809 position:50% align:center
I'm Jennifer, president
of the school idol club.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
And I'm Rakshata, her VP.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.272 position:50% align:center
It's an International Academy?

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
That's correct,
the school has a lot

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
of foreign exchange
students in its halls.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
I met these two in
an online community

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
for international
transfers like me!

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
It was only later
that we discovered

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
we're all school idols.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
You can imagine
how excited we were!

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center
Naturally, we're hoping
to participate

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
in your upcoming festival!

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50% align:center
[AI, KANATA gasp]

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
We'd love to have you!

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear it!

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
Until then, I want our members

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.466 position:50% align:center
to get to know each
other a little better.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
That's what the joint
concert's for?

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
I think I speak for everyone

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
when I say we'd be thrilled to
share the stage with you two.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
Let's do it.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.561 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu's performance yesterday
inspired us to go hard.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.648 position:50% align:center
There's so much talent
at your school! Uh.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu Zhong had a concert?

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.238 position:50% align:center
I wanted to see it live!

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
Exactly what I'd
expect you to say.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU chuckles]

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
It was a total surprise.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.246 position:50% align:center
We only caught the last
part of it ourselves.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
But did the audience like it?

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. No doubt.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
Uh! Agh! I hate this!

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
There's no point in dwelling
on other people's successes.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
We should focus on being
the best that we can be.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.928 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
I know, I know.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
Where is Lanzhu, by the way?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
Could she not make it
to this meeting, or...?

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
The thing is, Lanzhu isn't
actually a member of our club.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
What? That's strange.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
I hope she'll still consider
doing the concert with us.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
She might! I'll go talk to her.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
Sorry, that's a no.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
She didn't even have to think.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
I'm finding plenty of success

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
putting on small
performances of my own.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
I don't want you to tie me down.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
But that's--

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Listen.

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
The next time we face
off against each other

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
in front of an audience,

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
I want it to be at the
School Idol Festival.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.638 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have things to do.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
Agh!

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
Could she be any more annoying?

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
What were you expecting?

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
[EMMA sighs]

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.571 position:50% align:center
Listen, I know you don't
wanna leave her out,

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
but maybe you should
accept her choices.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.287 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] We can't let that
talented brat beat us!

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
Let's start preparing
for the joint concert!

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.209 position:50% align:center
We'll blow her away
for sure, guys!

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
First off,

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
we need to decide the
order we'll be singing.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
Right here. I'll dazzle
fans first, of course!

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
Hey, not so fast.
I wanna go first, too!

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.279 position:50% align:center
I'd do a great job of
kicking things off.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
Opening sounds fun.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center

Always.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center

me out of my spot!

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.747 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
You mean my spot.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50% align:center
Here's a good compromise.
I'll go first. Problem solved.

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] Uh, no.
How is that a compromise?

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
[ALL laugh]

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center

Yup, yup.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Did she say "Taylor"?

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
No way. Like <i>that</i>
Taylor family?

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
[MUSIC TEACHER A] Quiet while
I play the piece for her.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
No need. I was able to
hear it from the hallway.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
You got a spare pencil?

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center

Sure. Use this.

[knocking]

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
Excuse me. I brought
the application for you.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
Do you have a second
to look at it?

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
Come on in.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
We were actually just discussing
dates for the concert,

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
so your timing is great.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.804 position:50% align:center
How is everything looking?

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.806 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Well, it turns
out the cultural festival

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center
will be close to the
dates we had in mind.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
Mifune here is on the
committee for that event.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
We want to make sure that
students can do both.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
They shouldn't have to choose.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
That'd be awful.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO]
Please don't worry.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.779 position:50% align:center
There are quite a few people

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center
who're looking forward to the
school idol performances.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
The last thing I really
wanna do is disappoint.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
I'll find a way to make it work.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:18.623 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to hear that.
Thanks so much.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] By the way, you're
friends with Lanzhu, aren't you?

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
I am. We grew up
near each other.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
Which means we spent lots
of time playing together

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
before she moved to Hong Kong.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:33.054 position:50% align:center
That sounds lovely.
Did you see her recent concert?

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50% align:center
Well, no. She didn't mention it
to me, so I was in the dark.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
I see.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.022 position:50% align:center
We have a concert coming
up soon, you know.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
If you're interested,
I'd love to see you there!

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
[YU] That Mia girl
got a perfect score.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.405 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Wow.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I did some digging online.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
Apparently her family's full
of world-renowned musicians

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
and everybody's watching her

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
because they think she'll
be the next big composer.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.082 position:50% align:center
That is incredible.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
She's a third year now,
but she's only 14 years old

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
because she skipped
over a few grades.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Wow.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
Wait? Fourteen? That's nuts!

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I know, right?

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, speak of the devil.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
Hi, kitty.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.018 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
It's fine. You don't
need to be scared.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:25.482 position:50% align:center
[HANPEN meows]

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
Uh! Wait.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
Hi, friend.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
Are you a cat person?

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
Not really.

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
Hanpen loves to be loved on.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
So that's its name?

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Do you wanna come
and feed them with us?

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Musta been starving!

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:53.134 position:50% align:center
Mia, you wrote the song Lanzhu
sang at the open campus, right?

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
Yes, that was mine.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
It was totally awesome!

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
Thanks.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
You two must be super close
if you not only compose for her

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.477 position:50% align:center
but transferred schools
with her as well.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
Frankly, I just came
to Japan on a whim.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50% align:center
And please don't mistake
Lanzhu and I for friends.

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Uh. What do you mean?

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
[MIA]
She wants to sing my songs

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
and I want my songs to get more
attention via her performances.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
That way people will
finally acknowledge

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
the value of the
pieces I'm writing.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
We're basically using
each other. See ya.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Hm?

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:32.173 position:50% align:center
Hey! What's up?
You look intense.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Hey, you two.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI gasps]

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
It's a fan site for Lanzhu.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
She's already got one?

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
Rumor has it she's doing
another surprise concert today.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:50.316 position:50% align:center
Oh. Is that so?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
[EMMA sighs]

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:53.945 position:50% align:center
Interested?

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
Huh? Of course not,
don't talk crazy.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.700 position:50% align:center
Suit yourself,
but I definitely am.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
Hey, shouldn't you be
at work or something?

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
Today's my day off!

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
I wanna see her sing.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI, KANATA gasp]

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
Don't look shocked,
she's a stellar performer.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.545 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI grunts]

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
Well, too bad!

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:15.091 position:50% align:center
We've no clue when or where
this concert is going to happen.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
Unless you know
something I don't.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Uh. Look, it's her.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.806 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI, KANATA, EMMA]
Huh?

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
Well, let's just ask.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.067 position:50% align:center
--We can?
--Don't see why not.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
--Yup.
--[KASUMI] But--!

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Don't you take another step!

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
We have to be smart
about this, girls.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:47.207 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Um, why are we
acting like spies?

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
It'd be embarrassing to admit

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.795 position:50% align:center
that we wanna see her
put on a show, so...

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
We'll just follow her around
until she's at the secret venue.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.175 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
And she might even expose

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
some of her weaknesses
along the way.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:02.806 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] Seems a little
farfetched to me.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Here we go!

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:05.308 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:17.946 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
She's... having a snack.

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.447 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
It looks yummy!

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] I'm going to buy
Haruka something here.

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Kanata being a good sister

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
hits me right in the feels.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Who the heck taught
you to talk like that?

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Guess she pulled
a great blessing.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
I got a regular one last time.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
I usually pull something solid.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] And I'm always getting
future blessings here.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Exactly how
popular is this spot?

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
[speaking Chinese]

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Agh. She's destroying
the dessert buffet.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.691 position:50% align:center
The sugar might be
for an energy boost.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
That's a lot.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.610 position:50% align:center
If you have a pile of ice cream,

00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
you gotta eat it fast
before it melts!

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
That's not the issue!

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:05.285 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to think you've all
have forgotten why we're here.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
She's shopping.

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
It's not here.

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] <i>This</i> is how she
prepares for a show?

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Uh?

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
Ah-ha! There they are!

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Are those...?

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Yay! They've got our merch here!

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
This is hard proof

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
we're making a
name for ourselves.

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] We've gotta tell
the others later.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Should we maybe buy some?

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE A]
Anything else for you today?

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Whoa. She bought the whole set.

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Ah! I'll autograph mine for you!

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Hey. Calm down.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:47.452 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Let go of me!
I'm being a good idol!

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS whispering]

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
Just a guess, but I
think that's the stage.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.425 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS cheering]

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming!
Hope you're ready.

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:08.098 position:50% align:center
You're gonna fall head
over heels for me.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:20.402 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Bye now!

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU speaks Chinese]

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E]
She was amazing!

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.492 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT F]
Lanzhu's my new fav.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E]
I'm a fan for life.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
She's so good. It's insane.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.667 position:50% align:center
And she's just going to get
more popular moving forward.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
So... you did show up.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.171 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Yes! No!

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
We happened to be walking by
and saw you up there, so...

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't care
about the details.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.262 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for
being in the audience.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50% align:center
Ya know what? You should come
over to my place and hang out.

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
It's gigantic!

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:59.232 position:50% align:center
I could live in this bathtub.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.817 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
The view's to die for!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
Ugh! So heavy.

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Hope you enjoy.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
You live in this
palace by yourself?

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:16.458 position:50% align:center
I do. In fact, you're the first
people I've ever invited over.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
So... my concert,
what did you think?

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess I'd say...

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
It was wonderful.

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
Everybody there looked
like they were going

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
super crazy for your songs.

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they were.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
Now you see what kind
of idol I wanna be.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center
My goal with every concert

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:37.062 position:50% align:center
is for my fans to experience
the ultimate performance.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:41.316 position:50% align:center
They should feel blessed
every time I take the stage.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:43.276 position:50% align:center
Nothing beats seeing
those smiling faces

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
as I sing and dance,
knowing every eye's on me.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
I sorta owe my status to you,
so thanks for that.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
But I'm going to continue
pursuing something

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
your club simply can't offer me.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:16:00.543 position:50% align:center
It's the only certain way
for me to prove myself.

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:03.672 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're
really okay with that?

00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center
Hm? What are you asking?

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
You're positive that you wanna
do this without anybody's help?

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
Yes, without a doubt.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
See, I'm a solo artist.

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
That's the reason
I came to Japan.

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
If I joined you girls,
I'd be tied to your vision

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
and I wouldn't be able to put
on shows the way I want to.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Not true.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Uh?

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
I think you've got the wrong
impression of how we operate.

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
If the club really worked
like you think it does,

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:32.117 position:50% align:center
there's no way I'd keep
being a school idol.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.867 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Hm?

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
She's right.

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
Our members are able to perform
however they want, same as you.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Huh?

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
Don't compare us!

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
Do you hear what you're saying?

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
I get that you wanna think you
and I are equals, but we're not.

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
You have to worry
about each other.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
I wanna reach the top
by proving my own worth.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
If I joined a club
that believes the fans

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
are on par with the members,

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
I don't think I could
perform as well as I do.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Lanzhu.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
You've got it all wrong.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
then prove it,

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
show me what I'm not seeing.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
It won't be that hard
since a school idol

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:17.704 position:50% align:center
should be able to
express herself.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
What in the world was she
going on about back there?

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
And why are we so worried

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
about this new girl
anyway, Emma?

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
Didn't Karin say you should
just let her be earlier?

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.096 position:50% align:center
She's been concerned
since we first met her

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
at the open campus.

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
At first, I was just curious.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
She came to Japan to be
a school idol like me,

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
so I thought we'd have
tons of stuff in common.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
But the more I get to
interact with Lanzhu,

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.527 position:50% align:center
the more it seems like
she's not being honest

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
about her dreams and emotions.

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:52.781 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I have the same
weird feeling about her.

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
Sometimes she makes total sense,

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.788 position:50% align:center
but there's other times when
her point of view is so off,

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
I can't understand it.

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
I agree. Is she
hiding something?

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:06.544 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:07.921 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Don't get me wrong,

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
it's not that I wanna force
her to join the club.

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.425 position:50% align:center
And it's also possible
I have the wrong idea

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.135 position:50% align:center
and am being annoying
by bringing this up

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
over and over again.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
But there's one thing I'm
absolutely certain of...

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
Lanzhu came all the way to Japan

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.399 position:50% align:center
because of the School
Idol Festival we put on.

00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:31.027 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't be in this country
if it weren't for us.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
That's why I can't
just leave her alone.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
I thought if we talked,
she'd understand.

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:43.331 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI grunting]

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.374 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI sighs]

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.918 position:50% align:center
Okay, okay, fine.

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
If we're telling the truth,
I am kinda worried.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine being
an idol all alone.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
Let's get to the bottom
of this and help her out.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.304 position:50% align:center
She might be like,

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
"You're right! Ugh. I'm sorry
and I want to join your club!"

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
And we'll say, "Sure! You're
our new recruit, dummy!"

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:14.029 position:50% align:center
Ya see, absolutely
nothing beats the love

00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
that a school idol club
provides for its members.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
[gapss]

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.207 position:50% align:center
Kasumi, you may act tough,
but you're such a softie.

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you making fun of me?

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
I promise that I'm not.

00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Still,
based on what she's said,

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
it's gonna be hard to get her
to see things our way.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] We'll need to show her
that her whole understanding

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
of school idols is wrong.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.184 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Yup. With a concert.

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
That is what we do best.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:49.814 position:50% align:center
[RINA] I still can't get over
how cool hers was today.

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
You sure about that?

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
Looking back on it now,

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
I think it was lacking
something important.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:20:01.159 position:50% align:center
Her performance was obviously
incredible, that's a fact.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
But it could've been even better

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
if only she had more
appreciation for her fans.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
You mean, you think
that she needs

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
to connect with her fans
on a deeper level?

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Yup.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50% align:center
We're nothing without them.

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:19.803 position:50% align:center
Kind of like how we
perform solo numbers,

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
but then still work together
as a supportive unit.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Mh-hm.

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
The fans are
crucial, too, right?

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
We're usually on our own,

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
but at the last festival we
sang together as a group,

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
and that turned out spectacular.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
I think everyone agrees.

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
It was a lot of fun.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:49.499 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] Yeah, all of our
feelings were shining as one.

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Hey.

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:02.053 position:50% align:center
The joint concert's coming up.

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:05.598 position:50% align:center
That's our chance.
Let's do a group number.

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
If she sees us onstage together,
maybe we'll get through to her.

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Yeah. Great idea!

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
[ALL harmonizing]

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
What are those four up to?

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
A little harmonizing.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.211 position:50% align:center
They're singing together
at the joint concert.

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center
They're quite the group.

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
Karin, you poor, poor thing.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
Are you jealous that they
stole Emma away from you?

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
No. Hmph.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
That's nice. They look like
they're having a fun time.

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:54.356 position:50% align:center
Uh. What's up?

00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:57.233 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Oh, hi. Look at this.

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:40.337 position:50% align:center

They're all so amazing.

00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:44.591 position:50% align:center
