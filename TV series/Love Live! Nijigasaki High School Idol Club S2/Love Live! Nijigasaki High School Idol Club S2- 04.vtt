00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:16.474 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] It's upsetting how
quickly time seems to fly by.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.935 position:50% align:center
[AI] I have so much fun
whenever we're together!

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter what color
the future turns out to be,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.440 position:50% align:center
as long as I'm with you.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
[YU] This one says "The QU4RTZ
concert was awesome.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.488 position:50% align:center
I hope I see 'em at the
School Idol Festival!"

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:31.990 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:35.326 position:50% align:center
It was a fun concert.
Quartets are nice.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I agree, it was much
different than performing alone.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
And the best part is even more
people will know about our club!

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
I hope the rest of
you are preparing!

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
The next school idol
festival will be huge!

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
I just can't wait!

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
Side note.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.803 position:50% align:center
I wanna do a show, but one
that's easy to watch online!

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
You're talking about
streaming a concert.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.184 position:50% align:center
Yup! There are always people who
can't make it to our live sets.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.394 position:50% align:center
If we put the performance
online, though,

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.271 position:50% align:center
everyone can be
part of the party!

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.107 position:50% align:center
That'd be the perfect thing
to have on in the background

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.651 position:50% align:center
when I want something
to fall asleep to.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] You know, I think
that'd be a really great way

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.572 position:50% align:center
to promote the next
festival, too.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.325 position:50% align:center
I can see if the Motion
Pictures Club will help us out.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.826 position:50% align:center
I bet they could
set it up easily.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
Good idea, Rinari!

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.081 position:50% align:center
We'll all help you pull it off.

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:23.124 position:50% align:center
Let's make this a great show.

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You girls're the best!

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.420 position:50% align:center
And while I've got
your attention,

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:30.423 position:50% align:center
I should mention that I
wanna form a unit, too.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.550 position:50% align:center
Oooh, I'd love that!

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.470 position:50% align:center
I'm not totally sure what
it would look like, though.

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:36.846 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Hmm...

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.723 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Something wrong?

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
Would you be interested
in doing a group number?

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:42.977 position:50% align:center
They're real fun.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.480 position:50% align:center
Accommodating another girl's
vision just isn't my thing.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.066 position:50% align:center
I'd much rather
compete with them.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Hm?

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
[KARIN laughs]

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Aw, that's beary cute!

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ai.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
Yup, yup, that's my name.
What're you doing here?

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
Uh, not much. I simply wanted to
stop and see what's in fashion.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Mm-hm...

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50% align:center
What's that sound?
Uh, and who is this?

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you asked! This
darling is my older sister...

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
[AI]
...type of friend.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
Misato Kawamoto. Ai has been my
neighbor since we were little.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
We played together
a ton as kids.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
That's right! This is Karin
Asaka! She's another member

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
of the School Idol Club
I'm always talking about.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
Thanks for always taking
such good care of Ai.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
Would you mind if I
can call you Karin?

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
Of course. That's fine.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I know! Why doesn't
Karin join us, Sis?

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah!

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
[KARIN laughs]

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
You're both so good at this.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center
Come on. I want a rematch.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to beat you again.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
I think maybe I'll
sit this round out.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
Are you feeling sick?

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I'm just
a little tired is all.

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center
Gotcha. Of course, if you do
start to feel off, let me know.

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
We'll get you better ASAP.

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
Recently, I've been
living at the hospital.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.336 position:50% align:center
But they finally said
I could go back home.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
I'm totally fine now,
but it was scary.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
Which is why we're celebrating
her release today.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I didn't realize

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
I was crashing such
an important party.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.556 position:50% align:center
Please, we're the ones who
invited you to join us!

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
The more the merrier!
And we're not done yet!

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
[MISATO, KARIN laugh]

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
Now that's what I call a winner.

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center
Thanks but I won't
go easy on you.

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Perfect.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
Ohmigosh you're totally
Ai Miyashita!

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
Hi there!

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
It's crazy to see
how popular she is.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
No surprise there. See Ai's
an excellent singer and dancer.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
It's what makes her such
a worthy rival for me.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
I see. The two of you
are just... amazing.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Sis! Karin! Get up!

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
The boat is gonna be
here any second now!

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center
[AI] Hold tight.
Pretty soon we'll have

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50% align:center
the giant monja senbei
of your dreams!

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
You're quite skilled. I can tell
your family has a restaurant.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
[laughs] How ya
like them monjas?

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, by the way!

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:30.849 position:50% align:center
Soon, I'm gonna be doing
an online performance!

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
I know it might be hard for you
to come see me sing in person,

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
so you can stream it!

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
I'll definitely watch.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.606 position:50% align:center
And I'm thrilled that
you thought of me.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
[AI laughs]

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
Now I get it, this whole
online show is for Misato.

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
That's part of it, but obviously
I want a ton of people to watch.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.409 position:50% align:center
You know, you might
not believe me,

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
but when I was little,
I was pretty shy.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
And kind of a crybaby.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.540 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you serious?

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
Yeah, cross my heart!

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
But Sis here would
always smile at me

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
and take me
somewhere new to play.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.340 position:50% align:center
She's the only reason I was
able to make any friends.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I would've
been alone without her.

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50% align:center
Plus, turns out I love
being super active!

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
Now it's my turn
to return the favor.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
You're finally better
and out of the hospital!

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
We can go everywhere
together. It'll be so fun!

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
That sounds nice.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
Okay! Eat up, you two!

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:27.322 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT A]
I've got good news to report.

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
The School Idol Festival
will officially be happening

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
alongside the cultural fair.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
That's great.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
You've all been amazing.
Especially Mifune.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.790 position:50% align:center
We couldn't have gotten
this far without you

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
and your presentation.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I could assist you,
and that it worked.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, the student
council has a request.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
If it's not too much trouble.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.051 position:50% align:center
What might that be?

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
In order to make the
big joint event a success,

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
we need the School Idol
Club running one part,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
and the cultural fair committee
running the other part.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
But someone needs to be
in charge of them both.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
A person who can oversee
the whole thing.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:04.526 position:50% align:center
And because of that, we wanted
to see if you'd be interested.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
You want me to be in charge?

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
We all think you're great.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
With your ideas,
we all know you'll make it

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center
an event to remember.
What do you say?

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
This is an opportunity to
enrich the student body.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
It would be my pleasure.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.339 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Hello again.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
Hm? Karin. Hi.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
Are you interested in
learning different languages?

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
Sort of.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
I used to think I wanted to work
overseas as an adult, but...

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.524 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
Thanks for yesterday.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
You and Ai made it
a special occasion.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:50.405 position:50% align:center
There's no need to force a smile
around me. It must be tiring.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:51.573 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
Not to be rude,
but I can see through it.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
Why don't you tell me what's
actually on your mind?

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
You've known Ai ever since
you were just kids, right?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
So I don't understand
why you're hesitant

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
to just tell her how
you're really feeling.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she would
prefer that instead.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:08.882 position:50% align:center
Of course, but at least she's
passionate about something.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
And she's giving it 100%.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
I don't want her to
worry about anything.

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:14.763 position:50% align:center
[KARIN gasps]

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
She'll be fine, though.
You two are incredible.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.976 position:50% align:center
You can sing and dance.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.979 position:50% align:center
Plus, you make
countless people smile.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but Misato...

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
I should go. See ya.

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:38.953 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
What's so important?

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:41.373 position:50% align:center
[AI grunts]
It's just...

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
When we three were
hanging out yesterday,

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
did you maybe get the feeling
that Sis was upset?

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
[AI]
She's hard to read.

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
Even when her treatment
at the hospital

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50% align:center
was extra rough, she was always
smiling, no matter what.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
And I've noticed that since
she's been released,

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
it often seems like
there's something sad

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
behind her eyes.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
I might be wrong, but
I can't shake the idea

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
that she was feeling down.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
I get that. I think
you're right about her.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
I see. Then, I'm gonna
go talk to her.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
Wait. What are you going to say?

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
I don't know. I'll ask
her what's on her mind

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50% align:center
and cheer her up. Maybe
I'll take her somewhere.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
Are you sure that's
what she wants?

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
Think about her needs.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] I think, perhaps you
should leave her alone for now.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
How can you be so cruel?

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
I can't leave her alone if
something's troubling her!

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you
hearing me out, truly.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go to her, though.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
Sorry for dropping in
on you all of a sudden.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
Mm. It's just like old times.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50% align:center
We did come here a
lot back in the day.

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
So I want to talk.

00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:59.409 position:50% align:center
And I need you to be
completely honest with me

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
and not hide anything. Tell me,
what's troubling you so much?

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'm perfectly fine.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.670 position:50% align:center
Please! I want to do everything
I can to make you happy.

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
So don't hold back.
How can I help you?

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
I can't think of anything.

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Sis...

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,
but I'm being honest.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
There's nothing that's coming
to mind. Because...

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:32.275 position:50% align:center
Because I just feel...

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Wait. Is this my fault?

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
No way! I'm the one to blame.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
It was while I was
in the hospital.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
I obviously couldn't
go to school,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
so my friends started
drifting away.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.968 position:50% align:center
Except you.
You were always there.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
It made me happy. Truly.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
You kept me going. But...

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sis! You won't believe it.
I became a school idol!

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
[MISATO]
You found your passion.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:15.026 position:50% align:center
I watched as you
moved forward in life

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
and grew into this
talented person.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
Which made me realize that...

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
...I feel like I'm stuck.
I have nothing left.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
I can't tell what's fun
anymore. It's sad to admit.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
You're doing your
best as a school idol

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
and here I am bringing you down.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
How selfish is that?

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
And yesterday?

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
It was a blast getting to
spend time with the two of you!

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
You're finally starting to feel
better so we can hang out

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
whenever we want.
You had fun, didn't you, Sis?

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] I'll continue to
cheer you on, Ai. Always.

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] We should make a
poster to show everybody

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
how great the festival will be.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
Maybe we could do a cool
countdown to the event

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.886 position:50% align:center
across each of our
social media accounts.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Look over here!

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] What, are you the film
crew now? How's it look though?

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.560 position:50% align:center
This camera we borrowed
from the Motion Pictures Club

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
is super high quality! Wow!

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
Neat.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Uh, by the way, does
anyone know where Karin is at?

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] She said she wanted
to go watch Ai practice today.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.116 position:50% align:center
I see. So that's how it went.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
Ah, jeez. I'm so dumb.

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
I had no idea she was feeling
stuck and hopeless like that.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
I just thought I could
do something simple

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
to make her smile again.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
But turns out I was
the one hurting her.

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:02.425 position:50% align:center
What do you suppose I
should've done differently?

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
Should I have left her alone?

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
Like you said in
the first place?

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
Or maybe I shouldn't have become
a school idol to begin with.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center
There's no point in dwelling
on what's in the past.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
I realize how much of
a shock this is to you,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
but your online concert
is coming up soon.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
You have to focus, okay?

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
Your fans are
expecting greatness.

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.451 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I can't do it!

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
How could I when I ended
up hurting the person

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
who taught me how to have fun.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center
I don't even deserve to be
called a school idol anymore.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
You're seriously going to quit?

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.632 position:50% align:center
Well all right then.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:44.634 position:50% align:center
I'll just take over
the streaming concert

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:45.927 position:50% align:center
and perform in your place.

00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
[AI gasps]

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] It's the perfect
opportunity for me

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
to take your fans.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I'll be able to win
Misato over, as well.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
She'll fall in love with me.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
[grunts] No, absolutely not!

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:02.944 position:50% align:center
I won't let you steal my fans.
Especially not my sister.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
Too bad. If you're resigning,
you don't have a choice.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:11.202 position:50% align:center
Then I won't quit, okay?
Because deep down in my soul,

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:16.249 position:50% align:center
I wanna be a school idol!
For as long as I possibly can!

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
Now, that's more like it.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center
We're bound to end up
hurting people.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center
That's just life.
Accidents will happen.

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:25.759 position:50% align:center
But when things get tough,

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
remember that you'll
always have your smile.

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
The one that shines
as brightly as the sun.

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
Make sure to do your best, okay?

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:41.524 position:50% align:center
[AI] Hold on! I know I'll smile
if you share the stage with me.

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center
I told you before, I'm not
interested in doing that.

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
Think again. I'm not asking you
to give anything up.

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:51.576 position:50% align:center
As a fellow school idol
and a worthy rival,

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
doing a number together is the
ultimate form of competition.

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
I know it would be an
amazing performance

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
since you're the one who
reignited the fire inside of me.

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
So please!

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
A competition...

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:08.385 position:50% align:center
Well, if I think about it
that way, it could be fun.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare hold back.
Let's go.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.559 position:50% align:center
Yeah! You won't beat me.

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] Ai... Forgive me
for everything I said.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] It just felt like you,
no, the whole world,

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
had moved on without me.
I feel so pathetic.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
I came here hoping I'd
be able to apologize.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
But I can't. I'm the worst.

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
The crowd keeps growing.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
Whoa, the number of
viewers tuning in online

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
is blowing up, too!

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
[exhales] Huh... Rinari?

00:16:56.808 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
Don't be nervous. You've got
this concert in the bag.

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
That's so sweet.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
I should go!

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center

Nice to see you, everybody!

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
Get ready. We are DiverDiva!

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
To all you school idol lovers,

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
and those of you
watching online--

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
I know you'll fall for us!

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
Let's hear it! Who's ready
to have a good time?

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center

Sounds like some of you
need more encouragement.

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
That's perfectly fine.

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
My heart's full of joy.

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
I've been storing it up
since I was a little girl

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
when I first learned
to have fun myself.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
Now I'm happy to share
those good vibes with you!

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
No matter where you are in life,

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
you can always
find happiness again.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
My biggest hope is
you'll feel that truth!

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
So whether you're in this room

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
or watching our stream
somewhere else,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
you'll have a giant smile
on your face by the end.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
There's no way you won't.

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
[AI] Aww, yay! I never imagined
you'd make it to the venue!

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
Of course. I couldn't
resist coming down.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center
I was so excited watching you
that it was hard to breathe.

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
My heart overflowed
with happiness.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
I had the best time.

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
I wanna ask if it's still okay
for me to be your fan.

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
You fired me up.
Making me wanna do my best.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
I haven't felt that
in a long time.

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
Aw, that's amazing for you, Ai!

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
The performance was lovely.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.654 position:50% align:center
Thank you. All of you!

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
It sounds like we'll just
have to keep competing.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Yep! It's inspiring.

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
And not only for us two.

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Thanks, Sis!

Misato.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, hello.

00:20:57.716 --> 00:21:00.260 position:50% align:center
Not surprised to find you
with that book again.

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:04.180 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm gonna have to
start studying much harder.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
You should know now
it's never too late.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
That goes for most things.

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
[MISATO] This may sound
strange but my current goal

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.399 position:50% align:center
is to be more like you, Karin.

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
Hanging out with you girls,
it made me want

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
to have a friendly rivalry
with someone, too.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
You up to the challenge?

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Uh! Better bring your A-Game.

[CROWD cheering]

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:17.063 position:50% align:center
[SHIORIKO] Everyone seemed
to enjoy the show.

00:23:17.147 --> 00:23:18.356 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Of course they did.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.483 position:50% align:center
I was the one performing,
after all.

00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:22.485 position:50% align:center
Whenever I see you
in your element,

00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:24.529 position:50% align:center
it makes me believe there
are those who're meant

00:23:24.612 --> 00:23:27.490 position:50% align:center
to be in the spotlight and
the stage suits them best.

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:28.450 position:50% align:center
[LANZHU]
Hm?

00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:29.993 position:50% align:center
[KAORUKO]
Shioriko!

00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:36.291 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm home.
It's been a while.

00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:38.126 position:50% align:center

00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Hm...
