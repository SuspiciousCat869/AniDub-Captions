00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're able to thrill
not just the audience,

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center line:84%
but the rest of us as well.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center line:84%
[UZUKI]
The show starts in two minutes.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center line:84%
Already?!

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
Let's hurry!

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
Jeez...

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU] It's not like I can stand
on stage and perform radiantly

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
like Ayumu and the others do.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center line:84%
When I became a club member,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center line:84%
my main focus was to help
other people discover

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center line:84%
that they love school
idols as much as me.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nothing more.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center line:84%
But this note...

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center line:84%
...hit me hard.

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm so touched.
I couldn't be happier.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks so much!

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center line:84%
[VICE PRESIDENT A] Okay,
intermission is over.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center line:84%
Last song!

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Right!

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:30.203 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CROWD cheering]

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.045 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?!

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
I love you! Truly!

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CROWD]
Huh?

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:47.679 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU gasps]

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that Takasaki?
She's in the club, too.

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:01.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're good.

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center line:84%
[VICE PRESIDENT A] Takasaki,
we're turning on your mic.

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center line:84%
Um. Hi.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center line:84%
First of all,
thanks for coming to

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center line:84%
the School Idol Club's
first solo concert.

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm honestly so happy that it
feels like this isn't even real.

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ever since I became a member,
I've had the greatest time.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wasn't sure that I
deserved so much joy.

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center line:84%
And guess what?

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't think I'm
the only person here

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.812 position:50% align:center line:84%
at this Live who feels that way.

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's the same for you!

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure all of you have
a dream you're chasing.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want you to know
it doesn't matter

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.406 position:50% align:center line:84%
if you have a slow start
or need lots of work.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center line:84%
And there will be times
when things don't go

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:54.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
as well as they could.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
But don't worry.
We'll be here for you!

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.919 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whenever you need to smile,
you can call on us!

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Take my hand.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.216 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU laughs]

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Nijigasaki School
Idol Club supports you,

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
and that is never
going to change.

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Thank you so much, everyone!

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI, KANATA laughing]

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP laughing]

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're the best.
And now, one final song.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
Mia. You're not supposed to be

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center line:84%
writing songs in the
student council office.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
You need to learn how to
lighten up, fearless leader.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center line:84%
[sighs]

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center line:84%
[VICE PRESIDENT A]
President.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your thoughts?

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
Somebody is seriously
proposing a Kite Club?

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center line:84%
And you're considering it?

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yes, of course.

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center line:84%
It'll bring joy.
That's what clubs are for.

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:46.037 position:50% align:center line:84%
Did you catch the first ep?

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center line:84%
<i>The Scarlet Sword Princess</i>
kicked butt!

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA]
Mm. It was really good.

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center line:84%
Rina Board is, super-hyped.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't wait to watch again.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.965 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
And I can't wait to start

00:20:57.048 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center line:84%
using your lap as a
pillow more often.

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
Heh. Glad you're comfy.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't worry, Rina.
You're up next.

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIZUKU] Wait, so you're
interested in acting?

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
Modeling is great,
but I figure I should have

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center line:84%
a couple of side gigs,
just in case.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIZUKU]
Oh, I know!

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why don't you try
out the drama club?

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center line:84%
We have a new show that
you would be perfect in!

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're the best student
at this entire school.

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:24.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
Will you be my fur-ever friend?

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:25.452 position:50% align:center line:84%
[meows]

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:28.038 position:50% align:center line:84%
[laughs] Adorable!

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50% align:center line:84%
A tragedy has taken
place! See this chair?

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.419 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wanted it for the president's
throne in the club room,

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
but Shioko said I
couldn't have it!

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
There, there.

00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
Pretty sure Setsuna
would've said no

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.092 position:50% align:center line:84%
to that request, too.

00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center line:84%
But just keep dreaming big.

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ugh...

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center line:84%
[phone chimes]

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Ooh!

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.770 position:50% align:center line:84%
It looks like Ayumu made
it there safe and sound!

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMMA, LANZHU laugh]

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GIRL A] One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
One, two, three, four,
that's it, almost done.

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Um. Hello.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GIRL A gasping]
Oh, my gosh!

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:04.616 position:50% align:center line:84%
Um... It's nice to meet you.

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:06.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GIRL B]
She's really here!

00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
Our thrill just keeps growing.

00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:36.272 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
Next... It's your turn!
