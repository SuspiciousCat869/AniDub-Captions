[SETSUNA]
Let's hear it again!

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.931 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Welcome to the Nijigasaki

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.975 position:50% align:center line:84%
High School Idol Club!

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wasn't expecting you
to throw us a whole party.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center line:84%
It honestly makes
me feel kinda weird.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hold on. Are you nervous?

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:28.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh! No. I'm just new
to this group stuff.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO] Thank you for
the warm reception.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:31.948 position:50% align:center line:84%
We still have much to learn,

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
but we look forward to
working alongside you.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why are you talking like you're
giving some formal speech?

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.165 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aw, Mia-chi, you must feel
like you've always been

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center line:84%
in the club if you're
so comfortable.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIA]
I told you not to call me that!

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our future looks
livelier than ever.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.214 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we recruit any more
idols the club room's

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
gonna start to
feel kinda cramped.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
I'd like to submit my official

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.887 position:50% align:center line:84%
membership application,
President.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sorry, but I'm not
the idol club president.

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
Oh, I beg your pardon.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yu. You'll find everything
is in order.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nope. I'm not the one
running things, either.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Ahem!

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.650 position:50% align:center line:84%
The president of this
school idol club is not only

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.862 position:50% align:center line:84%
the most popular and most
talented person in the room.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:14.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's also the cutest by far!

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
What? I'm in charge?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, of course not.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, who? I'd say you're all

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.164 position:50% align:center line:84%
rather popular,
talented, and cute.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.917 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kasukasu's the performer
staging this show.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.794 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Do not call me that!

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
New decree!
As president of this club,

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm banning
unapproved nicknames.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:33.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
You sound like a puppy.
So yappy.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.928 position:50% align:center line:84%
A puppy?

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.514 position:50% align:center line:84%
You take that back
right now, ya newbie!

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.015 position:50% align:center line:84%
[growls]

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.558 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, now, Kasumi.

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.103 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI] This club desperately
needs to learn some respect!

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.689 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait, a sec.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:49.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey. Your place is giant, right
Shizuko? Let's sleep over!

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh? Yes. Of course.
That sounds nice.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
Girls. Listen up!

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
Since we've got some time off,

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:59.244 position:50% align:center line:84%
we'll have a slumber party
so we get even closer.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:01.579 position:50% align:center line:84%
Strong bonds make
for strong idols.

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:02.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
A sleepover?

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.417 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, yes. My kinda party.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center line:84%
During the day we could
explore the town together.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
How exciting.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI] He, he, he.
This slumber party will be

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:16.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
the perfect way for me to
remind everybody that no one

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center line:84%
would be a better
president than me.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI] "Kasumin's Plan to
Prove She's the President."

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center line:84%
My grand scheme
to garner respect

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center line:84%
and adoration from
the girls and become

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
the one true leader
starts right now.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is amazing!

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center line:84%
Kasumi planned out
every detail of the day!

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
This must've taken forever.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, a good leader
is prepared.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let's see here.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
First off is a shopping trip to
get us energized and talking.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Or so you think.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm actually going to play
the knowledgeable guide

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
and show off my
leadership skills

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:27.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
as we stroll from
store to store!

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU speaking Chinese]
What a lovely place.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center line:84%
Less talk n' more browsing!

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're supposed to go
as a group! Hey, wait!

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh. I see a shop
you would like!

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI whining]
We shouldn't be separated!

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is for me?

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center line:84%
Keep it close to you.
Wear it all day.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center line:84%
What a cute little kitty cat.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN laughs]
It's lovely. Thank you.

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center line:84%
Dangit! I was supposed
to take the lead

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
and show everybody how good I am

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center line:84%
at being in charge
of the afternoon!

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.588 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Look at this hat.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
Adorable, right?
What do you think?

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] It would look
great on me!

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH laughing]

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AI]
I could rock that.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[MIA] This is pretty.
--[YU] Can't resist.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[LANZHU] Maybe a small bag.
--[SHIZUKU] How can I choose?

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[RINA] I want this.
--[KANATA] Precious.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN laughs]

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIA]
Karin.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.607 position:50% align:center line:84%
Where are we supposed
to regroup again?

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
Uh?

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SETSUNA laughs]

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center line:84%
Looks yummy!

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.280 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SETSUNA, EMMA]
Ah!

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[EMMA] Buono!
--[SETSUNA] Delicious!

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Strange.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center line:84%
Has anyone seen
Mia and Karin lately?

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA] Oh, yeah, I saw them
walking together earlier.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center line:84%
We were supposed to
meet up right now.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wonder where they ran off to.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Have no fear!

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm on it! Leave this case
to President Kasumin!

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have a pretty good idea where
our missing members ran off to.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI] I'm positive the two
of them are still together.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center line:84%
Karin has absolutely
no sense of direction,

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center line:84%
so there's an extremely
high chance

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
she doesn't know
where she's going.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
Which would mean they're heading
to a place Miako wants to go.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're chowing
down on burgers.

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or they're possibly
in Chinatown.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMMA]
We've got this covered.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center line:84%
Emma knew that this
would happen.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center line:84%
She asked me to come up
with a way to track Karin.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
What?

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:17.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
On second thought,

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not sure this is where
we're supposed to be.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow! A baseball stadium!

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
You brought me
to the best place!

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
Uh?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ya hear that? The staccato
crack of ball meeting bat.

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center line:84%
The crowd is cheering as
they watch the players

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center line:84%
round the bases,
dashing towards home plate!

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN] Mm... No, I don't
think there's a game.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's the love of the
sport echoing through

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
the stadium walls.
Can't you feel it?

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
I didn't peg you for a fan.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center line:84%
And I didn't peg you for
someone who gets lost easily.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.163 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMMA]
There you are!

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN] Mm? Emma.
I'm surprised you found us.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA]
Leave it to me.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU] Next, it says we're
supposed to improve comradery

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
through group sports.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.802 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Or so you believe.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:10.430 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is where my
captainliness will shine.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center line:84%
[whistle blows]

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay! Let's get
this game started!

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SETSUNA]
Aren't you exuberant?

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Take that!

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] There!

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SETSUNA grunting]

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIZUKU] I am the ace
of the volleyball team!

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay, I'm actually terrible,
but as long as I fully inhabit

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center line:84%
the role, I can return
any pass! Probably!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ack!

Thanks for the setup.
Here I go!

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mine! [yelps]

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AI]
Way to use your head!

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm gonna show these
girls real skills.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
Gotta wait your turn.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center line:84%
The time will pass faster
if you take a snooze.

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wha-- Kanata?

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.348 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're comfy.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
Next topic is veggies.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:01.690 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's easy. This beet
takes me back to my roots.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:05.235 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
Beet! Like, you eat!

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Okay. Now fish.

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center line:84%
Darn. I haven't found
the right time yet.

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
How 'bout, cooking?

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, did you want to
bring something up?

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:16.830 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, it's nothing. Really.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.249 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU giggles]
Stop. I can't breathe.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center line:84%
This isn't over yet.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center line:84%
My plan to prove I'm the best
prez has only just begun.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIZUKU] We'll have to
take a bus from here.

[GROU gasps]
Your house is huge!

[SHIORIKO grunts]

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's the matter, Shioriko?

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center line:84%
The thing is...

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.565 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is going to be my
very first slumber party.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center line:84%
So I'm a little nervous.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm in the same boat.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center line:84%
O-ho, then I hope the two of you
followed proper protocol.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center line:84%
Like, you brought
your own pillows, right?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center line:84%
It'll be weird if you didn't.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our pillows?

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid I wasn't
aware of that rule.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's messing with you.

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Heh!

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
I always have one.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIZUKU]
Come on inside! Welcome!

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center line:84%
[barks]

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIZUKU] Ophelia! Did you come
outside just to greet us?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.014 position:50% align:center line:84%
[barks]

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIZUKU'S MOTHER]
This is such a pleasure.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center line:84%
Make yourselves
at home my dears.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're awfully grateful.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center line:84%

This one's for you.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center line:84%

[YU laughs]

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.378 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, time for the main event

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center line:84%
of every slumber party.
Hope you're ready!

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU] Oh fun, we're playing
a bunch of games next?

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI] I'm going to casually
dominate one round

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center line:84%
after the other, so the girls
know who's in charge.

Are you all right?

cheated, you cheaters!

[MIA]
Um. Does your dog bite?

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's no need to worry,
Ophelia is very well trained.

[AYUMU] Huh? What are
you doing out here?

00:10:54.112 --> 00:11:00.577 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU] Huh? Oh. I was just trying
to map out a new song.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center line:84%
This slumber party
is already really fun.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yup. Kasumi pulled out
all the stops.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH laugh]

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whenever I'm with you girls,

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's like my brain lights up
with brand new ideas.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's great!

Yeah.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
No more Miss Nice Prez.

Tomorrow morning, I'm
turning this party around!

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Today we're touring Kamakura.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center line:84%
And we'll be doing it all in
true orienteering fashion!

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.707 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Orienteering?

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's right.
Rinako has the deets.

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're playing a game.
You walk around Kamakura

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
and try to catch
13 virtual kitties

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center line:84%
prowling around randomly
assigned map locations.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center line:84%
The kittens will
pop up on your screen

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
and meow when you get close.

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
It doesn't matter
who catches the cat

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center line:84%
because they'll keep respawning.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center line:84%
No need to fight over them.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whoever collects the most
in the allotted time wins.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whoa, you programmed this?
That's awesome!

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:18.780 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA chuckles]

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our club consists of rivals
who are also the best

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center line:84%
of friends. A game
like this is perfect.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
A quick cat fight will
bring us even closer together!

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Ha. So trusting.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.919 position:50% align:center line:84%
My secret training
guarantees that I'll win.

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50% align:center line:84%
"Wow, Prez, you're so smart
and amazing," they'll say.

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've thought of everything.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sounds cool. What prize do
we get if we win the game?

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? Actually, I hadn't
considered the idea of a reward.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then how about
the winner makes a request.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center line:84%
And we make sure they get
whatever their heart desires.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center line:84%
I like that.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
My ask is just a simple one.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center line:84%
A 12-hour anime theme
song karaoke contest.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center line:84%

Hm?

Would it be okay for me to ask

good enough. I'd love to.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.045 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you mean it?

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yep! If I win,
I'm going to ask you girls

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center line:84%
to do something, also.

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center line:84%
Obviously.

[SHIORIKO] Lanzhu,
you seem a bit unhappy.

No. I wouldn't say that.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aw! I'm sitting here
with zero kitty cats.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:55.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, maybe everyone else
is having trouble, also.

No way!

Most people have some already!

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center line:84%
And after I did so much training
by memorizing my neighborhood!

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:05.864 position:50% align:center line:84%
What am I gonna do?

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center line:84%
If my plan to seem
like a leader fails,

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
I won't be able to keep
being their beloved president.

Uh, Kasumi.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh?

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.126 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is there something the matter?

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was just looking
at our sad standings.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
Neither of you have
caught any cats, either.

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait, I know!

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why don't the three of us
try to find them together?

[SHIORIKO, LANZHU]
Mm?

[KASUMI laughs]

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center line:84%
Another dead zone.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's no use.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not a one.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center line:84%
Useless! We have been searching
forever! It's not fair!

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
Will you please remain calm?

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center line:84%
A tantrum? You must
really want first place.

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, yeah. Because
everyone will think

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center line:84%
the winner is
just amazing, right?

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I'm first, the club will
not only acknowledge me

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center line:84%
as the president, they'll think
I'm worthy of the job.

[gasps]

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.881 position:50% align:center line:84%
That was just a dumb joke, yeah.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm really excited
for the prize, though.

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everybody in the group
will have to tell me

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.887 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm cute one million times.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ah! I have a feeling there's a
kitty over there! Gotta run bye!

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center line:84%
That girl is too adorable.

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO laughs]
Agreed. And she's honest.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or at least she's well
aware of what she wants.

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's valuable.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good point. Frankly,
I'm a little jealous.

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
Lanzhu, you should be more
up front about your desires.

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh?

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't deflect. What's been
bothering you today?

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
I told you. I'm good.

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
No, you're not.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:52.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
And if you talk to me,
maybe I can help out.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU]
A picture.

Huh?

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center line:84%

I want to take a picture.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center line:84%

is posing together!

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU] Why are you laughing
at me? I'm telling the truth!

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
I just... I didn't think
that would be an issue.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, well...
I'm not sure how or when

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center line:84%
to ask the girls to
smile for the camera.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center line:84%
I know!

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.256 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU]
Huh...

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why not start with
a pic of the two of us?

Now the results.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center line:84%
The winner and the only person

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:53.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
who caught every
kitten... is Yu!

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center line:84%
I did it!

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow, congratulations.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center line:84%
You did a great job.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center line:84%
Too bad. I was right
behind her in second.

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
The shame. I only caught one.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center line:84%
There, there.

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
What a bust.

Disappointed? Poor thing.

Yes, but I still had
a really good time.

Yeah, same here.

going to ask for Yuyu?

Well, I've been secretly working

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.896 position:50% align:center line:84%

So, I guess...

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was hoping maybe you'd
come up with some lyrics.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that too much?

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center line:84%
No way, of course
we'd love to pitch in!

You're an amazing leader.

such lively energy.
