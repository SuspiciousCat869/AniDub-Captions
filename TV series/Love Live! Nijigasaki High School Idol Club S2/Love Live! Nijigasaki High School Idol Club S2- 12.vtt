00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.807 position:50% align:center line:84%
December is already upon
us, but it'd be best

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
to hold the first live
before the year is over.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:19.811 position:50% align:center line:84%
Like on Christmas?

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:22.981 position:50% align:center line:84%
The Tokyo prelims for Love Live
are going to be that day.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want to cheer on Haruka,
so that's a "no."

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.445 position:50% align:center line:84%
She's right! We need to
boost up all the idols

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
who came to our joint festival.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
That livestream can't be missed.

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU] Shion'll be there,
but no in-person audiences.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center line:84%
By the way, you seemed
to know the idols

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.624 position:50% align:center line:84%
from Shion Girls' Academy.
Have you met them before?

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah. When I first got here,

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was doing those
pop-up performances.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
They happened to catch
one of my outdoor shows.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center line:84%
Apparently, they were
charmed by my many talents.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center line:84%
I guess that makes sense.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we're trying to avoid
any work on Christmas Day...

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then it'll just have to
be on New Year's Eve!

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
It would be the perfect party!

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.773 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Huh?!

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's a great idea.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everyone wants to celebrate
the start of a new year.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are we doin' this, girls?

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
For sure!

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.658 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd say that's unanimous.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:16.868 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then it's a date.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now to think up an
adorable concert theme.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.207 position:50% align:center line:84%
What do you mean by that?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.042 position:50% align:center line:84%
A theme will help us
guide the show.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center line:84%
And tell people what to expect.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.962 position:50% align:center line:84%
How about this. We call it:

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:30.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
"Come spend the cutest
New Year's Eve with Kasumin."

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.134 position:50% align:center line:84%
Perfect, don't you girls think?

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.053 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a choice all right.

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:37.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
See, Mia likes the idea!

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.432 position:50% align:center line:84%
That is absolutely
not what I said.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:40.850 position:50% align:center line:84%
What?!

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP laughing]

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.732 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
No, no, no. It's Kasumin!

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.234 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
Hm?

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:50.652 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU laughs]

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:52.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI] It's Kasumin! Come on!
You're killing me, Ai!

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:53.947 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA sighs]

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.157 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
[IROHA] The School Idol Club
is putting on a concert?

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's going to be so fun!

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hope you'll let us
help you out.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nijigasaki's first
ever solo show!

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center line:84%
School spirit will
be through the roof!

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center line:84%
Make us proud.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sure. We'll do
everything we can.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.019 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hope we'll see you
girls in the audience.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ASAGI]
Yes! Of course!

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KYOKO]
Oh, yeah! I decorated cookies

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.817 position:50% align:center line:84%
for everyone in my Baking Club!

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.319 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow, I bet they're delicious!

00:03:57.278 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP gasping]

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center line:84%
[IROHA] And treats for the
newest recruits as well. Enjoy!

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
Aw!

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center line:84%
You baked cookies of us?

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:12.002 position:50% align:center line:84%
You might be rookies,
but we'll cheer you on, too!

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really?

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.422 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're all too nice.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please. Enjoy the sweets.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
Uh? Thank you very much.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GIRLS laughing]

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center line:84%
We've got to start
planning our set dÃ©cor.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good lighting and monitors
make a huge difference.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center line:84%
They'll help us showcase
the best of everyone.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're always so on top
of those details, Shizuku.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center line:84%
Can you handle them?

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just consider it done.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU laughs]

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AI]
What's the matter?

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nothing. Let's go!

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
Eh?

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HARUKA] How's the prep for your
club's solo concert going, Sis?

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
So far it's smooth sailing.
And you, Haruka?

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:06.765 position:50% align:center line:84%
Me and the rest of the members
are training constantly.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't believe
you're going to be

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
the shining star at
the Love Live prelims.

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.729 position:50% align:center line:84%
My sister is amazing.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center line:84%
That livestream can't
come soon enough.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can't fail. 'Cause my
club is counting on me.

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center line:84%
They have so much faith
that they made me

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.409 position:50% align:center line:84%
the center of our performance.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center line:84%
So I won't let them
or our fans down.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center line:84%
We can't be anything less
than perfect that day.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just don't go too hard.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, here we are.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why did you want us
to meet you here?

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
And why did we have
to be in training gear?

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's our lunch break, you know.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because we're going
to practice, obviously.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIA, SHIORIKO]
Huh?

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO]
Wait. Just the three of us?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU]
You got it!

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our club's incorporating
more group numbers.

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whenever we perform as units,

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
our feelings are
even more amplified.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SHIORIKO, MIA]
Oh.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
The problem is,
I've always sung solo.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center line:84%
Groups aren't my forte.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center line:84%
But now that I'm a
part of the idol club,

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm going to try to adapt.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:18.628 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shioriko. Mia. I want
you to help me.

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sounds like a plan.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
I agree. We've much to learn.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks, you two.
You're the best.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU] "Hello. I am
a 16-year-old student

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
attending a public
school in London.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center line:84%
I watched a recording
of 'School Idol Festival'

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:45.321 position:50% align:center line:84%
and fell in love with Ayumu.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
My friend told me that she
wants to be a school idol.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center line:84%
I would really love to
help her dreams come true.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center line:84%
But in London, we don't have
school idol culture yet.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I don't want to
give up my dreams!

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want to join the School
Idol Festival one day,

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center line:84%
and to see Ayumu.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.221 position:50% align:center line:84%
I will continue to support you!"

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center line:84%
Someone saw me
perform and it actually

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center line:84%
inspired them like that? Wow.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh?

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
London. Huh.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KAORUKO] Of course I know
this competition.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
They've been holding it forever.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center line:84%
Apparently a lot of my
classmates in the music program

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.753 position:50% align:center line:84%
will be submitting
their songs this year.

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure they are.
If a composer does well in it,

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center line:84%
they could be handed
all sorts of opportunities.

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.761 position:50% align:center line:84%
Is that really true?

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh? Ayumu!

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU gasps]

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.599 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU laughs]

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU gasps]

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU laughs]

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU] So what are you
thinking, Yu? Will you enter it?

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, I'm not
not interested, I guess.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I might pass this time.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why is that?

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center line:84%
The thing is, the reason I got
into music in the first place

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:19.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
is because it made me happy.
I never thought seriously

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
about becoming
a legit composer.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not sure it's what I want.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center line:84%
I see.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.965 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have you thought much about

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center line:84%
what the future
might hold for you?

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, I mean, yeah. I guess so.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center line:84%
Contests like this work best
when people take them seriously.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's why I'm stuck.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not sure that I should
be allowed to enter.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center line:84%
I approach music more
casually, like a hobby.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not to mention,
I'd prefer to spend

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center line:84%
most of my free time
with the club.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
Maybe you're right.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU grunts]

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU]
You're asking if it's possible

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
to be a school idol
outside of Japan?

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.173 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not sure, a lot of
countries don't have

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
anything like school
idols to begin with.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.345 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not to mention,
clubs in other countries

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center line:84%
are totally different
than the ones here.

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Yeah. I've heard.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center line:84%
It'd be hard to build
idol culture from scratch.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
In fact, that's the whole reason
Lanzhu and I came here to sing.

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HARUKA]
One, two, three, four...

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:49.798 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
Haruka! Dinner is ready.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center line:84%
--Um. Hello?
--...five, six, seven...

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sorry sis, what's up?

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh...

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
Hiyah!

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
What was that?

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center line:84%
And it's done.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA] Maybe I went
a teensy bit overboard.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.701 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
Hey, Kanata!

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center line:84%
What are you doing out here?

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh. Hey, yourself.

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's this?

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA] I figured a
giant banner might be

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.877 position:50% align:center line:84%
a good start to
cheering Haruka on.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh...

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anyway. What's up?

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center line:84%
I can tell something's been
bothering you lately, hasn't it?

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] How could you
possibly know that?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center line:84%
I watch over my
fellow club members

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:42.017 position:50% align:center line:84%
much closer than
anyone realizes.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh.

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:47.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
Here's the thing...

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center line:84%
I told Ayumu that I wasn't going
to enter the competition,

00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center line:84%
but there's a part
of me that does want

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center line:84%
to see how far I could go in it.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
Honestly I'm mostly scared about

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
what would happen
if I somehow won.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center line:84%
Interesting...
Then my first question is,

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center line:84%
why didn't you tell Ayumu
that's how you really feel?

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh. Because I'm of two minds.

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:18.094 position:50% align:center line:84%
Y'know, ever since Ayumu and
I first joined the idol club,

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center line:84%
we've always been there
to support each other.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's how we got
where we are now.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ayumu gives me the push
I need to move forward

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center line:84%
whenever I get stuck.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center line:84%
She'd want me to enter
and help me win.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center line:84%
Makes sense.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center line:84%
Then, maybe you
should figure out

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center line:84%
what you want before
you talk to her again.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center line:84%
You two are the best of
friends, that's for sure.

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:45.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm more than positive
she'll be there for you

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
whenever you need her.

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd actually love to
give you a lil' push

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center line:84%
on the back toward
the contest, too.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I guess I'll
hold off for now.

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow, Kanata. You're so smart.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
Thank you for the chat!

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center line:84%
Any time, my pleasure!

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
Now, then. What am
I gonna do with this?

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Kanata!

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? Hi, Ayumu.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:22.033 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, um. Do you have
a sec to talk?

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sure.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
An overseas exchange program?

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU] It's short-term,
so I'd only be gone two weeks.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought I could
try to find the girl

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center line:84%
who sent me that letter
and maybe even

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center line:84%
help her get the club started.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'd be committing yourself
to a lot of hard work.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
I have to wonder why
you're asking me about this.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.640 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shouldn't you be
talking to Yu instead?

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU] I think deep down I'm
scared of us growing apart.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center line:84%
The two of us have been
excelling in our lives since we

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
joined up. It's like we've
been in perfect sync.

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center line:84%
But at heart, we're not working
toward the same goals.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50% align:center line:84%
Every step we take
toward our own dreams

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.451 position:50% align:center line:84%
is a step away from each other.

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center line:84%
Eventually, we won't be able to
stay as close as we have been.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50% align:center line:84%
It may sound like
I'm overreacting,

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I figure we might have to
face that reality someday.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center line:84%
So you're worried about
the future and not the present.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seems like we've all been
thinking that way lately.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA laughs]
Just talking to myself.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you're seriously
pursuing your dream,

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
your life will obviously change.

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center line:84%
Lanzhu talked about this
when we first met her.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center line:84%
Maybe she had more of
a point than we thought.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU]
Mm...

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:40.362 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, I'm glad I now
have some insight

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center line:84%
into what's troubling
the both of you.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center line:84%
But this is a difficult
problem to solve.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.868 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? The both of us?

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sorry. I'm just rambling again.

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm afraid that I don't
have good advice.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh. I see.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
So, basically,

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center line:84%
they're both hesitating
for the exact same reason,

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center line:84%
but neither one of them
have realized that yet.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.471 position:50% align:center line:84%
If they both push
each other towards

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center line:84%
their respective dreams,

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center line:84%
they're going to end
up further apart.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center line:84%
I totally understand wanting to
stay super close with someone.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:17.315 position:50% align:center line:84%
And the fear of losing them.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT A]
There she is!

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're Kanata Konoe, right?

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center line:84%
No. You can't have my banner!

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
We have something
we'd like to talk about.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? Again?

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT A]
I'll explain.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're in the Shinonome Academy
School Idol Fan Club.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ooh. Thank you for always
supporting my kid sister Haruka.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center line:84%
We actually belong
to different clubs

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.632 position:50% align:center line:84%
and didn't really
know each other.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center line:84%
But then we all went to
the school idol festival

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
and we bonded over our fandom.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center line:84%
School idols are
absolutely incredible.

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even if I get home exhausted,

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
watching them perform
gets me energized!

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center line:84%
I understand where
you're coming from.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT A] We want our
support to reach your sister

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center line:84%
and the others as
they attempt Love Live!

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
They have to know
we're rooting for them!

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come again!

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT B]
Since we can't go to the venue,

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center line:84%
we wanted to find some
other way to lift them up.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
Would you be willing
to help us out?

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT A]
Hm?!

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're comrades!

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've been wanting to do
something like this

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
for the girls as well!

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KARIN]
Support?

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA] Yeah. I wanted to
bring it up to the group.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've noticed that Haruka
seems run down

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center line:84%
and is smiling less
and less these days.

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP hums]

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center line:84%
She hasn't said
anything to me,

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.309 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I'm sure she's feeling
a ton of pressure.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center line:84%
It seems like she's
practicing every second,

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center line:84%
and I'm afraid she'll
end up with regrets

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
if she's not careful.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want to tell her she's great,
but also that whatever happens,

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center line:84%
the performance will be okay.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
My guess, is that it's not just
Haruka who feels that way.

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're right. The prelims are
bearing down on all the girls.

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.206 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's a lot to put on
someone's shoulders.

00:15:56.289 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center line:84%
Love Live's a huge goal for
practically every school idol.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
[AYUMU gasps] I think I
have a plan. Can I help?

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center line:84%
Me, too! Of course we
wanna cheer for Haruka,

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center line:84%
but we should also
support the others!

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Let's work together!

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thank you, girls!

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center line:84%
The best thing we could do
is figure out a way to cheer

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center line:84%
them on at the venue.

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center line:84%
But no audience is
allowed at prelims,

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center line:84%
so that's a difficult
feat to pull off.

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center line:84%
I think there's something
we can do even if we can't

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:27.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
go to the venue in the flesh.

00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:30.615 position:50% align:center line:84%
I was putting a little something
together for our concert.

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KASUMI]
Oo, what is it?

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIA]
Awesome! This would be stellar!

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center line:84%
[LANZHU]
Yes. This would work.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:40.959 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm going to start getting
in touch with people right now.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
We know what to do.

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:45.755 position:50% align:center line:84%
Project "Let's All Cheer on
the Other School Idols!"

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center line:84%
begins right this moment!

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.093 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP chattering]

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.848 position:50% align:center line:84%
--[YU] Sound good?
--[SETSUNA] I love it.

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
Leave it to me.

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HARUKA]
I'm off.

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA]
Have a great time.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.033 position:50% align:center line:84%
Haruka just walked out the door.

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll be over soon.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:15.869 position:50% align:center line:84%
Roger that.

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm almost finished
putting everything together.

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you nervous?

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] No, of course not!

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
But your legs are shaking
under your skirt, Chris.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're in the same boat.

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:51.154 position:50% align:center line:84%
The prelims definitely
feel extra weird

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center line:84%
since there's no audience.

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center line:84%
[phone ringing]

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whoops! I'm so sorry.

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HARUKA]
Uh, Sis?

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps] Everyone!

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's the matter?

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
Please check your
phones for messages.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KANATA] There's something
I want you to see.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center line:84%
We sent it to everyone
else performing

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center line:84%
at the prelims, too!

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center line:84%
And you're sure they're going
to be able to watch us live?

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center line:84%
[RINA]
Yes. They already are.

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center line:84%
[screaming] Too close!

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hello everybody competing
in the Tokyo prelims.

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center line:84%
We can't be there in person to
see your awesome performances,

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center line:84%
but we wanted to
tell you how we feel.

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center line:84%
All of us!

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center line:84%
[GROUP]
Hi there, idols!

[SAKURA, SAKUYA gasp]

[YUKARI, JENNIFER gasp]

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?!

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FANS]
You're so amazing, Haruka!

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
] We've got your backs,
no matter what!

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center line:84%
We know you'll kill it!

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have a great time!

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's always a great day
when we see you perform.

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do your best, Sakuya.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
Go on, Lanzhu. Your turn.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.556 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? I have to talk?

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh. I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to say.

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:05.895 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sounds like you're definitely
overthinking this message.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just say whatever comes
to your mind first.

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh. Okay. Then...

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center line:84%
[speaking Chinese]

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center line:84%
Your best is good enough.

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center line:84%
We can't wait to have a blast
watching you girls shine bright!

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ready, and...

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:24.247 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FANS] Give it your all!
You're great School Idols!

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.585 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow, this is a lot.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center line:84%
That was so sweet!

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm feeling much
more confident now.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
They're right!

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center line:84%
We're not alone! We've got this.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll be cheering for
you other clubs as well.

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center line:84%
Work that stage!

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HARUKA laughing]

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center line:84%
[FANS cheering]

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
Seems like they're having fun.

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
Agreed. Our words
reached their hearts.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, they did.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even if we're not
there ourselves.

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center line:84%
And look. The idols
competing represent

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
different schools,
which means their fans

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center line:84%
come from different places
and walks of life as well.

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center line:84%
But whenever you
like the same thing,

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center line:84%
you can bond with
different people

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center line:84%
and give each other strength.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center line:84%
Maybe deep down
everyone's the same.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center line:84%
That would mean
we can all be friends

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center line:84%
and help each other
reach for our dreams.

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center line:84%
We could follow the
example you two set.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU, AYUMU gasp]

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center line:84%
Even if a friend pushing you
forward means you grow apart,

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:40.281 position:50% align:center line:84%
you'll feel the lingering warmth
of their hand on your back.

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center line:84%
I believe you're both
gonna end up just fine.

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're really wise, Kanata.

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yu, listen.

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh?

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:57.716 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, this next term, I'm gonna
do an exchange program

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center line:84%
to spread my love
of school idols.

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU]
Uh. What?!

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't be shocked.

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'll have to keep
chasing your dream, too,

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center line:84%
or else you're gonna
get left behind.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center line:84%
And if I happen to
mess things up,

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll need your love!

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
'Cause you'll always have mine!

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
[YU laughs]

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center line:84%
Mm. I've got news, too!

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm going to enter that
composition competition

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center line:84%
and see how far I can go!

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EMMA] Wow. So Yu's
entering a huge contest

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center line:84%
and Ayumu's going overseas.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll be back before you know it.

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center line:84%
We'll miss you.

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center line:84%
We have even more
to think about now.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.968 position:50% align:center line:84%
Our show will kick off the year.

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah. I want it to be a
bold new step as a club.

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center line:84%
Awesome! I'm getting
crazy fired up!

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center line:84%
Same with me.
Check these out.

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:56.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
My thrill is so alive that I
wrote solo songs for everyone!
