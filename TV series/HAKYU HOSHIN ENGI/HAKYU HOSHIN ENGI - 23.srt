For most of my life,

I was never pained by
the idea of being alone.

When did it first find me--

47

I know so well?

48
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,416
[BUNCHU]
It was after I met Hiko.

He took my loneliness away...

50
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,708
...and replaced it
with something else.

but it seems as though
you've yet to learn.

If you wield that
much confidence,

you ought to have the strength
and skills to support it.

defeat me somehow...

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,291
We know that man!

164
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,125
[CHU groans]

165
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,083
[CHU]
This country has no leader.

166
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:01,791
The emperor...
is no longer fit to rule.

167
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:06,875
[CITIZENS chattering, laughing]

168
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,333
Whoa! Is this really happening?

169
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,750
You're alive!

170
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,250
Oh, thank goodness! I thought
you were dead for sure!

171
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,750
You're loud. [groans]

172
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,541
What's the update
on our situation?

173
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,291
Well, Taiitsu Shinjin made a
big announcement to everyone

174
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,875
that Kingo Island
was about to fall.

175
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,208
So now they're all
evacuating as we speak!

176
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,541
[TAIKOBO]
Whoa!

177
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,125
We managed to escape.

178
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,875
Everyone made it out safely.

179
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,125
Thank you, Taikobo.

180
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,666
Why me?

181
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,875
Because I know that must've
been a difficult clean-up job.

182
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,458
[TAIKOBO]
He was pretty strong.

183
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,375
It wasn't easy.

184
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,500
Uh--

185
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,208
[VENUS] All the <i>yokai</i> Sennin of
Kingo Island have been rescued!

186
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,041
If you're wondering
who you can thank,

187
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:05,916
turn your eyes toward the
fabulous Unsho Sisters!

188
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,208
[YOKAI 23G]
Goodbye, Kingo Island.

189
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,708
That's Mount Kongrong.

190
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,500
[YOZEN]
It's falling.

191
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,583
[BUNCHU]
Emperor Chu.

192
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,375
[BUNCHU]
Shushi...

193
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,916
I'm so proud of you.

194
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,208
You did well.

195
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:15,041
[BUNCHU] I promise... I did
everything I possibly could...

196
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,250
...for the good of our child.

197
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,833
For Yin.

198
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,375
[BUNCHU]
Hiko...

199
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,500
[grunts]

200
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,416
Look, there it is!

201
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,041
The Hoshindai is still standing!

202
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,333
Wait, does anyone
know where Master is?

203
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,375
He'll be back soon.

204
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,000
He needed some time alone.

205
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,958
Master...?

206
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,500
[SUPUSHAN] Ever since the war
ended, Master's been missing.

207
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,041
I can't believe that he just
wandered off to knows where

208
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,250
and left us behind to
deal with all the chaos

209
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,875
that he totally created!

210
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,750
He's lucky we haven't found him,

211
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,666
'cause when we do,
we owe him a beating!

212
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,416
[BUKICHI] Do you happen to
know where our Master is?

213
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
[coughs]

214
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,833
I'm sorry, I don't.

215
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,250
Good luck to you.

216
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,666
[BUKICHI]
Excuse me, have you seen...

217
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,541
[TAIITSU]
What? Who?

218
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,000
I can barely hear you.

219
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,291
But if you mean Taikobo,
I have no idea!

220
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,041
Do you have any idea
where Master could be?

221
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,875
Honestly, I haven't seen
him in quite some time.

222
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,083
I do hope you manage to
find him soon, though.

223
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,708
Taikobo?

224
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,375
Sorry, I have no clue.

225
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,916
Neither do I,
but we'll certainly

226
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,916
keep an eye out for him!

227
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,375
Do you know what I think?

228
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,166
With a little more
training you'd be able to

229
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,125
find the boy instantly!

230
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,416
Okay, so he's not here,
but who else can we ask?

231
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,958
Oh! I have an idea!

232
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,791
[VENUS]
Now pay attention!

233
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,666
If you wish to continue
living in the human world,

234
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,958
then you must start
obeying human laws!

235
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,625
The most important rule is

236
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,750
there will be no
consumption of humans!

237
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,875
[YOKAI 23H]
Shut up, ugly!

238
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,291
[YOKAI 23I]
Get off the stage and die!

239
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,916
[YOKAI chattering]

240
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,250
[YOKAI yelling]

241
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,375
[BUKICHI] Doesn't look
like he's here, either.

242
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,958
[SUPUSHAN]
Oh, well.

243
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,500
[SUPUSHAN]
I remember this place!

244
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,125
[SUPUSHAN]
I think it was right around here

245
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,000
that I first carried
Master into battle!

246
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,250
What a day.

247
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,000
Actually...

248
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,291
...no matter where I look,

249
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,583
all I can see are places
where we flew together.

250
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,291
[SUPUSHAN sighs]

251
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,833
[SUPUSHAN] I don't know
where else we can look.

252
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,583
Tell me the truth.

253
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,583
Do you think we're ever
gonna see him again?

254
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,916
[SUPUSHAN]
I know we will.

255
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,458
He'll come back at some point.

256
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,083
He's just that way!

257
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,208
I'll be so excited to see him!

258
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,333
I'll carry him on my back
to our next adventure!

259
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,291
[BUKICHI] Mm. And I'll be
following you both around

260
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,375
wherever you go,

261
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,291
even into the most
terrifying places!

262
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,458
[TAIKOBO whistling]

263
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,750
[laughs] That was so worth it!

264
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,791
Man, there's nothing I love more
than messing with those two!

265
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,916
But--I'm glad to get
a break from the noise.

266
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,875
Nap time.

267
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,875
[SHINKOHYO]
A nap? Really?

268
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:32,041
You haven't changed in the
slightest and never will.

269
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,958
[SHINKOHYO]
So, what do you intend to do

270
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,125
after freeing the human
world from the Sennin, hmm?

271
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,666
[TAIKOBO]
No plans.

272
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,166
I wasn't trying to
change human history.

273
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,916
I just wanted to help them

274
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,166
and fight with a team who
felt the same way as I did

275
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,666
about... certain things.

276
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,750
You mean about Dakki?

277
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah.

278
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,916
[SHINKOHYO] You could sense her
this whole time, couldn't you?

279
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,416
[DAKKI]
I have a single, small desire.

280
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,625
I wish to be the one and
only ruler of this planet.

281
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,250
I wish to become
this droplet of water.

282
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:17,375
I want to quench the earth and
create a life full of blessings.

283
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,666
[DAKKI]
I want to exist within the soil.

284
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,625
I want to be the power
behind the wind.

285
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:27,583
Just the sort of selfish
desires I'd expect from you.

286
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,875
[DAKKI]
Oh, really?

287
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,875
Joka also intended to
meld with this planet.

288
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,041
If I plan to take control of
Joka and do so in her place,

289
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,375
why would that be a problem?

290
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,500
Finally, my dear Taikobo.

291
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,541
Let me be your new mother.

292
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,833
I'll watch over you and
protect you forever.

293
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,916
I won't forget you.

294
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,541
Bye-bye.

295
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:06,000
Well, how do you plan to spend
all this free time you'll have?

296
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,958
I'll keep wandering around.

297
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,708
I'm not surprised.

298
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,250
Tell me something.

299
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,000
Do you know this place?

300
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,958
It was on this very
spot that you and I

301
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,833
fought our first battle
against each other.

302
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:22,583
How about one last fight
for old times' sake?

303
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,666
What do you say?

304
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,166
We'll keep it light and easy.

305
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,625
I was just joking.

306
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,291
Although it might not be
a bad idea for another day.

307
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,750
Besides, if I were
to fight you now,

308
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,875
what would I have to look
forward to in the future?

309
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,041
[yawns]

310
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,083
Now then.

311
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,791
Where should I go next?

312
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:50,333
[OH EKI] As for me... we will
say I'm Genshi Tenson's pupil.

313
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:55,333
This plan will come to fruition
in approximately 2,000 years,

314
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:58,458
when power shifts
from Yin to Shu.

315
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:00,916
[OH EKI]
At that time,

316
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,375
we will set the Hoshin
Project into motion.
