Because of Dakki,

00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,083
[BUNCHU] But humans have a thing
called "order of precedence."

88
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,916
I've adopted this
way of thinking.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,375
Yin is number one in my order.

[gasps]

91
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,208
[BUNCHU] What does not
benefit Yin must go,

92
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,166
such as Kingo and Kongrong.

93
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,125
They never have and never will
serve any purpose for Yin.

94
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,125
Therefore, I will destroy them.

95
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,916
It's a simple equation really,

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,375
yet one you and Taikobo
find difficult to understand.

97
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,583
[FUGEN]
It's no use.

I'm through talking,

101
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,500

Elite Sennin of Kongrong...

102
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,708
[BUNCHU]
You shall perish

worthless Sennin world!

104
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,625
So Bunchu decided to
make an appearance.

105
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,833
I suppose this means the
entertaining Great Sennin War

106
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,875
is entering its final act.

107
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,916
[KOKUTENKO] Which side
do you think will win?

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,375
No doubt Bunchu
will be the victor.

109
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,625
Really?

110
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,166
Even though Kongrong has
Taikobo, Ryukitsu Kosho,

111
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,791
and the rest of the Twelve
Elite Sennin on its side?

112
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,958
It's true he certainly is
outnumbered in this battle,

113
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,583
but I know that Bunchu's power

114
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,833
and his passion
for the Yin Dynasty

115
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,416
will outweigh any number
of foes moving against him.

116
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,166
However...

117
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,416
[KOKUTENKO]
However what?

118
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,250
[SHINKOHYO] While it's a simple
matter to break something,

119
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,833
restoration is a far
more difficult task.

120
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,875
Choka has been badly
damaged by Dakki.

121
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,000
Criminals are running rampant.

122
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,166
Public order is in shambles.

123
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,958
Women and children are
unable to leave their homes

124
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,416
and peace has all but
disappeared from the city.

125
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,666
How do you plan to repair this?

126
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,416
I am well aware of Yin's
current state, you clown.

127
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,291
It will be restored soon.

128
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,250
And yet I wonder how
you can be so certain.

129
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,666
Now that the Buseioh is
no longer working with you,

130
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,625
it appears that
basically the only thing

131
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,125
keeping the Yin
Dynasty alive is you.

132
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,375
[SHINKOHYO] After the many
challenges you've faced,

133

I don't understand why
you cling so tightly to it.

135
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,541
You realize that if
Yin as a concept is lost,

136
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,750
it will mean nothing
to its people.

137
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,833
In fact, I believe it
was Taikobo who said

138
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:11,291
many are already searching for
a new dynasty to replace it.

[BUNCHU groans]

140
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,458
[BUNCHU]
Silence, Shinkohyo!

141
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,500
I have always felt for Yin
as I would my own child.

142
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,041
I will protect it
unconditionally

143
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,250
just as any parent should.

144
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,416
[BUNCHU]
My history with Yin is long.

145
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,375
It began over 300 years ago.

146
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,541
[BUNCHU] When I was a
younger man, I had a rival.

[BUNCHU pants]

148
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,500
[BUNCHU]
Her name was Shushi

149
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,083
and her strength equaled my own.

150
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,333
[SHUSHI grunts]

151
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,291
[SHUSHI]
Ha!

152
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,125
[BUNCHU grunts]

153
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,916
[BUNCHU] I never saw her
as particularly beautiful

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,083
and she was four
years my senior.

155
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,333
That settles it.

156
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,291
Since I know that we
both have the same dream

157
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,833
of becoming generals
in the Yin army someday,

158
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,541
we'll need a lot of support.

159
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,875
So let's promise that we'll
always have each other's backs

160
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,541
no matter what!

161
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,625
Yes. I promise.

162
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,541
[BUNCHU] Although my rival,
she was cheerful and elegant.

163
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,833
I could not deny
she was charming.

164
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,250
Even so, I believed
we would remain at odds

165
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,291
for the rest of our lives.

166
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,291
[BUNCHU]
Then one day...

167
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,375
[BUNCHU]
You're going to be empress?

168
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,458
[SHUSHI laughs]

169
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,083
[SHUSHI]
Not yet, exactly.

170
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:56,250
But the emperor couldn't let
a good thing like me go!

171
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll be his second wife.

172
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,625
The thing is, since his first
couldn't have children,

173
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,250
if I were to have a baby, then
I could legally rule with him.

174
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,541
But you plan to be a general!

175
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,708
I mean, can you no longer
take up the sword?

176
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,000
[SHUSHI]
Don't be ridiculous.

177
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,500
We'll still fight together.

178
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,166
Only now we'll win standing
right alongside the emperor.

179
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,750
I would never let all of
our training go to waste.

180
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,750
The people of Yin need
both of us, remember?

181
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,083
[BUNCHU] That was
the day our paths split,

182
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,500
each in the opposite direction.

183
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,041
[BUNCHU]
In order to free my mind

184
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,375
from the array of
emotions clouding it,

185
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,416
I focused on
self-inflicted pain.

186
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,250
[BUNCHU groans]

187
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,833
[BUNCHU] My entire body began
to rot and grow necrotic.

188
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,833
[KING OF YIN] You wish
to go to the Sennin world?

189
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,375
[BUNCHU]
Yes.

190
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,666
I understand that I was not born
with the bones of a Sennin,

191
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,166
but after the training
I've put my body through,

192
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,166
I believe I may be
developing them.

193
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,708
[KING OF YIN]
I see!

194
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,333
If you were to go to their world
and return here as a Doshi,

195
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,083
that would greatly
benefit the Yin Dynasty.

196
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,541
--[SHUSHI] Bunchu.
--[BUNCHU] Yes?

197
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,875
Please make sure
you come back to us.

198
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,208
Promise?

199
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,208
I want this little one to
grow and learn from you.

200
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,166
[BUNCHU]
You have my word, Empress.

201
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,166
[BUNCHU]
Then ten years went by.

202
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,666
Have you heard?

203
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,708
It appears the Kyo clan has
invaded the capital of Yin.

204
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,291
[YOKAI 18B]
Yeah.

205
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:41,666
I heard that the emperor fought
back, but was killed in battle.

206
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,166
[BUNCHU]
During that era,

207
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,375
Yin had not yet
gained full strength.

208
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,875
[SHUSHI gasps]

209
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,458
[footsteps]

210
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,000
[gasps]

211
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,416
Shushi!

212
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,916
You came back.

213
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,291
I'm happy to see you, Bunchu.

214
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,291
[BUNCHU]
Please, save your strength.

215
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,750
[SHUSHI]
I fought as hard as I could.

216
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,708
I guess... I've lost
my edge somehow.

217
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,750
Hold on!

218
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,916
[SHUSHI]
I need you to train my son.

219
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,750
[SHUSHI]
Mold him...

220
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,541
...into a leader.

221
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,500
Emperor of Yin.

222
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,833
Promise me you'll
take care of him.

223
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,166
Please, Bunchu...

224
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,250
I shall.

225
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,083
[BUNCHU] And after the battle,
the boy became the new emperor.

226
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,666
He was good at it.

227
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,583
In fact, he made
Yin more powerful.

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,416
[BUNCHU]
From that day on,

229
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,458
I oversaw the education
of the royal family.

230
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:22,541
The emperor's son and grandson,
as well as Emperor Chu--

231
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,000
They were all students of mine.

232
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,958
[BUNCHU] I've trained leaders
both beloved and hated,

233
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,166
but regardless of
the way they ruled,

234
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,916
each one feared me
and idolized me.

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,416
That's true.

236
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,041
And it's worth noting that
you've outlived every last one.

237
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,375
[BUNCHU]
That's not relevant.

238
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,333
[SHINKOHYO]
Really, now?

239
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,791
[SHINKOHYO] You are the
father of Yin, Bunchu.

240
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,791
Relish it.

241
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,833
[BUNCHU] No matter the
cost, I will rebuild Yin!

242
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,750
Tsk. Gravity control!

243
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,833
Not bad.

244
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,333
I'm impressed.

245
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,250
[FUGEN]
You goal truly is annihilation.

246
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:34,166
You destroyed the power reactor
without a second thought.

247
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,875
But hear me, Bunchu.

248
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,458
I will not allow you
to release my soul.

249
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,291
I'm generating repulsion

250
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,625
and your Kinben will not
be able to reach me.

251
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,291
Is that a challenge?

252
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,666
[gasps]

253
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,083
Fugen!

254
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,875
Don't do anything stupid!

255
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,208
[gasps]

256
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,291
[TAIKOBO]
Stalling now?

257
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:06,333
[TAIKOBO screams]

258
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,583
[OHKIJIN]
Take deep breaths, Sister.

259
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,000
This is a treatment known
as an aromatherapy massage.

260
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,125
Why have I never had
one of these before?

261
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,458
Oh, that feels so
good! I approve!

262
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,625
Look what I brought, Dakki!

263
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,666
It's the legendary
unrefined saké

264
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,875
that Cleopatra herself
used to drink.

265
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,625
[DAKKI]
Is it really?

266
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,541
Wow! I love it!

267
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,625
[laughs]

268
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,541
[DAKKI] It's important
that a lady continuously

269
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,875
refine her beauty with
the most current trends!

270
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,708
Oh, look! We're getting
a call from you-know-who!

271
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,208
[OHTENKUN chuckles]

272
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,166
[OHTENKUN] I'm happy to see
you in good spirits, Dakki.

273
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,750
[DAKKI laughs]

274
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,916
Since the boys are off fighting,
I figured I'd have a spa day.

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,750
It's the perfect
way to luxuriate.

276
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,708
[OHTENKUN]
Ah, how predictable.

277
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,583
I called to inform
you that Bunchu

278
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,750
has finally made his move.

279
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,708
Oh, so things are going well?

280
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,041
[OHTENKUN]
I suppose.

281
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,125
But if this keeps up,
he'll be the sole victor.

282
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,833
[DAKKI]
You amuse me sometimes.

283
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,708
Bunchu is stronger
than most, it's true,

284
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,791
but don't forget he's
still just a human.

285
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,791
Humans have a simple point of
weakness buried deep within

286
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,500
which they call a heart.

287
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,833
[OHTENKUN]
Is that so?

288
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,583
[DAKKI] It can also
drive them mad... like you.

289
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,708
The trick is to discover
what will make Bunchu

290
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,708
crumble in on himself.

291
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,208
But I have a feeling you
already know what that is.

292
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,041
[OHTENKUN]
I believe I do.

293
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,833
You truly are amazing.

294
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:36,958
I am humbled.

295
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,708
Oh, stop.

296
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,458
[HIKO]
Hmm...

297
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,166
[TENKA]
What's the matter, Dad?

298
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,708
[HIKO]
Where are those three sisters?

299
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,875
[TENKA]
I dunno.

300
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,000
They got separated
from us at some point.

301
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,208
I'm wondering where
the hell Bunchu is.

302
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,375
Shouldn't he be here by now?

303
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,125
[FUGEN] Taikyoku Fuin's
gravity control isn't working.

304
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,708
Or is it just that
Bunchu's paopei

305
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,625
is significantly more powerful?

306
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,208
Before we continue,

307
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,625
I have a question.

308
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,500
What compelled you
to abandon Taikobo

309
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,666
and fight me on your own?

310
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,333
Did you believe your power
was enough to stop me?

311
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,291
Perhaps I did.

312
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,083
[BUNCHU]
You're lying.

313
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,500
You're ensuring Taikobo lives,
even if everyone else dies,

314
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,666
and attempting to stall me
until your allies arrive.

315
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,416
You offered to be
the one to draw me out,

316
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,750
though it could mean losing
your life in the process.

317
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,458
[BUNCHU]
I'm baffled and amused.

318
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:54,291
Do you honestly believe I'll be
defeated if you outnumber me?

319
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,458
[FUGEN]
I have to buy time somehow.

320
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,458
They'll be here soon.

321
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,708
How foolish must you be

322
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,875
to think this strategy
could ever be effective?

323
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,291
[FUGEN]
My friends are coming.

324
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,958
And you'll have your answers
when we defeat you together!

325
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,791
What's this?

326
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,666
Must be your paopei's
nuclear fusion ability.

327
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:50,541
[TAIKOBO groaning]

328
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,458
[TAIKOBO gasps]

329
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,708
[TAIKOBO groaning]

330
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,166
[TAIKOBO]
Fugen.

331
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,416
Looks like he attacked.

332
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,041
That was definitely
a direct hit.

333
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,708
I hope it was enough to do
a little damage at least.

334
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,291
[gasps]

335
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,416
[FUGEN]
No. That's impossible.

336
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,125
He doesn't even have
a scratch on him!

337
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,250
You never stood a chance
against my power.

338
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,375
I'll offer one truth

339
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,250
to compensate for
your embarrassment.

340
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,708
I have no weaknesses
for you to find.

341
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,166
The result will be the same
no matter how many come for me.

342
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,041
[FUGEN]
I'm scared.

343
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,708
[FUGEN gasps]

344
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,750
[BUNCHU]
Do you still wish to fight?

345
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,375
Very well.

346
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,583
Unfortunately,
you leave me no choice.

347
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,750
[FUGEN gasps]

348
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,750
[BUNCHU gasps]

349
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,166
Wait.

350
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,250
A wall of wind.

351
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,875
[TAIKOBO]
Fugen?

352
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,583
What the hell is wrong with you?

353
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,000
Looks like we made
it just in time!

354
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,416
[FUGEN]
Bo!

355
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,500
Hey, there, Bunchu!

356
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,875
It's been a while!

357
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,708
Ha! I didn't recognize you

358
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,750
without your tail
between your legs.

359
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,458
[TAIKOBO]
Good one!

360
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,291
But you need to get used
to the idea of losing.

361
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,333
Really?

362
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,791
Then come at me, Taikobo!

363
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,666
[KOKUTENKO]
Ooh! Looks like the battle

364
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,208
between Taikobo and Bunchu
is finally taking place.

365
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,333
We know how it ends.

366
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,583
Bunchu defeats
all of them, right?

367
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,083
Yes.

368
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,291
Unless...

369
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,958
[KOKUTENKO gasps]
Unless what?

370
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,875
[SHINKOHYO] It's possible
the Signpost of History

371
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,416
is not pointed in
Bunchu's direction.

372
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,083
We have no way of knowing

373
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,291
who will reign
victorious this time.

374
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,208
[OHTENKUN] What's your plan
now that the battle has begun?

375
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:08,083
Let's see. I think...
I'll do whatever I see fit.

376
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,250
[OHTENKUN]
Understood.

377
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,416
The age of myth seems to quickly
be approaching its close.

378
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,375
Therefore, history's archetype,

379
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,458
which is fundamental
to this world,

380
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,500
will end with it.

381
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,458
Dakki...

382
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,291
...Bunchu...

383
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,375
...the people...

384
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:49,083
They've forsaken me
and now I'm all alone.
