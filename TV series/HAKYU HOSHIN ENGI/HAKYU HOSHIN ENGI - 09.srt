1
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,458
So much for us to talk about.

2
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,958
Where to begin?

3
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,750
Suppose I'll tell you
how I've carried out

4
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,291
the Hoshin Project
from the shadows.

5
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,791
You what?

6
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,208
Well, I've been getting
my hands dirty for you.

7
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,458
You may not wanna admit it,

8
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,500
but you know that you've
gotta make a sacrifice

9
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,333
here and there if you
actually wanna get things done.

10
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,250
Whether you believe
it's right or wrong,

11
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,333
the efficiency is undeniable.

12
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,791
But you?

13
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,500
You're a good guy
and all that junk

14
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,291
so you can't bring
yourself to do it.

15
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,083
What in the hell are you saying?

16
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,500
[OHTENKUN] To be frank, I did
all the things you wanted to

17
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,791
but weren't capable of.

18
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,791
Not to get too poetic,
but I'm the mirror

19
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,625
that reflects the
darkness within you.

20
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:30,000
Conversely, you're the mirror
that reflects the light

21
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,375
within me.

22
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:42,083
[clock chiming]

23
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,583
[OHTENKUN] Time to make
up your mind, Taikobo.

24
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:45,958
What'll it be?

25
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,250
You've got a big choice
to make here.

26
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,875
Remember how you always
thought you'd be alone

27
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,416
after you lost your clan?

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
[TAIKOBO] Yes, but I also
remember being taken to

29
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,958
the Sennin world to
train as a Doshi.

30
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,750
[OHTENKUN] Right, and the first
thought that popped into

31
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,875
your head when you were
assigned the Hoshin Project was

32
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,125
"I'll show you."

33
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,458
[TAIKOBO]
But the allies I've made.

34
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,791
All of it.

35
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,875
Everything that I've ever done.

36
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,916
Everything that makes me me.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,375
Am I just supposed
to throw it all away?

38
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,875
We're gonna die!

39
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,083
[TAIKOBO, SUPUSHAN gasp]

40
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,666
We've made barrier contact.

41
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,125
Significant damage endured--
29 percent surface destroyed.

42
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,416
The barrier is down!

43
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,958
He pulled it off!

44
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,333
Thanks, Yozen.

45
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,166
[YOKAI 7A]
Commander Bunchu!

46
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,250
Kongrong Mountain
has collided with us!

47
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,208
The Tsutenho...
It's been destroyed!

48
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,791
Damn you, Ohtenkun.

49
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,250
[YOZEN]
They followed through.

50
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,416
Taikobo.

51
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,458
Thank you for having
so much faith in me.

52
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,041
I've got to pull it together.

53
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,500
I'm so utterly exhausted
I can barely even maintain

54
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,458
my human form.

55
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:43,875
I need to find someplace
safe to hide where I can rest.

56
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,750
[OHTENKUN] Hey, sorry to
be the bearer of bad news,

57
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:01,083
Bunchu, but, well, Chotenkun?
Yozen totally annihilated him.

58
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,791
[chuckles]

59
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,125
The bastard tucked
that victory under his belt

60
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,583
and ran like hell.

61
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,416
[BUNCHU] I assumed as much,
as I assume you're Yozen.

62
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,541
[OHTENKUN]
Pardon?

63
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,208
[BUNCHU] Transformation is
the genius Doshi's specialty,

64
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,458
after all, and I'm certain
that the real Ohtenkun

65
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,666
would rather die in battle
with Yozen instead of

66
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,750
admitting to me that he failed.

67
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,500
And the other option
is even more farfetched,

68
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,333
but I can't believe
he would betray me

69
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,250
and let Yozen escape.

70
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,583
So then...

71
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,958
Simple deduction tells me
I should annihilate you.

72
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,375
[OHTENKUN]
Will you just relax, Bunchu?

73
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,416
I didn't wanna step out
of line and make the call

74
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,666
to kill him without you
giving me the direct order.

75
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,416
I mean, we all know who he is.

76
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,625
I'm not gonna just kill
Lord Tsuten Kyoshu's son

77
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,166
without the go-ahead.

78
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,500
[BUNCHU]
I see.

79
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,833
But, that's hardly
an acceptable excuse.

80
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,291
His lineage doesn't change
the fact that he's still

81
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,625
our enemy.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,416
Well how does this
work for an excuse?

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,125
Yozen is so depleted he
can barely even hobble

84
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,000
right now.

85
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,166
There's no doubt his Kongrong
buddies will try to rescue him.

86
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,125
It'll be a small group
for the sake of stealth,

87
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,125
but they're gonna send their
best to get the job done.

88
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,041
I'd even wager that Taikobo
himself will join them.

89
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,916
And they'll walk right
into their own graves.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,375
That's why I let him live.

91
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,333
We couldn't ask for a better
piece of bait than Yozen.

92
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,333
I never realized you
were just as cunning

93
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,500
as that fox, Dakki.

94
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,125
Although your devious
maneuvers could prove useful,

95
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:41,041
the rest of the Juttenkun will
handle things without you.

96
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,708
I have no intention of
letting you out of my sight.

97
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,500
Aw, Bunchu, you don't trust me?

98
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,208
[BUNCHU]
Don't take it personally.

99
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,958
I don't trust anybody.

100
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,916
We have full contact
with Kingo Island.

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
At the very least, we have the
chance for a fair fight now.

102
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,541
Unfortunately...

103
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,416
Kongrong Mountain's
drained of energy,

104
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,041
and my power is
just as worn out.

105
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,000
[TAIKOBO]
Koshu.

106
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,916
[KOSHU]
Save your pity, please.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,666
You just stay focused
on what needs to be done.

108
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,708
Right.

109
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,125
Okay!

110
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,708
First things first,
we gotta rescue Yozen.

111
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,125
[GENSHI] And just how
do you intend to do that?

112
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,041
I'm infiltrating Kingo
Island myself this time.

113
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,500
Yozen's too important
to us to risk losing.

114
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,250
Whoa, hang on a sec! You're
our commander, aren't you?

115
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,125
It's not like we can
really risk losing you!

116
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,041
[TAIKOBO] I'm returning command
to Master Genshi Tenson

117
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,500
until I can make it back.

118
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,083
I owe Yozen big time,
and the last thing I'm gonna do

119
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,000
is leave him on
his own in there.

120
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,375
[GENSHI]
I understand.

121
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,750
Bring him back to us, Taikobo.

122
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,583
[GYOKUTEI]
I'd like to come along as well.

123
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,458
Yozen has become
like a son to me.

124
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,250
So I hope you don't
mind me joining you.

125
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,666
Of course you can.

126
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,125
So this is what it looks
like inside of Kingo?

127
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,583
[GYOKUTEI] I have to admit, it
certainly appears more advanced

128
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,625
than Kongrong.

129
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,416
Now that I'm here, it's really
no wonder we underestimated

130
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,333
the firing range
of the Tsutenho.

131
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,666
[GYOKUTEI] So, how do
you plan on finding Yozen?

132
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,333
[TAIKOBO]
Well, I figure we should find

133
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,500
the barrier control room.

134
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,458
If we're lucky, we'll find him
hiding somewhere close to it.

135
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,000
Something feels weird.

136
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,916
This place is supposed
to be crawling with Sennin,

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,541
so don't you think we should've
run into one by now?

138
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,916
[TAIKOBO]
Not necessarily.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,833
Especially if they've
already realized we're here.

140
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,625
They've probably withdrawn
all of their Sennin

141
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,583
and Doshi as part of their plan.

142
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,208
So we've gotta stay alert.

143
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,791
Yeah! You've got a point!

144
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,750
Gotta make sure we
don't fall for any traps--

145
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,666
[yelling]

146
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,250
[SUPUSHAN]
What's happening?

147
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,083
Master, help!

148
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,666
Supu, no!

149
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,083
[QUEEN] Ever since
the beginning of time,

150
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,125
the number three has
been said to emanate

151
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,125
a powerful aura
of pure sensuality.

152
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,208
[VENUS] That is a well-known
fact, my dear sister, Queen.

153
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,333
But do you suppose we were
the inspiration for such belief?

154
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,666
[QUEEN]
Without a doubt.

155
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,083
For there's nothing sexier
than a beautiful woman

156
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,666
who's also strong.

157
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,125
[VENUS]
We are the Three Unsho Sisters!

158
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,500
[MADONNA growls]

159
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,416
[VENUS purrs]

160
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,625
[QUEEN chuckles]

161
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,583
I wonder if Taikobo
and his crew have already

162
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,500
snuck in here somewhere.

163
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,500
Hey, Tenka, you doing all right?

164
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,458
Don't forget you've
still got that nasty gash

165
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,333
in your gut.

166
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,958
Try to pace yourself.

167
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,458
I'm good.

168
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,458
I appreciate the concern,
but it looks worse than it is--

169
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,416
nothing I can't handle.

170
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,750
So what's the next step
now that we've made it in?

171
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,833
Come over here and
take a look below us.

172
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,750
These floating spheres
are referred to as stars,

173
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,500
and the stars that shine
brightest are the Juttenkun's

174
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,208
personal chambers.

175
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,708
But that one, the giant
black star at the center?

176
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,958
That's the core.

177
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:27,083
It serves as the control
center for all of Kingo.

178
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,333
It's safe to assume Bunchu's
hunkered down in there

179
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,375
right now, throwing out
orders and threatening

180
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,083
minions with his glowing eye.

181
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,083
[HIKO]
Bunchu.

182
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,375
So, just what the hell
are the Juttenkun anyway?

183
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,166
[VENUS] They're the top
officers of Kingo Island,

184
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,500
led by a sadistic runt
named Ohtenkun.

185
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,541
What makes them a
particularly troublesome group

186
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,375
of Sennin is their mastery
of the space paopei,

187
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,916
Juzetsujin.

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,833
Now I'm more confused.

189
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,458
[VENUS] Just remember, if you
notice an octagonal mark

190
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,583
like this, take extreme caution.

191
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,250
[GYOKUTEI] I'm guessing
this eight-sided mark

192
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,333
is the entrance to
their hyperspace.

193
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,041
What do we do now?

194
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,708
Well, we're not leaving Supu,

195
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,041
so we're going in.

196
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,583
[SUPUSHAN whimpering]

197
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,125
A giant Capybara?

198
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,958
Did we stumble into
some creepy fairytale?

199
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,375
[SONTENKUN]
Hi, guys.

200
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,500
[SUPUSHAN] Ah! Did that stuffed
animal just talk to us?

201
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,291
[SONTENKUN]
I like to play games.

202
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,458
Is there a game
you like to play?

203
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,000
How about the name game?
Tell us who you are.

204
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,916
[SONTENKUN] I'm Sontenkun,
one of the Kingo Juttenkun.

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,041
And you're guests in my
hyperspace, Kaketsujin.

206
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,208
[TAIKOBO, GYOKUTEI]
He's a Juttenkun?

207
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,250
[SONTENKUN] I've created
an entire world of toys.

208
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,375
And the two of you,
Gyokutei of the Twelve Sennin,

209
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,500
and Taikobo,
commander of Kongrong,

210
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:11,416
will soon be added to
my vast collection.

211
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,916
Don't be so sure.

212
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,375
Whoa!

213
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,250
The sonic-speed Zansenken!

214
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,250
It took out a Juttenkun
in a flash!

215
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,333
'Fraid not.
Look a little more closely.

216
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,166
[GYOKUTEI] There was nothing
inside that thing but stuffing.

217
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,666
[SONTENKUN laughing]

218
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,416
Astounding observation
skills, Gyokutei.

219
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Y'see, each and every
toy in this room is me.

220
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,291
Cut 'em up all you want,
it won't do any good.

221
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,791
I know he's taunting us,
but I think it's the truth.

222
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,708
These toys...

223
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,708
None of them
are his actual body.

224
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,458
Which means he's controlling
them from somewhere safe.

225
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,166
Only a coward would refuse
to show himself in combat.

226
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,666
I'll slice this whole
room down to stuffing--

227
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,083
destroy every last toy
you can hide within.

228
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,583
Jeez! I couldn't
even see you move!

229
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,708
What d'ya expect from
one of the Twelve Sennin?

230
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,041
[SONTENKUN]
Argh! Oh, silly me.

231
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,875
I knew I was
forgetting something.

232
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,750
I've also got the ability
to self-destruct!

233
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,833
What?!

234
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,333
The bastard can explode?

235
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,541
[SONTENKUN]
Just play with me already!

236
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,666
How does kuzushi shogi sound?

237
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,750
All right, fine.

238
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,083
Go on, Supu, you play
with the pushy little creep.

239
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,166
But why? You know it's
gonna be some kind of trap!

240
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,333
And besides, aren't we
in a hurry to find Yozen?

241
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,958
The only way we're ever
gonna get out of here

242
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,333
is by defeating him!

243
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,750
[SUPUSHAN]
Uh...

244
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,916
If we're doing this,

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,750
I'm hoping you have
some plan in mind.

246
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,750
[TAIKOBO] I'm pretty sure I'm
getting close to figuring out

247
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,125
where this jerk is hiding.

248
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,250
[SUPUSHAN]
Well, if this is gonna help,

249
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,333
I guess I really
don't have a choice.

250
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,041
[SONTENKUN laughs]

251
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,250
[SUPUSHAN] If we're playing
games, I'd rather play go.

252
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,083
Hey, I said go!

253
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,708
[SONTENKUN] Then we agree,
kuzushi shogi it is.

254
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,458
We'll decide who goes
first with a round

255
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,500
of rock-paper-scissors.

256
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,541
[SUPUSHAN]
Uh... Yeah, that's fair.

257
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,791
[SONTENKUN]
One. Two. Three.

258
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,291
[BOTH]
Shoot!

259
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,375
[SONTENKUN]
Yay, I'm already winning!

260
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,958
Why did I play rock?
I never play rock!

261
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,916
[SONTENKUN]
All right, then,

262
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,375
that just leaves the difficult
tiles to take care of.

263
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,291
Let's see, I think
I'll start over here.

264
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,666
Careful now...

265
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,916
Slow. Slow. Slo--

266
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,125
It's about time!

267
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,958
I didn't think I was
ever gonna get a turn!

268
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,666
[SONTENKUN]
Aw, rats!

269
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,625
[SUPUSHAN]
Got it.

270
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,666
Now just one more!

271
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,208
[SONTENKUN]
You're actually pretty good.

272
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,416
[SUPUSHAN chuckles]

273
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,291
[SUPUSHAN] I've never even
played this game before,

274
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,708
but it's almost shockingly easy!

275
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,041
Time to end this.

276
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,708
I'll finish him off
with one big move!

277
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,916
[SUPUSHAN yelling]

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,083
[SONTENKUN]
Yipee!

279
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,750
Thanks for breaking up
the tiles for me!

280
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,875
Mine, mine, mine, mine!

281
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,916
I've got more than
half the tiles!

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,875
So I win and you lose!

283
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,500
[SUPUSHAN yelling]

284
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,291
Oh, no!

285
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,791
[SONTENKUN laughing]

286
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,333
One thing I forgot to mention.

287
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,916
If you lose to me in a game,

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,125
you get to spend the
rest of your life as a toy.

289
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,666
So, who wants to
play with me next?

290
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,291
If you win, I promise to
turn him back to normal.

291
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,000
[TAIKOBO]
I'll play your game.

292
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,250
[SONTENKUN]
And I accept your challenge.

293
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,375
I actually like these types
of games when I'm not in

294
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,583
a hurry trying to save
my friend's life.

295
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,041
So, what do you wanna play?

296
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,125
I'm fine with
whatever you've got.

297
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,583
[SONTENKUN] Well...
Concentration's always fun.

298
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,708
I haven't played
concentration in ages.

299
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,875
Sure, let's do it.

300
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,125
[SONTENKUN]
Yay!

301
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,541
Any luck?

302
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,291
You said you were on the verge
of locating him earlier.

303
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,333
Hush.

304
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,833
Keep your voice down.

305
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,625
He's hidden somewhere
among the toys in this room.

306
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:16,291
In fact, he probably
even looks like a toy.

307
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,041
That explosion of his?

308
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,291
He only blew himself
up to distract us.

309
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,083
And there's only one
reason why he would even

310
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,375
need to distract us like that.

311
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,708
He knew he was in danger
of getting sliced to bits

312
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,500
at any second.

313
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,458
Just trust me and
follow my lead.

314
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,291
[SONTENKUN]
Ta-da!

315
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,625
I found the deck of cards.

316
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,458
I'll go ahead and
lay 'em out for us.

317
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,708
Hold on!

318
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,416
I'll be the one to
lay out the cards.

319
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,375
I can't just sit back and
risk you cheating, after all.

320
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,875
[SONTENKUN]
I would never cheat!

321
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,125
What a terrible thing
to say to a toy.

322
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,708
Behold!

323
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,958
The amazing and mind-blowing
card-dealing skills

324
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,958
of Taikobo the Magician!

325
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,916
[SONTENKUN]
Wow! You look like a huge dork!

326
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,958
[TAIKOBO]
Chi!

327
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,625
[SONTENKUN]
Whoa!

328
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,958
[TAIKOBO]
That should do the trick.

329
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,375
[SONTENKUN]
That was awesome!

330
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,416
I totally take back
the dork comment!

331
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,166
You ready?
Let's see who goes first.

332
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,291
One, two...

333
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,666
[BOTH]
Shoot!

334
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,916
Wow, what a moron!

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,583
You really played paper twice?

336
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,708
[SONTENKUN]
Rats, that was dumb!

337
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,291
This one and this one!

338
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,875
[GYOKUTEI] You got a
pair--on your first try.

339
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,250
How'd you do that?

340
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,833
[TAIKOBO chuckles]

341
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,625
Oh, a magician never
reveals his secrets.

342
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,083
No, really, I'll tell
you how I did it.

343
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,250
I simply looked at all the
cards while I was dealing

344
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,250
and memorized
where they landed.

345
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,666
[TAIKOBO chuckles]

346
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,916
What?

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,250
A skill made possible
by my supreme powers

348
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,583
of dynamic vision
and memorization!

349
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,750
[laughing]

350
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,416
[GYOKUTEI]
Pretty cheap if you ask me.

351
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,958
But I guess it's an
impressive form of cheating.

352
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,500
[TAIKOBO]
These two cards! And these!

353
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,458
This card and this card
and this card and this card!

354
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,875
Oh, man! I forgot how
much fun this game can be.

355
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,500
I'm so happy only flowers
could visually represent

356
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,583
my joy!

357
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,208
[SONTENKUN] That cheat of yours
is actually the perfect way

358
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,333
to play this game,
and it's my own dumb fault

359
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,083
for letting you deal the
cards in the first place.

360
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,041
But you know what?

361
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,458
Memory can prove to be a rather
vague and precarious thing.

362
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,791
It has the tendency
to betray people.

363
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,166
Oh, c'mon, don't give me that.
You're just a sore--

364
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,458
What?

365
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,458
It's not a match?

366
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,833
--[SONTENKUN] Lucky me!
--No way!

367
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,291
[SONTENKUN]
I finally get to take a turn.

368
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,416
[chuckles, hums]

369
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,333
And here we go.
Three of clubs.

370
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,958
[TAIKOBO] Yeah, and it's exactly
where I remember it being.

371
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,958
[SONTENKUN]
Let's try this one!

372
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,125
[TAIKOBO gasps]

373
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,416
[SONTENKUN] This looks
like a good one to pick.

374
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,750
And this...

375
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,416
Yay! Look, I got
two pairs in a row!

376
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,500
What? How could you
possibly know where--?

377
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:16,000
[SONTENKUN] You're not
actually surprised, are you?

378
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,625
Did you forget
that this is my room?

379
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,500
Everything in here is
conjured from my thoughts.

380
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,541
That's how the Juzetsujin works.

381
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,500
It does what I want.

382
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,500
Here, let me show you.

383
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,083
This is how much
control I have in here!

384
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,666
What?

385
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,958
He turned every card
into an ace of hearts!

386
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,416
Now I see.

387
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,291
The game was rigged
from the get-go.

388
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,708
His paopei controls everything,
that's how he can turn

389
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,625
the loser into a toy.

390
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,291
But of course,
the master never loses.

391
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:51,500
The space paopei, Juzetsujin,
literally manipulates space.

392
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,041
And that's why the
Juttenkun are so powerful.

393
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,708
This entire time,
he's been challenging us

394
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,916
to games we could
never possibly win.

395
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,333
[SONTENKUN laughs]
Way to finally catch on, genius.

396
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,666
I'm already holding
26 cards here.

397
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,083
Gee, I wonder if I'll happen
to find the winning pair?

398
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,166
What do you think?

399
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,791
Are ya ready to
get turned into a toy?

400
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,416
[TAIKOBO]
Gyokutei.

401
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,958
The winning move is up to you.

402
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,083
I've got it under control.

403
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,500
[TAIKOBO yelling]

404
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,875
You just hang in there.

405
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:14,166
[YOZEN grunting]

406
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,666
[YOZEN panting]

407
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:41,833
[YOZEN crying]

408
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,208
[YOZEN]
Master...

409
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,625
[OHTENKUN chuckles]
