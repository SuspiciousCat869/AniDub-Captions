00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,250
[FUGEN]
Hey, Bo.

2
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,916
I was just thinking...

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,875
Do you remember that time
we snuck away with Kokin

4
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,708
to head out on
a little adventure?

5
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,875
Yeah!

6
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,750
I haven't thought
about that in ages now.

7
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,125
Kind of a random memory there.

8
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,083
[FUGEN] It's funny we
were brazen enough to slip

9
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,583
a sleeping drug into
Master Genshi's food

10
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,583
just so we could steal
Kokin and fly down

11
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,625
to romp around the human world.

12
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,458
[FUGEN, TAIKOBO]
Later!

13
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,125
[laughing]

14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,208
[FUGEN] I really miss
those days, y'know.

15
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,458
It's just...

16
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,416
I can't help but feel
nostalgic for the time

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
when we didn't have to fight.

18
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,083
Well, doesn't matter now.
Here we are.

19
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:21,166
Bunchu will be here soon,
so we need to be prepared.

20
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,833
Let's have a snack while we can.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,875
[TAIKOBO]
Whoa! Sesame dumplings!

22
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:29,583
[munching]

23
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,166
Thanks, Fugen!
That got my energy up.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,791
Wait... Maybe not.

25
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,416
[FUGEN]
Sorry, Bo. Don't hate me.

26
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:42,583
[TAIKOBO groaning]

27
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:47,041
[snoring]

28
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,083
Take 'em down, Master!

29
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,291
Looks like we've got a
pretty good sized audience.

30
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,875
Better make this count.

31
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,125
Perfect time to show everyone
how powerful I really am.

32
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,541
[KOKUTENKO]
Hmm...

33
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,833
Well this makes for an
interesting turn of events.

34
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,750
Oh, nothing's ever
interesting enough for me.

35
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,458
You know that it's
my personal mission

36
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,583
to make every situation
more entertaining,

37
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,625
and I've got one last
piece to put in place

38
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,791
before we enjoy this spectacle.

39
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:01,916
[KOKUTENKO]
You do?

40
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,875
So that guy's the
illustrious Taikobo, eh?

41
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,416
Yep.

42
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,250
I heard plenty of stories about
him up in the Sennin world.

43
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,958
I feel pretty lucky I get
the chance to actually

44
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,041
see him fight.

45
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,958
You can hang back
for this one, guys.

46
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,875
I'll handle this fool on my own.

47
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,583
[KOYUKEN chuckles]

48
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,791
I'm Koyuken, one of the
four Shisei of Kuryu Island.

49
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:36,166
And you, Taikobo of Kongrong,
will die by my hand!

50
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,375
Whoa, hang on!

51
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,791
I've got a question first!

52
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,416
I've heard about you
and I even know

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,666
that you once fought Dakki!

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,541
Well she's my enemy too!

55
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,000
Wouldn't it make more
sense for us to join forces

56
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,291
and take her down together?

57
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,291
That's a lovely thought,
but you're also an enemy

58
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,208
of Master Bunchu, and right now,

59
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,708
that's the only thing
that matters.

60
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,375
Not to mention I'm having
too much fun to stop!

61
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,791
I haven't cut loose
like this in forever!

62
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,333
[TAIKOBO] Well, crap. I guess
he's not gonna back down.

63
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,333
[RI KOHO] Now why does Koyuken
get to have all the fun?

64
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,125
I want my turn to fight, too!

65
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,208
[TAIKOBO, SUPUSHAN gasp]

66
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,750
[TAIKOBO] At this rate,
we won't even have a chance

67
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,500
to fight back!

68
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,833
Koyuken's right.

69
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,958
He can easily take care
of these guys on his own.

70
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,208
Hey, Koyuken!

71
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,750
No reason for us
to stick around,

72
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,250
so Ri Koho and I are
gonna attack Seiki.

73
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,333
Just make sure that you
and Yoshin finish off

74
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,708
all of the others after Taikobo.

75
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,333
Wait, Seiki?

76
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,000
--You get all that?
--Of course.

77
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
[NATAKU]
I'll deal with those two.

78
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,625
He's clearly the
strongest of the group.

79
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,375
I can smell his power.

80
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,000
[TAIKOBO]
Chase after them!

81
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,625
Up, up, down, down, left,
right, left, right, B, A!

82
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,458
What are you talking about?

83
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,875
[KOYUKEN]
You're not going anywhere.

84
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,416
[BUKICHI yells]

85
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,000
Uh-oh!

86
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,791
Master Taikobo!

87
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,833
[RI KOHO]
I like this plan.

88
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,708
The only orders
Master Bunchu gave us

89
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,291
were to kill the Buseioh
and his clan,

90
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,875
but he never said anything
about not destroying Seiki.

91
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,708
You'd have to be an idiot
to not read between the lines.

92
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,291
Seiki's a major threat to Yin,

93
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,416
so we're helping Master Bunchu
by wiping it off the map.

94
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,583
You keep moving,
I've got this one.

95
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,916
[NATAKU]
Hold it.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm after the
strong one, not you.

97
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,208
I'm gonna make you
regret underestimating me.

98
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,708
[NATAKU]
Interesting.

99
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:56,166
I suppose I'll kill you first,
then go after him.

100
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,000
[YOZEN]
Stop right there.

101
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,125
I know you!

102
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,875
You're the genius Doshi, Yozen!

103
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,250
You came down to get
mixed up in this, too?

104
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,458
I recommend you
turn back now, Shisei.

105
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:20,083
What's the point of rushing
headfirst into your death?

106
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,458
Don't waste your thousand
years of training.

107
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,541
[KOYUKEN laughing]

108
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,416
That takes care of one of them.

109
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,291
Let's see what
the rest have to offer.

110
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,541
Kick his ass, Master!

111
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,750
[KOYUKEN]
How are you still alive?

112
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,125
[TAIKOBO laughs]
That's all your fault!

113
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,125
You essentially built me
my own escape route

114
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,583
with all that water you
threw down beneath me!

115
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,833
[laughing]

116
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,791
We can finally start
this fight for real now.

117
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,666
You're only gonna hurt
yourself if you try to use

118
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,291
that attack on me this close.

119
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,208
[KOYUKEN] Oh, you prefer
close-quarters combat?

120
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,375
Well, funny enough, I do too!

121
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,291
Ah! I can't get it off!

122
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,458
[SUPUSHAN gasps]

123
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,000
[BUNCHU] What have you
come here for, clown?

124
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,208
I have zero inclination
to fight you.

125
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,750
Really?

126
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,750
Nice to see you're aware of
your own limitations, Bunchu.

127
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,833
I can't help but admire a man
who understands his place.

128
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,291
But you see,

129
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,708
I'm actually here to let you
in on a little something.

130
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,375
Your Shisei assassins are
making a move to attack Seiki.

131
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,875
[BUNCHU]
Don't be absurd.

132
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,625
I gave them orders to kill
Hiko before he arrives there.

133
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,208
[SHINKOHYO]
I know that.

134
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,375
But Ohma has chosen to take the
battle to the skies over Seiki.

135
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,666
Civilians will die,
there's no doubt.

136
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,500
Figured that might
not sit right with you.

137
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,916
[BUNCHU] You'd better
be telling the truth.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,458
[TAIKOBO gurgling]

139
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,708
Fight, Master!

140
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,458
You're gonna look like an
idiot if you drown like this!

141
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,041
We're on dry land!

142
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,750
I'd kill for a
breath of fresh air!

143
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,666
No!

144
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,625
That's enough.

145
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,000
Time to jump in!

146
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,041
[BUKICHI yells]

147
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:33,916
[HIKO]
Tenka!

148
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,916
Uh... Y'know, Yoshin?

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,833
It's kind of in bad
form to kill humans

150
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,916
that aren't Sennin or Doshi.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,500
Not to say that I haven't.

152
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,083
No other choice.

153
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,166
Our paopei attacks are too
large-scale for this fight.

154
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,875
They work perfectly for
annihilating large armies,

155
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,083
but dealing with
targets this small?

156
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,083
It's too difficult to
single them out.

157
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,125
[OHMA]
Yozen. [chuckles]

158
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,791
If I defeat you, it'll make me
the most famous of the Shisei.

159
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,541
Not only that...

160
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,666
Master Bunchu will be even more
feared than he already is.

161
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,041
Listen, calm down.

162
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,250
If you came to fight,
let's do it elsewhere.

163
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,208
There's no reason for
us to risk the lives

164
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,583
of the people of Seiki.

165
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,625
I know you Shisei use rather
haphazard techniques.

166
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,708
[OHMA]
Hey, two birds with one stone.

167
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,500
[OHMA] I came here to
destroy Seiki, you fool!

168
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,250
Now go, Kaitenju!

169
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,458
Are you insane?

170
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,375
You see that mountain, Yozen?

171
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,708
Well you're falling next!

172
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,291
[CIVILIANS yelling]

173
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,333
[YOZEN] You just crossed a line
from which you can't walk back!

174
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,875
[OHMA]
I'm shaking.

175
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,666
Am I actually letting
this guy intimidate me?

176
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,208
[YOZEN]
If you're here to destroy Seiki,

177
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,583
I'll just have to put an end
to you before you can go

178
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,041
any further with it!

179
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,666
[OHMA] Yeah? You think you
can pull that one off, huh?

180
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,291
'Cause I can't wait
to see you try!

181
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,125
[OHMA]
I got him!

182
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,208
I killed the genius!

183
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,625
[YOZEN]
Or so it would seem.

184
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,708
The explosion?

185
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,166
That was just me
destroying your weapon.

186
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,291
[OHMA]
You're alive? Where are you?

187
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,875
[YOZEN] Much closer
than you want me to be.

188
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,750
I'm disguised as
one of your Kaitenju.

189
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,583
[OHMA]
You what?!

190
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,041
Don't give me that crap!

191
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,875
I can tell my Kaitenju are real!

192
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,541
They're connected
directly to my will!

193
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,916
[YOZEN]
I'm aware of that.

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,791
How else could I perfectly
transform into one?

195
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,333
This is my true power.

196
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,791
And how I earned my
"genius" reputation!

197
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,666
Fine, then!

198
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,041
I'll just have to launch
every one of them

199
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,291
and destroy you
and Seiki both!

200
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,625
[YOZEN]
Wrong move.

201
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,875
[OHMA yells]

202
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,208
[YOZEN]
I tried to warn you.

203
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,000
No...

204
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,708
[YOZEN]
Let it go.

205
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,583
[OHMA] I can't face Master
Bunchu if it ends like this.

206
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,125
[YOZEN] I must admit,
your tenacity is admirable,

207
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,291
but the smart move
here is to go home.

208
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,791
And that is the last
warning I'll give you.

209
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,250
Need... da beach...

210
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,625
Huh? What're you saying?

211
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,166
Are they your last words?

212
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,208
[TAIKOBO]
Beaches!

213
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,583
What beaches?

214
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,916
[TAIKOBO]
Da beach!

215
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,458
Hey, what's he up to?

216
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,250
[KOYUKEN]
Wha--?!

217
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,416
[KOYUKEN] How did he drink
all of that seawater?!

218
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,666
Behold my master's beloved,
top-secret item, the Sento!

219
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,291
Yep! This little peach here
converts any water into

220
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,416
top-shelf booze!
So thanks for that attack!

221
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,666
I got a nice little
buzz from it.

222
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,708
[hiccups]

223
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,291
[KOYUKEN]
Seriously? I can't believe 

224
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,208
you overpowered my technique
with a move that stupid!

225
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,208
[TAIKOBO laughing]

226
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,500
[TENKA] Just so you know,
I'm gonna end this quickly.

227
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,666
I'd rather not risk losing
someone that I care about.

228
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,708
In that case...

229
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,375
My power's a bit depleted.

230
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,291
Hey, Yoshin.

231
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,000
I could use some healing here.

232
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,416
[YOSHIN]
Hekichiju.

233
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,541
Share with me the
power of the earth.

234
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,541
[TAIKOBO gasps]

235
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,500
[KOYUKEN chuckles]

236
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,916
Now that's not fair!

237
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,333
[TENKA]
Taikobo!

238
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,916
I'll help you take
these guys down.

239
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,041
[TAIKOBO]
Thank you!

240
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,875
There's something wrong.

241
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,541
What am I feeling?

242
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,750
No...

243
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,833
Is that...?

244
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,375
He's here!

245
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,416
[YOZEN]
Wait!

246
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:03,625
It's like the air is
trembling with great power,

247
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,750
and worse, with immense fury.

248
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:09,750
[YOZEN]
Nataku!

249
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:10,916
[NATAKU]
Have we met?

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,583
We have to go.
Taikobo's in great danger.

251
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,625
[SUPUSHAN]
What's happening, Master?

252
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,458
[TAIKOBO]
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

253
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,750
But you can feel that pressure
building up in the air, right?

254
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,208
[SUPUSHAN] Yeah, it's so thick
I'm having trouble breathing!

255
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,333
[TAIKOBO] Is he already
jumping in the fight?

256
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,083
Not good. None of us are
prepared to take him on!

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,291
[OHMA]
Koyuken! Yoshin!

258
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,583
[KOYUKEN]
You're back!

259
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,666
Taikobo! Are you
all right down there?

260
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,791
Oh, hey, Yozen!

261
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,166
It's good to see ya again!

262
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,250
But let's catch up later.

263
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,458
[YOZEN]
Indeed.

264
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,708
I've never encountered
anyone that gave off

265
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,750
such an intimidating aura.

266
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,000
Whoever they are, they're
even stronger than I am.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,916
[GROUP yelling]

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,541
The hell is this?

269
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,041
[GROUP gasps]

270
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,250
[grunts]

271
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,541
[HIKO]
It's Bunchu!

272
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,750
[BUNCHU]
This is child's play.

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,083
You are the Doshi,
Taikobo, correct?

274
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,791
[SHINKOHYO chuckles]

275
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,500
You see, what'd I tell you?

276
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,833
Vastly more interesting
now, isn't it?

277
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,958
[SHINKOHYO]
Bunchu's paopei, Kinben,

278
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,916
is a simple
yet powerful tool.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,541
One that can attack enemies
a few kilometers away.

280
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,708
Which is precisely what
makes it such a challenge

281
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,000
to contend with.

282
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,666
Is this seriously
your idea of fun?

283
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,125
You need a new hobby.

284
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,625
[BUNCHU]
Tell me, Taikobo.

285
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,875
Why are you bent
on destroying Yin?

286
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,083
You're just as
reprehensible as Dakki.

287
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,500
Trying to manipulate the human
world with the power of Sennin

288
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,000
and Doshi.

289
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,041
[TAIKOBO]
You're wrong!

290
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm gathering allies
for one purpose,

291
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,583
and that's to finally expel
all the Sennin and Doshi

292
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,625
who serve Dakki from
the human world!

293
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,041
[BUNCHU]
You say that...

294
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,000
So then why are you trying
to destabilize the empire?

295
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,791
Defeating Dakki
and her underlings

296
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,250
should be more than enough!

297
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,708
I thought the same thing
and I wish it were true!

298
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,208
But the situation's just
not that simple anymore.

299
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,000
If things continue
down this path,

300
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,041
it's only inevitable that
the Four Lands will revolt.

301
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,625
And if a war breaks out?

302
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,958
The Sennin infesting Yin
will take countless lives.

303
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,666
You know that we're already
on the brink of a war.

304
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,958
After everything
they've been through,

305
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,666
the people want a new emperor.

306
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,166
They need one.

307
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,875
So the least I can do is to
get rid of the Sennin in Yin

308
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,875
before the war erupts!

309
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,291
[BUNCHU] The people will be
sated once the true problem

310
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,708
is solved:
when Dakki's been defeated!

311
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,125
[TAIKOBO]
It's too late!

312
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,708
Emperor Chu has already
lost the trust of the people.

313
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,083
Can't you see that?

314
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,416
It's not too late!

315
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,125
Nothing will stop Yin
from regaining its glory!

316
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,208
[HIKO yells]

317
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,250
Hiko!

318
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,375
You okay?

319
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,000
[HIKO]
Look. Bunchu.

320
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,416
You can't deny that the Emperor
is under Dakki's control.

321
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,791
But you choose to
remain loyal to his title.

322
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,750
Is that really enough
to justify this for you?

323
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,791
The country you love
has been corrupted.

324
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,750
Protecting Yin now is only
helping to destroy it!

325
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,875
Bunchu. Please come with us.

326
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,625
[BUNCHU]
Silence! You miserable traitor!

327
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,416
[TAIKOBO choking]

328
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,458
[BUNCHU]
I'll finish you!

329
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,666
[TENKA]
Stop right there!

330
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,750
Leave them alone,
Grand Preceptor!

331
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,250
I don't wanna fight you,
but I can't let you do this!

332
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,208
Grand Preceptor.

333
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,916
I hope that you'll forgive
me for my involvement.

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,958
We just cannot afford to lose
Taikobo at a time like this.

335
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,166
If you guys get out of my
way, I can take him myself.

336
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,500
Don't worry, Master,
I'll protect you!

337
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,625
[BUNCHU] Ha! It doesn't matter
how many of you there are.

338
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,541
Speak of ideals all you like.

339
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,041
None of you actually have
the resolve to back them up!

340
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,041
[TENKA grunts]

341
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,416
Resolve requires strength,
and you're weak!

342
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,458
Wow.

343
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,375
Bunchu is like
a force of nature.

344
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,083
[BUNCHU]
Shisei, finish off the living.

345
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,500
Yes, sir!

346
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,708
Hold on!

347
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,750
[TAIKOBO]
No, not yet.

348
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,750
I'm surprised you can move.

349
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,291
[TAIKOBO]
Nobody's dying.

350
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,250
I won't let you kill them.

351
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,500
I won't!

352
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,625
[YOZEN]
Taikobo.

353
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,791
He's almost dead and
he's protecting us

354
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,416
with a wall of wind.

355
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,833
[YOZEN] Honestly,
you really do amaze me.

356
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,291
Now I know... you are
someone I can trust

357
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,458
with my heart.

358
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,166
[BUNCHU] He can't conjure
such a large whirlwind for long.

359
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,416
But still...

360
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,916
[TAIKOBO grunts]

361
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,083
You're finally awake!

362
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,416
You're alive!

363
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,416
[SUPUSHAN]
Oh, I'm so relieved!

364
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,625
I was so scared
you wouldn't wake up!

365
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,416
I don't know what
I would've done! [crying]

366
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,708
It's okay.

367
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,875
Thanks, guys.

368
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,458
[KI SHO]
So, Taikobo.

369
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,833
Yozen told me all about
your encounter with Bunchu.

370
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,958
I'm glad you managed to survive.

371
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,500
[TAIKOBO]
Bunchu.

372
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,500
He was fighting for Yin with
every single ounce of his being.

373
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,750
I can only guess that
something happened in his past

374
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,333
to make him so
fanatically loyal.

375
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,000
His conviction
goes beyond reason.

376
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,583
But I have to ask myself...

377
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,208
Why am I fighting?

378
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,416
[TAIKOBO]
For the Kyo? Against death?

379
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,750
Opression. Isolation.

380
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,791
[OLD MAN 5A]
Do you hate them, Lord Ryo Bo?

381
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,583
And do you hunger for revenge?

382
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,333
Well, don't even bother.

383
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,958
Trust me, it's not
worth the effort.

384
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,833
Unless you can somehow
change the whole world,

385
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,500
this will keep happening
until the end of time.

386
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,750
[TAIKOBO]
I will change it.

387
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,916
I'll make a world
safe for humans.

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,333
A world free of
Sennin and Doshi.

389
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,166
[TAIKOBO coughs]

390
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,833
[BUNCHU] You used your paopei
until you coughed up blood?

391
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,833
Taikobo.

392
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,083
[TAIKOBO grunts]

393
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,375
[BUNCHU] I can't let Seiki
have one as great as you.

394
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,583
I don't remember
anything after that.

395
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,958
I see.

396
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,416
You should know.

397
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,833
We have made the decision
to officially declare war

398
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,041
upon Choka.

399
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,708
[SHUKOTAN]
You may be unaware of this,

400
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,458
but one of the
Shisei attacked Seiki.

401
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,416
Many lives were lost.

402
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,208
[KI SHO] They unleashed
an atrocity on us,

403
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,541
and we can't overlook it.

404
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,500
Even if we chose
to remain silent

405
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,291
and just look the other way,
the people will not!

406
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,833
[HIKO]
Forgive the intrusion.

407
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,375
But we'd like to join you in
this fight, if you'll have us.

408
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,000
[KI SHO] Yes!
We welcome you with open arms!

409
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,916
--[HIKO] We're all yours.
--[RYUU KAN] Yeah!

410
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,125
[KOH MEI]
Whatever we can do to help.

411
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,250
[SHUU KI]
Just let us know!

412
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,666
[OHMA]
Master Bunchu.

413
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,125
Not to question you,
but why did you let them live?

414
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,541
I was repaying the debt we owe.

415
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,125
Those people in Seiki.

416
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,166
They wouldn't have lost their
lives if not for our actions,

417
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,208
and there's nothing we
can do to fully atone

418
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,416
for that sin.

419
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,916
I shouldn't have acted
on my own impulses.

420
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,166
[BUNCHU] What's done is done
and there's no taking it back.

421
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,916
I'd better return to Choka now.

422
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,041
I'm certain things
are about to get busy.

423
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,458
What would you have us do?

424
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,833
Well, Shisei.

425
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,333
The approaching war will
be even more ruthless.

426
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,208
There's no doubt I'll call
upon you again, so heal.

427
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,916
Right! Yes, sir!

428
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,375
[BUNCHU]
He fights for Seiki,

429
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,166
and I for Choka.

430
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,291
We travel down opposite paths,

431
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,041
yet both will be
fraught with peril.

432
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,583
We'll meet again soon.
