I've been meaning
to speak with you.

The Sennin of Kingo pose
far too great of a threat.

a toll on the people of Shu.

If we're going to be

my pride talking,

You what, now?!

One of the primary goals of
the Hoshin Project was this.

00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,416
To create a safer
world for the humans

228

Defeating Kingo Island
wasn't part of the plan.

I want you and the
Juttenkun to assist me.

That sounded more like a
demand instead of a request.

Have you forgotten
that we Juttenkun

238

than you could ever be?

your services to Yin

317
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,875
so we can stack
this deck high.

318
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,083
We don't wanna let Yin
capitulate, now do we?

319
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,750
You want to save Yin.

320
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,791
Do you really expect
me to believe that?

321
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,208
Your goal has been
destroying Yin all along.

322
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,458
I'm well-versed in the many
secrets you keep hidden.

323
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,333
You left Kingo Island to
revel in the decadent life

324
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,041
of a vagrant Sennin.

325
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,833
Sure, Bunchu also migrated
from the Sennin world

326
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,708
to live alongside the humans,
but he still continues

327
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,500
to maintain his connection
with Kingo Island.

328
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,208
The exact opposite of you.

329
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,500
You've cut all ties.

330
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,000
Severed every one that
could tangle you up.

331
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,291
And then you established
your own dominion,

332
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,250
bringing half the Yokai
Sennin in under your rule.

333
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,291
Hell, you've claimed
the palace as your own.

334
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,458
And oddly enough, Tsuten
Kyoshu hasn't made a peep,

335
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,875
even though you stole
most of his followers.

336
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,708
Hold on, Tsuten Kyoshu?

337
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,958
Oh, silly me, I remember him.

338
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,750
[YOTENKUN] You have to
give credit to Bunchu.

339
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,541
That's one hell of a bold
plan he's come up with.

340
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,041
[CHOTENKUN] No one ever
said he was to be taken lightly.

341
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,583
[SONTENKUN]
So what do you think, Ohtenkun?

342
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,625
We going along with his plan?

343
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,041
Sure we are.

344
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:22,083
[crunching]

345
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,958
So we're all on the same page...

346
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,208
We're gonna let Bunchu
do whatever he wants

347
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,958
for the time being.

348
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,333
[SHINKOHYO chuckles]
Take it in while you can.

349
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,958
This country's history's about
to get drastically remolded

350
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,958
by the hands of Sennin.

351
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,500
Do you really want that?

352
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,291
Couldn't you put all
this turmoil to rest

353
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,916
just by defeating Dakki?

354
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,833
Sure, but I can't do that.

355
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,166
[KOKUTENKO]
And why not?

356
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,041
Oh, just because.

357
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,708
Besides, all of the
pieces are in place.

358
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,208
Both Kingo and Kongrong
have chosen to support Yin

359
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,541
and the Shu.

360
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,666
The coming war isn't a
possibility, but a fact.

361
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,208
[SUPUSHAN]
Hey, uh, Master...

362
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,500
You sure it's a good idea
to travel to Kingo Island

363
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,041
by ourselves?

364
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:15,000
Yep, it's the only way I can
properly propose a ceasefire.

365
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,041
Okay, but I'm
kind of freaking out.

366
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,041
I mean, what if they
just refuse to listen?

367
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,416
A-And then they might capture
us and torture us just for fun!

368
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,625
Oh, no, what if they skin us
alive and dip us in salt?!

369
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,750
Can you try to put
a lid on the neurosis?

370
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,250
[TAIKOBO gasps]

371
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:25,583
Wha--?

372
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,208
What the hell's going on?

373
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,166
[FUGEN]
Kingo Island.

374
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:33,916
It's moving.

375
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,416
Kongrong and Kingo.

376
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
This is it.

377
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,541
The battle is about to begin.

378
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,291
No turning back now.

379
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,083
This should be quite fun.
