Bo.

In order to
accomplish something,

3
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,625
a person has to
make a sacrifice.

4
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,833
And the bigger that outcome
is promised to be,

5
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,750
the more sacrifices it takes.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,125
[FUGEN] But... this doesn't mean
we're throwing our lives away.

7
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,750
We made up our minds to do this.

8
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,833
We don't need pity or sympathy.

9
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,291
Just...

Fugen.

12
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,083
You've always been so stubborn.

13
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,708
You're too quick to
sacrifice yourself.

14
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,583
[FUGEN]
I could say the same about you.

15
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,375
[TAIKOBO]
No you can't!

16
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,708
I don't go into any battle
without having some kind of

17
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,416
plan to survive!

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,791
[FUGEN]
Right.

19
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:44,083
[FUGEN] And I have a plan
for everyone to survive.

Thank you.

No!

Fugen's explosion is going
to destroy Kingo entirely!

We have to go, Taikobo!

Listen to him.

[SUPUSHAN]
I didn't realize I had.

00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,333
And I have no idea how I did it,

50
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,250
because only adults
of the Supu Clan

51
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,250
can pull of a
transformation like this.

52
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:47,125
Oh. Well then is it possible
that you used some kind of item?

53
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,291
[SUPUSHAN]
An item?

00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,791
How?

55
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,166
I don't have anything on me
except this blank piece of--

56

[gasps] Wait a minute!

57
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,541
This is the Certificate
of Adulthood you get

58
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,083
when you become an adult!

59
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,583
It's making sense.

60
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,083
The heat from the
Twelve Elite Sennin's

61
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,000
combined attack on Bunchu

62
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,833
must've made the
invisible ink appear!

63
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,333
Why would something so important
be written with invisible ink?

64
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,208
[TAIKOBO]
I knew it.

65
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,083
Huh?

66
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,625
All of it.

67
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,791
In the back of my mind, I knew
it would turn out like this.

68
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,208
It was obvious,
given Fugen's personality

69
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,875
and the position of
the rest of the Sennin.

70
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:26,000
I knew they were prepared to die
in their fight against Bunchu.

71
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,750
[TAIKOBO]
I took advantage of that--

72
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,208
of their selfless hearts.

73
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,041
[TAIKOBO] What a terrible
plan that turned out to be.

74
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,166
[YOZEN] But you didn't
plan for them to die.

75
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,000
And this isn't about failure.

76
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,291
The enemy was just much
stronger than we anticipated.

77
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,083
We needed to defeat Bunchu.

78
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,708
There was no way to
do this without them.

79
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,833
The problem is we
didn't defeat Bunchu.

80
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,916
He's not dead...

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,208
...and so the Twelve
Sennin can't rest.

82
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,541
That's impossible!

83
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,583
There's no way he could've
survived that explosion!

84
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,750
I know he wasn't
riding Kokukirin,

85
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,000
and it seemed like he took
the brunt of that attack.

86
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,625
[TAIKOBO] Look at the middle of
the fireball Fugen left behind.

[YOZEN gasps]

90
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,375
[SUPUSHAN]
That damned Bunchu disappeared!

91
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,750
Where'd he go?

92
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,666
My guess is he's heading
straight for Mount Kongrong

93
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,583
as we speak.

94
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,375
I doubt he knows we're
still alive down here,

95
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,833
so he's going to
the one location

96
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,250
that he's sure to find an enemy.

Taikobo, I would strongly
advise against going.

101

And it pains me to say this,

but if you go,
you'll only die in vain!

I probably won't survive.

00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,750
Even so, there's no
turning back at this point.

I gotta fight to win.

107

I won't back down no
matter what the cost!

What fools.

160
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,000
They barely had
any time left to live

161
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,208
and that was how they spent it.

162
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,708
[KOKUKIRIN]
Master Bunchu.

163
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,833
I happened to notice
you are still wounded

164
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,666
from the last battle.

165
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,750
I suppose it's no wonder
they were called

166
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,541
the Twelve Elite Sennin.

167
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,291
I had long forgotten what
physical pain felt like,

168
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,083
but those warriors
have reminded me.

169
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,541
[KOKUKIRIN]
I see.

170
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,041
But it appears that Taikobo
and Yozen are still alive.

171
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,125
What merit do we gain
by ignoring them

172
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,958
and defeating
Genshi Tenson first?

173
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,416
We're merely making the
best use of our time.

174
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,125
I know exactly where Genshi is

175
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,166
and we'd still have to
locate the others.

176
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,833
Besides, we're already here.

177
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,291
[BUNCHU]
You are Genshi Tenson,

178
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,958
the founder of Mount
Kongrong, correct?

179
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,125
Yes, that's me.

180
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,875
[BUNCHU]
Well then.

181
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,750
For the good of Yin,
I'll need to destroy you.

182
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,375
You are an ignorant fool,

183
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,083
believing you can
get away with anything

184
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,541
as long as it's
"for the good of Yin."

185
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,916
What you are doing is nothing
but senseless slaughter!

186
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,041
[BUNCHU] You have quite the
nerve to say that to me.

187
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,791
What of your charge Taikobo?

188
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,000
Are you not using him
in the same way?

189
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:25,875
Hypocrite.

190
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,625
You are behind this entire plot

191
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,333
to mercilessly destroy Yin
and give rise to Shu.

192
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,291
And because of this, you're the
one man I will not let escape.

193
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,541
[GENSHI grunts]

194
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,375
[GENSHI] You believe all
the terror you've caused

195
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,875
is for the good of Yin?

196
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,666
The only one you're
serving is yourself.

197
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,833
You've manipulated every aspect
of the Yin administration

198
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,958
to suit your own purposes.

199
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,708
You implanted your ideology
into the mind of the emperor

200
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,250
when he was just a boy.

201
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,708
That is to say,

202
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,916
you controlled him!

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,958
You took advantage of his
vulnerability at a young age

204
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,833
and dyed him in your own colors.

205
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,458
[GENSHI] Your focus is purely
on what you think benefits Yin.

206
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,500
But because that is all you see,

207
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,583
you have become a tyrant who
controls Yin from the shadows,

208
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,458
just like Dakki.

209
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,500
[GENSHI]
You hunger for domination

210
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,916
and a world where humans
live by your ideologies.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,125
That is the truth
of your blackened soul

212
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,166
and you can't deny it!

213
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,833
Ha! You don't hold
anything back, do you?

214
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,291
No matter how you
choose to spin it,

215
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,000
I remain true to my
vow to protect Yin!

216
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,208
Yes, my mission includes
the humans as well.

217
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,958
Before Dakki appeared, the
government of the human world

218
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,500
was copacetic, was it not?

219
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,500
I have the power to return
happiness to the human denizens

220
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,500
under the banner of my child--

221
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,833
the banner of Yin.

222
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,125
They'll have peace
for all eternity.

223
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,333
[GENSHI] And your command
will ensure this peace?

224
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:03,000
The people will live in
a prison of your creation.

225
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,958
[GENSHI] Losing one's freedom
does not bring about happiness

226
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,875
and it never will.

227

to waste your worry on me.

left to protect you all.

Be strong, Genshi.

We don't have any more
time to waste, Bunchu,

[GENSHI] Have you noticed that
Kinben's movements have stalled?

252
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,583
It's because the
gravity surrounding you

253

has been transmuted.

255

That paopei's familiar.

256
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,583
It's similar to the one
Fugen Shinjin used.

257
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,833
[GENSHI]
Naturally.

After all, It was I who
created Taikyoku Fuin.

259
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,791
[GENSHI]
But they are not the same.

260
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,458
This one is immeasurably
more powerful.

[BUNCHU groans]

262

[GENSHI]
It's no use.

263
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,250
I've restricted
Kinben's movements

264
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,458
by adding an additional
five Gs of force to it.

265
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,083

It's simple.

[GENSHI gasps]

[GENSHI]
You leave me no other choice

317
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,333
but to increase the output!

318
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,333
No, Genshi! You mustn't!

319
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,291
Your body wouldn't be
able to handle it.

320
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,875
It's not worth the risk!

321
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,750
[HAKUTSURU gasps]
What kind of risk do you mean?

322
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,375
[KOSHU] Master Genshi is using
the paopei on his forehead

323
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,750
to create a Hoshin
field for protection.

324
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,416
It's draining his strength.

325
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,125
That's the reason
he's been so cautious

326
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,333
throughout the fight thus far.

327
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:08,041
And so, if he increases the
output of his super paopei

328
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,041
on top of that--!

329
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,458
[GENSHI]
Listen well!

330
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:14,375
One who fears their own death
cannot defeat the enemy!

331
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,458
I am aware of the risks.

332
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,125
Prepare yourself, Bunchu!

[BUNCHU groans]

337
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,625
The gravity field is
becoming much too massive

338
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,750
and is now turning
into a black hole!

339
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,916
We must evacuate!

340

Master Genshi, no!

348
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,708
[KOSHU]
Everyone!

349
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,458
I need you to use all
you have to protect Genshi!

The gravity field disappeared!

355
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,125
You're right, Supu.
Looks like it's time.

356
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,750
Let's go, you guys!

357
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,041
That explosion had
a tremendous impact.

358
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,500
Hold on, Master Genshi.
We're coming.

359

[HAKUTSURU]
Master Genshi, please!

360
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,125
Come on! You have to wake up!

We've come to the end, Genshi.

You've made an
impressive effort.

Finally,

367
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,666
the long-awaited

for an emotional confrontation.
