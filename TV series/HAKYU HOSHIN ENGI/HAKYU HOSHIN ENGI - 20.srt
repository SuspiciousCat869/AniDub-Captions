Yes, I applaud your perception.

is Dakki's decision

to alter our hapless

Her magic is strong.

193

It's the lost power
of the Yin royal family.

What do you mean by that?

[SHINKOHYO]
I'm surprised I've never

196
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,000
told you this story, Kokutenko.

197
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:56,833
The first ruler of Yin, Emperor
Toh, was more like a god.

198
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,333
[SHINKOHYO]
In fact, his power exceeded that

199
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,333
of even the mightiest Sennin.

200
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,208
He used that power to
destroy the Xia Dynasty

201
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,791
and become the legendary
ruler who founded the Yin.

202

[panting]

203
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,250
[SHINKOHYO]
Emperor Chu looks as though

204
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,666
he's failed to live
up to that standard.

205
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,250
Yeah, I'm lost.

206
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,708
Not really following you on any
of this to be honest with ya.

207
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,833
Then perhaps it would help
if you knew the entire story.

208
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,833
Sure!

209
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,083
[SHINKOHYO]
About the history of Yin,

210
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,291
the relationship
between Yin and Dakki,

211
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:36,541
and how Dakki is connected
to the Signpost of History.

212
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,125
[SHINKOHYO]
The Signpost of History

213
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,583
gave powers to certain people
and made them create nations.

214
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,958
She also genetically
altered certain creatures.

215
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,291
[SHINKOHYO] The legends say she
transformed terrain as well.

216
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,666
It was all for the sole
purpose of shaping reality

217
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,458
exactly the way she wanted it.

218
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:10,041
And thus, we call her
the Signpost of History.

219
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,208
But what exactly is
the Signpost of History?

220
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,875
A Sennin?

221
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,625
[SHINKOHYO]
To answer that,

222
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,583
you should know that
she has another name--

223
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,291
Joka.

224
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,250
It all started long, long ago.

225
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,375
We would have to go back many
thousands of years into the past

226
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,291
to reach the beginning.

227
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,541
[SHINKOHYO]
This was during the time

228
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,791
before humans ruled the land.

229
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,291
[SHINKOHYO]
A group of beings,

230
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,375
unable to control
their immense powers,

231
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,416
lost their home world.

232
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,583
They came to this planet
because its environment

233
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,083
closely resembled
what they needed.

234
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,125
There was one who
possessed a great power

235
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,625
that was unrivaled among them.

236
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,083
This alien being... was Joka.

237
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,750
[JOKA] I will destroy
this planet to cleanse it,

238
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,416
immediately.

239
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,750
[ALL gasp]

240
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,500
[JOKA] Then I shall
sow it with the seeds

241
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,875
brought from our home world.

242
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,666
Joka decimated this world
and everything in it,

243
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,916
just as she promised.

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,750
And it wasn't just once.

245
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,375
It happened several times.

246
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,000
[SHINKOHYO]
Yes. Joka must have intended

247
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,500
to make this planet a copy
of the one she'd lost.

248
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:27,125
She wanted to make it
her second home.

249
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,375
It's quite likely there
was an age called Yin

250
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,666
in the place she'd left behind,

251
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,250
and possibly even Sennin
living there, too.

252
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,916
The existence of Mount
Kongrong and Kingo Island,

253
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,791
even the Great
Sennin World War--

254
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,250
These things may have
also existed and occurred

255
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,583
in her previous world.

256
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,625
And so, the world we live in now

257
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,833
is one that was hand-crafted
by the Signpost of History.

258
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:58,041
I've come to liken it to a
child building a sand castle.

259
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,458
[SHINKOHYO] That is how
Joka manipulated history

260
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,041
without being seen by anyone.

261
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:11,291
Well, almost anyone.
There was one exception.

262
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,291
Before the Yin Dynasty,
there was the Xia.

263
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,125
And Toh lived in
the Forbidden Palace

264
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,500
as more of a Xia bureaucrat.

265
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:23,583
One day, Joka chose him to
become the first Emperor of Yin.

266
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,750
Thereafter, he enjoyed a
life of luxury in the palace

267
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,791
with his beautiful
empress, Bakki.

268
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,500
We know her as Dakki.

269
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:38,166
This is where the relationship
between Joka and Dakki began.

270
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,708
[FUGEN]
Listen, everyone.

271
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,125
What is that?

272
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,166
I hear Fugen's voice.

273
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,208
[FUGEN] I'm communicating
by sending vibrations

directly to your eardrums.

275
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,333
Only the Twelve Elite
Sennin will hear.

276
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,958
I have instructions
for you from Bo.

277
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,500
Because the power reactor
was destroyed,

278
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,458
soon all the stars around
us will begin to fall.

279
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,000
We'll take advantage
of the chaos

280
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,583
to launch an all-out
attack on Bunchu.

281
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,000
We must coordinate our timing

282
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,041
and focus all our
attacks on him at once.

283
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,041
[FUGEN] That was the end
of his instructions.

284
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,583
However,

285
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,833
Bunchu could still manage to
find a way to dodge our assault.

321
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,125
Take this!

322
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,500
[gasps]

323
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,000
[DOTOKU] I want you to
give it to my pupil, Tenka,

324
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,541
so I need you to stay alive.

325
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,833
Counting on you.

326
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,833
[YOZEN]
I'll see it done.

327
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,416
Hey, Master!

328
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Let me go with you!

329
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,500
No, Bukichi.

330
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,333
You must stay here
and protect Bo.

331
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,583
[TAIKOBO gasps]

332
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,666
Fugen, don't you dare
make decisions for me.

333
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,791
I don't need a damn escort!

334
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,208
[YOZEN]
Taikobo, calm down.

335
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,541
[TAIKOBO]
Yozen?

336
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,541
[YOZEN] We need to leave
this to the Twelve Sennin.

337
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,916
[TAIKOBO]
Let go of me! I mean it!

338
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,166
I've got this!

339
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,333
[FUGEN]
I'm counting on you, Yozen.

340
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,000
[SEKI laughing]

341
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,375
[REIHOU]
For our home!

342
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,541
[KURYUSON]
For Kongrong!

343
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,750
In the name of...

344
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,583
...the Twelve Elite Sennin!

345
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,208
Ready, Bunchu?

346
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,666
[ALL]
We will defeat you!

347
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,958
Perhaps all of you
should fall one by one,

348
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,291
just like the Juttenkun.

349
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,541
[DOTOKU grunts]

350
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,000
[DOTOKU gasps]

351
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,250
[DOTOKU]
No!

352
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,041
[DOTOKU groans]

353
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,500
[TENKA groans]
I can't lose.

354
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,458
I refuse to give up.

355
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,041
[DOTOKU groans]

356
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,125
[TENKA]
I'll keep going.

357
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,166
I'll keep fighting!

358
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,166
[DOTOKU]
Tenka.

359
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,666
I did the best I could

360
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,000
to guide your competitive
spirit in a positive direction.

361
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,541
But now you must
walk your own path!

362
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,958
[TENKA]
Huh?

363
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,916
[DOTOKU yelling]

364
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,333
[DOTOKU]
Goodbye.

365
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,916
[TAIJO]
The level of your struggle

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,166
has no bearing on the outcome.

367
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,041
We won't know the true
outcome until we try.

368
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,541
[TAIKOBO gasps]

369
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,541
[TAIKOBO] We can't
fight him one-on-one!

370
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:37,125
Everybody! You gotta
attack him together!

371
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,416
Well, I suppose some things
will just never work out

372
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,583
the way you want them to.

373
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,166
I'm leaving the rest
to you, Fugen.

374
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,916
[FUGEN]
If you can hear this,

375
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,833
I have a suggestion.

376
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,750
It may be a cruel thing to ask.

377
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,458
[FUGEN]
I propose that we do not focus

378
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,541
all our attacks
on Bunchu at once,

379
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,791
but fight him individually.

380
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,291
[FUGEN] If we do not
face him in one big group,

381
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,708
we have a better chance of
breaking his concentration.

382
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,291
[FUGEN]
Yes.

383
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,083
What I'm asking...

384
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,750
...is for you to give your
lives to lure Bunchu in.

385
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,625
[FUGEN]
And then...

386
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,958
One more.

387
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:30,875
[BUNCHU gasps]

388
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,125
[FUGEN]
...I will strike last.

389
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,916
[TAIJO] There will be
endless battles and chaos.

390
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,833
In the end,
everything disappears,

391
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,500
leaving the world barren.

392
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,625
Is this worth your suffering?

393
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,041
[gasps]

394
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,625
Looks like it worked.

395
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,541
All without you noticing.

396
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,458
I focused on getting
close enough to you

397
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,291
so you wouldn't be able
to dodge my attack.

398
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,666
[TAIKOBO gasps]

399
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,041
[FUGEN]
Now then.

400
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,958
It seems we have
a score to settle.

401
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,250
[BUNCHU]
You fool.

402
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,208
What are you thinking?

403
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,458
[TAIKOBO] There is one
thing within our reach.

404
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,416
That's leaving the
next generation a world

405
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,500
that we treated with
compassion and respect.

406
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,333
[TAIKOBO gasping]

407
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,666
[FUGEN]
Bo.

408
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,958
In order to
accomplish something,

409
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,166
a person has to
make a sacrifice.

410
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,500
And the bigger that outcome
is promised to be,

411
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,541
the more sacrifices it takes.

412
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:35,625
[FUGEN] But... this doesn't mean
we're throwing our lives away.

413
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,500
[FUGEN]
We made up our minds to do this.

414
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,208
We don't need pity or sympathy.

415
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,583
[FUGEN]
Just...

416
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,458
[FUGEN]
...remember us.
