[TAIKOBO]
Chi!

4
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:56,916
[TAIKOBO]
Bunchu!

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,916
You and the Yin have
both grown decrepit!

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,708
The human world
needs a young wind.

7
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,250
That's its only hope.

8
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,208
So it's time for you to go!

9
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,458
[BUNCHU] If that's what you
believe, you're delusional!

10
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,958
I won't hand over the human
world to such a myopic brat!

11
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,541
You're just a naïve child!

12
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,375
[TAIKOBO yells]

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,083
[TAIKOBO]
Not good.

14
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,416
I'm almost out of
strength at this point!

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,750
Although, the same goes for him.

16
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,000
All right.

17
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:38,041
No matter what it costs me,
and no matter what I must do,

18
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,291
I have no option here
but to prevail!

19
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,750
Now, Bunchu! Let's finish this!

20
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,041
Fine with me.
Bring it, Taikobo!

21
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,041
[TAIKOBO]
Hello, Master Genshi Tenson.

22
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,375
Your number one pupil,
Taikobo, has arrived.

23
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,208
[GENSHI] Hmm. And how is my
top pupil's training going?

24
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,708
Oh. Uh, y'know,
it's going great.

25
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,583
[GENSHI]
Don't lie to me, you fool!

26
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,416
[TAIKOBO yells]

27
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,875
[GENSHI] You only pretend
to meditate, while in truth,

28
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,750
you're actually just sleeping!

29
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,333
There's no deceiving
these eyes of mine.

30
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,791
You're blessed with the rare
bone structure of a Sennin,

31
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,875
but you choose to goof off
instead of properly training.

32
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,875
With all due respect, Master.

33
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,666
I don't see the point in
training if we don't use it.

34
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,708
Dakki and her minions are
down there terrorizing

35
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,125
the human world.

36
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,083
And all we ever do is just
sit up here in the heavens

37
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,750
and train like there's nothing
we can be bothered with.

38
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,750
It's too depressing to train.

39
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,625
So I'd rather sleep
than worry about it.

40
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,083
[GENSHI]
You better not!

41
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,750
It has become more than
apparent that you are not suited

42
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,166
for our traditional
form of training.

43
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,791
[TAIKOBO]
What's with the scroll?

44
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,958
[GENSHI]
This scroll is the Hoshin List.

45
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,750
I have no intention of
letting Dakki and her minions

46
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,541
continue to wreak havoc
over the human world.

47
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,041
Some years ago,
we three Great Sennin

48
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,000
deliberated over a solution.

49
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,000
Of course, we must
certainly banish them

50
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,333
from the Human World,
but we must not allow them

51
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,833
to return to the
Sennin world either.

52
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,291
Our solution...

53
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,291
We created the world
of gods, a new dimension

54
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,333
between the Sennin
and human worlds.

55
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,625
And it is there that
we will seal them away.

56
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,958
That list contains the
names of those who must be

57
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,875
imprisoned there.

58
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,875
There are 365 Sennin on that
list and it is your duty

59
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,750
to defeat them all!

60
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,291
Wait!

61
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,625
Sennin and Doshi are forbidden
to take the life of another!

62
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,166
[HAKUTSURU] You won't be
doing any killing, Taikobo.

63
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,041
Please, give us some credit.

64
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,750
Take a look over there.

65
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,000
The tower you see before
you is called the Hoshindai.

66
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,916
Once an evil Sennin has been
defeated in the human world,

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,541
their souls are magnetically
drawn to the Hoshindai

68
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,666
and then immediately
trapped within.

69
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,875
Uh... How did I never
notice that before?

70
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,875
[GENSHI] If it were enough
for us to simply overthrow

71
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,375
and banish Dakki, we would
mount all of our forces

72
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,625
against her.

73
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,250
But if such a powerful
ruler were to be lost,

74
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,666
the humans would rebel
against the controlling Yin

75
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,958
and the world would
be thrown into chaos.

76
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,583
The chance for such calamity
must be avoided at any cost.

77
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,958
In other words, we'll need
to provide some stability

78
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,375
after Dakki's defeated.

79
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,625
[GENSHI]
Precisely.

80
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,625
To prevent the pervasive
spread of pandemonium,

81
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,208
we'll need to establish a
new king in the human world.

82
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,666
The most aptly suited candidate
would have to be Kisho,

83
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,916
the Seihakuko.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,833
But for Kisho to become king,

85
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,500
he will have to be
the one to defeat Dakki.

86
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,541
So you are to use your
knowledge to move forward

87
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,000
with the Hoshin Project
while ensuring that Kisho

88
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,375
achieves this goal.

89
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,000
And if you refuse...

90
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,750
...you will choose expulsion!

91
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,041
Wait, you'll kick me out?!

92
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,791
[HAKUTSURU] Do you think
Taikobo will accept the mission?

93
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,000
[GENSHI]
Yes. I'm certain that he will.

94
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,416
[HAKUTSURU]
Oh?

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,625
[GENSHI] He has his own
personal stake in the matter.

96
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,458
[VOICE 1A]
It was a ruthless manhunt.

97
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,375
[VOICE 1B] They said they
needed to bury the villagers

98
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,708
with the slain emperor
to be his attendants.

99
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,208
[VOICE 1A] They normally
only need five or six.

100
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,750
Why would they murder hundreds?

101
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,791
[VOICE 1C] It was the selfish
demand of the evil empress.

102
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,750
[TAIKOBO]
The Yin empress. She did this.

103
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,291
[GENSHI] The empress of the
Yin is an immortal Sennyo

104
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,875
who once lived in
the Sennin world

105
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,166
and now manipulates
mankind with the power

106
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,666
of her beguiling beauty.

107
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,166
[TAIKOBO]
Unbelievable!

108
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,458
[GENSHI] She descended to
the human world centuries ago

109
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,208
and has lived in the
Imperial palace ever since.

110
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,875
By changing her
name and appearance,

111
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,208
she has deceived
generations of emperors

112
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,166
while indulging in a life
of decadent profligacy.

113
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,083
[DAKKI] The death of our beloved
emperor demands extravagance.

114
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,416
He deserves hundreds of
attendants in the afterlife,

115
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,833
not just five.

116
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,916
We don't want the people
of Yin to rebel against us,

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,666
of course, so round
them up from other tribes.

118
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,125
Yes, Miss.

119
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,333
[GENSHI] Dakki seems
to have recently acquired

120
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,208
a dangerous new spell.

121
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,708
Such wicked power attained
through mere beauty

122
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,458
cannot be allowed to continue.

123
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,000
My name is Genshi,
and I have come to summon you.

124
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,666
It is your fate
to become a Sennin.

125
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,333
[TAIKOBO]
A Sennin?

126
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,291
My mother, father, brother,
and my little sister...

127
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,166
The empress killed them all!

128
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,000
If I become a Sennin, can I
punish her for her crimes?

129
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,041
[TAIKOBO]
I've made up my mind, Master.

130
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,125
I'll undertake
the Hoshin Project.

131
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,458
[GENSHI]
Good to hear.

132
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,583
In that case, you deserve
to carry this with you.

133
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,833
A paopei that
manipulates the air.

134
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,291
It's called Dashinben.

135
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,791
A paopei?

136
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,208
I've always wanted a
power amplifying weapon.

137
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,583
And now I've got one!

138
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,083
[GENSHI] And one more thing
to help you on your way.

139
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,333
[HAKUTSURU] This is Supushan,
your spirit beast.

140
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,875
He'll take you
wherever you need to go.

141
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,375
Really?

142
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,000
Hey, it's Taikobo, right?
As he said, my name's Supushan.

143
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,958
It's very nice to meet ya.

144
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,583
You too, buddy!

145
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,791
The Hoshin Project, huh?

146
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,333
Well that's good for a laugh.

147
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,916
I rule over more than
300 slavishly loyal

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,291
Sennin and Doshi,

149
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,958
and some novice Doshi
thinks he can overthrow me?

150
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,083
They don't seem to have
thought out this plan.

151
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,500
After all, the extent of your
power is only second to mine.

152
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,666
So, how will you handle him?

153
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,458
I've spent hundreds
of years perfecting

154
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:06,125
my Temptation spell and thus
obtained the highest status.

155
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,041
Why should I waste
my time entertaining

156
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,000
the ambitions of
one meager Doshi?

157
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,875
I can appreciate your disregard,

158
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,750
but I'd still like to give this
a go and test out his powers

159
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,666
just to be on the
safe side of things.

160
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,166
Lady Dakki just ordered
you to ignore him!

161
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,791
Do you intend to disobey her?

162
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,666
I am here as Lady Dakki's
guest, not a servant.

163
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,958
I warn you not to make
that mistake again.

164
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,458
He speaks the truth!

165
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,333
Well, while we're
on the subject,

166
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,375
I think I'll go ahead and
take my shot at Taikobo.

167
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,208
I'm itching to try out my
Raikoben here, after all.

168
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,541
[TAIKOBO] How much longer until
we reach the capital, Supu?

169
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,875
Still quite a ways.

170
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,791
This country's pretty
huge, y'know.

171
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,083
[TAIKOBO]
Hey, look.

172
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,625
There's a shepherd down there.

173
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,541
[TAIKOBO]
A nomad roaming the west.

174
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,333
He must be of the Kyo people.

175
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,250
Poor guy's clothes
are in tatters.

176
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,583
I'm kinda curious, Master.

177
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,291
Have you taken the time to
look over the Hoshin list yet?

178
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,708
Jeez. No.

179
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,541
Better read it before
we reach Choka.

180
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,916
[SUPUSHAN]
Not a bad idea.

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,791
[TAIKOBO]
First name up... Shinkohyo.

182
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,333
What? Did you say Shinkohyo?

183
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,875
This is bad!

184
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,916
They say he's stronger than the
Three Great Sennin combined!

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,958
He's the strongest Doshi, rides
the strongest spirit beast,

186
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,125
and he's even got Raikoben,
the strongest paopei!

187
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,208
What? Hold on!

188
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,791
They can't expect me
to fight him!

189
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:28,958
[SUPUSHAN]
Then don't do it!

190
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,041
Why wake up a
sleeping dog to kill you?

191
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,833
[TAIKOBO] Does this list go
from strongest to weakest

192
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,291
or something?

193
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,916
That's gotta be it, yeah,
let's see who's at the end.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,458
[TAIKOBO yells]

195
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,958
You must be Taikobo.

196
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,291
It's a pleasure to
meet you, truly.

197
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,666
I'm Shinkohyo, an imperial
guest of the empress.

[TAIKOBO]
Speak of the devil.

199

[SUPUSHAN]
Master Shinkohyo!

200
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,750
How can a person
of your great stature

201
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,750
align himself with Dakki?

202

[KOKUTENKO screeches]

203
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,916
Now, now, Kokutenko, calm down.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,833
It's not nice to make
murderous threats.

205
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,958
Despite how it appears,
I haven't taken anyone's side.

206
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,583
I only reside in the palace
due to my chronic predilection

207
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,250
for luxury and comfort.

208
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,666
Oh, great,
so you're not my enemy!

209
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,625
See ya!

210
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,000
[SHINKOHYO]
Don't leave! Wait!

211
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,333
My name has gotta be
on that list of yours, right?

212
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,666
So doesn't that mean you
have to defeat me in battle?

213
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,916
Listen, Shinkohyo.

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,166
There's something
you should hear.

215
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,791
Uh... Sure, what is it?

216
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,875
That outfit's tacky.
Where's your sense of style?

217
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,916
[SHINKOHYO]
Oh, Taikobo.

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,041
You've just dug your own grave.

219
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,041
Insulting my finely
cultivated sense of taste

220
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,375
is an open declaration of war!

221
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,333
It's not fair! Why me?
Why'd I have to get teamed up

222
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,458
with this
big-mouthed idiot Doshi?

223
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,291
[SHINKOHYO]

No! I'm gonna dodge it!

Stay put and close
your eyes, Supu!

Oh, that's the Raikoben!

227
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,000
[DAKKI SERVANT 1A]
Shinkohyo caused that?

228
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,125
[DAKKI]
Indeed he did.

229
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,750
You don't want to
get on his bad side,

230
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,375
but you couldn't ask
for a better ally.

231
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,250
The Sennin world won't attack
me as long as they fear him.

232
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,625
Believe it or not, I was
holding back on that one.

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,625
Scan the area, Kokutenko.

234
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,291
Let's see how Taikobo
fared in that encounter.

235
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,875
Use your clairvoyance
if you wouldn't mind.

236
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,541
[KOKUTENKO] Looks like
he fell to the earth with some

237
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,916
serious injuries.

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,125
He only managed to
avoid a painful death

239
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,791
by using his paopei
to distort the lightning.

Thank goodness
he's still alive.

Excellent news.

In the 5,000 years
of my existence,

243

this is the very first time
I've seen my own blood.

244
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:53,458
Taikobo's proven himself a
rival deserving of my attention.

245
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,333
He knew there was
a Kyo village behind him

246
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,208
and therefore chose
not to dodge.

247
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,541
Not only did he protect it,

248
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,958
he still managed
to strike back at me.

249
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,875
It would be a waste
to kill such a worthy Doshi.

I can't drop my guard
like that in the future.

Please rest in peace.

257

Sennin and Doshi treat this
world like their plaything,

suffering because of it.

Uh, Master...

Can we maybe
reconsider this plan?

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,208
Why not start small instead
of going straight for Dakki?

271
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,708
It's because
many of the people on this list

272
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,708
are under the sway
of Dakki's magic,

serving her against
their own will.

274

So if we defeat Dakki first,

00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,250
We of the Koh clan
have loyally served

312
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,708
the Yin Dynasty for generations.

313
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,541
It sickens me to watch
her feed off its ruin.

314
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,583
Well, you come find me
if you run into any trouble.

315
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,333
I'll do what I can to help.

316
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,666
Tell ya what.

317
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,541
I'll pull some strings
and set up an appointment

318
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,333
for you to meet
with the empress.

319
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,708
Wow, thank you, Hiko.

320
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,333
That's great!

321
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,833
[HIKO]
Later, then.

322
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,291
Hmm. I dunno.

323
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,916
You sure we can trust this guy?

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,625
Yeah, I think we can.

325
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,041
He strikes me as a man
of great character.

326
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,125
Supu, what's wrong with you?

327
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,500
I didn't expect her
to be this beautiful.

328
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,083
I'd wake up from death just
to catch a glimpse of her!

329
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,291
[TAIKOBO]
Seriously?!

330
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,375
Hiko recommended you to us.

331
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,375
He said that you wish
to work for the palace?

332
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,458
Yes, your highness.

333
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,333
Well, Dakki. What do you think?

334
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,583
[DAKKI] Sounds like a
splendid idea to me!

335
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,958
So tell me.

336
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,291
Did you have any particular
work in mind, Taikobo?

337
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,833
If possible, I'd like
to be a court musician.

338
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,833
I believe that
could be arranged.

339
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,458
[TAIKOBO]
By the way, Emperor Chu.

340
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,458
If you need me to
prove my credentials,

341
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,083
I'm holding a grand party
tomorrow in the western capital

342
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:56,041
of Shugen, with over
300 beautiful women.

343
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,291
Really? Count me in!

344
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,333
But won't it take us
several days to travel

345
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,875
all the way to Shugen from here?

346
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,291
[TAIKOBO]
For most it may,

347
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,791
but it's no more than a quick
leap with my Supushan.

348
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:06,875
[CHU]
Brilliant!

349
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,791
I didn't consider
your flying beast.

350
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,583
[TAIKOBO]
Here, hop on behind me.

351
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,166
Consider me your personal
chauffeur for the next few days.

352
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,958
[DAKKI] Oh, that does sound
like fun, I'd love to go!

353
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,541
My, you look awfully
nervous all of a sudden.

354
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,291
Oh, no, please don't tell me.

355
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,000
This party's nothing
but a clever ruse

356
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,416
and you're plotting to kidnap
Emperor Chu, aren't you?

357
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,583
What? Seize him!

358
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,541
[TAIKOBO]
C'mon, Supu!

359
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,541
Oh, no. Dakki's Temptation!

360
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,791
Good boy.

361
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,541
Please, no...

362
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,791
I just can't resist.

363
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,291
Oh, Supu...

365
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,333
[GUARD 1A]
Go on and take a look.

366
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,791
[SNAKE 1A hisses]

367
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,083
[DAKKI chuckles]
Behold the Taibon!

368
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,750
He's still under her spell.

369
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,208
[DAKKI] Let's kick things off
by executing these poor devils.

370
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,500
Empress, wait.

371
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,041
Who are these people?

372
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,333
Oh, just a bunch of Kyo
we were using as slaves.

373
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,833
Taikobo here hails
from the Kyo clan.

374
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,125
Which means I can't
trust any of them.

375
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,041
So into the Taibon they go!

376
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,250
Stop it, Dakki!

377
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,041
I'm the only one who
should be punished here!

378
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,500
[DAKKI]
Not listening!

379
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,250
Sorry, but I'm ready to get
this Taibon party started!

380
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,416
Go, run for your lives!

381
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,666
Don't pretend that you care.

382
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,208
It's your fault!

383
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,041
You picked a fight with them
and you're completely powerless.

384
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,875
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

385
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,708
There's no way
I'm dyin' like this!

386
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,333
I say we fight back!

Now's my chance!

00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,291
[DAKKI]
Don't you get any funny ideas.

394
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,166
Surely you haven't forgotten
that your little sister

395
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,916
is my captive, have you?

[SLAVES yelling]

397
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,083
[HIKO] I threw your clothes in
the snake pit when we escaped.

398
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,416
Far as they know, you're dead.

399

She massacred all
of those innocent Kyo.

400
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,000
Why did you save my life?

401
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,208
Those people are dead
because of my mistake.

402
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,625
[HIKO]
Listen, Taikobo.

403
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,625
I had this feeling
when I met you

404
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,625
that you can actually
do some good.

405
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,916
I didn't rescue
you for your sake.

406
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,208
I saved your life for
the sake of this world.

407
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,083
You need to stay alive.

408
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,875
There's no room for weakness.

409
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,250
Then I'll have to remain strong.

410
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,666
[TAIKOBO]
I've already lost so much

411
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,583
in such a small
amount of time.

412
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,625
[TAIKOBO]
Oh, nice!

413
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,875
I caught a big one!

414
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,416
It's a speckled trout.

415
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,791
[FUGEN]
C'mon, Bo.

416
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,458
You shouldn't catch fish
when you're not even allowed

417
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,416
to eat them.

418
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,375
Yeah, I know that!
Here, look!

419
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,416
Catch and release!

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,708
Actually...
I've got a gift for you.

421
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,541
It's a fishing hook
of my own design.

422
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,333
What?
That won't catch anything!

423
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,708
You only go fishing when
you need to clear your mind.

424
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,208
It helps you think, right?

425
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,583
Don't you feel bad hurting
the fish just so you can focus?

426
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,291
Seems a little unfair.

427
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,166
You'll do just about anything
to avoid conflict, huh?

428
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,625
I could say the same
for you, y'know.

429
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,958
Although...

430
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,708
I can't shake the feeling
you'll devote yourself

431
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,583
to combat someday.

432
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,916
You do have a shining blade

after all.

But when that day comes,

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,458
I promise I'll be
right beside you.

436
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,333
The least I can do
is offer you that.

[TAIKOBO] Fugen, you were
right about everything,

but I don't want to hurt anyone.

I wish I could create a
safe world without fighting.

possible to avoid it?

You've disappointed me.

on smiling in that way?

You're up.
So we better get moving.

I did a lot of thinking
while you were sleeping off

Dakki's spell.

There's no way I can
defeat her on my own.

456
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,791
So it's time to
find some allies.

457
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:14,708
[SUPUSHAN]
Partners?

458
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,125
Exactly.

We'll gather up enough new

have we been here now?

[KOKUKIRIN]
I don't understand.

462

You could easily quell

[BUNCHU]
Well, Kokukirin.

466
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,916
When fighting humans,
it's only proper to face them

467

as human. However...

00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,416
It's a different matter
when you're facing

469
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,958
Sennin and Doshi.

470
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,458
As long as there's
life in my body,

471
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,500
no man or god will bring harm
to Emperor Chu or the Yin.
