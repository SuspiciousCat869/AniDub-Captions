1
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,041
[BUNCHU] You're rather
persistent for someone

2
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,166
on the verge of death, Buseioh.

3
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,041
[HIKO chuckles]
That goes for you, too.

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,708
[BUNCHU] I have no
desire to take your life

5
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,125
with my own hands.

6
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,625
I'd prefer a dignified battle
between our armies

7
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,708
after we've returned
to the human world.

8
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,291
I'm giving you
the chance to leave.

9
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,125
Shut up, already.

10
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,625
I'm not leaving here until
I've cracked your face open

11
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:58,708
with my fist.

12
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,000
Is that so?

13
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,250
Well, I tried.

14
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,750
[BUNCHU]
You leave me no choice.

15
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,791
[thunder rumbles]

16
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,250
[BOTH grunt]

17
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,958
Hiko.

18
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,583
I understand.

19
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:36,041
The true thing I've always
been drawn to protect.

20
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,875
I know what it is now.

21
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:27,500
[SUPUSHAN] Is this really the
time to be lounging around?

22
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,500
We've seen firsthand
how powerful Dakki is.

23
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,500
As things stand, I'm clearly
not ready to take her on yet.

24
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,083
Which is why we
need to start gathering up

25
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,458
those allies you were talking
about and build an army!

26
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,791
We could do that,
or we could just sit here

27
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,666
on this rock until we
catch us a big ol' fish.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,791
[SUPUSHAN] He's still shaken up
from our last run-in with Dakki.

29
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,416
[HIKO]
What did you say? Bunchu?

30
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,791
[MESSENGER 2A]
Yes, sir.

31
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,416
We've received word that
he's suppressed the uprising

32
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,958
in Hokkai.

33
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,416
I see.

34
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,583
So... When can we expect
his return to Choka?

35
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,583
[BUNCHU]
You can expect me now.

36
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,250
You've put some years
on your face, old friend.

37
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,666
[HIKO]
Oh, come on.

38
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,583
Is that really the first
thing you're gonna say to me?

39
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:33,416
Better than being some eternally
baby-faced Doshi who never ages.

40
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,500
[BUNCHU] Well, age hasn't
dulled our edges.

41
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,541
That much is clear.

42
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,083
Thanks for holding the empire
together while I was gone.

43
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,041
I can't pretend it was easy.

44
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,041
Not with that shrew
trying to run the show.

45
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,708
[BUNCHU]
Twenty years I've known him.

46
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,500
[MOTHER SPIRIT BEAST 2A] You'll
pay for your crime, humans!

47
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,875
I'll raze this city
and slaughter you all!

48
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,625
That's enough!

49
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,666
[BUNCHU] No vermin threatens
Yin under my watch.

50
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,458
[BUNCHU]
You'll die for this!

51
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,208
The hell's wrong
with you, jackass?

52
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,333
Do you always kill first
and ask questions later?

53
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,958
Who the hell do
you think you are?

54
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,041
I don't owe an introduction
to a savage hothead.

55
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,791
[HIKO]
There, go on.

56

[BABY SPIRIT BEAST 2A]
Mama!

57
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,916
[MOTHER SPIRIT BEAST 2A]
Oh! My little girl!

58
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,000
[HIKO]
Some heartless punks from Choka

59
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,666
stole that spirit beast's
baby away from her.

60
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,291
Pretty good reason for her
to be so pissed off.

61
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,500
There's more than just
brute strength that's required

62
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,500
of a Grand Preceptor.

63
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,250
Try to keep that
in mind, will ya?

64
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,833
Wait, aren't you--

65
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,041
You've arrived at last,
Koh Hiko!

66
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,291
I expect you'll fully
devote yourself to Yin.

67
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,416
[HIKO]
I will.

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,041
Grand Preceptor. Hey.

69
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,208
[BUNCHU]
And before I knew it,

70
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:20,166
he became an ally I would
trust with my own life.

71
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,583
A true friend.

72
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,041
[LI SEI]
Help! Somebody help me!

00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,250
My son's trying to kill me!

He's found me! That's my son!

Nataku! He's a human paopei!

76
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,250
[TAIKOBO]
That guy's a paopei?

77
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,875
Well I guess that would explain
how he can so effortlessly

78
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,291
wield three at once.

79
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,208
[LI SEI]
No! Please don't!

80
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,458
[TAIKOBO]
That paopei...

00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,250
I know it!

[BUNCHU] I see much has
changed, Your Majesty.

85
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,583
Or perhaps not.

86
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,541
In fact, I recall another
mysterious vixen

87
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,500
who once held sway
over the court.

88

This was about 60 years ago,
during Taitei's rule.

[BUNCHU]
Your reign ends here, snake.

You've brought
enough suffering to Yin,

and now you'll burn for it!

92
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,375
[BUNCHU]
Now that I've returned to Choka,

your deception is exposed.

I'll oust that beast.

00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,166
Well I'm just utterly dying
to see you try, Bunchu.

I welcome you both to Chintokan.

00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,250
My name is Li Sei and I'm
the commanding officer here.

120
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,750
I actually once trained with
the Sennin at Kongrong Mountain.

121
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,250
Nataku is--well, my son is
an artificial human

You're home.

Welcome back, my love.

125
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,541
[LI SEI]
Ah, perfect time, dear.

126
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,666
Let me introduce you
to my wife, Inshi.

127
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,250
Hello. Nice to meet you.

128
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,083
You were telling me
about Nataku?

129
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,916
[LI SEI] Well, it all began
about ten years ago.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,916
At that time, my wife
had been pregnant

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,208
for close to three
and a half years.

132
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,458
Which is unusual,
to say the least.

133
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,833
Don't you worry, dear.

134
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,708
I'm sure our child will be
a healthy ball of love.

135
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,916
I couldn't bear to
tell her the truth.

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,666
That deep within,
I harbored the fear

137
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,041
she would give birth
to a monster.

138
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,625
Then one day, she told me
of a dream she'd had

139
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,250
the night before.

140
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,041
[INSHI]
What is this? Who are you?

141
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,458
[TAIITSU]
I'm sorry, Madam Li,

142
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,958
but the child you're carrying
is mortally malformed.

143
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,416
However, you may
still give life to the baby

144
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,375
if you choose to accept this.

145
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,666
The paopei. Reiju.

146
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,125
[LI SEI] And when she
did finally give birth,

147
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,916
it was to a horrifying egg-like
ball of twisted flesh.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,666
[LI SEI]
She must never know of this.

149
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,666
I can't let her
see this monster!

150
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,541
The inhuman child that
burst forth from the mass

151
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,041
was born into our world
with paopei attached

152
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,375
to his body.

153
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,250
Despite his true nature,
my wife never failed

154
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:14,333
to treat Nataku with anything
but the love of a mother.

155
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,541
--Eat up, now!
--It's good.

156
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,291
Time to study.

157
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,208
--One plus two is?
--Three.

158
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,875
Oh, my perfect boy!

159
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,125
[BUNCHU] Demolish the Horaku
and fill in the Taibon!

160
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,500
[CROWD]
Yes, sir!

161
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,541
Distribute food to the people!

162
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,458
I assume you're hoping to
reverse the many evil deeds

163
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,916
Dakki has committed?

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
As the Grand Preceptor,
I'm only doing what's right

165
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,958
for the empire.

166
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,666
You truly baffle me, y'know.

167
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,666
I'll never understand why this
empire is so important to you.

168
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,625
This empire.

169
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,416
Well, Yin is very much
like a child to me.

170
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,583
[BUNCHU] You wouldn't expect
that from me, would you?

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,333
[SHINKOHYO]
No.

172
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,875
But it does explain this mortal
attachment you have

173
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,583
to Yin, Bunchu.

174
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,791
I think I can handle this.

175
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,375
I just need to help them put
an end to this familial spat.

176
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,666
That's all there is to it.

177
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,708
It's just that easy, huh?

178
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,375
If we can make Nataku our ally,

179
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,750
that alone would give us the
strength of a thousand men.

180
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,875
Our best chance for that
is to smooth things over

181
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,125
so he feels like he owes us one.

182
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,250
[INSHI]
Nataku!

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,250
Nataku!

184
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,458
I've chosen to offer my
protection to your father,

185
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,500
Li Sei!

186
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,250
If you really wanna
see him dead,

187
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,875
well, I hope that you're
ready to kill me first!

188
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,625
Are you nuts?!
Of course he's ready!

189
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,000
Pull it together, Supu.

190
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,250
If you're telling me you're
too scared to even fly,

191
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,708
then you're no more
than a hippo.

192
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,833
[SUPUSHAN]
A hippo?!

193
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,166
[SUPUSHAN]
All right, let's do this!

194
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,375
[TAIKOBO]
Atta boy!

195
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,583
[INSHI]
Please, Taikobo!

196
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,416
Try not to hurt my son.

197
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,708
Of course.

198
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,375
Trust me, I want this
to end peacefully too.

199
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,583
Ready when you are.

200
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,291
[TAIKOBO yells]
Chi!

201
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,208
You stopped its trajectory!

202
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,666
[chuckles]

203
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,750
That's definitely the
face of a man born to fight.

204
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,000
Get ready to dodge!

205
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,625
[TAIKOBO]
I'll admit he's strong.

206
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,541
Yeah, sorry, but I don't
think you're evenly matched

207
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,083
on strength.

208
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,833
Thanks, but I was able to make
that observation on my own.

209
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,833
Somethin' wrong, Nataku?

210
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,250
What, can't you hit me
from that far away?

211
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,458
So he has to fly after the
paopei he shoots to catch them?

212
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,250
[INSHI, LI SEI gasp]

213
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,583
Mother, no!

214
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,250
Whoa, what just happened there?

215
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,875
The Kenkonken is a type of
paopei that uses copper rings

216
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,750
to make direct physical attacks.

217
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,791
I can't stop them when
he fires both at once,

218
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,375
but I am capable of easily
changing their trajectory.

219
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,458
Well that was
certainly a close call.

220
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,541
[TAIKOBO]
Dafuba!

221
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,541
Nataku, no!

222
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,708
What's the matter?

223
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,333
Having second thoughts
about using the Kenkonken?

224
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,125
Hey, you're welcome to do so,

225
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,708
but I'll just change
its direction again

226
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,125
and who knows
where it'll end up.

227
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,125
Why are you interfering?

228
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,666
My fight is with Li Sei.

229
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,541
Our quarrel has nothing
to do with you.

230
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,916
All right. I've gotta ask.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,625
Why is it that you
despise Li Sei?

232
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,750
It's because
Li Sei despised me first.

233
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,166
And I get it.

234
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,833
I was born bearing the weapons
of a Sennin, after all.

235
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,958
So I can understand why he
can't consider me his son.

236
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,291
And I've caused my
mother trouble as well.

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,500
Is that all?

238
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,333
I feel like there's a part of
the story you're not telling me.

239
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,666
[INSHI]
There is.

240
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,416
It happened three years ago,
on a very humid day.

241
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,625
We had gone to swim
in a certain river,

242
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,583
even though it was prohibited.

243
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,250
Nataku enraged the spirit
beast that ruled the river.

244
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,083
[SPIRIT BEAST 2A] What fool
dares to wear a paopei

245
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,458
in the waters of my river?

246
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,666
Don't you realize that
your paopei sends out

247
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,750
shockwaves through the current?

248
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,333
Your carelessness has caused
a needless massacre

249
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,375
amongst my disciples!

Please forgive him!

251
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,833
My Nataku is no more
than a child!

252
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,041
I beg you!

253
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,916
[SPIRIT BEAST 2A]
I demand penance!

254
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,958
You will both be executed!

255
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,916
Nataku...

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,166
[NATAKU]
I had to.

257
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,250
I couldn't just stand by and
let him kill you, Mother.

258
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,583
[INSHI]
It was my fault.

259
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,166
He was only trying
to protect me.

260
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,916
A few days afterward,
the King of the Spirit Beasts

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,416
descended upon us.

262
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,875
[SPIRIT BEAST KING 2A] Which
one of you murdered my son?

263
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,541
Reveal yourself!

264
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,833
I shoulder the sins of my son!

265
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,916
And I will accept
your punishment!

266
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,958
[INSHI] And before I could
realize, he protected me again.

267
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,708
I'm sorry, Mother.

268
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,333
I'll now return this
body back to you.

269
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,208
[NATAKU]
I should have died right then.

270
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:50,333
But the true essence of my
being continued to survive.

271
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,083
I became a creature
of pure consciousness.

272
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,250
My mother only saw my dead body,

273
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,583
so she built a glorious
tomb for me.

274
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,250
And that was enough
to satisfy my soul.

275
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,416
But then...

276
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,000
How dare she have a
tomb like this built

277
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,000
without telling me about it?

278
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,208
The Spirit Beast King will
murder us if he discovers it!

279
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,791
[NATAKU] At that point,
a Sennin appeared before me.

280
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,666
I'm Taiitsu Shinjin
of Kongrong Mountain.

281
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,125
And you, child?

282
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,291
It is nowhere near
time for you to die.

283
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,833
You will be reincarnated
as a lotus.

284
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,416
[NATAKU] This Sennin has
chosen to keep me alive

285
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,333
for some reason.

286
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:35,000
I can't say why,
but I do know one thing.

287
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,833
I know that I can
never forgive Li Sei

288
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,958
for what he's done to me.

289
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,583
The body born from
my mother has died.

290
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,791
Which means I am no
longer related to Li Sei.

291
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,291
[TAIKOBO]
Well now I know!

292
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,833
Hearing your side of the story
definitely changes things.

293
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,375
Y'know what?

294
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,500
My mind is changed.

295
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,291
I'm 100 percent
on your side now.

296
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,916
So. Hurry up and kill your idiot
father and let's call it a day.

297
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,166
[SUPUSHAN, LI SEI, INSHI]
What?!

298
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,875
[SUPUSHAN]
What's wrong with you, Master?

299
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,791
Did you change
your mind or lose it?

300
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,333
Well, what're you waiting for?

301
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,916
[TAIKOBO]
You can't do it, huh?

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,250
I mean with your power, you
should've been able to kill him

303
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,583
long before
I even showed up.

304
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,583
No, he's very skilled
at running away!

305
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,708
Really? C'mon already.

306
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,625
The truth is, you don't hate
him as much as you want to.

307
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,875
[NATAKU]
You're wrong!

308
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,750
I loathe him with all my being!

00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,083
Oh, please, no...

00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,708
Time to say thank you.

312

I just saved both your
parents' lives for you.

313
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,041
And you wanna know why I did it?

314
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,083
I saved them 'cuz
I'm on your side.

You're wrong. You're wrong.

316
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,250
You're wrong! You're wrong!
You're wrong! You're wrong!

317
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,416
That's enough, Nataku.

318
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,666
Are you really
gonna keep this up?

319
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,791
The power of a paopei
is weakened when anger

320
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,041
dilutes your focus.

321
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,750
You don't stand a chance
of beating me right now!

322
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,291
[INSHI]
Wait!

323
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,583
Nataku, you have to stop this.

324
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,000
If I were to lose you again,

325
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,833
or if I lost your father...

326
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,583
I would die from a broken heart.

327
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,833
[NATAKU]
I've lost.

328
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,000
[NATAKU] I don't even understand
what I mean to those two.

329
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,375
I'm just a paopei.

330
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,250
After being reborn,
I'm not even related to them.

331
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:07,833
But still, my mother has asked
me to spare Li Sei's life,

332
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,333
so I won't kill him.

333
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,583
Good.

334
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,833
I think you're making
the right call on that.

335
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:16,500
And whatever your body is now,
it honestly doesn't matter.

336
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,375
The three of you are still
a family and nothing

337
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,625
will change that.

338
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,958
[clapping]

339
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,166
[TAIKOBO]
What the hell?

340
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,750
[BUNCHU]
A rebellion?

341
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,416
Led by the Eastern Prince?

342
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,291
Indeed.

343
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,250
I ordered the execution of the
former Eastern Prince, Kanso.

344
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,916
After that task was carried out,
his younger sister

345
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,458
and my last wife killed herself.

346
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,833
It's only natural that
his successor, Kyo Bunkan,

347
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,250
would seek vengeance.

348
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,000
And so we shall respond.

349
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,916
I want one of you to lead
an army of 50,000 soldiers

350
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,625
to persuade the Prince
to remain loyal.

351
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,125
[BUNCHU]
Hiko.

352
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,541
That cunning fox has devised
this scheme to send me away.

353
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,583
It's precisely why she
had the Prince executed.

354
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,208
You think so?

355
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,458
Devious wretch.

356
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,458
Her intellect is a far
greater weapon

357
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,375
than her temptation spell.

358
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,125
[TAIITSU]
Impressively done, Bo!

359
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,958
You put that little quarrel
to bed quite easily.

360
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,291
I remember you.

361
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,125
Taiitsu Shinjin!

362
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,708
As the creator of Nataku,

363
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,541
I did feel obligated
to intervene myself.

364
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,166
But y'know, I've gotta say I
never would've even considered

365
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,791
stooping so low as to
use his mother as a shield.

366
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,083
I haven't seen you in forever
and that's the first thing

367
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,166
you say to me?

368
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,208
[TAIITSU]
Yeah, that's right.

369
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,125
It's been, what?
Three hundred years?

370
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,333
Well, nice to see you.

371
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,833
So, Nataku.

372
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,833
It's rather apparent that
mentally, you are still a child.

373
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,875
Seems best to have you train
under me in the Sennin world.

374
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,083
Why the hell should
I do what you say?

375
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,041
Convince me.

376
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,625
Piss and vinegar.

377
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,750
All right, then.

378
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,333
[SUPUSHAN gasps]

379
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,583
It's been a while since
I've seen a capturing paopei.

380
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,208
So, uh, Taikobo.

381
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,000
Would you mind if Supushan
gave me a ride down from here?

382
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,583
I climbed up to
make a cool entrance

383
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,166
but I'm scared to climb down.

384
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,333
[NATAKU]
Hey! Let me out!

385
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
You don't need to
worry about Nataku,

386
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,000
I promise I'll take care of him.

387
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,875
I'm sure that you will,
great Sennin.

388
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:27,000
It hurts to lose him, but we
must part ways for now.

389
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,125
Taikobo, once Nataku
has completed his training,

390
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,375
he'll return to the human world
to work as your right hand.

391
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,708
But I don't intend to rush
his training just for you.

392
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,208
[LI SEI] Maybe I should
return to the Sennin world

393
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,750
to complete my training.

394
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,916
I am his father after all; I
can't just let my son beat me.

395
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,125
Next time around, I'll get him.

396
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,208
Sure.

397
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,041
You believe what you need to.

398
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,166
[BUNCHU]
Your Majesty.

399
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,875
I've already quelled
the rebellion.

400
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:44,250
Bunchu. I have dispiriting news.

401

You're saying Hiko
betrayed Choka?
