My name is Oh Eki.

I am one of the progenitors.

101

[GENSHI] Joka, the

Such a being actually exists?

103
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,625
[OH EKI] I remained behind,
as last progenitor,

104
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:43,041
so I could stop Joka
from causing ruin.

lack the strength to
defeat her on my own,

ask for your assistance.

You said Joka has destroyed
the world many times, yeah?

So why didn't you defeat
her sooner, in the past?

112
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,833
[OH EKI] Joka's physical
body has been sealed

113
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,041
and she can only move
and act as a spirit.

114
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,291
Because she has exhausted
so much energy in that form,

115
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:21,791
the wisp of her existence
has grown weak, vulnerable.

116
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,375
On the other hand, due to
her repeated annihilations,

117
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,500
this planet's lifeforms
have evolved into stronger,

more resilient beings.

119
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,500
I have been forced to stand by
and wait for Joka to grow weak,

120
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,166
while the rest of you
grew stronger.

that's fair?!

[OH EKI] Fairness doesn't
enter into the equation.

125
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,833
What I need you to do
is make a choice.

126
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,166
[OH EKI]
Will you accept that its fate

127

Now then, Oh Eki.

132
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,916
Please tell us the best way
to proceed from this point on.

133
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,666
[OH EKI] The first step
is obtaining weapons.

All seven paopei we
created are required.

135

You must venture out
and find each one of them.

136
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,833
Once the seven people capable
of using them come together,

137
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,416
Joka's end will be at hand.

You mean the super paopei.

Several of them are
on Mount Kongrong.

140
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,000
[OH EKI]
This plan must remain top secret

141
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,791
so that Joka does not
suspect a thing.

142
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:42,500

I'm Genshi Tenson's pupil.

Beating your opponents

You would never take

324
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,916
Not even your strength
can withstand this.

325
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,625
Master Bunchu!

326
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,500
[gasps]

327
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:50,125
[HIKO wheezing]

328
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,583
Listen to me, Bunchu.

329
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,125
You gotta open your eyes.

330
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,791
It's changed.

331
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,375
The Yin you and I
once knew is gone!

332
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,833
[HIKO]
It doesn't exist anymore!

333
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,458
[BUNCHU]
You're wrong.

334
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:13,000
As long as I draw breath,
Yin will prevail.

335
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,416
It will continue its resilience.

336
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,791
I will not hear such vile words
from the mouth of a traitor!

337
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,458
How dare you try to
tear me from it.

338
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,750
If I were to forsake Yin,

339
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,875
it would be at the
request of its people!

340
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,875
Do you hear me?

341
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,333
Now stop wasting your time
and get out of here!

342
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,458
I'm through staring into
the eyes of a coward!

343
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,125
You are my enemy, Hiko.

344
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,166
I've nothing more to--[gasps]

345
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,708
[chuckles]

346
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,666
There's the face of
the man I once knew.

347
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,416
I see you.

348
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,041
Hold on.

349
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,500
Don't go now.

350
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,083
Please!

351
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,791
Not yet!

352
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,833
Taikobo, are you there?

353
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,375
[gasps]

354
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,541
[HIKO]
I leave the rest up to you!

355
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,083
Goodbye, Dad.

356
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,208
Buseioh...

357
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,416
[JOKA]
Long ago,

358
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,333
I was captured and sealed
away by my own brethren.

359
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:02,291
But in time I developed a way
to move about as a spirit.

360
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,041
Once I could do that,

361
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:08,250
I began to rebuild this land
in the image of my lost home.

362
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,041
I led it along the same
evolutionary course

363
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,375
with which I had been familiar,

364
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,625
perpetually building it anew.

365
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,416
And then I would destroy it.

366
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,791
Building and destroying,
for millions of years...

367
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:28,083
It was all part of my quest to
create the perfect final form.

368
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:34,000
[JOKA] And at last, I'm seeing
all my hard work bear fruit.

369
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:37,125
I'm building a perfect world.

370
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,125
And soon, our home
will be reborn.

371
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,083
[JOKA]
Yes...

372
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,250
Yes!

373
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,000
Dakki!
