1
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,375
I've been having rather
disturbing thoughts lately.

2
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,958
Go on.

3
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,708
[GENSHI]
It's been thousands of years now

4
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:58,291
since we first created
the Sennin world.

5
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,208
Our motivation was to guide
those who are Sennin born

6
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,291
down a path of righteousness.

7
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,500
At least that's what I believed.

8
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,875
Lately I question if
those ideas were our own.

9
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,958
Were we manipulated
into creating it

10
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,750
by the Signpost of History?

11
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,000
Do we truly care
about our mission?

12
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,375
Don't be ridiculous, Genshi!

13
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,541
[GENSHI] These are not thoughts
of paranoia, but real memories.

14
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:23,416
[gasps]

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,583
It first came to me in a dream.

16
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,625
Though I was young,
it still haunts me.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,083
[JOKA] You will henceforth
be known as Genshi Tenson

18
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,958
and you will create
the Sennin world.

19
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,458
What if the one who's
been stealing souls

20
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,166
and using them to control
humanity's direction

21
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,541
was the Signpost of
History all along?

22
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,666
[TSUTEN] This is all
just wild speculation!

23
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,625
[GENSHI] History's timeline
from past to future

24
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,583
may already be laid out!

25
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,000
That's it!

26
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,291
Our fates are not subject
to this creature's whims!

27
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,166
[TSUTEN gasps]

28
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,333
[GENSHI]
I will annihilate it

29
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,500
and leave not the
slightest trace behind!

30
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,416
[GENSHI]
Mark my words.

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,041
I will destroy it
no matter the cost!

32
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:51,583
[YOZEN crying]

33
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,958
[YOZEN]
When did it happen?

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,625
[YOZEN] When did I
get used to being alone?

35
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,583
[YOZEN] When was it
that I closed my heart?

36
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,125
[gasps]

37
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,375
[gasps]

38
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,666
[YOZEN]
He is open and unafraid.

39
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,458
People let him in.

40
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,333
He has so many gifts and
strengths that I do not...

41
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,583
...and he makes those
around him feel at ease.

42
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,083
[YOZEN] He gave me the
confidence to open my heart

43
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,000
for the first time in long time.

44
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:54,000
I thought, perhaps,
he might understand me--

45
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,083
trust me.

46
00:04:56,166 --> 00:05:00,125
However, when I mastered
the art of disguising myself,

47
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,125
I lost sight of who I truly am.

48
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,041
It's difficult
for me to accept...

49
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,125
[YOZEN]
...but the truth is...

50
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,583
...I've always been a <i>yokai</i> .

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,583
[YOZEN gasps]

52
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:26,333
[YOZEN] I'm... alive...
and my wounds have healed.

53
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,708
[OHTENKUN chuckles]

54

[YOZEN gasps]

55
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,833
That is the benefit of
awakening as a <i>yokai</i> .

56
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,458
My mites could attack you
as often as I command them

57
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,125
and it wouldn't
make any difference.

58
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,916
I hope this isn't new
information, sweet prince.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,166
[YOZEN]
Ohtenkun!

60
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,916
[OHTENKUN]
Disguising yourself as a human

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,458
restricts you from
using your true power.

62
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,583
If you'd only known,

63
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,375
you could've saved
your stupid master.

[YOZEN grunts]

Oh, I'm not the main dish today.

Good day, Master Tsuten.

71
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,916
This is Yozen.

72
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,875
[TSUTEN]
Hm?

73
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,750
Yozen...

74
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,291
[TSUTEN]
My son?

75
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,875
[HIKO] All right,
you three, enough of this!

76
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,208
We can't exactly help you fight

77
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,041
if we're stuck
inside of this thing!

78

[QUEEN]
Now quiet down, boys!

79
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm afraid this particular
enemy is beyond your abilities.

Just stay comfortable while

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't recognize this place.

[SHINTENKUN MALE, FEMALE gasp]

92

Welcome, Juttenkun.

We're so glad to have you.

This is Kyukyoku Kogajin.

Please make yourselves at home.

But I must inform you
that enemies here

97
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,000
are reduced to the size of bugs.

98
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,875
Also, your multidimensional
space no longer exists.

99

I'm sorry.

100
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,916
Ours happens to be
much more voluptuous

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,875
and popped yours like a bubble.

00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,000
So you might as well
surrender now!

If you want forgiveness,
we could work something out.

[FUGEN]
Hey, Bo?

112
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,708
[TAIKOBO]
What is it?

113
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,708
[FUGEN] I've detected three
massive unknown life energies.

114
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,208
It's just a guess right now, but
I'd say one of them is Bunchu.

115
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,458
The second could be the
remaining Juttenkun.

116
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,958
And I'm not quite sure
about the last one, but...

117
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,625
...it's the largest.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,125
I'll go ahead and place
my bet on it being Ohtenkun.

119
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,250
Even though I still can't
quite put my finger on

120
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,750
what he is exactly.

121
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,541
Well, he's one of the
Juttenkun, isn't he?

122
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,916
[TAIKOBO] Yeah, but there's
gotta be some underlying reason

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,041
why he's obsessed with Yozen.

124
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,916
He's had several chances
to kill him so far,

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
but he always chooses not to.

126
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,750
It's like he intentionally
lets him live.

127
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,083
That doesn't sound like
something a <i>yokai</i> would do.

128
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,125
The <i>yokai</i> are much more

129
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,500
simplistic and
direct than people.

130
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,125
But Ohtenkun...

131
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,375
He almost seems human in the
way he can read people's minds

132
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,416
and manipulate them.

133
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,291
[FUGEN]
That sounds like Dakki--

134
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,291
at least, according
to the rumors.

135
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,583
[TAIKOBO] She's on a
completely different level!

136
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,958
Anyway, I'm sure we'll find out
what it is one way or another.

137
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,291
Right now we need to be
ready to face Bunchu.

138
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,208
[FUGEN] That's Kingo
Island's power reactor.

139
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,125
Tell me, Yozen.

140
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,583
What's it like knowing you're
about to go into battle

141
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,125
with Daddy Tsuten?

142
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,166
Dakki and I drained his soul
and left nothing but a shell,

143
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,958
so that should help
with the guilt.

144
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,708
Genshi Tenson was the first one

145
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,750
to detect the change
in your papa.

146
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,041
And here's something else
you might not have known.

147
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,250
He created the Hoshin
Project to kill Dakki.

148
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,750
[YOZEN]
That's not true.

149
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,916
He created it to
protect the human world.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,500
I assure you it's for the
Sennin world and nothing else.

151
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,250
It's a plan to kill Dakki.

152
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,666
She's their greatest
enemy, after all.

153
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,583
Sure looks like
you've been deceived,

154
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,208
but that's just the
kind of man Genshi is.

155
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,500
One would be foolish to believe
she would be easy to kill.

156
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,250
Dakki can move around as a soul

157
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,750
and become any
entity she desires.

158
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,333
That's why Genshi created the
Hoshin Field with his own power.

159
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:36,458
He believes he'll be able to
capture Dakki's soul within it.

160
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,916
I'm impressed.

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,500
He comes off as an old fool,
but he's quite brilliant.

162
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,833
For example, sending
Taikobo to kill her

163
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,500
was quite a clever move.

164
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,708
He has a personal
vendetta against Dakki

165
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,250
for killing his people.

166
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,791
So it's possible that bleeding
heart despises her the most.

167
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,250
Genshi knows exactly how to use
that anger to his advantage.

168
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,750
For such a smart man,

169
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,166
I'm amazed he never anticipated
Bunchu being a challenge.

170
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,166
How could he have predicted
Bunchu would bring Kingo Island

171
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,250
directly to him?

172
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,333
[OHTENKUN] He tried so hard
to protect Mount Kongrong,

173
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,833
only to watch it
crumble in the end.

174
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:16,000
[OHTENKUN laughs]

175
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,333
I was behind Bunchu
all the way, of course.

176
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,625
How could I not be?
It serves them right.

177
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,416
They all deserve to die.

178
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,916
[OHTENKUN laughs]

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,875
I pity you.

180
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,375
Don't forget, I'm not
the one you'll be battling.

181
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,541
[OHTENKUN]
Come on, Yozen.

182
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,291
I know you can give me
a little more than that.

183
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,375
At least try to match
my enthusiasm.

184
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,625
[YOZEN gasps]

[OHTENKUN grunts]

186
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,333
I need your help, Master Tsuten.

187
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,333
We're in the presence
of our enemy.

188
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,708
Yozen raised his blade
against Kingo Island

189
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,125
and poses a threat to us all.

190
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:12,833
Prove your loyalty as our most
vehement savior and protect us.

191
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,375
[TSUTEN]
Very well.

What a great show.

00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,583
Enjoy the blood bath.

00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,250
Impressive.

201
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,875
As I had expected.

202
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,541
Do you remember me?

203
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,000
We've met.

204
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,125
However, it's been a long time.

205
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,166
Perhaps you weren't
listening earlier.

206
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,583
I told you his memory was wiped.
He remembers nothing.

207
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,333
Fifty years ago,

208
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,041
I infiltrated this place
for one purpose.

209
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,541
That was to ask you
about my origin.

210
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,416
[TSUTEN]
Who darkens my doorway?

211
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,750
I am a Doshi.

212
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,166
I'm from Kongrong.

213
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,291
I've come to learn
the truth about who I am.

[TSUTEN gasps]

[gasps]

216
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,916
[YOZEN]
I was inspired to change

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,375
after meeting Taikobo...
and his friends.

218
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,666
I understand that it takes
strength to admit weakness

219
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,458
and showing vulnerability
requires courage.

220
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,750
[OHTENKUN grunts]

221
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,875
[YOZEN]
Therefore, I will not run away--

222
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,333
not from you and
not from myself.

223

[OHTENKUN groans]

224
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,583
If word got to Kongrong
about what you really are,

225
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,458
they'd never accept you.

226
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,916
[YOZEN] You might want to
believe that, but you're wrong.

227
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,458
I am not choosing
to go into battle

228
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,625
in hopes that they'll like me.

229
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,416
It's because what I truly desire
is to be a friend to them.

230
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:22,000
[OHTENKUN] And for that,
you're a disgrace to all <i>yokai</i> .

Come on, Tsuten!

removed Kingo Island's barrier.

stop until both of you die!

I don't know what

but it came from the

you said was likely Ohtenkun.

why he used it.

Well, maybe I can't be,

but the Bunchu I know

would be listening to our
conversation right now.

And if he did hear everything
we just said, he's got no choice

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,875
Well done, Yozen. I'm impressed.

322
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,666
You took down Tsuten Kyoshu!

323
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,791
You killed your own father!

324
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,708
This is all your fault!

325
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,666
[laughs]

326
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,541
No, you're wrong.

327
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,791
The truth is that my father
chose to protect his pride

328
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,041
in the end.

Shut up.

[OHTENKUN groaning]

332
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,458
That's not true!

333
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,000
And even if it is,

334
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,833
it doesn't matter,
because you're both done for.

335
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,291
Now I'll just sit back and watch

336
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,750
as Kongrong and Bunchu
vanish from existence, too!

337
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,041
It's like watching two snakes
eat each other by their tails.

338
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,166
In the end, you both disappear!

339
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,416
And those of us who remain

340
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
will drown ourselves
in laughter!

I release to Bunchu.

You sure he was out here?

a more specific direction?

Yes, I'm all right.

Sorry for worrying you.

It's been exhausting
for all of us.
