Supu...

00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,250
I don't know what to do.

3
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,166
I don't wanna have to
make any sacrifices.

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,166
But still...

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,375
Is it even possible to
create a human world

00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,125
free of Sennin without it?

7
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,916
To see this through...

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,166
...it could very likely mean
losing the Sennin world.

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,041
Am I really capable of that?

Am I, Supu?

[OHTENKUN]
Listen up, all of you.

Totenkun's dead?

[CHOTENKUN] Well, Ohtenkun,
what the hell do we do now?

16
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,875
You need me to
spell it out for you?

17
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,958
[YOTENKUN] This goes against
everything we've heard.

18
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,875
Are the Kongrong Sennin
really that powerful?

19
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,791
[OHTENKUN]
No. Judging by all parameters,

20
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,083
you guys are stronger than
they could ever hope to be!

We can't keep losing like this.

do about it is kill them,

own life in the process.

I'm onto you.

in your pocket, don't you?

About Doko Tenson's pupil, Igo.

43

Do you have any idea when he's
supposed to join up with us?

[TAIKOBO]
I'm actually not sure.

The one thing I know about
him is he's super lazy.

Oh, yeah?

along rather well, at least.

Just as I thought.

Are you really gonna
steal all those peaches?

Shouldn't you at least
do the right thing

and leave a little

You could always try
working for them.

If I have to work,
I'd rather just starve.

on stealing those peaches

something in this area.

This is Taikobo.

00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,125
[TAIKOBO]
There's a core deep within Kingo

90
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,375
and that's where Bunchu's
giving his orders from.

Only problem, we don't know
exactly where the core is.

to find it on your own...

...I forbid you from
attacking Bunchu.

In order for this plan to work,

00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,291
we must first take out the
Juttenkun that surround him.

be tolerated. Over!

As much chaos as you've caused,

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,541
--[TAIKOBO grunts]
--[SUPUSHAN groans]

161
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,208
Keep your distance,
Supu, it's dangerous!

162
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,458
Quit lyin' to me!

163
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,791
You're eating it!

164
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,416
You just wanna keep it
all for yourself! [groans]

165
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,791
Uh...?

166
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,541
[TAIKOBO]
Uh? What's happening?

167
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,666
[TAIKOBO, SUPUSHAN scream]

168
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,458
[FUGEN]
So it was a trap after all.

169
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,416
Guess I have no choice here.

170
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,875
Might as well jump in with them.

171
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,625
A field of flowers.

172
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,541
Oh, hey, you got
trapped, too, huh?

173
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,250
They sure are pretty.

174
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,083
[SUPUSHAN gasps]

175
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,333
[SUPUSHAN gasps]

176
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,875
Why are the flowers wilting?

177
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,875
[ENTENKUN] The lives of flowers
are fleeting and short.

178
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,791
They achieve the pinnacle of
their glory in the warm season,

179
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:41,083
and when the cold comes
rolling around, they die.

180
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,708
[ENTENKUN]
And I know this cycle well.

181
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:49,250
I'm Entenkun, and I control this
paopei dimension, Kanpyojin.

182
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,291
In fact, I personally
usher in the frigid cold

183
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,875
that smothers
this land in death.

184
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,041
Those who enter this
space will soon become

185
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,833
acquainted with doom.

186
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,041
Everything wilts and dies here.

187
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,458
You see this thing?

188
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,166
What is this gross,
morbidly poetic creature?

189
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,208
I'm guessing it's
one of the Juttenkun.

190
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,208
[ENTENKUN]
Ah, the first snow.

191
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,083
It's snowing?

192
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,208
There's ice bursting
from the ground!

193
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,041
[TAIKOBO, SUPUSHAN scream]

194
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,333
[ENTENKUN laughing]

195
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,875
He's got the power
to control ice!

196
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,458
[ENTENKUN sighs]

197
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,000
[ENTENKUN]
Oh, dear.

198
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,583
Have they been buried
so quickly and easily?

199
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,750
[ENTENKUN]
Huh?

200
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,833
Hang back behind me, you two.

201
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,666
As much as I loathe fighting,
I can handle this one.

202
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,250
Save your strength.

203
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,000
Considering the bigger fights
you've still got ahead of you,

204
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,625
you're going to need
all of the energy

205
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,208
that you can possibly muster.

206
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,583
[ENTENKUN] They melted
right through my ice,

207
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,375
which can only mean...

208
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,791
...one of them's wielding
a fire-type paopei.

209
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,750
[FUGEN]
You know, furball,

210
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,750
fighting's right at the top of
the list of things I hate.

211
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,125
Why don't we just
talk this thing out?

212
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,250
If we can find some
understanding,

213
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,250
we're bound to come up
with a better solution

214
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,375
than killing one another.

215
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,750
[ENTENKUN]
What a foolish notion.

216
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,541
People and <i>yokai</i> are
destined to kill each other.

217
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,208
And that conflict will continue
until it's determined

218
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,583
who will rule the world.

219
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,458
[FUGEN]
You really believe that?

220
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,666
Well, for what it's worth,

221
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,666
I intend to keep trying
to persuade you.

222
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,208
How's this?

223
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,291
If you still refuse to listen
after I make three attempts,

224
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,500
then I'll assume
that understanding

225
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,875
is completely off the table.

226
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,125
[TAIKOBO]
C'mon, Fugen!

227
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,916
What're you blathering about?

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,875
I think it's quite clear.

229
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,375
The little freak has
already tried to kill us!

230
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,583
Be serious here!

231
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,958
[FUGEN]
Oh, I'm very serious.

232
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,166
[gasps]

233
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,208
I can't argue with the
facts of the matter.

234
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,458
People and <i>yokai</i>
are in conflict.

235
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,041
But... I believe
that can change.

236
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,250
We just need to take the time
to understand each other.

237
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,791
Will you take a look around you?

238
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,916
He's got us trapped
in his death dimension!

239
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,291
Perhaps, but this is simply
the way I do things.

240
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,166
Fine, get us killed!

241
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,333
Got a gift for you.

242
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,333
[TAIKOBO] You've never
wavered from who you are.

243
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,500
[ENTENKUN] Taikobo's strategic
flexibility is impressive.

244
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,125
From my brief observation,

245
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:07,458
his ingenuity appears to exceed
that of the Twelve Sennin.

246
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,791
[gasps]

247
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:15,083
[TAIKOBO screams]

248
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,041
[ENTENKUN] Your open-mindedness
truly is a treasure,

249
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,833
but... pursuing that treasure

250
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,375
can often lead to
a mortal downfall.

251
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,916
[TAIKOBO]
Supu!

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,750
Dodge them! Watch out!

253
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,250
[SUPUSHAN]
I'm trying, all right?

254
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,750
[BOTH gasping]

255
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,166
Fugen!

256
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,708
I thought you said you
were gonna handle this?!

257
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,166
'Cuz now would be the time!

258
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,416
[BOTH screaming]

259
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,083
[FUGEN]
I've got this, Bo. Hang on.

260
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,666
Initiating Forced Phase Change.

261
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,875
Whoa!

262
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,500
[ENTENKUN]
What? The ice!

263
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,708
This paopei of mine,
Taikyoku Fuin,

264
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,916
is able to manipulate
all chemical elements.

265
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,500
Turning ice into steam is about
the easiest thing I can do.

266
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,625
At one atmospheric pressure,

267
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,500
water becomes ice below
zero degrees Celsius

268
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,916
and vapor above 100 degrees.

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,291
My paopei broke apart
the water molecules

270
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,208
that had solidified into ice,

271
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,291
releasing them into
a cloud of steam.

272
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,791
Do you understand now?

273
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,791
I control the molecules
that form your ice,

274
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,291
which means that
you can't defeat me

275
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,833
no matter how hard you try.

276
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,041
So come on.

277
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,791
Let's put a stop to
this meaningless fight.

278
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,583
[ENTENKUN chuckles]

279
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,208
[ENTENKUN]
It would seem you've confused

280
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,333
threats with persuasion.

281
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,375
And your point is pure delusion!

282
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,375
[BOTH gasp]

283
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,500
[SUPUSHAN]
I'm freakin' freezin' to death!

284
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,833
[ENTENKUN] You assume
I'm just some simple Sennin

285
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,416
who controls ice.

286
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,625
I'm a Juttenkun, you fool!

287
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,166
I'll pluck out that silver
tongue of yours and sell it!

288
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,791
[TAIKOBO] This just might be
the nastiest blizzard ever!

289
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,458
[ENTENKUN] The simple
truth of this situation

290
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,791
is that you can never defeat me.

291
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,833
You create nothing of your own.

292
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,375
You can only muster
a defensive response,

293
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,208
like turning my ice
into water or steam.

294
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,916
But I'm eager to watch you
fight off this blizzard

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,083
with that paopei.

296
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,166
C'mon, let's see what it can do!

297
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,458
As clever as you are,

298
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,458
I'm sure you can figure
out what will happen.

299
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,791
[sighs]

300
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,125
You're pretty clever yourself,

301
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,083
just as I'd expect from
one of the Juttenkun.

302
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,166
Shut up and do
something, will you?

303
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,333
Quit talking and do whatever
you did earlier with this snow!

304
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,583
You really think I should?

305
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,541
Yeah, I do! And hurry up
before we all freeze!

306
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,708
[FUGEN]
All right.

307
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,666
[TAIKOBO, SUPUSHAN gasp]

308
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,833
You pulled it off!

309
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,541
You got rid of
the freezing cold!

310
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,208
I can feel my face again!

311
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,041
Oh, no.

312
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,875
[BOTH scream]

313
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,666
What the hell? It feels like the
steam is freezing to my body!

314
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,958
[SUPUSHAN, TAIKOBO whining]

315
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,500
[sighs] I'm pretty
sure you'll survive.

316
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,083
[ENTENKUN] Let me tell you
something Ohtenkun said to me.

317
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,375
[OHTENKUN]
I want you to consider

318
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,416
why the Juttenkun are losing.

319
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,375
Think about it long and hard.

320
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,166
[ENTENKUN] He said our
three fallen comrades

321
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,708
succumbed to their arrogance

322
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,291
and that's why their
souls were released.

323
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,125
Their own pride did them in.

324
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,666
They were convinced
they couldn't lose

325
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,125
and that's precisely
why they did.

326
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,583
I've learned from their mistakes

327
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,250
and I won't underestimate
my enemies!

328
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,458
It seems we've come down to
a barometric race of sorts,

329
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,041
and from the looks of it,

330
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:59,333
my blizzard greatly exceeds the
speed at which you can melt ice.

331
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,541
I will happily watch
your life plummet

332
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,041
with your body temperature

333
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,333
until you're nothing
but a frozen statue.

334
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,208
[sighs]

335
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,291
[ENTENKUN]
Huh?

336
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,000
Clearly, there was some
miscommunication here.

337
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,375
My paopei does turn
ice into steam

338
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,291
and I guess I let you think
that's all it's capable of,

339
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,541
but there's far more
to it than that.

340
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,083
[ENTENKUN]
Huh...?

341
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,875
[ENTENKUN] Wha--what
did you do to my snow?!

342
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,666
[BOTH whimper, gasp]

343
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,583
It all just vanished!

344
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,583
[sighs]

345
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,666
Nothing remaining but a
warm, pleasant breeze.

346
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,708
If you want to know
what just happened,

347
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,333
my paopei took your ice

348
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,750
then promptly split it
into hydrogen and oxygen,

349
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,666
so it all vanished into the air.

350
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,208
You should've listened to me.

351
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,458
I told you that my paopei
manipulates chemical elements.

352
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,750
Yeah. I knew that.

353
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,916
[SUPUSHAN] Like you remembered
all that stuff. Sure.

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,291
[FUGEN] I really didn't
want to go to these lengths,

355
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,083
but you gave me no choice.

356
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,291
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,541
[FUGEN] And now, there's
nothing left you can do.

358
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,041
So, we've reached the end.

359
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,666
Might as well talk.

360
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,166
[ENTENKUN gasps]

361
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,541
Hey, no reason to be afraid.

362
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,625
See?

363
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,083
[BOTH gasp]

364
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,708
[ENTENKUN]
Hm?

365
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,750
As proof that I have no
intention of harming you,

366
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,250
I won't use my paopei anymore.

367
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,958
Why are you always like this?

368
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,958
That's just so freakin' naive!

369
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,166
Calm down, Bo.
Why are you so angry?

370
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,625
[TAIKOBO]
What's wrong with you?!

371
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:59,625
[ENTENKUN] You... To make
a peace offering like this?

372
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,541
[ENTENKUN]
You're an absolute fool!

373
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,833
[SUPUSHAN, TAIKOBO scream]

374
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,666
[TAIKOBO]
I knew it!

375
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,791
[ENTENKUN gasps]

376
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,958
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,750
This is goodbye.

378
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,041
[ENTENKUN]
Hey! What's it doing?

379
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,791
[TAIKOBO]
Whoa! What is that?

380
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,666
[SUPUSHAN] Did his paopei
just self destruct?

381
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,291
[FUGEN] I programmed it
to automatically do that

382
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,875
if he tried to attack us
with his ice again.

383
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,791
If a large amount of
water were to appear

384
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,291
within a 37 meter radius,

385
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,708
the water would be broken down

386
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,500
and the hydrogen would
be used to make tritium...

387
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,500
[FUGEN]
...which would then result in

388
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,458
a very small-scale
nuclear fusion.

389
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,541
Uh, wait, nuclear fusion?

390
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,666
Glad you chose the
most dangerous option.

391
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:51,000
To not understand each other--
it truly is a tragedy.

392
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,291
[DAKKI]
The human world is quickly

393
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,291
approaching a crossroads.

394
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,416
It's just about time
for you to make your

395
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,000
first grand appearance.

396
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:52,833
Please come forward and offer
us your much needed guidance.
