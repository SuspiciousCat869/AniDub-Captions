1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,750
[TAIKOBO]
Kingo Island...

2
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,541
It's on the advance!

3
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,250
No turning back now.

4
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,708
This should be quite fun.

5
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,000
[BUNCHU]
Listen closely.

6
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,666
We're going to war to
accomplish a single goal:

7
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,125
The complete and
total destruction

8
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,583
of Kongrong Mountain.

9
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,583
[TAIKOBO]
No. Bunchu must be insane!

10
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,666
He's bringing half of the
Sennin world into battle

11
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,208
with him!

12
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,208
[SHINKOHYO] Well, I personally
can't think of a better way

13
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,083
to drag the Juttenkun
into this skirmish

14
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,291
than driving their
home to the frontlines.

15
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,666
[TAIKOBO]
Shinkohyo?

16
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,583
I should've expected
you to be drawn to this

17
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,625
like flies to a pile of crap!

18
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:20,916
How could I miss this?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,708
It's certain to be the
most entertaining thing

20
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,208
to happen to this world.

21
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,666
Approximately one thousand
Sennin and Doshi

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,291
call Kingo their home.

23
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,125
Kongrong, on the other hand...

24
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,625
It's only got about 400 or so.

25
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,625
I'm no mathematician, but those
seem like some long odds.

26
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,625
I know what we're up against!

27
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:38,708
Let's go, Supu!

28
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,625
Kongrong, on the double!

29
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:41,750
[SUPUSHAN]
Roger that!

30
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,250
[UNSHO] Since the beginning
of time, the number three

31
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,750
has been said to emanate a
powerful aura of sensuality.

32
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,250
[KEISHO]
In general, that's true,

33
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,791
but you're talking about
the three of us, aren't you?

34
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,125
[UNSHO]
Of course I am.

35
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,416
For there's nothing sexier
than a beautiful woman

36
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,625
who's also strong.

37
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,666
I'm the eldest sister, Venus!

38
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,208
The middle sister, Queen!

39
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,875
[UNSHO]
And our baby sister, Madonna!

40
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,458
[KEISHO, UNSHO]
Together, we three are

41
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,541
the princesses of
the Sennin world,

42
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,958
the Three Unsho Sisters!

43
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,791
This is utterly dreadful!

44
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,708
Look at its ghastly progress!

45
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,583
The horrid Kingo Island
measures nearly 10 miles

46
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,916
in diameter, and it's equipped
with several thousand

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,166
gun batteries.

48
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,250
The beast is five times
the size of Kongrong.

49
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,208
It's cutting a westward path.

50
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,166
We already know
where it's heading.

51
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,625
They're advancing on
Kongrong, aren't they?

52
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,541
[MALE VILLAGER 7A]
What the hell?

53
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,666
[MALE VILLAGER 7B] It's some
kind of floating mountain!

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,166
[MALE VILLAGER 7D]
Run for your lives!

55
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,166
[MALE VILLAGER 7C]
Hurry!

56
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,500
[MALE VILLAGER 7E]
Someone help us!

57
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,791
Well this is an
encouraging sight!

58
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,333
You already assembled before
I could even put out the call!

59
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,458
The Twelve Sennin of Kongrong!

60
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,208
Quite the looming
catastrophe, eh?

61
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,708
Just to be clear,

62
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:49,000
this immense mass tearing
across my radar is Kingo Island,

63
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,375
is it not?

64
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,250
That's exactly what it is.

65
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,958
This battle's coming
straight to us,

66
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,500
and there's no way
for us to escape it.

67
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,833
Master Genshi.

68
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,708
I think it's pretty evident
that Bunchu intends

69
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,791
to annihilate Kongrong Mountain.

70
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,291
We have no choice but
to prepare for this fight.

71
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,958
Do whatever you deem necessary.

72
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,500
I trust you to capably
lead us through this battle.

73
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,791
Truthfully, I fear we have
little hope of winning

74
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,666
without you.

75
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,791
Sir.

76
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,750
Well, let's get down to it.

77
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,333
I take it that you already
have a strategy in mind?

78
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,583
I do.

79
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,166
First off, we need to
move Kongrong Mountain.

80
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,416
I was unaware of it,
but Taiitsu told me

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,875
it's capable of movement.

82
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,791
This central sphere serves
as Kongrong's cockpit.

83
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,041
But its complex control
system will take a Sennin

84
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,291
of the highest possible
level to pilot.

85
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,500
Makes sense.

86
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,916
And if we're looking
for someone like that,

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,458
there's only one
woman for the job.

88
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,416
Well, Koshu? You up for it?

89
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,458
Roger!

90
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,666
[TAIKOBO] Do you think we
can use the batteries, Yozen?

91
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,083
[YOZEN]
It will be difficult.

92
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,166
They haven't been fired
in thousands of years.

93
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,125
They're in need of
some heavy maintenance.

94
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,000
And that's going
to take a full day.

95
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,583
If only we had a day.

96
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,875
Actually, hell, I'd even take
half a day at this point.

97
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,541
We just don't have the energy
to pull that off, Taiitsu.

98
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,000
[TAIITSU sighs]

99
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,333
Yeah, we don't have enough
to get a decent barrier up.

100
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,708
Don't worry, I'll figure out
some way to make it work.

101
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,125
You just stay focused
on piloting us, okay?

102
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,250
Looks like we're gonna have to
conserve as much energy

103
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,166
as possible until we engage
in combat with them.

104
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,875
I better go check in with Fugen.

105
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,625
How're things looking?
Have ya figured out a location

106
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,500
for the battle?

107
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,625
The coordinates 72 64 0 25 6

108
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,333
appear to be completely
unpopulated,

109
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,458
so it should be the ideal area.

110
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,333
Good.

111
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,000
It's time to get moving, Koshu!

112
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,000
Kongrong Mountain,
initiate launch!

113
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:58,000
[YOKAI 7A] Armaments are
99.72 percent battle ready.

114
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,750
[YOKAI 7B] Barrier functional
for approximately 108 hours.

115
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,541
[CHOTENKUN] The 100 flying
paopei, Sokinrikishi,

116
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,125
are fully activated.

117
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,125
Everything is properly
proceeding according to plan.

118
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,541
[OHTENKUN]
Bunchu.

119
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,583
We're close enough to have
a visual of Kongrong now.

120
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,958
[FUGEN]
Kingo's approaching.

121
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,208
Koshu. Make sure to keep
us at a safe distance.

122
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,125
Stop outside the range
of their cannons.

123
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,458
No!

124
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,958
This can't be good!

125
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,666
Listen well, Kongrong.

126
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,791
I am Bunchu, the Grand
Preceptor of Yin

127
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,833
and the acting supreme
commander of Kingo Island.

128
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,916
We've chosen to engage you in
combat with a single imperative,

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,291
and that is the utter
annihilation of the Kongrong

130
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,916
mountain range.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You have the option to surrender
and hand over Kongrong,

132
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,000
or you can choose to fill the
Hoshindai with your own souls.

133
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,083
Your call.

134
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,666
You deserve to be severely
punished for using Taikobo

135
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,916
to create chaos
in the human world.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,666
As the other half
of the Sennin world,

137
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,000
we can no longer allow this.

138
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,250
I'm not just gonna sit here
and let you badmouth me,

139
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,750
you got that?

140
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,833
You can act as self-righteous
as you want,

141
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,500
but everyone knows you're
only in this to protect Yin!

142
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,541
[BUNCHU] Heh. I only wish for
the human world to remain free

143
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,375
of Sennin interference.

144
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,333
You freakin' liar!

145
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,791
If you really feel that way,

146
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,041
why don't you abandon
your Grand Preceptor post

147
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,625
and live in the Sennin World?

148
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,583
Huh? How about that?

149
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,583
Leave it to Taikobo to lose
his composure and say

150
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,375
what everybody else is thinking.

151
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,958
[GENSHI sighs]

152
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,916
[BUNCHU] I've said everything
that I had to say, so be ready.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,208
[TAIKOBO]
I'm still talking!

154
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,416
[growls]

155
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,125
Wait! Hey, Bo!

156
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,833
Kingo's preparing to launch
a full missile attack!

157
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,875
Here they come!

00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,500
Yozen! Do it!

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,041
[YOZEN]
Seriously.

160
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,083
I realize we're running
low on energy,

161
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,041
but did they really
have to throw me out here

162
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,500
to act as their barrier?

163
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,208
I mean, that's asking a lot.

164
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,416
Oh, well.

165
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,625
There's not much point
in complaining now.

166
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,125
Partial transformation!

167
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,833
Water barrier!

168
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,875
[TAIKOBO]
Well look at that.

169
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,416
He conjured up Koyuken's
power by only transforming

170
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,666
his hands.

171
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,541
I didn't realize he'd mastered
the partial transformation.

172
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,208
He just might be the best
Kongrong has to offer.

173
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,166
Quite Impressively done,
"genius" Doshi.

174
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,250
Although...

175
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,791
[BUNCHU]
Now launch. Sokinrikishi!

176
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,208
Paopei robots.

177
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,375
They must be similar
to Kokinrikishi.

178
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,833
You know, Bunchu...

179
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,083
You're gonna have to
step up your game here.

180
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,583
These meager attacks
aren't gonna do the job.

181
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,958
That goes without saying.

182
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,375
I'm simply attempting
to buy us some time

183
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,583
until we can reach peak energy.

184
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,083
And after that?

185
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,041
[BUNCHU] We'll employ
Kingo's largest, strongest

186
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,291
paopei weapon.

187
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,333
Tsutenho.

188
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,166
Chi!

189
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,208
[grunts]

190
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,416
[YOZEN]
You showed up just in time!

191
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,083
Wait, are they retreating?

192
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,833
[TAIKOBO]
Something's wrong.

193
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,125
We gotta pull back, everybody!

194
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,500
It's a little too
late for that, Taikobo.

195
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,541
[TAIKOBO] They're firing
their main weapon!

196
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,875
Koshu! Get us
out of here quickly!

197
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,208
Can we outrun that?

198
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,916
We should still be out
of range of their weapons,

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,083
so calm down.

200
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,625
We're basing that
on obsolete data.

201
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,916
If Bunchu has the means to
destroy Kongrong Mountain

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,125
in one fell swoop, he'll do it.

203
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,666
Those other attacks
were just distractions!

204
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,875
He was just buying time
to reach peak energy!

205
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,708
[BUNCHU]
Tsutenho, fire!

206
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,208
[TAIKOBO grunting]

207
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,625
[YOZEN]
Oh, god, no!

208
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,291
Looks like most of it
is still standing.

209
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,208
[DOTOKU]
We've taken heavy damage.

210
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:52,416
A large number of souls
are flying to the Hoshindai.

211
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,541
What now, Bo?

212
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,916
[TAIKOBO]
Taiitsu!

213
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,875
How much longer until we
can fire our main battery?

214
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,083
We're almost at full power,
so it should be soon.

215
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,750
[GENSHI]
Is it possible to withdraw?

216
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,750
Or is it too late
for us to flee?

217
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,333
[TAIKOBO] Their main
cannon's range is longer

218
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,833
than we anticipated.

219
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,250
They'll just shoot us in the
back if we try to run now.

220
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,916
Bunchu's got us cornered.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,708
We've only got one
option available to us

222
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,333
if we wanna make it
out of this alive.

223
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,875
Koshu!

224
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,416
Aim us straight at Kingo,
full speed ahead!

225
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,125
We'll fire the Genshiho
at close range

226
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,291
and blast a hole
in their barrier.

227
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,791
We'll then use that
opening to invade Kingo.

228
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,708
Fully charged and ready!

229
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,541
[TAIKOBO]
Koshu! Do it!

230
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,000
Genshiho! Open fire!

231
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,166
Keep on going--
we're almost there!

232
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,500
Why'd you stop firing?

233
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,125
That was all the energy we had.

234
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,708
Well, Taikobo?

235
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:42,166
Do you finally see just
how helpless you truly are?

236
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,541
Tsutenho, prepare to fire!

237
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,083
[DOTOKU]
Oh, man, this is a nightmare!

238
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,666
They're gonna shoot us
with that monster gun again!

239
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,541
We're gonna be dead
if that thing hits us

240
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,041
at this close range!

241
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,125
Does Taikobo even know
what the hell he's doing?

242
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,958
All right, you two,
enough with the panicking.

243
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,625
Do you really think you could
do any better than he is?

244
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,166
[DOTOKU]
Well, I...

245
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,166
[GYOKUTEI] That first blast
would've wiped us out of

246
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,375
existence if it
weren't for Taikobo.

247
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,375
He saw it coming
and he saved us.

248
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,041
[DOKO]
Yeah, that is true.

249
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,125
Don't lose your faith in him.

250
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,916
We must do what we
can to get through this,

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,375
and a big part of that
is believing in Taikobo.

252
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,625
Looks like they're beginning
to charge up Tsutenho again.

253
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,750
What should we do? Any ideas?

254
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,291
[SUPUSHAN]
I know!

255
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,041
Now's the time to
let loose and show 'em

256
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,583
what you've got!

257
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,625
Right.

258
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,250
[TAIKOBO]
Tension in here is suffocating.

259
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,875
There's no room for even
the smallest mistake.

260
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,500
I can't let them fire again.

261
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,208
If we can just take
out that barrier...

262
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,458
We have to.

263
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,458
There has to be
some way to do it.

264
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,750
[FUGEN]
Bad news, Bo.

265
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,541
All right, lay it on me.

266
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,916
From what I can tell,
Yozen seems to be missing.

267
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,458
--[TAIKOBO gasps]
--[SUPUSHAN] Huh?

268
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,541
He didn't die the last time they
fired their cannon, did he?

269
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,666
No, it would take more
than that to kill him.

270
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,708
Wait a sec.

271
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,500
Yozen, I owe ya one, buddy.

272
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,000
All our lives are
resting in your hands.

273
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,041
[YOZEN]
Just as I thought.

274
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,875
These mechs are
capable of freely passing

275
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,041
through the barrier.

276
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,875
It's been about 50 years
since I last infiltrated Kingo.

277
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,250
Of course, this isn't exactly
the time for nostalgia.

278
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,750
So he's going to try to
bring down the barrier

279
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,000
on his own.

280
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,208
You are undeniably
valiant, genius Doshi.

281
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,583
Ohtenkun.

282
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,583
We have 20 minutes until
we can fire Tsutenho again.

283
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,833
Deal with him before
he can cause any trouble.

284
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,166
Yeah, fine.

285
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,000
All right, first things first,
I need to find a way inside

286
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,333
the central area.

287
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,541
What's happening?

288
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,541
[YOZEN gasps]

289
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,708
What is this place?

290
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,458
[CHOTENKUN] Welcome to
the eternal desert, Yozen.

291
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,916
Perhaps you've heard of me.

292
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,791
I'm Chotenkun, of the Juttenkun.

293
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,708
[YOZEN]
The Juttenkun?

294
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,583
[CHOTENKUN]
You now inhabit Kosajin,

295
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,958
a hyperspace of my own design.

296
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,875
Once you've entered,
there's no way of getting out.

297
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,125
[TAIKOBO] With any luck, Yozen's
already infiltrated Kingo.

298
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,041
Let's hope he can manage
to bring down the barrier

299
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,541
all by himself.

300
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,041
He's gonna get himself
killed in there on his own!

301
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,000
If anyone can do it, it's him.

302
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,958
I'm a little sick and tired of
everyone calling him a genius.

303
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,541
But there really is no
better word to describe him.

304
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,041
Hey, Koshu! Taiitsu!

305
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,916
Be ready to charge
into Kingo at full speed

306
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
as soon as he gets
that barrier down, okay?

307
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,666
Use every last drop
of energy Kongrong's got!

308
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,625
Drain it dry if you need to!

309
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,291
You're sure putting a lot
of faith in Yozen, huh?

310
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,250
You really trust him.

311
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,583
You're damn right I trust him.
With my life.

312
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,500
[YOZEN]
All of this... it's not real.

313
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,458
It has to be an illusion.

314
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,125
[CHOTENKUN]
Afraid not, Yozen.

315
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,458
It's reality.

316
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:52,666
Simply put, this dimension
itself is actually my paopei.

317
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,333
[CHOTENKUN] And I control every
single centimeter of this realm

318
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,500
at will.

319
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,291
To be clear, only I
can create an exit.

320
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,416
Basically, you're trapped
in here until I decide

321
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,250
to let you go free.

322
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,583
Is that so?

323
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,208
Well, sorry, I'm not just
going to take your word.

324
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,750
You know I'm running
short on time here,

325
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,916
so I'll have to use
everything I've got...

326
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,750
...to defeat you!

327
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,166
[CHOTENKUN] You'll only
wear yourself out, Yozen.

328
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,750
That's all.

329
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,416
[CHOTENKUN]
What did I tell you?

330
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,375
I completely control this space,

331
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,625
so you're not just fighting me--
you're fighting an entire world.

332
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,541
[YOZEN]
Why have you not attacked?

333
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,333
Are you trying to mock me?

334
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,750
[CHOTENKUN]
Just surrender.

335
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,166
Kongrong's paopeis are
laughably inefficient at best.

336
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,708
They could never
defeat the Juttenkun.

337
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,958
I don't give up.

338
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,041
I would rather die
than surrender to you.

339
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,250
[CHOTENKUN] Your abilities
drastically surpass those

340
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,000
of the other Kongrong Sennin.

341
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,958
It would be wasteful to kill
someone of your caliber.

342
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,791
Not only that, but I can sense
that you're closer to us

343
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,000
than you are to humankind.

344
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,416
Your personality,
your perfection of being.

345
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
It's evident you're not a human.

346
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,958
Not to mention your
transformation powers.

347
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,333
They're more reminiscent
of a Yokai Sennin

348
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,041
taking human form.

349
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,208
Or possibly a highly evolved
version of that technique.

350
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,375
You mask the beautiful
visage you're too scared

351
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,208
to show the world.

352
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,458
You look just like us,
don't you?

353
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,875
The nature of a Yokai
is far more cruel

354
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,125
than that of a human,
but they're welcome

355
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,041
amongst their own kind.

356
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,458
Join us, Yozen.

357
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,458
Allow yourself a life
where you truly belong.

358
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,291
It's not too late for you.

359
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,666
[YOZEN]
Thanks, but I'll pass.

360
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,958
[CHOTENKUN]
If that's what you want.

361
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,041
[YOZEN gasps]

362
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,500
[CHOTENKUN]
I failed to mention.

363
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,791
Everything here rapidly
erodes and withers away.

364
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,625
I'm immune to it,
but everything else...

365
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,916
It all crumbles
to sand and becomes

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,041
a part of the desert,
including you.

367
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,291
I'm sure you can
already feel the moisture

368
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,958
draining from your bones.

369
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,333
Surrender now, or become
one with the wasteland.

370
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,875
Trust me on this one, Yozen.

371
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,916
You need to maintain
a human form,

372
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,791
or else the bad guys
might find you.

373
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,833
Okay!

374
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,250
I am a human, dammit.

375
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,375
[TAIKOBO]
Nobody's dying.

376
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,375
I won't let you
kill them. I won't!

377
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,416
[CHOTENKUN]
Wait. What is this?

378
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,833
You seem rather
interested in me.

379
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,375
So y'know what?

380
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,666
I'll show you.

381
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,583
[YOZEN]
Though there is one catch,

382
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,291
it'll cost you
your life to see it.

383
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,041
[OHTENKUN chuckles]

384
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,625
Just another 20 minutes
to go before we can unleash

385
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,166
a torrent of hellfire.

386
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,708
Kongrong Mountain will
vanish before our very eyes.

387
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,083
[chuckling]

388
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,208
[SUPUSHAN whimpers]

389
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,500
[OHTENKUN] You'd better
have a brilliant plan

390
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,916
if you're gonna escape
Chotenkun's Kosajin

391
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,458
in time to disarm the barrier.

392
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,666
If you break out
even one second late,

393
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,208
you won't have a
home to return to.

394
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,500
So let's see
the goods, "genius."

395
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,750
Show us what you're capable of.

396
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,250
I'm dying to see if you're
worthy of that nickname.

397
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:36,458
[YOZEN]
For Taikobo, and the others.

398
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,583
To live up to their trust in me.

399
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:43,083
That is why I'm
a Doshi of Kongrong.

400
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,916
[CHOTENKUN]
So that is his true form?

401
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:54,083
[YOZEN] I know what I am,
and it doesn't matter

402
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,500
what I was before.
