1
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,083
[YOZEN] I prefer to hide
behind a human form.

2
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,833
It's always been more
comfortable for me.

3
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,916
To say the least,
it's a lot easier to use

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,291
this false form in human society

5
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,000
as opposed to revealing
my true nature.

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,333
Although, embracing
this deception,

7
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,416
it meant I could never open my
heart to anyone but my master.

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,833
[YOZEN crying]

9
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,375
How about we get you
out of this rain, Yozen?

10
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,041
Don't want you to catch a cold.

11
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,166
[YOZEN] But I've never had
reason to open my heart.

12
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,041
I can do almost anything
you can imagine,

13
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,250
and I've never
needed anyone else.

14
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,791
But then... I met him.

15
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,291
And everything
I believed fell apart.

16
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,041
[TAIKOBO] Listen to me,
Supu, and don't turn around.

17
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,750
What're you talking about?

18
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,875
[TAIKOBO]
We've got somebody following us.

19
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,208
[SUPUSHAN]
What?

20
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,625
And it gets worse.

21
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,916
I'd recognize that
smell anywhere.

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,666
[SUPUSHAN]
Wait, their smell?

23
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,958
Oh, no, it smells like Da--

24
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,958
[TAIKOBO] Shh! Calm down!
Calm down, all right?

25
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,250
Listen, we'll turn around
on the count of three. One...

26
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,750
[SUPUSHAN]
Two...

27
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,958
[SUPUSHAN, TAIKOBO]
Three!

28
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,375
[DAKKI]
Ta-da!

29
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,916
[VOICES]
Do as before!

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,875
[SUPUSHAN, TAIKOBO]
Dakki!

31
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,375
It's been so long!

32
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,625
[SUPUSHAN, TAIKOBO yelling]

33
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,208
Help. My kness
got weak just now.

34
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,333
You know you can fly?

35
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,625
Hey, there, big boy.

36
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,458
I'm so glad you aren't
dead yet, Taikobo.

37
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,000
Why?

38
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,166
What is she doing all the way
out here in the countryside?

39
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,041
I'm here to kill you,
you silly goose!

40
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,458
Why else would I be
tromping around in the mud?

41
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,208
Oh, sweet Supushan.

42
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,000
[DAKKI] It breaks
my black heart to do it,

43
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,250
but you look too tasty to
not use my new paopei,

44
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,750
Sansento, on you.

45
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,750
You'll make for
a delicious sashimi!

46
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,333
Lay off him, Dakki!

47
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,250
[SUPUSHAN] Wait.
This doesn't make any sense.

48
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,916
The only time Dakki
ever lifts a finger

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,875
is to order her servants around.

50
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,541
But she came out here
on her own to kill us?

51
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,625
Is this some other kind of trap?

52
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, then.

53
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,666
You've got me all worked up
to see what you can do,

54
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,791
hot stuff.

55
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,791
Prepare to fall to
the ground bewitched

56
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,916
before my sexy figure!

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,291
[TAIKOBO laughing]

58
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,041
Sorry, I can't take it anymore!

59
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,375
You're killin' me, you phony!

60
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,541
So she's a fraud?

61
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,875
[TAIKOBO]
Of course she is!

62
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,375
I mean, sure, it looks and
smells identical to her,

63
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,166
but there's somethin' that's
just obviously not right.

64
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,708
The dead giveaway--
the real Dakki?

65
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,666
She's never once referred
to you as Supushan!

66
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,625
Only thing she's ever
called you is "Good Boy"!

67
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,791
[SUPUSHAN]
That's what did it?

68
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,333
[TAIKOBO]
And I know who she is.

69
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,291
I've heard stories
of a brilliant Doshi

70
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,958
who's mastered transformation.

71
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,291
And I believe his name was...

72
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,458
...Yozen!

73
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,416
All right, ya got me.

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,708
Seems my reputation's
worked against me.

75
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,291
[YOZEN] Kudos on seeing
through my disguise.

76
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,875
Well done, Taikobo.

77
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,458
I'm exactly who you say.

78
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,375
Yozen of Mount Gyoksen
in the Kone-rone Mountains.

79
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,458
Student of Gyoktei
Shinjin of Kinkdado.

80
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,250
Holy crap!
That is one good-lookin' guy!

81
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,250
Way more of a
convincing hero than you.

82
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,500
Hey, shut up!

83
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,625
You think he's so great,
consider this.

84
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,458
Everything Dakki just said
to us came out of his mouth.

85
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,875
And I think we can all agree
that he was trying his hardest

86
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,166
to seduce me just now.

87
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,416
[YOZEN]
All right, about that--

88
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,708
Can we maybe agree
to not bring it up again?

89
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,583
So... What is it
you want from me?

90
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,083
Because you gotta admit
that was a pretty bizarre way

91
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,125
to introduce yourself.

92
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,958
[YOZEN]
Master Genshi Tenson sent me.

93
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,541
This is all his idea.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,416
[YOZEN]
He ordered me to follow you,

95
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,708
and to assist you
with the Hoshin Project.

96
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,333
[TAIKOBO] That's about the
best news I've ever heard!

97
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,208
I'm more than happy
to let a genius like you

98
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,458
do all the hard work!

99
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,583
[YOZEN]
Not so fast.

100
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,625
I only agreed on one condition.

101
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,041
[TAIKOBO]
And that is...?

102
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,625
[YOZEN] That I first be allowed
to test you to find out

103
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,708
if you're genuinely
worthy of my assistance

104
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,000
on this crucial mission.

105
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,625
If you fail to live
up to my expectations,

106
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,291
well, I'll simply have to
carry out the Hoshin Project

107
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,666
in your place.

108
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,666
And defeat Dakki on my own.

109
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,375
Seriously?!

110
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,208
[YOZEN]
Go on and prove yourself.

111
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,458
Show me you're someone
to whom I can reveal

112
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,500
my true nature. Please.

113
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,958
[CHU]
Bunchu.

114
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,291
I have dispiriting news.

115
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,791
He betrayed us?

116
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,583
Hiko's forsaken Choka?

117
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,833
Your Majesty, there must
be some mistake.

118
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,666
I'm afraid not.

119
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,291
[BUNCHU]
He would never betray you.

120
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,083
Not without exceptional cause.

121
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,416
[BUNCHU]
Could it be...

122
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,333
[BUNCHU]
Hiko.

123
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,958
Hello, my love.

124
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,291
Kashi!

125
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,333
[KASHI] I'm off to pay
my visit to your sister.

126
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,291
I do hate that I can only
see her at the beginning

127
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,500
of the New Year.

128
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,166
So, you're going to
the forbidden palace?

129
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,750
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,208
Please be careful.

131
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,833
I wish that I could go with you,

132
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,333
but no man is allowed
within the forbidden palace.

133
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,666
I know.

134
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,666
[DAKKI]
Well look at that!

135
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,958
If it isn't the
Buseioh's wife! Wow!

136
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,041
Oh, yeah?

137
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,708
[KASHI]
Dakki?

138
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,416
[DAKKI] It's been so long,
come on, let's have a drink!

139
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,583
[KASHI]
Uh, well...

140
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,208
--Thank you, but I--
--[DAKKI] Loosen up!

141
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,458
[DAKKI laughs]

142
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,291
[KASHI]
She really is a gorgeous woman,

143
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,625
but what's lurking
in that beautiful head?

144
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,125
[KOH SHI]
Sister!

145
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,333
I explicitly told you
to no longer visit me!

146
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,666
Don't you understand what's
happening in the capital

147
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,916
right now?

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,708
[KASHI]
I'm sorry, Koh Shi.

149
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,125
This is not what
I was expecting.

150
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,291
[ATTENDANT 3A]
My empress.

151
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,041
Emperor Chu has
arrived as you requested.

152
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,333
[KOH SHI, KASHI gasp]

153
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,541
[DAKKI]
Finally.

154
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,500
It certainly took
him long enough.

155
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,916
The Emperor?

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,666
Empress, you know this is wrong!

157
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,041
It's improper for the Emperor
to meet his retainer's wife!

158
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,291
[CHU]
I'm here, Dakki!

159
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,541
The life of the party
has officially arrived!

160
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,916
Who is that?

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
[DAKKI] This lovely creature
is the Buseioh's wife.

162
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,250
It is?

163
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,333
Please, forgive my intrusion.

164
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,291
Now, wait.

165
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,541
Are you so sure?

166
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,750
Kashi is an extraordinarily
beautiful woman.

167
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,708
I couldn't even dream
of competing with

168
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,250
her staggering beauty.

169
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,083
Well, one look
won't kill anyone.

170
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,458
Dakki!

171
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,291
Why are you encouraging this?

172
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,625
Wait!

173
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,250
C'mon, just let me have a really
quick little peek at your face!

174
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,583
[CHU laughing]

175
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,583
There's nowhere left for you
to run, my lovely Kashi.

176
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,458
Oh, wow.

177
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,250
I wouldn't say you're
as beautiful as Dakki,

178
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,291
but I'd definitely rank
you in the top five.

179
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,291
Don't you dare
lay a finger on me.

180
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,291
I'm the wife of the
Buseioh, Koh Hiko,

181
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,000
and I'm proud of that fact.

182
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,958
He's the only man
I will allow to touch me.

183
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,958
And I refuse to be dishonored.

184
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,625
[CHU]
Such a fine woman.

185
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,791
Now I truly want
to make you mine.

186
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,083
Please, Your Majesty,
don't do this!

187
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,875
[DAKKI] What belongs
to the Emperor's servants

188
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,916
belongs to the Emperor.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,791
And you will belong to me.

190
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,416
If I refuse you,

191
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,166
I know my husband will
be punished as well.

192
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,166
So I acquiesce.

193
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,500
For this moment,

194
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,958
I belong to the Emperor.

195
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,166
[KASHI]
I may be in your possession,

196
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,125
but you will never
claim my heart.

197
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,583
Kashi!

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,041
[KOH SHI]
No! Oh, god, Kashi!

199
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,583
I... I'm sorry.

200
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,041
My detainment here has
only shackled my brother

201
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,333
and his wife to your tyranny.

202
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,666
[CHU]
Koh Shi!

203
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,250
This is for you, brother.

204
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,458
Through death,
I gift you your freedom.

205
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,250
[KOH MEI]
Hiko!

206
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,333
I'm sorry, but I
have terrible news!

207
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,250
You're gonna test me?

208
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,750
[YOZEN] To be precise,
you'll undergo three tests.

209
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,625
Well, two more,
as the first is complete.

210
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,000
You faced your greatest foe.

211
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,875
I confronted you
in the guise of Dakki

212
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,166
and you stood your ground.

213
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,708
All while retaining
your composure.

214
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,208
Therefore you passed.

215
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,666
That's great, but you
said I've still got

216
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,416
two more to go?

217
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,250
[YOZEN]
That's correct.

218
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,541
Shall we continue?

219
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,833
--[SUPUSHAN yells]
--Oh, crap, Supu!

220
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,750
Hey, what are you doing?
Leave me alone!

221
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,041
Stop it, let me go, you mutt!

222
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,125
[TAIKOBO]
That dog...

223
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,000
It's not a spirit beast.

224
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,083
[YOZEN]
Right you are.

225
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,416
He's actually my
paopei, Kotenken.

226
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,125
Now then. Kotenken.

227
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,458
Go ahead and sink your
teeth into Supushan.

228
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,000
[SUPUSHAN yells]

229
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,041
[TAIKOBO]
Supu, no!

230
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,583
Here's how this goes.

231
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,875
You fight me in earnest and
show your true power for once,

232
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,291
or Supushan will die.

233
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,541
I need to see how
strong you really are.

234
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,166
This is your second test.

235
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,708
[TAIKOBO]
Come on, Supu, fight!

236
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,291
Just bite the big, fluffy,
damn dog back!

237
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,208
What?! I can't do that!

238
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,625
You know I'm not a fighter!
I'm a hider or a die-er!

239
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,541
[YOZEN] Are you really going to
keep playing dumb and weak?

240
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,541
Quit stalling and fight me!

241
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,125
What's wrong with you?

242
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,083
Why didn't you dodge
the attack, Master?

243
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,416
Look, Yozen.

244
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,375
You and I both know it
won't make any difference

245
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,250
who wins or loses this fight.

246
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,666
That's good enough for me.

247
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,625
You stood in the
direct path of danger

248
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,750
and stared it down
without even flinching.

249
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,416
As far as scoring goes,
you passed that test

250
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,958
with flying colors.

251
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,416
And the sun sets over Yin.

252
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,916
[HIKO]
Your Majesty.

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,791
I request a training match.

254
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,333
[CHU]
So you've come.

255
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,833
[SHINKOHYO] Seems I've
shown up just in time

256
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,833
for quite the spectacle.

257
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:12,916
You're here!

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,541
Hi, Shinkohyo!

259
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,916
[HIKO yelling]

260
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,708
What happened was
a tragic accident!

261
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,708
I know it wasn't your fault.

262
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,083
But that fact doesn't
change anything.

263
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,583
I have to do this.

264
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,125
It's the only way to
truly settle the score!

265
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,208
[HIKO grunts]

266
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,708
[YOZEN]
This is what Yin has come to.

267
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,125
All of those people have
fled Choka to head for Seiki.

268
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,250
But they have to pass
through the checkpoint,

269
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,083
Rintokan, to get there.

270
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,125
And in all reality, they'll
be refused and sent back.

271
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,041
This will provide the
basis for your third test.

272
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,125
Ensure that these
powerless people safely

273
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,916
make it past the checkpoint.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This will not be an easy task,

275
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,708
but if you succeed, I'll
acknowledge you as my superior.

276
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,125
[TAIKOBO growling]

Who do you think you are,
you arrogant jerk?

through hoops just to get

279
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,500
your nod of approval?!

280
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,291
[TAIKOBO]
You call this a test?

281
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,916
'Cuz it sounds like you're
passing the buck to me!

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,416
Why don't you go down there?

283
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,000
Let's see you help
those poor refugees!

284
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,583
But all right.

285
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,791
I'm not gonna run and back
down from your challenge.

286
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,458
Not if I wanna look
myself in the mirror.

287
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:31,333
Heh heh. But Yozen, you push
me into a corner like this,

288
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,708
I'm gonna get mean.

Let's do this, Supu!

Uh, roger that!

is he planning to pull?

Look at that.

294
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,041
The Buseioh's martial
arts skills come close

295
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,708
to rivaling that of a Sennin.

296

when so many of your
people are still in Choka?

absolutely sickens me!

unleash his cruelty on me,

00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,041
Master Genshi Tenson,

320
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,708
you appointed the wrong
Doshi to this project.

321
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,958
And I was wrong.

322
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,166
Wrong to have harbored
any hope in him.

323
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,416
[YOZEN]
Go on and prove yourself.

324
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,958
Show me you're someone to whom
I can reveal my true nature.

325
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,000
Please.

326
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,291
[YOZEN]
Transform!

327
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,333
Spectacular work, great Doshi!

328
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,708
Just look at them all
running for their lives.

329
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,125
Actually, we're not done yet.

330
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,458
Uh, Buseioh?

331
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,333
Why've you come out here?

332
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,291
[HIKO]
To get some answers from you.

333
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,625
Some answers?

334
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,708
Why aren't you letting these
people pass through?

335
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,500
I... Well, sir, uh...

336
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,375
I was given these orders
from the Empress!

337
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,875
The Empress has chosen
to rescind that decree.

338
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,875
Those who want to leave are
allowed to pass from now on.

339
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:14,875
Yes, sir!

340
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,416
[TAIKOBO]
Don't fall for this!

341
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,666
That man is obviously
not the Buseioh!

342
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,375
Can't you tell that
he's a fraud?

343
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,166
He's an impostor?

344
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,791
Now that you mention it...

345
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,041
Is that so?

346
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,875
Why don't you
think this through?

347
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,791
Are you going to believe
your commanding chief

348
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,250
or this unknown Doshi?

349
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,208
[TAIKOBO]
Huh...?

350
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,833
I want you to apprehend this
suspicious Doshi at once!

351
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,500
[TAIKOBO yelling]

352
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,458
Oh, poor Master.

353
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,375
You have my gratitude, Buseioh.

354
00:18:56,458 --> 00:19:00,250
This insane Doshi nearly had
me fooled with his ramblings.

355
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,666
[YOZEN]
Something's off here.

356
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,833
It's not like Supushan
to go along with this

357
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,375
without chastising him,

358
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,375
but he didn't voice
a word of protest.

359
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,291
Y'know, Master, if you keep
pulling stunts like this,

360
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,791
people are gonna
end up hating you

361
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,708
no matter how much
you're trying to help them.

362
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,833
[YOZEN] The refugees actually
got through the checkpoint.

363
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,333
Not only that, but the
only person who got hurt

364
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,375
was Taikobo himself.

365
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,541
Brilliant.

366
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,541
--Piece of crap!
--Stop! Get away from him!

367
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,833
Leave him alone!

368
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,250
You're a real slippery bastard.

369
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,666
[YOZEN]
Well done, Taikobo.

370
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,708
Tricking me to
save those people.

371
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,750
It was a true stroke of genius.

372
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,500
You aced the test.

373
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,833
You hear that, Supu?

374
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,666
The genius said my acting
was a stroke of genius!

375
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,541
Yeah, you're a Doshi,
but your greatest strength

376
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,500
might be deception.

377
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,666
And that is exactly the problem!

378
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,750
I mean, I'm the one
who's supposed to be

379
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,250
the master of deception.

380
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,791
But you so easily saw right
through my Dakki disguise.

381
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,250
So my acting skills
must be sorely lacking.

382
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,500
I have no choice but to
return to the Sennin world

383
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,541
in order to perfect my craft.

384
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,958
[TAIKOBO]
Wait, what?

385
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,958
Are you saying you're not
gonna team up with me now?

386
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,458
[DAKKI (YOZEN)]
No, not just yet.

387
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,833
I am a diehard
perfectionist after all.

388
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,541
Well then, ta-ta
for now, Taikobo!

389
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,750
[laughing]

390
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,166
[TAIKOBO]
Okay.

391
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,125
He really gets a kick out
of pretending to be Dakki.

392
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,125
[YOZEN] I know what kind
of Doshi he is now,

393
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,333
and maybe he could
understand me.

394
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,875
Maybe even go so far
as to trust me.

395
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:46,791
Although, that won't make
it any easier to tell him.

396
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,333
But he deserves
to know the truth.

397
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,250
[YOZEN]
Taikobo.

398
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,083
There's a storm brewing
in the skies over Choka.

399
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,208
Hurry to the west
before it's too late.

400
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,333
When the time arises,
I'll appear again

401
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,125
to assist you on your quest.

402
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,166
I promise that
I won't let you down.

403
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,375
[CHU] The Buseioh's
family left yesterday.

404
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,916
They've deserted Choka
to flee towards Seiki.

405
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,625
I'm allowing them to leave
without any interference.

406
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,458
[BUNCHU] If Hiko allies
himself with Seiki,

407
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,375
that could be enough for
the people to acknowledge

408
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,833
Kisho as the true king.

409
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,791
If Seiki gains any more power,

410
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,583
we'll have no choice
but to crush it.

411
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,250
Regardless of the
centuries that I've lived,

412
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,291
you always acted as though
you were my older brother.

413
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:13,000
But, no matter what I said,
it never bothered me.

414
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:18,500
Hiko, you were the one person
I could open my heart to.

415
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,166
[KOKUKIRIN]
Master Bunchu.

416
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,291
[BUNCHU]
Kokukirin.

417
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,791
Summon the Shisei
of Kuryu Island.

418
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,125
[KOKUKIRIN]
The Shisei?

419
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:32,416
Then, you truly do intend
to defeat Koh Hiko.

420
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,875
He must be stopped.

421
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,666
For the sake of Yin
and Emperor Chu.

422
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,958
[KOKUKIRIN]
Understood.

423
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,208
I'll bring them.

424
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,000
[BUNCHU]
Hiko.

425
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,208
I have no choice
but to see you dead.

426
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,083
We once walked
the same path together,

427
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,541
but this is where it splits.
