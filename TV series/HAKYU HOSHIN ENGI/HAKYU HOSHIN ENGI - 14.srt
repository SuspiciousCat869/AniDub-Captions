...as I prefer.

00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,833
I didn't need anyone.

[TAIITSU] All right,
time for your repairs.

00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,458
Get the hell away from me.

7
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,875
[TAIITSU] If I do that,
you'll never move again,

8
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,041
and we wouldn't want
that, now would we?

00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,416
If I hurt you, raise your
hand and let me know.

10
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,708
I can see right through you.

11
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,541
Since you couldn't
defeat me with skill,

12
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,875
you used your paopei.

13

A coward only relies
on his weapons.

I know you've always
wanted Kinsen and Kaseno,

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,750
and lately I've been
thinking very seriously

16
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,458
about giving them to you.

17
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,166
Really?

18
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,166
Of course, but there's
one condition.

Care to guess what?

20
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,916
[NATAKU] You want me to go
and join Taikobo, right?

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,208
Yes. So, let's see how you feel.

22
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:47,000
[TAIITSU]
Any pain or discomfort?

23

No.

24
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,958
[NATAKU] Fighting against
powerful opponents

25
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,708
was more than a mission.

26
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,000
It was the breath
that gave me life--

No enemy stands a
chance against you.

I'm well aware of that

and I'll destroy
every last one of them.

You were created to fight.

It fuels your soul--
renews your spirit.

I pray that you will
one day use your gifts

00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:34,500
to fight for Mount Kongrong--
no, for this entire world.

Is that so?

44
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,791
You could say that.

00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:55,958
[NATAKU]
I see.

00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,750
I hope I get to
fight you one day.

Well, perhaps we'll
both be so fortunate.

I intend to align with Taikobo.

Stay close to him and we will
meet again quite soon.

Tell me, why have you
traveled so far from home?

the truth about who I am.

You know my father.

Will you give him a message for
me the next time you see him?

Tell him:

66

"I'm human."

You need to maintain

Can I face Bunchu?

Will I be able to fight somebody
who I used to call "friend"?

In truth, I don't
think I can kill him.

pretty hard to believe.

Even if I did find the man,

110
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,791

It's so obvious.

The whole reason
all the Kingo Sennin

have been impossible to find
is because they're hiding!

I'm pretty sure Ohtenkun's bug

wasn't the only one of its kind.

They're all over Kingo Island,

00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,916
Listen to me.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,333
Our allies are
catching an illness

166
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,000
that seems to only
affect Sennin and Doshi.

167
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,458
Here's what you do.

168
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,833
Figure out a way to gather
them together and heal them.

169
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,416
I'm on it!

170
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,708
I don't know where everyone is,
but I promise I'll find them.

171
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,208
[TAIKOBO]
Thanks, Bukichi.

172
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,833
I'm counting on you.

173
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,583
[FUGEN] It sounds to me
like the only ones

174
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,000
even capable of movement
right now are Bukichi, Nataku,

175
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,958
and our faithful spirit beast,
Supushan, over here.

176
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,083
Not sure how that's
fair. [chuckles]

177
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,416
[TAIKOBO]
Not sure why you're laughin'.

178
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,625
New plan!

179
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,125
Bunchu and the rest
of the Juttenkun

180
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,416
will just have to wait.

181
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,666
We shouldn't attempt an attack
when everyone's feeling so weak.

182
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,791
We have to find Ohtenkun first.

183
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,500
If we're one man down,
shouldn't you rest, too?

184
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,791
Not everybody gets to nap
whenever they want like you do.

185
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,416
I'm coming with you.
Just gimme a minute.

186
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,375
[TAIKOBO] Oh, no problem!
Please, take your time!

187
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,708
[IGO] Huh. Looks like
they're headin' this way.

188
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,333
That damn Taikobo just
can't keep still, can he?

189
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,625
[IGO] Thank goodness
Master gave me this radar.

190
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:06,125
Never would've
found him otherwise.

191
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,375
Maybe he's got somethin' on him

192
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,333
that can help me keep
these stupid bugs away.

193
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,125
[TAIKOBO groans]

194
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,500
I have to draw
the line somewhere

195
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,291
and I can't stand
seeing you like this.

196
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,791
I'm gonna take you back!

197
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:18,916
[TAIKOBO]
Don't you dare!

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,375
[SUPUSHAN]
Why?

199
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,166
Okay, fine, but it's your
fault if something happens.

200
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,208
[gasps]

201
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,916
Who are you?

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,583
[IGO] It's good to finally
meet you, too, Taikobo.

203
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,958
Though you're smaller
than I expected you to be.

204
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,500
I'm Doko Tenson's pupil.

205
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,458
My name's Igo, and we-go...

206
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,166
...nna be... good friends.

207
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,208
[SUPUSHAN yells]

208
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,458
That was a dad joke!

209
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,291
The pun was so bad,
it's killing me!

210
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,250
Calm down, Supu!
You're making it worse!

211
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,625
[TAIKOBO]
I heard about you from Doko.

212
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,791
Hey, wait a minute.

213
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,000
Those mites aren't
affecting you at all?

214
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,333
What mites?

215
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,250
Oh, these purple bugs
that keep crawlin' on me?

216
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,166
I try to crush 'em
as soon as they land.

217
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,166
I have very sensitive skin,
so they tickle like crazy.

218
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,958
[TAIKOBO]
You also have very quick hands!

219
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,208
He's swatting them before
they can take effect.

220
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,916
His sensitive skin
is saving him!

221
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,416
Oh, is that the way it works?

222
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,500
[OHTENKUN] So, some of them
aren't affected by my bugs.

223
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,500
I'll need to find some
other way to eliminate them.

224
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,916
But first...

225
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,833
Hello, Yozen!

226
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,291
I've been expecting you.

227
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,291
[gasps]

228
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,791
[HIKO] Looks like we're at
the very bottom of the island.

229
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,458
Those sisters have to be close.

230
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,666
[VENUS] Well, if it isn't
Hiko and his little boy!

231
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,208
Now some might argue that
our beauty is quite wicked,

232
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,208
but how can it be when
it led you gentlemen

233
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,166
all the way down
here to find us?

234
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,916
Unfortunately for
you both, I'm taken.

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,875
But I adore a man who's
willing to fight for me.

236
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,708
Should we ignore the fact
that we just crashed

237
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,916
some kinda weirdo costume party?

238
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,583
[VENUS]
Wait! I almost forgot to ask!

239
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,291
How's your health, Tenka?

240
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,833
Are you feeling all right?

241
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,791
[gasps]

242
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,208
[QUEEN]
Look what I found!

243
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,625
One of Ohtenkun's
parasitic paopei!

244
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,250
These little guys attach
themselves to Sennin and Doshi

245
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,083
and suck every last drop
of their strength.

246
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,458
[BOTH gasp]

247
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,833
[VENUS laughs]

248
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,541
It's no costume party, honey.

249
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,208
There's way more than hotness
to our sexy couture!

250
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,291
This paopei fabric is
fashionable and functional.

251
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,750
It's called Mysterious Veil

252
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,375
and it repels any paopei
that would try to weaken us.

253
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,958
[TENKA] Where exactly
were you carrying those?

254
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,416
Just so I understand,

255
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,458
Tenka's sick because
of these insects?

256
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,791
[VENUS]
Correct.

257
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,250
Then please stop wasting
time and help him out.

258
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,125
Dad, what are you doing?

259
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,333
There might not be
much we can do.

260
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,666
Your son already has the mark
of infestation on his arm.

261
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,625
At this point, your best
option is going to be

262
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,541
defeating their creator,
Ohtenkun, himself.

263
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,916
However, in the meantime,

264
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,958
the good nurse Venus
is ordering him to take

265
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,458
two of these Sento extract
pills three times a day.

266
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,000
It's not a cure, I'm afraid,

267
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,166
but he should regain about
50 percent of his strength.

268
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,916
Figures it would be Ohtenkun.

269
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,041
[DOKO]
Nataku...

270
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,000
[DOKO groans]

271
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm so sorry, but I'm not
feeling very well today

272
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,958
because I've come down
with a mysterious illness.

273
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:36,291
You'll have to fight without us,
but don't worry, we'll be okay.

274
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,500
[NATAKU]
All right.

275
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,333
I wasn't finished yet,
you big idiot!

276
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,791
Have you lost all three
of your brain cells?

277
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,541
I'm a sweet, adorable child!

278
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,791
What kind of monster would
just turn and walk away?

279
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,291
I guess his other
personalities are awake.

280
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,583
Listen up, you mindless
human paopei!

281
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,958
When someone says,
"Don't worry, we'll be okay,"

282
00:15:56,041 --> 00:16:00,125
that means, "Worry!
We'll absolutely not be okay!"

283
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,250
--[DOKO yells]
--[NATAKU] Shut up.

284
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,333
You can take care of the
Twelve Sennin yourself.

285
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,833
[DOKO] Ow! There's no reason
to be cruel to someone so cute.

286
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,458
Just wait until I tell Taiitsu!

287
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,708
Oh, good grief.

288
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,791
[NATAKU]
This smell.

289
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,708
That strong Doshi is close.

290
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,166
But why is he here?

291
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,625
His last fight
nearly killed him,

292
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,750
so he should still be resting.

293
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,000
And yet, he's here
deep inside Kingo Island

294
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,916
and giving off a scent
that broadcasts his weakness.

295
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,583
[NATAKU groans]

296
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,250
[TAIKOBO]
So, Igo.

297
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,333
I know you just got here
but I have a request.

298
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,833
I need your help finding Nataku.

299
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,333
That name rings a bell.

300
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,875
The human paopei, right?

301
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,208
[TAIKOBO]
Yeah.

302
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,083
You two are probably the
only ones who haven't been

303
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,291
affected by the parasites
and can fight right now.

304
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,083
Knowing Ohtenkun,
he'll target you guys next.

305
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,250
He won't waste his time
on those of us who are dying.

306
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,541
So it makes the most sense
for you to join Nataku

307
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,500
and fight together.

308
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,625
All right, it's finished.

309
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,666
Here you go.

310
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,583
I modified your radar for you.

311
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,416
You should be able to find
Nataku's exact coordinates.

312
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,000
[IGO]
Thank you very much.

313
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,083
So, about my pay,
uh, what am I gettin'?

314
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,250
Huh?

315
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,416
[IGO]
What's that look for?

316
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,000
You can't get without givin'.

317
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,250
I just met you guys.

318
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,208
I'm not doin'
your deeds for free.

319
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,125
I need compensation.

320
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,166
But wouldn't working for free
make you feel more charitable?

321
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,208
Trust me, you're the only
one who cares about that.

322
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,583
Uh, here, let's see.

323
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,541
I definitely owe you
something special.

324
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,333
Behold! A Homan Sento
of the highest quality

325
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,458
that you can only find
once in a century!

326
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,666
Homan?

327
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,958
Oh, yeah, I know it
well. It's legendary!

328
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,416
I accept!

329
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,458
Of course you do and
I now feel very good

330
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,916
about our working relationship.

331
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,458
You're giving him
a legendary what?

332
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,375
[TAIKOBO]
That reminds me!

333
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,500
Supu!

334
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,208
I have an important
job for you, too.

335
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,166
Yeah?

336
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,833

[NATAKU grunts]

338
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,958
[NATAKU]
There he is.

339
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,625
[NATAKU]
Hey.

340
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,666
Ah, Nataku.

341
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,458
I figured you'd still
be alive and well.

342
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,875
You're not moving.

343
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,916
You must be too weak
to fight at the moment.

344
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,625
I'll defeat you one day
when you're at your best.

345
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,625
But as for right now,
go back home.

346
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,000
[YOZEN]
Thank you.

347

[NATAKU grunts]

348
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,500
Piggyback!

00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,583
[NATAKU grunts]

350
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,000
Yo!

351
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,333
Sorry to surprise you,

352
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:51,083
but I'm Igo who's Igo-ing
where you're Igo-ing.

353
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,458
[NATAKU grunts]

354
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,166
Get off me!

355
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,666

[gasps]

357
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,083
[YOZEN]
We've arrived.

358
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,416
Kotenken.

359
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,833
Thank you for remembering
the scent so accurately.

360
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,291
Ohtenkun...

361
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,666
...you were a fool to think
I'd give up so easily!

362
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,041
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

363
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,666
[IGO]
That was the genius Doshi Yozen?

364
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,000
Why does he have horns?

365
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:40,875
[YOZEN gasps]

366
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,125
I don't know what
that symbol is,

367
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,333
but it doesn't
belong to Ohtenkun!

368
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,291
[YOTENKUN]
Welcome, friends.

369
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,125
Ohtenkun couldn't
make it, unfortunately,

370
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,625
but he knew you
would show up here.

371
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,500
He's graciously
sent the two of us

372
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,208
to deal with you in his stead.

373
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,166
[YOTENKUN]
My name is Yotenkun...

374
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,208
...and this is Kinko Seibo.

375
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,958
[IGO whistles]

376
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:18,375
[IGO] So this is the spatial
paopei I've heard so much about.

377
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,500
You'll die in this
multi-dimensional space,

378
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,875
guaranteed.

379
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,541
I had thought that
we'd only be facing

380
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,583
one member of the Juttenkun,
but it appears two have decided

381
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,250
to appropriate
this space together.

382
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,125
[NATAKU grunts]

383
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,791
What? See something?

384
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,166
What is it?

385
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:44,958
[OHTENKUN chuckling]

386
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,625
[YOZEN gasps]

387
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,208
[YOZEN]
Ohtenkun!

388
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,500
You destroyed everything
important to me

389
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,500
and now I'll make you pay!

390
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,291
[YOZEN]
Master.

391
00:20:56,375 --> 00:21:00,208
I know the blood that flows
through me is that of a <i>yokai</i> ,

392
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,375
but...

393
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,375
Oh? You certainly
recovered quickly.

394
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,375
But you are the child
of Tsuten Kyoshu.

395
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,750
Wait, what did he just say?

396
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,250
[YOZEN]
I may be his descendant,

397
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,583
but you raised me as
a Doshi of Kongrong!

398
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,833
[BOTH gasp]

399
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,625
[DAKKI]
Salutations, Lady Joka.

400
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:24,041
It has been far too long
since we last saw each other.

401
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,791
We've been having a lively time
and there's so much to tell you!

402
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,208
[DAKKI]
Just look--

403
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:42,666
the Sennin World War appears to
have reached a turning point!

404
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,750
In other words,

405
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,041
things are progressing
exactly as you commanded,

406
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,791
so congratulations are in order!
