1
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,750
[DAKKI]
It's been 600 years now.

2
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,333
That's when it all began.

3
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,125
I had the same comfy
setup I've got now.

4
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,583
I possessed the queen
at the time, Bakki,

5
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:49,208
and took my rightful place
living inside the palace.

6
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,041
[DAKKI gasps]

7
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,000
[DAKKI]
He also lived in the palace,

8
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,291
but that should
go without saying,

9
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,083
considering his status
in the government.

10
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,250
[DAKKI] He is the first
emperor of the Yin Dynasty,

11
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,833
Emperor Toh.

12
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,333
[DAKKI] So I decided that
I would make a similar plan

13
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,041
and run with it.

14
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:34,458
At long last... we finally meet.

15
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:11,000
[OHTENKUN chuckling]

16
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:17,125
[OHTENKUN chuckling]

17
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,875
[OHTENKUN] Oh, the absurd,
tragic irony of humanity.

18
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,625
Gyokutei got himself killed

19
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:28,291
and Yozen's deepest, darkest
secret has been exposed.

20
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,416
[OHTENKUN chuckling]

21
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,708
[OHTENKUN chuckling]

22
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,750
This is so damn funny,
my sides are splitting open.

23
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,625
He's lookin' pretty rough.

24
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,500
You'd better hope
that he survives this.

25
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,916
Just forget it, Supu.

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,875
We're leaving.

27
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,541
Seriously, Master?

28
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,208
We need to treat
Yozen's injuries.

29
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,750
Oh, right.

30
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,833
Yozen's one of
the strongest Doshi.

31
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,208
How can he be drained like this?

32
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,750
This is your work.

33
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,000
You did something
to him, didn't you?

34
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,458
Hey, I said I'd give him back,

35
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,000
but I never said that
he'd be unharmed.

36
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,333
Oh, c'mon.

37
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,625
I just played a little
trick on him, that's all.

38
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,000
You see that pattern on his neck
that looks like a wicked tattoo?

39
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,666
Well, it continuously
slams him with damage,

40
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,083
just as if I were attacking
him with my paopei.

41
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,000
You should be grateful
that I chose to let

42
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,083
your little "genius" live.

43
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,166
[TAIKOBO] I'm gonna make
you pay for this, Ohtenkun.

44
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,125
Mark my words.

45
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, don't get all
histrionic on me.

46
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,750
I've lost two of
my own guys, y'know.

47
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,708
We're even now.

48
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,875
[YOZEN]
Master...

49
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,041
[TAIITSU]
According to our intel,

50
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,833
all of Kingo Island is governed
from its control room,

51
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,875
located in the core.

52
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,958
Logically, we can safely
assume that's where Bunchu is.

53
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,375
Maybe you should
explain yourself, Taikobo!

54
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,666
Gyokutei's soul was
released to the Hoshindai

55
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,916
and Yozen's on
the verge of death!

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,583
[TAIKOBO]
Gyokutei--

57
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,583
He was determined
to save his pupil,

58
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,625
even knowing that he
was walking into a trap.

59
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,166
What happened was tragic,

60
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,041
but Yozen is back home
and being cared for now.

61
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,333
Should we tell them what
we found out about him?

62
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,250
Don't go there, Supu.

63
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,291
Let's leave the decision to
tell everyone up to Yozen.

64
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,791
[SUPUSHAN]
Of course.

65
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:27,916
Let's avenge them!

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,416
Damn straight!

67
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,541
[KOSEISHI] I say we all storm
Kingo Island immediately!

68
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,750
[JIKO]
Yeah!

69
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,833
There's no reason for
us to hold back now!

70
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,125
We must fight--

71
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,166
fight for Gyokutei Shinjin!

72
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,125
[ALL] We'll fight for
Gyokutei Shinjin!

73
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,541
[DOTOKU, JIKO]
Let's make 'em pay, Taikobo!

74
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,458
Slow down.

75
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,291
[JIKO]
Huh?

76
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,125
[ALL]
What?

77
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,458
[DOTOKU gasps]

78
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,000
We need to act swiftly!

79
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,875
We can't sit around and
waste time formulating plans!

80
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,791
I've dealt with the
Juttenkun's paopei

81
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,416
and it's like nothing we've
ever experienced before.

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
They use space itself
as a weapon.

83
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,833
What's that mean?

84
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,833
It's too risky.

85
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,666
If we all rush in there at once,

86
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,916
we could easily be pulled into
a dimension of their creation

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,458
and get wiped out
in one fell swoop.

88
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,791
So instead,

89
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,625
we should divide ourselves
up into several teams,

90
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,375
each one taking a different
root to infiltrate Kingo.

91
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,666
Wait, teams?

92
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,458
Supu! You know what to do!

93
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,208
I'm on it!

94
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,833
[NATAKU]
The hell is this?

95
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,916
[TAIITSU] Maybe he's
picking teams by lottery?

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
[NATAKU]
That's stupid.

97
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,166
All right!
Everybody, form a line.

98
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,750
[ALL]
Uh, yeah.

99
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,416
[TAIKOBO]
Each of you gets a single spin.

100
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,416
[ALL]
Right.

101
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,375
[ALL chattering]

102
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,791
What's gonna happen?
What're ya gonna get?

103
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,375
What're ya gonna get?!

104
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,625
[DOTOKU]
Hey, I got a blue one!

105
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,333
[ALL gasp, laugh]

106
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,916
[JIKO]
I got a yellow ball!

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,708
[BOTH] What color is it gonna
be? What color is it gonna be?

108
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,041
I can't wait to see what it is!

109
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,875
[ALL gasp, laugh]

110
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,083
Whoa! Don't spin it so hard!

111
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,416
You're gonna break
the thing! Ah!

112
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,625
[ALL laughing]

113
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,083
[DOTOKU]
Bull's eye!

114
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,666
Oh, what are you gonna get?
What color's it gonna be?

115
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,583
Let's see what it is. C'mon.

116
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,875
It's red! I got red!

117
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,041
Who else is red?

118
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,041
[DOKO]
Me! I've got red!

119
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,541
Yay! The three of us are
gonna make for a great team!

120
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,625
[KORYU]
Yeah. Let's do this.

121
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,125
[NATAKU]
I'm fine on my own.

122
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,375
[ALL chattering]

123
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,666
[TAIKOBO sighs]
Looks like we've got our teams.

124
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,625
'Kay. So I'm the
only one left to go.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Huh? It's purple.

126
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,000
[FUGEN] I guess that makes
the two of us a team, Bo.

127
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah?

128
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,000
[FUGEN chuckles]

129
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,666
Purple is too plain,
so let's be Team Mulberry.

130
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,458
Uh... yay.

131
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,750
[ALL]
All right! Let's do this!

132
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,833
[TAIKOBO]
Uh, hey, wait.

133
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,458
Let's have a do-over,
just this once!

134
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,291
Sorry, guys, but two
people doesn't exactly make

135
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,250
for that much of
a team, does it now?

136
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,666
Not really.

137
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,916
I suppose not.

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,416
I've got a rather
talented pupil named Igo

139
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,958
who's just on the verge of
finally coming into his own.

140
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,083
Would you like me to
send him with you?

141
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,416
Igo?

142
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
[DOKO]
Like I said, he's quite skilled,

143
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,083
but he's got some
problems with discipline.

144
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,083
You could help me out
and set him straight.

145
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,041
[YOZEN wheezing]

146
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,541
[TAIKOBO] Master, has Yozen
shown any improvement

147
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,250
since we returned?

148
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,833
[GENSHI]
Mm.

149
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,750
I'm having Unchushi give him a
thorough examination right now.

150
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,458
I have to say,
this is an interesting

151
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,916
experimental subject,

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,291
and by that, I mean an utterly
terrifying medical case.

153
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,083
From what I can ascertain,

154
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,041
this mark on his neck
was made by a paopei.

155
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,166
Really?

156
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,666
[UNCHUSHI]
Indeed.

157
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,416
It's a microscopic paopei
creature that resembles a mite

158
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,750
and attaches itself to
parasitically feed off

159
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,333
Sennin and Doshi.

160

It's remarkable, really.

161
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,000
This little beast?

162
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,458
Once it latches onto a host,

163
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,791
it drains you of your energy
until you're depleted

164
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,375
and the nonstop onslaught of
exhaustion finally kills you.

[TAIKOBO]
I see.

166
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:04,000
This thing itself is
actually Ohtenkun's paopei.

[GENSHI]
What can we do?

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,041
[UNCHUSHI]
I hate to tell you this, but...

169
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,083
...my prognosis is
that it's not possible

170
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,833
to surgically remove it.

171

embedded within him.

[UNCHUSHI]
Medically, no,

175
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,083
but there is still
one way to save him...

176
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,250

Go on.

Someone must kill the Sennin
who dispatched this paopei

Well, we're here. Now what?

183
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,916
[TENKA] I'd guess we should be
ready to fight before too long.

184

[VENUS] It'll happen soon
enough. Just remember--

the only enemies we really
need to concern ourselves with

186
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,250
are the Juttenkun, Bunchu,
and Tsuten Kyoshu himself.

187

The rest of Kingo's

She's plummeting to her death

but she's still
stuffing her face?

a little mixed up.

Hang on.

320
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,583
I'm gonna get us close.

Up we go!

There!

00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,375
[TENKA groaning]
So heavy.

325
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,041
It's stupid how
giant you are, Dad.

326
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,583
[HIKO] Hey, you better not be
calling your father stupid!

327
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,625
Sorry, not how I meant it.

328
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,208
We're getting closer, though!

329
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,000
[TOTENKUN]
Let's bring the wind up a notch.

330
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,666
Eighty meters per second.

Ouch!

338
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,291
[HIKO sighs]
Looks like we're safe for now.

339
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,291
Hey, Hito, you alive down there?

340
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,500
You haven't talked in ages

341
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,125
so I kind've already
thought you were dead.

342
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,333
Have you ever considered how
abusive this relationship is?!

Stop doing that!
you're gonna kill me!

[HIKO]
It's you or us!

347
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,458
Wow, Dad, that's messed up.

348
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,041
How about all three of
us make it out alive?

349
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,083
Go, Karyuho!

350
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,166
[TOTENKUN]
Better raise the wind speed.

351
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,375
One hundred meters per second.

354

The heat is rising!

It burns, it burns!

356
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,250
Shut up with your
whining, already!

357
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,625
[sighs] I'm not letting us
get cubed like a steak!

358
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,166
Damn it.

359
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,416
That creepy cockroach won't
even bother to look down here.

360
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,375
He's doing all
he can to mock us.

361

Wait! That's it!

362
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:47,791
Hey, Dad.

363
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,291
[HIKO]
Huh?

364
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,416
Listen close. I know what to do.
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

365
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,458
[HIKO gasps]
Sounds like a plan.

366
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,291
Hey, Hito, I need
you to lift us up

367
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,208
to the very bottom
of the pillar.

368
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,583
[HITO]
Huh?

369
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,916
If we don't do this,
you'll die right along with us.

370
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,916
Well, damn it all.

It's stretching!

375
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,666
[HITO]
That close enough?

376
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,291
Just as I thought!

377
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,750
The spot directly
beneath the pillar

378
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,041
functions like the
eye of the storm.

379
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,416
The force of the wind
is weaker here

380
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,625
so our attacks might
actually reach him now.

381
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,375
Throw everything you've
got at that dung beetle!

[TOTENKUN]
Hmph. Idiots.

383

[TENKA chuckles]

384
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,041
[TOTENKUN] All you've done is
run out of weapons to use on me.

385
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,208
Just give up and accept
your slice and dice death.

386
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,166
There's no escaping a wind
speed of 120 meters pe--

[HIKO, TENKA laugh]

388
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,000
I doubt you can see it,

389
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,791
since you only seem
capable of looking up,

390
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,541
but have you even
bothered to wonder

391
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,333
what happened to
the other Karyuho?

392
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,541
[TOTENKUN]
What?

00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,250
[TOTENKUN grunting]

394
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,458
[TOTENKUN]
Too hot.

395
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,416
[TOTENKUN groans, gasps]

396
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,500
[TENKA] The Juttenkun
dismiss humans as nothing

397
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,541
but small and insignificant
pests compared to them,

398
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,250
but look what happens
when you're too arrogant

399
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,916
to even bother glancing down.

400
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,541
[sighs]

401
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,083
So you're saying the
only way to save him

402
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,000
is to defeat Ohtenkun.

403
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,125
[GENSHI] Hm... And
there's no other option?

404
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,541
[UNCHUSHI]
We can extend his lifespan

405
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,333
and relieve some
of his symptoms.

406
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,583
[GENSHI]
Hm?

407
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,041
[UNCHUSHI] This Sento
extract should allow him

408
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,333
to regain a little bit
of strength, at least.

409
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,208
That's helpful, but
it still won't solve

410
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,875
the root of the problem.

411
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,375
I'm afraid the only real
choice left before us

412
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,333
is to kill Ohtenkun.

413
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,333
[UNCHUSHI]
Here ya go. Down the hatch.

414
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:55,791
Such a truly remarkabale--uh,
no, I mean terrifying paopei.

415
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,416
To think that it grows by
absorbing its host's strength,

416
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,416
literally stealing their life.

417
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,250
To be frank, it's
practically a miracle

418
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,416
he's even still alive right now.

419
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,291
When you think of its latent
potential, it boggles the mind.

420
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,791
[TAIKOBO]
It's worrisome.

421
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,875
But if I'm gonna win this one
for all of us on Kongrong,

422
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,500
I need to concentrate
on the battle ahead.

423
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,750
You take good care
of Yozen, okay?

424
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,083
You know I will.

425
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,333
[TAIKOBO]
Now then.

426
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,375
Master, we've split our
elite force into teams

427
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,291
to strike the enemy's core.

428
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,458
This battle...

429
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,958
I've got a feeling
that it's not gonna end

430
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,208
until more fighters have fallen.

431
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,125
I'm sorry that I've asked you
to carry such heavy burdens

00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,541
time and time again.

433
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,541
Don't be.

434
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,291
I'm doing this because I know
it's the right thing to do.

435
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,750
So long.

436
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,625
[HAKUTSURU] Just when you think
he can't get any stronger,

437
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,291
he defies expectations.

438
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,458
Losing Gyokutei Shinjin...

439
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,208
It must've been incredibly
painful for him.

440
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,375
[GENSHI] Mm. He's given
all of himself to fight

441
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,458
for a human world free
of Sennin and Doshi.

442
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:09,583
To achieve it, he's prepared
to lose his own home--

443
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,791
to sacrifice the Sennin world.

444
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,000
His devotion to
such a just cause

445
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,166
is wholehearted and selfless.

446
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,750
It will be painful, but until
he's achieved his ultimate goal,

447
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,708
he knows that he can only move
forward without looking back.

448
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,125
[TAIKOBO]
No matter what,

449
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,916
even if it means the destruction
of the Sennin world...

450
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,125
...I will give humanity
the world it deserves--

451
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,125
one safe from Sennin and Doshi.

452
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,250
[TAIKOBO]
Listen up, guys.

453
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,416
We're dividing into
six teams, A through F.

454
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,583
And we're going guerilla here.

455
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,708
This plan will still give
the enemy the upper hand

456
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,875
in several aspects.

457
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,750
Do not try to engage the
Juttenkun in one-on-one combat.

458
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,833
We'll take them out one
at a time with our teams.

459
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:29,875
[SENNIN 11A]
Seriously?

460
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:30,708
[SENNIN 11B]
That's fightin' dirty!

461
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:31,458
[SENNIN 11C]
No kidding!

462
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,666
Proceed with caution!

463
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,750
Team A rules!

464
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,791
[OHTENKUN]
Now pay attention.

465
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,333
The Kongrong Sennin are
bound to be charging in here

466
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,500
at any minute.

467
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,541
You are to kill every
last one of them,

468
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,041
even if it means
risking your own lives.

469
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,333
You got that?

470
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,333
And those left
standing in the end--

471
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:02,583
they'll be the ones tasked
with finally defeating Bunchu,

472
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,583
taking down Tsuten Kyoshu,

473
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,291
and destroying
all of Kingo Island.

474
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,083
Right, Bo? That's the plan?

475
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,666
Lady Koshu.

476
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,958
The Twelve Sennin themselves
are about to step forward

477
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,458
and join the battle.

478
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,500
[KOSHU] This war will be
the first and last great war

479
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,833
of the Sennin world.

480
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,083
It will be fierce.

481
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,708
Our tactic is to offer
support from the rear.

482
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:27,208
This will allow them
to freely advance.

483
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,750
[KOSHU]
Although...

484
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,000
...I can't help but worry
over how many of them

485
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,666
will actually make it out alive.

486
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,791
[KOSHU]
I can only pray--

487
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,416
pray that they will all be
fortunate enough to return.
