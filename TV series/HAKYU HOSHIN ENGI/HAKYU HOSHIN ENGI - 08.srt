1
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,375
[DAKKI]
It's been well over a decade.

2
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,750
This body is just
not what it used to be.

3
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,166
[BUNCHU] You've brought
enough suffering to Yin.

4
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,125
And now you'll burn for it!

5
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,208
[KIBI]
Lo... Loli...

6
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,666
[DAKKI]
Kibi. Kijin.

7
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,416
If only I weren't so powerless.

8
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,541
[DAKKI]
I have the intellect.

9
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,041
And the cunning.

10
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:14,375
But I need loyal pawns
to bring my plan to fruition.

11
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,125
If that's the case,

12
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,208
why don't you posses a new body?

13
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,375
You do have that
special ability.

14
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,541
So simply go and take
whichever one you see fit.

15
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,458
I only wish that it were
all so straightforward.

16
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,708
But a body that's worthy
of housing my soul is rare.

17
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,625
They're born once
every hundred years.

18
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,541
I firmly believe that
time has come now.

19
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,500
Kibi and I discovered her
by random coincidence.

20
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,208
A stroke of good luck!

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,958
[OHKIJIN] The lovely daughter
of Lord So Go, of Kishu.

22
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,875
So Dakki.

23
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,958
[CHU] This is the last
time I'll ask politely.

24
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,041
Give your daughter to me
and I will make her

25
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,250
empress of Yin.

26
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:01,208
Refuse, and Kishu
will be turned to ashes.

27
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,625
[SO GO sighs]

28
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,666
I would suppose that I
am left with no other choice.

29
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,291
So strange.

30
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,416
Is this truly my destiny as
the lord of Kishu's daughter?

31
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:21,875
[SO DAKKI gasps]

32
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,416
You're so Dakki, right?

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,708
[SO DAKKI]
Oh. Yes.

34
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,041
With your big day upon us,

35
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,041
we're here to make
sure you're fully prepared.

36
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,041
We gotcha!

37
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,083
[KIBI]
Loli!

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,458
[OHKIJIN] Don't worry, we'll
take extra special care

39
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,666
with you.

40
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,125
Won't we, sister?

41
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,958
His majesty will wed
the fairest creature

42
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,916
that has ever
walked these lands.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,500
So beautiful, inside and out.

44
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,708
You will mesmerize everyone
who lays eyes on you.

45
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,791
[DAKKI]
Yes.

46
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,541
From this point on all
shall be as I desire!

47
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:45,833
[laughing]

48
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,708
[CHOTENKUN]
So that is his true form?

49
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,833
[CHOTENKUN]
This force is incredible!

50
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,416
[SAND KOSAJIN growl]

51
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,000
[YOZEN grunts]

52
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,250
[SAND KOSAJIN shriek]

53
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,000
[CHOTENKUN]
Such extraordinary power.

54
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,791
[YOZEN gasps]

55
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,625
[CHOTENKUN]
Have you forgotten?

56
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,625
We Juttenkun have the
ability to manipulate space.

57
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,750
I've made it so
the closer you come,

58
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,583
the farther away you get.

59
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,958
Your power may be great, Yozen.

60
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,375
But alas, it still won't be
enough to save you here.

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,416
[YOZEN laughing]

62
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,291
So it's hopeless.

63
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,375
Whatever shall I do now?

64
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,875
Perhaps I should just destroy
this world you've created.

65
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,041
[FUGEN] Less than four minutes
left until they fire again.

66
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,416
What are your orders?

67
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:58,916
Taikobo.

68
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,916
[HAKUTSURU]
Well?

69
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,416
You there?

70
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,541
[TAIITSU]
This is pointless, you know!

71
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,833
Even if Yozen is able to
take down the barrier,

72
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,416
it's gonna be too late!

73
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,708
Look, I know that you're
planning to drive Kongrong

74
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,333
straight into the cannon if
his mission is successful.

75
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,833
But the fact remains that
Kingo Island is still

76
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,583
five kilometers away!

77
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,916
Even at Kongrong's top speed
of 100 kilometers an hour,

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,875
it'll take three minutes
to get there,

79
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,583
and they're going to be
ready to fire in just

80
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,208
three and a half minutes!

81
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,708
I know how hopeless it seems.

82
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:51,875
[CHOTENKUN]
What?

83
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,083
My Kosajin cannot be destroyed!

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,125
[CHOTENKUN]
He transformed into the sand?

85
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,000
What do you think you're doing?

86
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,500
[YOZEN] I'm going to burst
through your little ball.

87
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,500
It's impossible to
create an infinite space

88
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,375
with even the
most advanced paopei.

89
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:19,166
So this precious world
of yours has boundaries.

90
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,166
[CHOTENKUN] And you really
believe that you can fill it

91
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,166
till it pops? [chuckles]

92
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,166
[YOZEN]
As I am at this moment...

93
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,708
I know I can.

94
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,833
[CHOTENKUN]
Interesting.

95
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,333
Let's see which
proves to be superior.

96
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,583
My Kosajin,

97
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,500
or your cheap transformation.

98
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,541
[OHTENKUN]
Well? How'd it go?

99
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,750
Did you turn Yozen
into a corpse?

100
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,708
What now?

101
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,166
We can't wait any longer.

102
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,875
We're gonna have
to run on faith.

103
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,500
Koshu.

104
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,375
I want you to use all
the energy we have left

105
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,333
to ram Kongrong
Mountain into Tsutenho

106
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,750
at maximum speed!

107
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,708
 Are you sure
about that, Taikobo?

108
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,625
[TAIITSU] But Kingo Island's
barrier is still in place!

109
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,666
Yozen's mission must've failed.

110
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,666
I promise that
I won't let you down.

111
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,583
Now fire up the engines!

112
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,625
[FUGEN]
Distance to target,

113
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,083
5.085 kilometers.

114
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,083
That puts our arrival at
three minutes and one second.

115
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,916
We'll get there just in time.

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,041
We got this!

117
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,416
No way Yozen's
gonna let us down!

118
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,500
[RYUKITSU]
All right, Taikobo.

119
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,583
I'm putting my faith in you!

120
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,916
[TAIITSU]
What? No!

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,916
We're ready!

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,375
Full speed ahead!

123
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,583
Ready...

124
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,875
[OHTENKUN]
Answer me.

125
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,708
Is he dead?

126
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,958
[CHOTENKUN] We won't
have to worry about him.

127
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,583
He begged for his life,
but I ground him into dust.

128
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,000
[OHTENKUN chuckles]

129
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,625
That's not his style.

130
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,166
I know you can lie
much better than that.

131
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,458
Right, Yozen?

132
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,916
So, you were able to break
through his play-land after all.

133
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,166
Well... I'm not all that
surprised, to be honest.

134
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,541
I mean...

135
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,333
You do have his blood
running through your veins.

136
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,625
Let me tell you an
admittedly unflattering story.

137
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,708
It's a tale of two
abandoned children.

138
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,416
A well-kept secret
of the Sennin world.

139
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,041
Only the so-called
"three great Sennin"

140
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,166
and a handful of
others know about it.

141
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,208
About 200 years ago...

142
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,333
[TSUTEN]
Genshi Tenson.

143
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,000
[GENSHI]
Hm?

144
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,041
Kyoshu.

145
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,166
[GENSHI]
What are you doing here?

146
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,250
You know things are tense
between Yokai and humans

147
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,708
at the moment.

148
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,041
We need to talk.

149
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,875
Dakki's strength is growing
at an alarming pace.

150
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,250
Three days ago, she made
an exceptionally bold move.

151
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,708
She used her powers
of temptation to abduct

152
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,041
300 Sennin from Kingo.

153
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,791
[DAKKI]
Lord Tsuten Kyoshu!

154
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,541
It has been so long.

155
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,791
I've been thinking quite
a bit about striking out

156
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,291
on my own.

157
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,708
Naturally, I do expect
to have a few attendants

158
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,500
at my side.

159
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,333
I mean, both Kingo and Kongrong

160
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,666
will be under my
control sooner or later.

161
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,541
So do be prepared.

162
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,083
[TSUTEN] As I said, she's more
powerful with each passing day.

163
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,666
At this point, the only
ones who could stop her

164
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,041
are Shinkohyo and Taijo Rokun,

165
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,375
but there's slim chance
they would deign themselves

166
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,583
to render aid.

167
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,250
With this in mind...

168
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,708
I wish for Kongrong
Mountain and Kingo Island

169
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,291
to forge a non-aggression
pact between us.

170

As a token of my sincerity,

171
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,458
I offer you my son, Yozen.

172
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,833
[GENSHI]
Very well.

173

This is no time to be
at odds with one another.

174

In return, I offer
you my top pupil.

175

Oh Eki.

176
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,916
[OHTENKUN]
At the time,

177
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,625
I was expected to fill
the role Taikobo now holds.

178
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:39,083
That's what Genshi Tenson
had been grooming me for.

179
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,875
Later, I learned that the
real reason I'd been chosen

180
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,791
was due to the fact
that I had talents

181
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,250
similar to yours.

182
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,416
Are you surprised by my story?

183
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,125
Did you believe
you were the only one

184
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,708
with those kinds of issues?

185
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,041
But you're far better
off than I am.

186
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,125
You were brought up in a
safe and nurturing environment.

187
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,000
And what I experienced
was the complete opposite.

188
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,500
[TSUTEN]
At least Yozen will be safe now.

189
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,916
Dakki won't be able to
sink her claws into him

190
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,458
on Kongrong.

191
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,083
I realize this is tough for you.

192
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,333
But I cannot allow the
Yokai Sennin to sacrifice you

193
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,583
at any cost.

194
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,166
And so you must remain
here inside this cell.

195
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,041
One which no Yokai can enter.

196
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,750
Until you are fully grown.

Looks like a human child.

[YOKAI 8C] If the tasty little
thing happened to get out.

No filthy human
belongs on Kingo!

204
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,916
I think he was
abandoned by the humans.

205

He must be a miserable
bastard to be hated

[YOZEN]
I already knew of this.

234
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,208
About 50 years ago,

235
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,916
I infiltrated Kingo

236
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,208
under somewhat of
a false pretext.

237
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,875
But my true mission
was to discover who I was

238
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,583
and where I came from.

239
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,041
I discovered my
father's identity.

240
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,583
And the reason I was
left on Kongrong Mountain

241
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,875
as a child.

242
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,750
Yeah?

243
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,375
And you still wanna fight
us after learning that?

244
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,875
It was vexing.

245
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,625
Finding out the truth
of who I was.

246
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,791
But now...

247
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,416
Now I am a Doshi of Kongrong.

248
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,375
Are you?

249
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,416
[laughing]

250
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,000
But so worn out that
you can't even maintain

00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,416
your human form?

252
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,666
I'd expect more from
a prince like you.

253

Ah...

254
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,375
It'd be so damn easy
to kill you right now.

00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,166
And a waste of time.

This is the switch to
turn off the barrier.

Have at it.

258
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,375
Exactly what are
you trying to pull?

00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,541
[OHTENKUN]
Oh, please.

260
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,250
Did you think I was
just gonna tell you?

261
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,458
You'd better act quickly
before I change my mind.

262
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,458
But it'd be wise of you
to consider one thing.

263
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,291
If the barrier were to just
go down at this moment,

264
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,666
there would be a head-on
collision between Kingo

265
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,208
and Kongrong.

266
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,583
And if that happened,

267
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,958
every last Sennin and
Doshi could die all together

268
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,166
in an instant.

269
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,666
However, if the
barrier stays up,

270
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,375
Tsutenho will just blow
Kongrong into a million pieces.

271
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,416
We'd be more than
happy to accept you here

as one of our own.

273
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,875
But if word were to get
out about what you really are

274
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,125
back on Kongrong,
I'm positive that would be

275
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,500

I'm sure you
realize that, Yozen.
