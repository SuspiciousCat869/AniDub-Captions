1
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,083
[TENKA]
Who will I fight for now?

2
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,250
What's the point of it all?

3
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,291
I'm not even sure
what my purpose is.

4
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,208
[TENKA]
Throughout my youth,

5
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,375
I always had the towering
figures of my father

6
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:04,000
and Grand Preceptor
Bunchu to look up to.

7
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,041
It was always my goal to be
just like them when I grew up.

8
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,208
Hey, Tenka.

9
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,833
You'd better surpass me someday.

10
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,458
That's how a son shows
devotion to his father.

11
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,000
There you are, Tenka.
Took you long enough.

12
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,750
I was getting bored waiting.

13
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,708
So you here to stop me?

14
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,250
[TAIKOBO] I couldn't shake
this funny feeling

15
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,791
that you just might
try to do something.

16
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,791
I've gone through
the same thing.

17
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,291
And I remember exactly
how it feels.

18
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,791
Regardless, if you decide to
act on those feelings now,

19
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,916
you're nothing more
than a selfish traitor.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,208
And I'm not gonna
let that happen!

21
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,208
[TENKA]
To surpass my father

22
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,500
and to truly gain his respect--

23
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,625
those were the only
things I've ever wanted.

24
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,916
But how can I achieve them
if he's no longer here?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,791
Who do I fight for?

26
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,291
What is my purpose?

27
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,458
[SUPUSHAN]
Hey, Master...

28
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,208
It's great you've become a
strategist for Seiki and all,

29
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,041
but wouldn't it make more
sense to put the soldiers

30
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,833
in combat training
instead of having them

31
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,083
do farm work?

32
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,875
You might think that
at first, but here,

33
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,458
lemme try to explain
it to you in a way

34
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,875
you can understand.

35
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,708
[SUPUSHAN] You think
I'm an idiot, don't you?

36
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,916
That's not what I'm saying.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,958
It's practically the same!

38
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,750
Farming and training?

39
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,166
[TAIKOBO] Farming tools are
handled much like weapons.

40
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,125
If they think of farming
as combat training,

41
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,333
it'll produce the same results.

42
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,083
But tilling the soil actually
requires a lot more strength

43
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,791
and exertion than swinging
some spears around.

44
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,083
[SUPUSHAN]
That's a really good point!

45
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,041
You've put a lot of
thought into this, Master!

46
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,541
Yep!

47
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,666
But I do still plan on us
winning with as little violence

48
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,041
as possible, though.

49
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,541
All right, what's the deal?

50
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,166
Why'dya keep sneaking
around and spying on me?

51
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,541
[BUKICHI chuckles]

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,125
My name's Bukichi.

53
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,041
I work as a lumberjack.

54
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,666
Uh, can I help you
with something?

55
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,541
[BUKICHI] Please train
me as your disciple!

56
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
What?

57
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,916
Okay, you can't
be serious, no way.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,416
I'm dead serious!

59
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,250
I've heard all about
your heroic acts

60
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,666
and I highly admire
you, great Doshi!

61
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,166
And especially now that
Lord Ki Sho's appointed you

62
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,958
as our strategist!

63
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,375
Wait, how did you
hear about that?

64
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,583
[SUPUSHAN]
And we here are, yet again.

65
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,916
Master wasting another day
fishing for no reason at all.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,708
Still no luck, huh?

67
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,791
Well, why would fishing
be any different?

68
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,750
[SUPUSHAN] He's been so
discouraged for days now.

69
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,041
We need to get back to the
reason we came to Seiki.

70
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,875
[GENSHI] To prevent the
pervasive spread of pandemonium,

71
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,291
we'll need to act quickly

72
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,166
and establish a new emperor
in the human world.

73
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,458
The most aptly suited
candidate for the position

74
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,208
would have to be Ki Sho,
the Lord of the West.

75
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,041
[SUPUSHAN] We need to get
Ki Sho on our side quickly!

76
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,541
We don't have time for
him to mope around

77
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,166
like this pretending to fish!

78
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,166
[SUPUSHAN gasps]

79
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,541
Any bites today?

80
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,333
Actually, I think I
just caught a big one.

81
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,041
[KI SHO chuckles]

82
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,333
[SUPUSHAN]
Lord Ki Sho!

83
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,083
[KI SHO] Mind if I sit down
and chat with you?

84
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,208
I'd be flattered.

85
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,708
One of the four
great feudal Lords

86
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,250
comes all the way out here
on his own to talk to me?

87
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:28,333
[KI SHO]
Well, Seiki is a safe land.

88
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,833
I've heard you've proven
yourself an honorable Doshi

89
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,041
many times.

90
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,250
Moreover, you've come
to our world solely

91
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,583
to defeat Dakki.

92
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,250
She held me prisoner
for seven years,

93
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,166
but that was the very least
of her monstrous deeds.

94
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,500
Apart from Emperor Chu,
the Lords of the East,

95
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,500
West, South, and North
comprise the Yin.

96
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,541
After receiving
Dakki's invitation,

97
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,791
we all gathered in Choka.

98
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,208
Oh, you're here! Welcome, Lords!

99
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,125
So glad you could make
it to my little party.

100
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,666
We're gonna have a blast!

101
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,416
Is the pool filled with booze?

102
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,000
Look at that!

103
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,875
[DAKKI] We'll eat some clams,
and chase it with some booze!

104
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,833
Chug, chug, chug,
chug, you'll die from fun!

105
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:13,458
[KI SHO]
This is sick. Tigers?

106
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,625
[KI SHO] Both the Lord
of the East, Kyo Kanso,

107
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,708
and the Lord of the
South, Gaku Suu,

108
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,708
objected to her cruelty.

109
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,375
[KI SHO] But the Lord
of the North, Su Koko,

110
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,916
submitted to Dakki.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,208
While I saw the truth.

112
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,291
This was her plan
from the start.

113
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,875
She invited us here with
the intent of murdering those

114
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,583
who won't fall in line.

115
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,041
A power play to rein
in the growing influence

116
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,458
of the Four Lords.

117
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,833
Regardless...

118
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,750
I need to warn the Emperor
against her machinations.

119
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,583
Even if speaking out in
opposition costs me my life.

120
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:53,375
That is the price of
loyalty to one's ruler.

121
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,750
[KI SHO]
Your Majesty.

122
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,458
This is a sickening farce.

123
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,125
A devious plot by your Empress.

124
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,333
Ki Sho!

125
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,416
Oh, well.
You know what that means.

126
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,666
[HIKO]
Your Majesty! Empress!

127
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,958
Oh, and Ki Sho!

128
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,958
I didn't know you were visiting!

129
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,166
[KI SHO] The Buseioh saved
my life by playing dumb,

130
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,416
but Dakki held me prisoner
in the nearby land of Yuri

131
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,458
and reveled in my anguish.

132
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,666
While I was captive,

133
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,000
so many precious things
were stolen from me.

134
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,666
Including my son.

135
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,208
[DAKKI]
So then, Emperor Chu!

136
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,291
Hakuyuko's offered up
his family's treasure

137
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,333
in exchange for
Ki Sho's freedom.

138
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,416
Dakki. I have to ask.

139
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,750
What are your first
impressions of this man?

140
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,416
Well, let's see.

141
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,083
He's certainly very handsome.

142
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,541
[CHU]
What, you think so?

143
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,875
More handsome than me?

144
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,666
[HAKUYUKO] She's as beautiful
as the rumors say.

145
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,291
Although, there's something
false about her beauty.

146
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,375
Get out of my throne
room, Hakuyuko!

147
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,291
[DAKKI] My Temptation doesn't
seem to have an effect on him.

148
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,041
[HAKUYUKO] I'm starting to
lose hope they'll actually

149
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,750
return my father to me.

150
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,750
Coming here has felt like
a mistake since my arrival.

151
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,958
[DAKKI]
Hakuyuko.

152
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,583
A little birdie told me that
you're a master of the Koto.

153
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,875
I'd love for you to
teach me how to play.

154
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,583
Sure.

155
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,666
[koto playing]

156
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,708
[music continues]

157
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,333
[KI SHO]
Hakuyuko.

158
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,375
Y'know what's crazy?

159
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,000
Until I met you, no man has
been able to resist my charms.

160
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,333
And I tried so hard with you.

161
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,625
I hate rejection.

162
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,708
[HAKUYUKO]
Father.

163
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,291
I'm sorry I failed you.

164
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,500
Dakki...

165
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,833
And Kibi...

166
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,250
[DAKKI, KIBI]
Present Lunchtime Banzai!

167
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,375
All right!

168
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,125
Today we'll be making
Hamburg steaks!

169
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,791
First ingredient in this fun
and tasty dish is ground meat!

170
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,291
We'll add a slice of bread
and an egg to help thicken it.

171
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,833
But before we throw
it all in the mix,

172
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,291
we'll soak the bread in some
milk and lightly squeeze it out.

173
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,333
While it soaks...

174
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,958
Here! Let's add
some diced onions,

175
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,000
and don't forget the seasonings!

176
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,458
Now we'll mash and mix the
ingredients in little circles

177
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,083
until it sticks together!

178
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,750
Then divide it into portions
of your preferred size,

179
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,291
and toss it between your hands.

180
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,291
Have fun with it!

181
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,208
You'll then press
a dent in the center,

182
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,083
and cook each side
for thirty seconds.

183
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,250
Right! And I think it's just
about time to flip these!

184
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,583
[DAKKI] Cook on high heat
until you've browned them,

185
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,500
then you're ready to cover
them and reduce the heat

186
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,083
so they don't stick to the pan.

187
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,833
And voilà!

188
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,875
Your Hamburg steak
is ready to eat!

189
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,875
And that's Lunchtime Banzai!

190

All right, back to
you in the studio!

191
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,125
[MALE SERVANT 4A]
Time to eat, Ki Sho.

192
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,291
The Empress herself
made your lunch today.

193
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,708
She wanted you to know that.

194
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,375
[KI SHO]
Oh! How lovely!

195
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:31,000
How did Lady Dakki know
Hamburg steak is my favorite?

196
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,333
[MALE SERVANT 4A]
Go on and dig in.

197
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,125
[KI SHO]
How could she do this?

198
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,791
[DAKKI] He even said Hamburg
steak's his favorite!

199
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,958
How could the old fool
not even realize?

200
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,333
A man that dumb couldn't
pose a real threat.

201
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,333
Might as well send
him back to the West.

202

[CHU]
If you think it's best.

Hey, sis...

204
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,458
You sure we should release him?

205
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,916
Seems there's a good chance
he'll start a rebellion.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,208
[DAKKI chuckles]

207
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,541
That's exactly what
I'm counting on him to do.

208
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,375
Someone has to start the war.

209
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,916
[KI SHO]
So I'd like to ask you.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,750
In light of what's happened,

211
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,916
what should be my next move?

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,250
Should I continue to pledge
fealty to the Emperor?

213
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,958
Or should I rise up
and wage war against Yin

214
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,625
for the sake of our people?

215
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,458
You know what she's done.

216
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,666
The people have lost all
faith in the Yin Dynasty

217
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,958
because of Dakki.

218
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,041
There's so much more to lose
and nothing to be gained

219
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,500
by letting this continue.

220
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,583
Raise an army and defeat Yin.

221
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,750
Build a new empire in its place.

222
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,208
Become the great
emperor the people need!

223
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,583
Such a burden.

224
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,541
I can feel the weight of
history crushing down on me.

225
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:12,208
But this destiny may very
likely be heaven's will.

226
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,333
It is.

227
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,500
In that case, Taikobo...

228
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,958
Will you agree to be
Seiki's strategist?

229
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,333
I could use a guiding hand
to lead me through this war.

[GENSHI] The Buseioh has
finally abandoned Emperor Chu.

231
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,208
[HAKUTSURU]
Well that's spectacular news.

232
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,041
He can take up arms
and join Taikobo

233
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,916
now that he's a free man.

234
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,166
[GENSHI] Yes, but it
won't be a simple task.

235
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,958
If the Buseioh has chosen
to rebel against Yin,

236
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,041
there's no doubt that
Bunchu will pursue him.

237
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,166
And Dakki will dispatch
assassins for her own amusement.

238
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,416
[HAKUTSURU]
Here's an easy fix!

239
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,333
Why don't we just send
Taikobo to safely escort

240
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,708
the Buseioh?

241

[GENSHI] Hmm, it's unlikely

from Seiki to help him.

243
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,875
But I know who we can send now.

A man more deeply
connected to the Buseioh

245

than any other in

[HIKO] I refuse to lose
any more of my family!

[SUPUSHAN gasps]

But Dakki has sent

I managed to convince him of how
critical the cause really is,

him two paopei.

316
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,666
So my paopei collection's
running a bit low.

317
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,916
But hey, it's all for
the greater good!

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,416
Yeah, he kicked your
sorry ass silly, didn't he?

319
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,833
Well! No matter
how it happened...

320
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,291
Thanks, guys.

321
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,708
I appreciate the help.

322
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,458
I'd better be fighting
a worthwhile foe.

323
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,166
[TAIITSU] Well I'll be
taking my leave then.

324
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,875
[TAIKOBO] You're not
sticking around to help?

325
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,583
[TAIITSU] C'mon, you know
me better than that.

326
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm not cut out for fighting.

327
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,125
And even if I wanted to,
the Twelve Sennin

328
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,541
can't get involved.

329
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,500
Not unless we wanna
provoke the Kingo Islands.

330
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,291
Yeah, you've got a point there.

331
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,208
All right, let's get moving.

332
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,625
[KOSO]
Time to collect!

333
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,083
Your head is mine!

334
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:13,250
[RYONO gasps, yells]

335
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,541
Some real exciting stuff here.

336
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,916
Hope you guys don't mind
me joining in on the fun.

337
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,708
[KOSO]
Who the hell are you?

338
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,291
Heh heh. My father
named me Koh Tenka.

339
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,750
I'm one of Hiko's sons,
ya brainwashed jackass.

340
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,291
[KOSO]
Y-You are...?

341
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:35,916
[HIKO]
Tenka?

342
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,333
[TENKA]
How's it goin', Pops?

343
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,166
Holy crap, look at you.

344
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,458
The old age is really showing.

345
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,041
Hey! Not funny!

346
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,625
[TENKA laughing]

347
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,375
[KOSO]
How dumb is this brat?

348
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,125
We're in the middle
of a fight here.

349
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,583
But if he wants to turn
his back, I'll take it!

350
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:54,916
[TENKA yells]

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,458
[GROUP yells]

352
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,458
Thanks, son.

353
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,875
[TENKA] Hey, who's this
little guy over here?

354
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:12,875
[KOH MEI]
That's Tensho.

355
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,416
You're my brother?

356
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,375
[KOH MEI] He was born after
you left for the Sennin world.

357
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,416
[HIKO]
Tenka.

358
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,333
I'm happy to see you.

359
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,541
You better surpass me someday.

360
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,166
That's how a son shows
devotion to his father.

361
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,791
[TENKA] It was those
words my father said to me

362
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,458
that led to my decision to
train on Kongrong Mountain

363
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,708
to become a Sennin.

364
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,625
[DOTOKU]
Right! Left! Uppercut!

365
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,750
[yells]

366
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,875
What? Who are you?

367
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,958
[DOTOKU] I'm Dotoku Shinkun,
but you can call me Master.

368
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,166
Of course, that's only if
you'd like me to train you

369
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,916
in the ultimate artistry
of sportsmanship.

370
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,833
Um, and why would I want that?

371
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,250
Because I'm a Sennin.

372
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,333
[TENKA]
To be entirely honest,

373
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:05,333
I was somewhat reluctant
to become a Doshi at first.

374
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,416
I was torn between
staying in the human world

375
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,041
to become a Tennen
Doshi like my dad,

376
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,041
and the desire to obtain
my own paopei

377
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:16,416
and assist my father, much
like Grand Preceptor Bunchu.

378
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,875
But then I realized
if I followed

379
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,833
in my father's footsteps,

380
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,583
I would never be able
to truly surpass him.

381
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,125
So I chose.

382
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,583
I spent years training
in the Sennin world

383
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,791
and finally got my paopei,
the Bakuya no Hoken.

384
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,125
Hey, Coach. What's with the
serious look on your face?

385
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,875
I've got some
heavy news for you.

386
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,625
Your father's left Choka.

387
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,041
[TENKA] The time has finally
come for me to help Dad!

388
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,875
I'm glad you've returned.

389
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,083
However...

390
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,125
[TENKA]
Is it about Mom?

391
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,208
And my aunt?

392
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,083
[HIKO]
Yeah.

393
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,416
They were both
incredible people.

394
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,208
And their lives deserve justice.

395
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll make sure
Dakki pays for this.

396
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,375
My boy.

397
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,416
You've grown strong.

398
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,666
[rumbling]

399
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,416
What's that rumbling?

400
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,916
This can't be real!

401
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,416
[TENKA]
Father!

402
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,250
Always someone interfering.

403
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,375
No matter.

404
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,500
We're sticking to
Bunchu's orders.

405
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,625
Kill every last one
of Buseioh's clan.

406
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,833
We, the Shisei,
will see this job through!

407
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,166
Who attacked us?

408
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,166
This may well be worth my time.

409
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,875
Wait! Nataku!

410
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,875
I've got this! They're mine!

411
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,958
[BUNCHU]
The Shisei are powerful.

412
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,708
Hiko, you've brought
this death upon yourself.

413
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,375
No one betrays me
the way you have.

414
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,041
Accept your penance!
