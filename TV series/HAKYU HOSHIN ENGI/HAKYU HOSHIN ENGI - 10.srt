00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,541
[YOZEN]
It's such a faint memory now.

[YOZEN crying]

00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,375
[GYOKUTEI]
Yozen.

4
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,708
Is someone there?

[YOZEN crying]

6
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,666
[GYOKUTEI]
Yozen.

7
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,708
[YOZEN crying]

8
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,458
[GYOKUTEI]
C'mon, now.

9
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,708
I hate to see you cry like this.

10
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,375
[GYOKUTEI] No. Tsuten Kyoshu
doesn't hate you at all.

11
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,708
That's not why he left you here
with us on Kongrong Mountain.

12
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,250
The truth is, he brought
you here because

13
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,666
he loves you dearly.

14
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,750
He was only trying
to protect you,

15
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,666
and this is the safest
place you can be.

16
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,958
I don't get it.
Protect me from what?

17
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,125
Well, you see...

18
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,208
You have the inherent
qualities of a powerful prodigy,

19
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,125
and some bad people
wanted to exploit you

20
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,750
for their misdeeds.

21
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,625
Fortunately, your father
found out about their plans

22
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,041
before they could.

23
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,166
So he asked Master Genshi
Tenson to watch over you.

24
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,958
Trust me on this one, Yozen.

25
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,333
You need to maintain
a human form,

26
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,458
or else the bad guys
might find you.

27
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,500
Okay!

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
I'll do the best I can,
and then maybe my dad will come

29
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,041
take me home someday.

30
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,541
[YOZEN]
Although...

31
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,833
In the end,

32
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,208
no one ever came
for me, and I was alone.

33
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,958
[TAIKOBO]
Gyokutei.

34
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,541
The winning move is up to you.

35
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,208
I've got it under control.

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,500
[TAIKOBO yelling]

37
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,083
You just hang in there.

38
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,666
[SONTENKUN laughing]

39
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,541
[SONTENKUN] I've got my
own Taikobo doll now.

40
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,875
So, Gyokutei Shinjin, looks like
you're the only challenger left.

41
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,250
What game do you
feel like losing?

42
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,708
No more games.
Playtime's over, you cretin.

43
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,708
Taikobo was setting up a
plan right beneath your nose,

44
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,041
and all that's left now
is for me to execute.

45
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,250
[SONTENKUN] Great, he's
gonna try the sword again.

46
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,750
Did you not hear me?

47
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,000
Or are the illustrious
Twelve Sennin of Kongrong

48
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,583
really this stupid?

49
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,291
I'm happy just to make
these two self-destruct

50
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,541
and explode.

51
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,166
Or, you can extend
their miserable lives

52
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,791
by indulging me in a
game you can never win.

53
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,958
You're the only one
who's going to lose here.

54
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,875
As a matter of fact,
I'll kill you so quickly,

55
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,833
you won't have the
chance to hurt anyone.

56
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,541
[SONTENKUN laughs]
Go on and try it!

57
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,500
Fast as you may be
with that sword,

58
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:29,250
you don't even know
where the real me is hiding!

59
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,750
That's where you're wrong.

60
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,750
Taikobo showed me where you are.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,458
[SONTENKUN]
Settle down!

62
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,875
Any more sudden
movements from you

63
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,458
and your friends go boom.

64
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,291
That's all I needed.

65
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,750
You're as good as dead.

66
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,458
[SONTENKUN grunts]

67
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,583
[SONTENKUN]
But how? How did you know?

68
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,625
You practically
gave yourself away.

69
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,416
Taikobo narrowed
your location down

70
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,833
to one of the toys
hanging from the ceiling.

71
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,791
So when it came time
for him to deal the cards,

72
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,958
he made a grand show of it
in order to distract you.

73
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,375
And all the while, he was
actually using the cards

74
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,541
to slice tiny cuts
into the toys.

75
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,625
From those cuts,
a small drop of blood

76
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,416
would eventually fall.

77
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,000
Then he kept you
busy with the game

78
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,166
until your blood told
us where you were.

79
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,583
I'm sure you were confident
that you had Taikobo beaten,

80
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,375
but that's exactly
what a skilled hustler

81
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,083
wants you to think, and he's
Kongrong's greatest cheat.

82
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,833
[SONTENKUN]
He tricked me.

83
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,375
Made a complete fool of me.

84
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,500
Compared to your dirty tricks,

85
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,083
it really wasn't much more
than a cute little prank.

86
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,125
The Juttenkun are
quite a devious bunch.

87

Nicely done, Gyokutei!

Happy to help.

Anyway, we've wasted
enough time here.

Let's find Yozen.

[TAIKOBO]
Yeah, let's get moving.

94

[OHTENKUN chuckles]
There goes one more.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,416
Add Sontenkun to
the list of corpses.

96
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,833
Talk about pathetic.

97
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,000
Enough of this!

98
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,458
It's time for them to die!

99
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,500
Yeah.
Brilliant suggestion there.

100
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,583
Believe me, I'm aware of the
deadly glares we're getting.

101
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,250
If we don't finish
them this time,

102
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,125
we'll be killed in their place.

Bunchu.

104
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,083
You'd better let me
take this next go-round.

105
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,375
No way in hell.

106
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,250
I already told you
to sit this one out

107
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,916
so I can keep an eye on you.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,333
How many times do you wanna risk

109
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,375
running up against
the same conclusion?

110
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,833
We've already got two guys down

111
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,541
and I'd rather
not lose any more.

112
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,166
Taikobo's dirty little tricks
aren't gonna work on me.

113
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,666
And I'll tell ya why.

114
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,500
He may be a good cheat, but
deception is my very nature.

[BUNCHU]
Fine, then.

116

Go kill him.

I'm leaving you on your
own to die a lonely death.

I think so.

Well, at least I hope so.

[TAIKOBO]
Who is that?

128
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,416
[OHTENKUN]
Hello, Taikobo.

129
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,625
Nice to finally meet you.

130
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,791
Around here,
I'm known as Ohtenkun,

131
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:48,875
and I suggest you
remember that, brave leader.

132
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,625
He's one of the Juttenkun.

133
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,125
Pleasantries aside,

134
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,416
I've got somethin'
you might wanna see.

135
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,166
They've got Yozen!

136
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,666
Don't worry, he's fine.

137
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,666
We've got him safely locked
away deep inside Kingo.

138
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,333
And I'll give him back.
You just have to come get him.

139
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,375
We keep a warp
paopei stored in the star

140
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,750
directly to your right.

141
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,375
All you've gotta do
is hop on board

142
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,333
and it'll automatically
transport you to Yozen.

143
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,041
The only catch?

144
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,458
You have to come alone.

145
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,500
[TAIKOBO] I'm gonna guess
this is the warp paopei

146
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,916
he was talking about.

147
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,500
It actually looks like
the same type of system

148
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,291
as Master Genshi's Hiraii.

149
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,500
[SUPUSHAN]
Cool! Let's get on board!

150
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,041
Stop, you idiot!

151
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,416
Jeez! What are you
screaming at me for?

152
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,541
Because this thing's
obviously a trap.

153
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,416
Most likely, there's gonna
be a powerful Juttenkun

154
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
waiting wherever
this paopei takes us.

155
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,708
Probably Ohtenkun himself.

156
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,416
[TAIKOBO]
You both saw him.

157
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,833
Just one look at him
and you can tell

158
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,208
that he's insanely dangerous.

159
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,791
He wants to split us up,
which means his strategy

160
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,291
is to kill us off one by one.

161
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,541
[GYOKUTEI] So you're saying
we should avoid this.

162
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,583
[TAIKOBO]
Nope.

163
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,541
I'm gonna do
exactly what he said.

164
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,583
I've got no doubt in my mind
that I'm walking into a trap,

165
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,458
but it might be the only chance
we have to save Yozen.

166
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,666
Taikobo!

167
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,291
I should be the one to go.

168
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,541
[TAIKOBO]
I can't let you.

169
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,000
When it comes down
to it, I can fight

170
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,208
just as dirty as he can,
but you don't think like--

171
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,208
[GYOKUTEI]
I need to do this for Yozen.

172
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,666
You aren't the one he
wants to rescue him.

173
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,666
Of that much I'm certain.

174
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,250
What's that supposed to mean?

175
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,333
[GYOKUTEI]
As you know,

176
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,875
I've looked after Yozen
since he was a child.

177
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,875
And I know things about him.

178
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,708
Certain things he's kept hidden.

179
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,250
It's only natural.

180
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,041
I'm even sure that
you know a side of him

181
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,125
that he's never shown to me.

182
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,375
No one can ever truly
know the full extent

183
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,750
of another.

184
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,041
You would need the ability
to read a person's mind.

185
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,250
You might believe
that you know someone,

186
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,416
but there's more
than you can see.

187
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,041
Some dark secret buried
deep within their heart.

188
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,833
Much like everyone else, Yozen
carries such secrets within him.

189
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,833
And I know he's just not
ready to reveal that side

190
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,708
of himself to another person.

191
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,291
But, if you go after him now,

192
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,291
you're more than likely
to discover the real Yozen.

193
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,208
And then, you might
not say it out loud,

194
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,708
but you'll still think it.

195
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,708
You'll think to yourself,
"Why didn't you tell me sooner?

196
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,125
And he'll know.

197
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,000
He'll see it in your eyes
and it'll hurt him deeply.

198
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,166
So I'm asking you, wait
until he has the strength

199
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,625
to tell you.

200
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,833
Let him decide when he's ready.
Don't force it on him.

201
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,583
Please, Taikobo.

202
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,041
Allow him that.

203
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,750
How can I say no to that?

204
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,291
The rescue mission's yours.

205
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,166
One thing, though.

206
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,916
I don't give a damn
what the real Yozen is.

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,833
I'll never abandon him.

208
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm not surprised.
But thank you.

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,333
This must be it.

210
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,625
Yozen!

211
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,458
Yozen!

212
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,125
[OHTENKUN chuckling]

213
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,208
Come on in, Gyokutei Shinjin.

214
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,875
Ohtenkun!

215
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,041
He's all yours.

216
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,375
Scoop him up and take him home.

217
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,166
He's lying right there.

218
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,375
Master...

219
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,000
[GYOKUTEI]
You fought well.

220
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,500
I'm very proud of you.

221
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,541
Master...

222
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,041
[OHTENKUN chuckles]

223
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,375
You're gonna have
to pay, though,

224
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,000
if you wanna take
him outta here.

225
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,041
Thievery is a crime, after all.

226
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,541
[TAIKOBO]
Are you ready, Supu?

227
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,000
You and I are heading for
the core of Kingo Island.

228
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,000
[SUPUSHAN] Whoa, hold on,
what're you talking about?

229
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,250
Well, the control room
is located in the core, so--

230
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,916
You told Gyokutei we'd wait
for them back on Kongrong!

231
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,875
And you know Bunchu's
in the control room,

232
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,291
so quit acting so aloof!

233
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,125
Think about where
Gyokutei is heading,

234
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,125
and where they
would confine Yozen.

235
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,625
They're probably in the
Juttenkun's barracks,

236
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,458
and that's gonna be
somewhere close to the core.

237
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,791
[SUPUSHAN] Okay, I see what
you're saying, but still.

238
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,166
We have to find them.

239
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,625
I'm not walking out of here
unless they're with us.

240
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,458
We're saving them,
no matter the cost!

241
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,625
[SUPUSHAN sighs]

242
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,041
I know it's pointless
to argue with you.

243
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,458
So fine, but we're getting
out of this creep nest

244
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,833
as soon as we find them.

245
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:12,916
You got it.

246
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,791
[YOZEN]
Master...

247
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,208
You're here.

248
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,166
Did you come just to rescue me?

249
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,791
Shh. Save your energy.

250
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,916
Kongrong's still intact,
and it's all thanks to you.

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,166
And Taikobo's alive and
well, so you rest easy.

252
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,875
You're my greatest pupil,
and I've never been so proud.

253
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,875
That means so much to me.

254
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,458
Thank you.

255
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,458
Just hearing you
say those words...

256
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,833
It's the only salvation I need.

257
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,750
But Master, please
be careful in here.

258
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,541
Ohtenkun is evil incarnate.

259
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,375
I can feel his malice
like a poisonous vapor.

260
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,500
Stay with me!

261
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,958
So...

262
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,583
I think I've given
you enough time

263
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,583
for your weepy
heartfelt reunion.

264
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,208
But now I'm bored.

265
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,750
Hope you don't mind
if I liven things up a bit.

266
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,375
Wha-- What is this?

267
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,458
My paopei, Kosuijin.

268
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,666
The other Juttenkun
are all-powerful

269
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,791
only when they've got you
trapped in the dimensions

270
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,625
they create.

271
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:49,416
But I force this dimension
to succumb to my power.

272
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,625
And you will perish
in this space beneath

273
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,208
a rain of blood.

274
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,541
A rain of blood?

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,166
My god...

276
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,333
Don't tell me these
red clouds are...

277
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,750
[OHTENKUN] I literally just
told you what they are,

278
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,041
but I forgot to mention
my blood is highly acidic.

279
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,416
Stick around long enough
and you'll become a puddle.

280
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,375
You've only got one
option for saving your skin.

281
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,166
Struggle your way through the
rain and escape this space.

282
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,041
There's another option.

283
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,375
A simple one.

284
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,750
[GYOKUTEI]
And that's killing you!

285
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,666
What? Impossible...

286
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,958
You should be dead!

than I thought you were.

Try to attack me all you want,

but you're gonna have
trouble killing an illusion.

291
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,750
This whole space is
made from my blood

and I control it all.

I've basically got you
trapped inside my body.

effort in before your body

Everything else in
this place is round,

305

so why is that a giant square?

I don't know.

word "suspicious" written on it.

00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,208
You can still save yourself!

319
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,291
You've got a long way to go,
so I'd pick up the pace

320
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,416
if I were you.

321
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,708
Or you can both
melt for all I care.

322
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,333
[YOZEN]
Please, Master.

323
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,375
Leave me!
Just put me down and--

324
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,791
[GYOKUTEI]
This reminds me.

325
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,958
I've carried you
like this before.

326
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,166
Back when you were
a child and I found you

327
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,541
crying in the rain.

328
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,458
[GYOKUTEI]
Come on now, Yozen.

329
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,958
Let's get you out of this.

330
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,791
[GYOKUTEI]
I wanted to keep you dry.

331
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,666
So you wouldn't catch a cold.

332
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,250
[GYOKUTEI] You've grown
so much since then, Yozen.

333
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,708
[YOZEN] All this time, the one
who would come back for me

334
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,250
has been standing
right by my side.

335
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,291
What the hell?

336
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,708
[GYOKUTEI grunts]

337
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,291
[SUPUSHAN gasps]

338
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,666
I'm here, pal.

339
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,583
[TAIKOBO]
Gyokutei!

340
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,708
Taikobo.

341
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,708
Take care of Yozen for me.

342
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,791
[TAIKOBO]
He's gone.

343
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,250
[GYOKUTEI]
Yozen.

344
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,125
Yozen.

345
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,375
Wake up, now.

346
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,125
There you are. Look around.

347
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,750
[GYOKUTEI]
It's stopped raining.
