00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,875
Huh. Isn't this interesting?

5
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,416
You appear to be capable,

6
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,541
but it's quite obvious you don't
have the bones of a Sennin.

7
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,708
Who're you?

8
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,875
[TSUTEN]
My name is Tsuten Kyoshu.

9
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,375
I am known as the patriarch

10
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:30,625
of both the Sennin world
and Kingo Island.

11
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,541
[BUNCHU gasps]

12
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,916
[BUNCHU] From that day
forward, I had a new goal.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,333
I would train in the Sennin
world and strive to serve Yin.

14
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,416
[BUNCHU] Under the tutelage
of Tsuten Kyoshu,

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
my strength rapidly increased.

16
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,833
[BUNCHU] I fought for
one purpose alone:

17
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:03,500
to protect the Yin Dynasty
no matter the cost.

18

[BUKICHI panting]

[BUKICHI]
The last team is finally here!

20
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,333
[GENSHI] Excellent! You've
done great work, Bukichi!

21
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,708
Thanks! I'm just following
Master Taikobo's orders!

22
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,041
Guess that's everyone, huh?

23
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,125
Master Genshi.

24
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,833
I believe I owe you an apology.

25
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,583
I left without telling you.

26
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,625
Yozen. It's good to see
that you've returned.

27
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,625
[BUKICHI]
He doesn't look sick.

28
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,791
[gasps] Why are they
all still affected?

29
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,416
Ohtenkun's soul was released!

30
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,083
I saw it!

31
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,166
[GENSHI gasps]

32
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,750
[YOZEN] His mites
shouldn't have power...

33
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,708
...unless they're being
controlled by someone else.

34
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,291
Could Dakki be to blame?

35
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,125
If you have a moment,

36
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,125
there's something
I'd like to discuss.

37
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,041
[GENSHI]
Not now.

38
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,416
This takes precedence.

39
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,291
I just received an urgent
message from Taikobo.

40
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,125
He says they're
going to keep Bunchu

41
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,125
at Kingo Island's power reactor

42
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,791
and he needs the rest
of us to get there

43
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,208
as soon as we've recovered.

44
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,833
Then we'll all attack at once.

45
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,208
When they've recovered?

46
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,750
[gasps] How exactly is that
supposed to happen now?

47
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,875
Killing Ohtenkun was said to
be the only way to heal them

48
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,000
and they're still drained.

49
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,916
[GENSHI]
But hope is not yet lost.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,041
What Taikobo has done requires
us to take immediate action.

51
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,208
It's time!

52
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,583
[YOZEN, BUKICHI gasp]

53
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,125
[GENSHI]
Come here, now!

54
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,625
[SUPUSHAN]
Roger!

55
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,375
We're here and happy
to be of service.

56
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,625
Always glad to provide services!

57
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,458
No! What am I seeing?

58
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,166
That hippo has a mustache!

59
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,208
Well, that wasn't exactly
the welcome I was expecting.

60
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,166
But as a gentleman
and Supushan's father,

61
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,250
I'll excuse it this once.

62
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,625
You may call me Supu Papa.

63
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,583
His... what?

64
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,666
[GENSHI]
Greetings, friend.

65
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,083
Good to see you.

66
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,708
Perhaps it will
help you understand

67
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,000
if you know more
about Supushan's past.

68
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,166
[GENSHI] His story begins in
a land known as Supu Valley,

69
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,250
located far off in the west.

70
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,375
Mama makes the best cupcakes
in all of Supu Valley!

71
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,583
[GENSHI] Supushan's life
with Supu Mama and Supu Papa

72
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,708
was a peaceful,
carefree existence.

73
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,708
[GENSHI] Supu Papa
provided for his family

74
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,750
by serving as my means
of transportation.

75
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,791
He was compensated
most handsomely.

76
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:24,958
[GENSHI] But then, 1,500
years ago, a tragedy occurred.

77
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,750
[CHOKOMEI chuckles]

78
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,708
[GENSHI] Chokomei attacked
their quiet village.

79
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,208
[CHOKOMEI]
It's no dream.

80
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:44,083
I'm that noble knight born
under the destiny of the rose!

81
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,916
Now, who's up for a
heroic fight against me?

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,708
[laughing]

83
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,791
[CHOKOMEI] Hmm. A threat has
arrived from Kingo Island,

84
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,458
but nary a soul has come
to halt my conquest.

85
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,583
[CHOKOMEI]
Uh? Hark!

86
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,000
[CHOKOMEI]
That beard!

87
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,500
It belongs to the founder
of Kongrong--Genshi Tenson!

88
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,916
[GENSHI laughs]

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,750
[GENSHI] If you know me,
you know I have clairvoyance,

90
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,541
and I've foreseen your actions.

91
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,541
[gasps]

92
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,541
[CHOKOMEI]
Have you?

93
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,666
You are right hand to the man
they call Tsuten Kyoshu,

94
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,583
and I did not want
to leave my pupils

95
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,708
to handle you on their own.

96
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:29,083
I figure fighting you by myself
will result in fewer victims.

97
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,541
[CHOKOMEI]
Perfectly fine by me.

98
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:31,916
I look forward to it!

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,166
I do love battling
a stronger opponent

100
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,500
and enhancing my skills.

101
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,375
Genshi Tenson!

102
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,250
I challenge you!

103
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,458
[GENSHI]
All right.

104
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,250
Let's go, Supu Papa! Transform!

105
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,875
[SUPU PAPA]
Rogering that, indeed!

106
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:47,708
[gasps]

107
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,791
Transformation!

108
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,875
[GENSHI]
Adults of their kind

109
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,625
have the ability
to take new forms.

110
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,958
They become magnificent
spirit beasts

111
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,666
with unique sets of powers.

112

[CHOKOMEI groans, pants]

114
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,291
[GENSHI]
With Supu Papa's help,

115
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:13,750
I succeeded in driving that
pompous rapscallion away.

116
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,833
One small bump on
the road to victory.

117
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,208
I'll simply train harder
for the next round!

118
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,083
[GENSHI]
However...

119
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,708
[SUPU PAPA groans]

120
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,000
[GENSHI] Supu Papa was later
seriously injured in battle

121
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,458
and forced into retirement.

122
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,791
[GENSHI] With their sole
provider now out of work,

123
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,166
the family was in danger
of falling apart.

124
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,500
It was with watery eyes
and heavy hearts

125
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,500
that the Supu Family decided
to send young Supushan

126
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,708
to become an apprentice.

127
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,000
[SUPU MAMA]
Supushan!

128
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,333
[GENSHI] Later, he served as
my ride for a period of time,

129
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:53,583
and finally, we teamed
him up with Taikobo.

130
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,333
That's so sad.

131
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,458
I'm sorry, Supushan.
I had no idea.

132
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,416
[GENSHI]
The past is the past.

133
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,375
Let's go Supu Papa!

134
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,291
Rogering that, indeed!

135
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,041

[SUPU PAPA]
Energy Drain!

138
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:31,875
[JIKO gasps]

139
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,708
[gasps]

140
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,125
[GENSHI]
Another beneficial power

141
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,500
I find unique to the adult Supu

142
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,208
is that they can absorb
the effects of any paopei

143
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,708
by literally consuming
the energy produced.

144
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,250
I never would've dreamed
he had that kind of ability.

145
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,666
I just thought
he was a flying hippo.

146
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,250
Fortunately for us,

147
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,333
Taikobo remembered this fact
and called Papa here to help.

148
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,458
I finally feel
like myself again!

149
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,083
Thank you so much for
healing us, Supu Papa.

150
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,708
What a fine example you are!

151
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,666
[DOTOKU]
Yeah! We're so grateful!

152
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,916
[GENSHI]
I see.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,083
So you heard all of this
directly from Oh Eki?

154
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,708
Yes, and in the end
they both lost their lives--

155
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,791
Tsuten Kyoshu and your
former pupil as well.

156
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,208
Be honest with me.

157
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,375
Have you been lying
about the Hoshin Project?

158
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,958
Or is there truth in
what you've told us?

159
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,125
[YOZEN] You originally said
it was a plan to defeat Dakki

160
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,000
and create a new order
in the human world.

161
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:46,750
But Ohtenkun--I mean Oh Eki--
had a different version.

162
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,250
[YOZEN] He said it was a plan
to capture Dakki's spirit.

163
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,166
With the story changing
so frequently,

164
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,000
I can't help but wonder if
anyone is being honest with me.

165
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,375
[YOZEN] If you just wanted
to get rid of Dakki,

166
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,500
wouldn't it have been easier

167
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,166
to simply send every
Sennin after her?

168
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,291
And when questioned,

169
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,541
you have done nothing
but give excuses

170
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,500
or the most roundabout
explanations.

171
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,875
I beg you to stop the confusion.

172
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,375
Tell me the truth right now--

173
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,750
[GENSHI]
Quiet!

174
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,416
Do not say another
word out here.

175
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,041
She is listening.

176
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,125
[YOZEN gasps]

177
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,166
[YOZEN]
There's no one here.

178
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,166
[GENSHI]
The presence just vanished.

179
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,083
She must never hear the true
purpose of the plan, Yozen.

180
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,458
We will go on as though
we know nothing.

181
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,375
Who was it?

182
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,000
The Signpost of History.

183
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,500
[gasps]

184
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,291
[FUGEN]
Hey, Bo.

185
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,000
I was just thinking...

186
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,125
Do you remember that time
we snuck away with Kokin

187
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,541
to head out on a
little adventure?

188
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,166
Yeah! I haven't thought
about that in ages now.

189
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,625
Kind of a random memory there.

190
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,916
[FUGEN] It's funny
we were brazen enough

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,833
to slip a sleeping drug
into Master Genshi's food

192
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,791
just so we could
steal Kokin and fly down

193
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,875
to romp around the human world.

194
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,041
[TAIKOBO]
That was such a blast!

195
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,166
You weren't even part of
the Twelve Elite Sennin yet.

196
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,791
[FUGEN giggles]

197
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,583
[TAIKOBO]
Oh, ho, ho! Nice!

198
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,791
I caught a big one!

199
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,791
It's a speckled trout.

200
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,958
[FUGEN]
So,

201
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,125
is this the reason you wanted
to travel to the human world?

202
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,500
[FUGEN]
You shouldn't catch fish

203
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,625
when you're not even
allowed to eat them.

204
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,833
Yeah, I know that!

205
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,041
Here, look! Catch and release!

206
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,208
Actually, I've got
a gift for you.

207
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,125
It's a fishing hook
of my own design.

208
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,708
What? That won't catch anything!

209
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,083
You only go fishing when
you need to clear your mind.

210
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,791
It helps you think, right?

211
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,166
Don't you feel bad hurting
the fish just so you can focus?

212
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,500
Seems a little unfair.

213
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,458
You'll do just about anything
to avoid conflict, huh?

214
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,041
I could say the exact same
thing for you, ya know.

215
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,833
I guess that's why
we get along so well.

216
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,666
[FUGEN]
I really miss those days.

217
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah. I can't help
but feel nostalgic

218
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,125
for the time when we
didn't have to fight.

219
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,041
Well, doesn't matter
now. Here we are.

220
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,916
Bunchu will be here soon,
so we need to be prepared.

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,666
Let's have a snack while we can.

222
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,041
Whoa! Sesame dumplings!

223
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:51,250
--[phone ringing]
--[TAIKOBO chewing]

224
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,333
Yeah? This is Taikobo and I'm
in the middle of a dumpling?

225
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,375
What? Yozen?!

226
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,750
You're still alive?

227
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,791
Yes, and I'm very happy
to hear you're safe as well.

228
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,333
I'm heading your way

229
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,208
and I'll be bringing
a few friends with me.

230
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,375
You and Fugen stay
right where you are.

231
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,208
We'll need you to act
as bait for Bunchu.

232
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,375
Got it.

233
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,583
Get here as quickly
as you possibly can.

234
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,416
The two of us won't last
more than ten minutes

235
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,208
against that guy.

236
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,291
[TAIKOBO]
All right! Let's get moving!

237
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,416
We gotta go destroy
the power reactor.

238
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,625
Then we'll act as
bait to lure Bunchu.

239
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,750
Once Yozen gets here,
we'll attack as a group.

240
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,208
If we know exactly where he is,

241
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,750
we can avoid
breaking up our forces.

242
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,708
Uh... [groaning]

243
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,000
[FUGEN]
Sorry, Bo.

244
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,625
Don't hate me.

245
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,208
What's happening?

246
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,875
Did you put a tranquilizer in
those dumplings or something?

247
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,583
Not just any tranquilizer.

248
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,666
It's the same drug we
gave to Master Genshi

249
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,333
before our last adventure.

250
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,666
[TAIKOBO groans]

251
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,208
[FUGEN] There's no reason
for both of us to wait.

252
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,000
If the only purpose of us being
there is the keep Bunchu around,

253
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,875
I'll do it myself.

254
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,000
We only need one person
to act as bait.

255
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,125
Please don't...

256
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,875
[FUGEN]
Kokinrikishi, go.

257
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,708
[TAIKOBO]
You idiot...

258
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,375
[FUGEN sighs]

259
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,416
[FUGEN]
I did the right thing.

260
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,166
Bo still has to fight
Dakki on his own.

261
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,250
He has to live.

262
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
[FUGEN gasps]

263
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,041
[FUGEN]
He's coming!

264
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,708
[FUGEN]
I can feel it.

265
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,166
Like the air is
filled with rage.

266
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,000
[FUGEN]
This force...

267
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,208
It's overwhelming.

268
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,416
I've never faced anyone
this strong before.

269
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,625
I'm here looking for Taikobo.

270
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:52,583
[heart beating]

271
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,125
[FUGEN]
Although...

272
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,708
[FUGEN]
...I can't shake the feeling

273
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,250
you'll devote yourself
to combat someday.

274
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,750
You do have a shining blade deep
inside your heart, after all.

275
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,166
Hm?

276
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,041
But when that day comes,

277
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,291
I promise I'll be
right beside you.

278
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,750
The least I can do
is offer you that.

279
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,958
[TAIKOBO]
In that moment I realized...

280
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,750
...I didn't want him to
risk his life for me.

281
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,416
I could not allow him to die.

282
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,166
[groans] Damn it, Fugen.

283
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,416
What the hell were you thinking
giving me a sleeping pill?

284
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,208
[TAIKOBO pants]

285
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,666
[TAIKOBO groans]

286
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,250
Stay awake! [groans]

287
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,458
Stay awake!

288
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,625
[FUGEN]
I can't show weakness.

289
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,125
Hello there, Bunchu.

290
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,833
I must admit conflict is
something I cannot abide.

291
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,500
I wonder if we might resolve
this by talking instead?

292
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,208
[BUNCHU scoffs]

293
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,416
Speak, then.

294
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,458
I appreciate it.

295
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,166
[FUGEN]
Tell me.

296
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,041
Why is it that you devote
yourself so strongly to Yin?

297
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,208
[FUGEN]
Because of Dakki,

298
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,833
the people have lost all
faith in the Yin Dynasty.

299
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,708
It's been a long road.

300
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:28,000
Serving as their guardian deity
for more than 300 years...

301
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,666
You've worked hard
to protect Yin,

302
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,375
but the truth is it has been
doomed for a very long time.

303
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,708
The flow of history has
steered in another direction--

304
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,333
toward Shu.

305
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,166
[FUGEN] So, I'd like
to make a suggestion.

306
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,833
Why don't we work
to defeat Dakki--

307
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,916
cleanse the human
world together?

308
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,500
When our mission is complete,

309
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:54,416
we will each take a vow never
to enter the human world again.

310
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,041
What do you say?

311
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,333
That was enlivening.

312
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:05,208
But humans have a thing
called "order of precedence."

313
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,416
I've adopted this
way of thinking.

314
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,125
Yin is number one in my order.

315
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,875
[gasps]

316
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,541
[BUNCHU] What does not
benefit Yin must go,

317
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,500
such as Kingo and Kongrong.

318
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,458
They never have and never will
serve any purpose for Yin.

319
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,500
Therefore, I will destroy them.

320
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,250
It's a simple equation really,

321
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:27,875
yet one you and Taikobo
find difficult to understand.

322
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,708
[FUGEN]
I knew it.

323
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,916
You made your appearance
here for one reason only,

324
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,875
and that is to watch
Kingo and Kongrong fight

325
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,166
until they destroy each other.

326
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,541
[BUNCHU] You are correct.
It's the only solution.

327
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,750
The Juttenkun opposed me...

328
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:48,083
...and Tsuten Kyoshu's mind
had long since been decimated.

329
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,291
[FUGEN]
How could you?

330
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,541
Don't you feel indebted to him
for all he's done for you?

331
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,833
[BUNCHU]
Of course I do.

332
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,708
But it's a matter of priority.

333
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,791
I was forced to choose
between him or Yin.

334
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,666
[FUGEN]
It's no use.

335
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,000
I'll never break through
such an iron will!

336
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,541
[BUNCHU]
I'm through talking.

337
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,583
Fugen Shinjin of the Twelve
Elite Sennin of Kongrong...

338
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:20,875
You shall perish along with
your worthless Sennin world!

339
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,583
[BUNCHU] My relationship
with the Yin Dynasty

340
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:05,125
began over 300 years ago.

341
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,500
I served the emperor at the time

342
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,875
and was working my way up
to a general's position

343
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,583
at a young age.

344
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,791
[KING OF YIN] You wish
to go to the Sennin world?

345
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,333
Yes.

346
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:19,708
I understand that I was not born
with the bones of a Sennin.

347
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,250
But after the training
I've put my body through,

348
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,875
I believe I may be
developing them.

349
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,375
I see!

350
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,166
If you were to go to their world
and return here as a Doshi,

351
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,166
that would greatly
benefit the Yin Dynasty.

352
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,166
[SHUSHI]
Bunchu.

353
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,750
[BUNCHU]
Yes?

354
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,916
Please make sure
you come back to us.

355
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,250
Promise?

356
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,166
I want this little one to
grow and learn from you.

357
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,541
Understood, Shushi.

358
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,208
I promise.

359
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,250
[BUNCHU]
Everything I am today...

360
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,916
...began at that moment.
