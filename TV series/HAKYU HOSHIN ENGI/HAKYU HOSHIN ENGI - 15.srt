1
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,125
[YOZEN]
I admire him.

2
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,166
He has a way of earning trust.

3
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,166
[YOZEN]
People follow him.

4
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,375
They allow him
into their hearts.

5
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,250
[YOZEN]
However...

6
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,541
...with me, it's different.

7
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,750
For I'm a <i>yokai</i> .

8
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,125
[phone rings]


9
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,541
[groans] You got me.


10
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,541
How can I help you today?


11
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,916
[GENSHI]
Taikobo? This is Genshi.

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,291
[TAIKOBO]
Yeah, I know.

13
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,708
I haven't gotten the others
and saved the world yet,

14
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,250
but I'm trying, 'kay?

15
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,416
Thanks for checkin' in, bye!

16
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,250
[GENSHI]
Hold on a moment, you fool!

17
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,875
I called to tell you
that Yozen is missing.

18
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,458
[TAIKOBO gasps]

19
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,208
[GENSHI] We've been searching,
but he's nowhere on Kongrong,

20
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,875
which likely means...

21
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,625
Yeah, he's out
looking for Ohtenkun.

22
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:15,375
[TAIKOBO] After losing Gyokutei
like that, watching him die,

23
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:19,166
I imagine his heart is filled
with the need for vengeance.

24
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:23,958
He hates that monster so much

25
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,708
he doesn't even care
about his own health.

26
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,625
Then you need to go and
protect Yozen immediately.

27
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,083
He may be our last hope

28
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,541
to keep Kongrong and
Kingo Island connected.

29
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,333
I'm on it, boss.

30
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,375
Wake up.

31
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,958
Yozen is heading after Ohtenkun

32
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,583
and it's our job to make sure
he doesn't get himself killed.

33
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,875
Right now?

34
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,583
[sighs] Are you sure about this?

35
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:52,250
Should we really be rushing
into a fight just for Yozen?

36
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,416
[TAIKOBO gasps]

[YOZEN]
Ohtenkun!

40
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,125
For what you've done
I'll make you pay!

[YOZEN gasps]

44
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,083
[OHTENKUN] I'm not the enemy
you'll be fighting today.

45
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,625
[gasps]

46
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,416
[OHTENKUN]
So sorry to disappoint you,

47
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,750
but I assume you've already
met Yotenkun and Kinko Saybo.

48
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,625
They're superior to
any other Juttenkun

49
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,916
and you deserve the best.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,750
Besides, too many of our guys
have been defeated lately

51
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,666
and I think it's time
we balance things out.

52
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,166
I'm glad you're here.

53
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,125
I spared you because
I wanted to make sure

54
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,166
your death was more harrowing
than your beloved master's.

55
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,791
Thanks for travelling all
this way to entertain me.

56
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,625
I won't let you leave alive.

57
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,375
[OHTENKUN] I love your
unwavering confidence.

58
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,500
It keeps things exciting.

59
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,791
Wait.

60
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,083
I can tell that you're
a very strong fighter.

61
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,750
Time to die.

62
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,666
[gasps] What?

63
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,916
Deflected?

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,083
[laughs]

65
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,541
Enjoy killing them.

66

[NATAKU grunts]

67
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,250
So when I defeat those two,

68
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,458
I get to fight him, right?

69
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,583
Holy crap.

70
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,000
Did that guy just
become more powerful?

71
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,250
[YOZEN]
Come on!

72
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,250
I think it's best that
we stay out of his way.

73
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,250
[IGO]
Uh, yeah.

74
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,541
[NATAKU]
Die.

75
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,458
[IGO grunts]
Hurry up!

76
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,208
[YOTENKUN]
Could you be any more foolish?

77
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,500
What makes you think you could
reach us with power alone?

78
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,708
[gasps]

79
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,875
Don't waste all your
strength on them!

81
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,833
[gasps]

82
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,208
[KINKO SEIBO]
How disgusting.

83
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,625
Children really should be taught

84
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,708
that violence is not a
useful form of expression.

85
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,083
I imagine you're the type
who won't understand that

86
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,041
until your limbs have
been ripped clean off.

87
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,375
Nataku!

88
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,916

How embarrassing.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,208
Down in a matter of seconds.

90
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,791
--[NATAKU] Shut up.
--[exhales]

91
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,666
[YOTENKUN] Hmm. He survived a
blast from the light of Rakkon.

92
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,791
Interesting.

93
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,291
He must be a paopei himself.

94
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,583
Now...

95
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,250
...what are we going
to do with those two?

96
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,791
Question for ya.

97
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,000
Why didn't Nataku's attack
work on those guys?

98
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,791
There are a few
possibilities, actually.

99
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,958
My primary theory
is light refraction.

100
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,750
I believe the one
called Kinko Saybo

101
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,583
has the ability
to control light.

102
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,166
And if that's the case,
then you and I are in danger.

103
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,458
This entire space
could be an illusion.

104
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,416
Huh?

105
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,541
How's that?

106
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,625
[YOZEN] Light gives us
the ability to see.

107
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,041
We take it in and what is
reflected through our lenses

108
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,083
is what our mind processes.

109
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,083
Now, if that light were
to be refracted, well...

110
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,500
Even though I think I can see
my hand clearly in front of me,

111
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,500
it might not actually be there.

112
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,666
[IGO]
I get it.

113
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,916
They're avoiding our attacks

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,958
by manipulating when
and where we see them.

115
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,291
Nice try.

116
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,666
You just sit tight and
leave this one to me!

00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,583
Ha.

120
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,416
Oh, yeah, I'm positive.

121
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,666
I don't need my eyes to see.

122
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,625
My mind's eye has
perfect vision.

123
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,833
So, I can detect their locations
and see their true forms.

124
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,333
Maybe you guys should
do a little work

125
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,291
on your mental abilities, too.

I can see the talismans,

and you're closer
than I thought.

[YOTENKUN]
These fools will never learn.

133

[IGO]
Here it comes.

134
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,791
But that's not the real attack.

I have very sensitive skin,

so I can sense
anything and everything

[YOTENKUN]
An impressive Doshi, indeed.

152

He uses only sensation
to fight his battles.

153
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,833
[KINKO SEIBO]
Huh. In that case...

154
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,791
What's happening?

Everything's turning black.

[FUGEN] Now that Mount Kongrong
has been drained of energy,

157
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,750
we'll have to find some
way to keep Kokin moving

158
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,750
with our own power.

159
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,916
[FUGEN] I'm at a loss
for a solution, though.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,416
We barely have enough to
get ourselves back home.

161

So what?

162
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,833
Should we just go and
leave Yozen here to die?

00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,750
You haven't been the same
since he was captured.

164
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,666
You've been quite
strange, actually.

[NATAKU]
Where are we now?

168
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,333
Not sure,

169
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,041
but I think it may be
Kinko Seibo's realm.

170
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,166
Wait! What's that?

[ALL gasp]

Don't let down your guard.

173

We appreciate the challenge,
but the more you resist,

174
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,250
the more pitiful you'll
look when you die.

Hm?

[YOZEN groans]

188
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:28,541
Ha. You're not afraid of
your own shadow, are you?

189
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,750
Don't forget, it's
part of who you are,

190
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,416
which means if you harm it,
you're also harming yourself.

191
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,541
The good news is that
shadows are only

192
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,958
one tenth as powerful as
the bodies casting them.

193
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,250
The bad news is that
the body must die

194

in order to kill the shadow.

of eternity fighting yourselves!

And you really think we're
gonna take that bait?

00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,750
No, don't! Igo!

198
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,791
Of course I can kill it!

[YOZEN sighs]

202
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,041
That was way too damn easy!

203
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:07,916
You're weak!

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,500
[laughs, groans]

205
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,166
What I was going to say was
damage done to our shadows

206
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,791
comes back to us.

207
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,666
But if you simply
move out of the light,

208
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,333
it disappears completely.

209
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,791
[IGO groans] You have
all the answers, don'tcha?

210
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,541
Where's Nataku?

211
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,750
[IGO] Oh. He's kickin'
his own ass up there.

212
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,625
Stay strong.

213
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,625
[YOZEN] I would prefer
to reserve my power

214
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,208
for battling Ohtenkun.

215
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,833
However, I can't stand idly by.

216
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,625
I'm not sure Nataku can
take much more of this,

217
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,083
but I think I know
how I can help him.

218
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,291
[NATAKU]
Stay back.

219
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,458
[KINKO SEIBO chuckles]

220
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,791
At least that one has the sense
to know when it's time to flee.

221
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,000
[NATAKU]
Hm?

222

[YOSHIN]
Nataku!

223
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,708
Do not step out of that shadow!

224
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,333
That's neat.

225
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,375
[YOTENKUN] Hmm. He's
transformed into Yoshin

226
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,125
of the four Shisei
of Kuryu Island.

227
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,458
Very clever of him
to use Hekichiju

228
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,583
to manipulate the earth.

229
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,708
Oh, well.

They must've figured
out our tactic

and now they're trying to
run us into the light!

240

[IGO gasps]
Angry shadows!

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,583
[NATAKU]
Not again.

242
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,041
[FUGEN] Perhaps it's the
magnitude of this battle

243
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,208
that's making you anxious.

244
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,458
You want to win, but you don't
want to endanger anyone, right?

245
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,375
[FUGEN] I understand how
important that is to you,

246
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,833
but don't let it get in the way
when there's so much at stake.

247
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,916
[FUGEN] Right now, your help
is needed to end this battle,

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,625
even if we must be sacrificed.

249
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,875
That's what's
being asked of you.

Hey? Are you okay?

256
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,708
I'm not quite sure what
to do with you right now.

Oh, yeah!

You're so right!

I don't know why
I didn't see it!

But now I know.

261
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,083
I've been going about this
entirely the wrong way!

262
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,583
What do you mean?

263
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,583
Trying to fight the
Juttenkun one by one

264
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,458
was never gonna
get us anywhere.

265
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,125
[FUGEN]
Uh...

266
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,833
[TAIKOBO] We should've gone
directly for their leader!

267
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,125
We need to stop wasting time

268
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,083
and fight who we
were meant to fight!

269
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,000
It's time to go after Bunchu!

270
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,208
[FUGEN] That might be
taking it a bit too far.

271
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,208
[TAIKOBO] Doesn't matter!
It's a brilliant plan!

272
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:07,208
Now, Kingo Island is
currently heading somewhere.

273
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:11,416
[FUGEN] Yes. It's been heading
directly west for a while now.

274
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,875
[TAIKOBO]
And you know why?

275
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,416
Because Bunchu is
up to something!

276
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,875
He's entrusted the
Juttenkun to handle us.

277
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,666
He's not even paying attention
to what we're doing!

278
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,250
[FUGEN] So we should attack
while he's distracted?

279
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,666
That is exactly right.

280
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,458
I've never been more
grateful for my smarts

281
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,875
than in this moment.

282
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,208
So,

283
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,375
d'you know where Kingo
Island's power reactor is?

284
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,083
I'm fairly certain I do.

285
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,041
[FUGEN gasps]

286
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,291
[FUGEN]
Hold on.

287
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,375
Are you suggesting we
bring Kingo Island down

288
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,250
with Mount Kongrong
still attached?

289
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,750
Yes, exactly.

290
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,125
We'll create a huge distraction
by disturbing the island,

291
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,500
then Bunchu will have no choice
but to come out from the core

292
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,875
to defend it.

293
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,583
Then we won't need these
silly things anymore!

294
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,791
[FUGEN]
And you're doing this all out of

295
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,666
the goodness of
your heart, right?

296
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,083
Step one: find Kingo's power
reactor and blow it up! Pew!

297
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,750
This will cause
all the stars to fall

298
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,166
and wipe out the <i>yokai</i> Doshi!

299
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,083
Aah!

300
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,208
Which means I'll get caught in
the line of fire and die, too!

301
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,791
[FUGEN]
Is that so...?

302
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,208
[TAIKOBO] And that will bring
about the fall of Kingo Island,

303
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,958
which will piss Bunchu
off something fierce!

304
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,250
He'll be too busy being enraged

305
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,375
to even notice us ganging
up on him! [giggles]

306
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,375
It's the best plan ever!

307
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,791
I gotta hurry
and let Genshi know

308
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,041
so we can get started
immediately! [giggles]

309
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,583
One catch.

310
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,333
About the power reactor--

311
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,250
I don't think we have enough
strength to destroy it.

312
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,250
[TAIKOBO]
But you're wrong!

313
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,041
This is the highest quality
Sento that exists.

314
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,625
Eat it and it'll restore
your strength by 40 percent!

315
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:47,333
It's the only one I've got left,
so we have to split it.

316
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,125
Thank you, Bo.

317
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,250
[TAIKOBO]
You ready? Let's go!

318
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,958
Hey Yozen, what do
we do? [grunts]

319
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,708
[YOZEN panting]

Nataku!

322
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,000
Here we go.

323
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,583
This may be the
last move for me.

324
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,166
He transformed into Chotenkun.

325
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,416
And he's using the sand
to block out our light!

326
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,375
[NATAKU grunts]

327
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,916
Nice try.

Yozen!

331
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,000
[KINKO SEIBO]
The shadows move quickly.

332
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,833
Did you not think they'd
reach you before you finished?

333
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,541
It seems "genius"
was a misnomer.

334

[gasps]

335
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,333
[NATAKU]
Die.

336
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,333
But how?

337
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,000
Was this all part
of Yozen's plan?

338
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,750
[YOTENKUN]
It wasn't to block the light!

339
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,666
[YOTENKUN groans]
Damn it!

340
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,666
He used his paopei
to blind us with sand!

341
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,666
You did it!

342
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,416
The light is gone!

343
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,416
Rest up.

344
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,291
I'll handle things from here.

345
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,666
[gasps]

346
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:35,875
[IGO]
Oh, no.

347
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,666
He's not breathing!

348
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,250
[NATAKU]
Is he dead?

349
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,125
[IGO]
No.

350
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,500
His spirit's barely hanging on.

351
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,916
But... we could
lose him any second.

352
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,625
Hey, you can't go yet, okay?

353
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,875
I still need to thank you for
risking your life to protect us.

354
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,541
[YOTENKUN] Ha. How kind of Yozen
to make this easy on me.

355
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,625
Looks like I can still win!

356

You wish!

359
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,541
Let's go, Nataku!

360
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,791
[NATAKU grunts]

361
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:32,250
[OHTENKUN chuckling]

362
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,458
I'll stay down here and
destroy all the talismans

363
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,125
to keep Yozen safe.

364
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,541
So you're free to
go after the enemy.

365
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,041
You don't wanna fight?

366
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,250
I gotta say I never expected
to hear ya say that.

367
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,541
[IGO]
Thanks, Nataku!

368
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,500
Now, prepare to be impressed!

369
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,541
[YOTENKUN]
Go ahead and try!

370
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,875

[IGO]
Oh, please, this is nothing!

373
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,000
Now... finish him!

374
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,916
But of course, I still
got both arms and legs.

375
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,666
Komasho, transform!

376
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,041
[YOTENKUN]
What's this?

377
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,708
[IGO grunts]

378
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:30,125
[YOTENKUN]
No! That's impossible!

379
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,625
Rest well.

380
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,750
I had to stop ya or there'd be
no point in my coming here.

381
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,958
[IGO]
Yeah!

382
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,416
This fight is over!

383
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,375
Wait a sec.

384
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,041
Where'd he go?

385
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,250
[OHTENKUN chuckles]

386
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,625
[OHTENKUN]
You don't fool me.

387
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,958
It may be weak,
but I can still sense it.

388
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:44,375
There's a life force
struggling to hold on.

389
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,583
[OHTENKUN] Perhaps you're closer
to evolving into your true form.
