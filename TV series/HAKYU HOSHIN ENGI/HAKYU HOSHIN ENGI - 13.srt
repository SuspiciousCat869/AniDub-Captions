strongest to weakest
or something?

Looks like I've
stumbled upon a Sennin.

00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,333
Yeah? And who's
doing the stumbling?

172
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,541
I'm Koh Hiko, the emperor's
military strategist,

also known as the Buseioh.

Are you on your way
to see the empress?

175
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,041
Yes, I am.

176
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,166
And for what, exactly?

177
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,041
I intend to defeat her.

Hey, sorry, man!

Most of the guys
who come through here

183
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,625
just wanna join up
to be her henchmen.

184
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:33,166
Now if you were one of them--
well, I would've had to kill ya.

185
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,708
I had a feeling about you!

186
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,208
I knew you weren't under the
thrall of Dakki's Temptation!

187
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,875
You're damn right I'm not.

188
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,666
I repelled her sorcery with
the sheer strength of my will.

[HIKO]
Listen, Taikobo.

190
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,958
I had this feeling
when I met you--

191
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,958
that you could
actually do some good.

192

I didn't rescue you
for your sake.

I saved your life for
the sake of this world.

You need to stay alive.

There's no room for weakness.

[clock ticking]

[TAIKOBO sighs]
You'll do just about anything

198
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,666
to avoid conflict, huh?

199
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,166
Sure, but I could say
the same for you, y'know.

200
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,000
I mean, that's why
we get along so well.

201
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,250
Although...

202
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,416
...I can't shake the feeling

203
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,958
you'll devote yourself
to combat someday.

204
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,333
You do have a shining blade deep
inside your heart, after all.

205
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,875
But when that day comes,

206
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,041
I promise I'll be
right beside you.

207
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,833
The least I can do
is offer you that.

208
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:57,416
[TAIKOBO] Fugen... you were
right about everything...

209
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,041
...but I don't want
to hurt anyone.

210
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,833
I wish I could create a
safe world without fighting.

211
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,000
But--is it even possible
to avoid it?

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,250
[TAIKOBO] What Dakki did to you
has really led me to thinking...

213
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,375
There's no way I can
defeat her on my own.

214
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,875
So, it's time to
find some allies.

215
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,500
[TAIKOBO] We'll gather up enough
new friends for our own army.

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,916
He's a human paopei!

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,458
[LI SEI] The inhuman child
that burst forth from the mass

221
00:13:56,541 --> 00:14:01,291
was born into our world with
paopei attached to his body.

222
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,291
Despite his true nature,
my wife never failed

223
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,666
to treat Nataku within anything
but the love of a mother.

224
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,375
If we can make Nataku our ally,

225
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,666
that alone would give us the
strength of a thousand men!

226
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,875
Our best chance for that
is to smooth things over

227
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,541
so he feels like he owes us one.

about using the Kenkonken?

were to actually happen,

who can say who'll
get hit with it?

limitations, ya know!

And that is...?

of unifying his subordinates,

00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,208
No matter what happens...

317
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,375
...I can't let you win.

318
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,041
You are the Doshi
Taikobo, correct?

319
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,625
[TAIKOBO groans]

320
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,000
[BUNCHU]
Hm. I'm surprised you can move.

321
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,541
[TAIKOBO]
Nobody's dyin'.

322
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,583
I won't let you kill them.

323
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,125
I won't!

324
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,375
[YOZEN groans, gasps]

325
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,875
[YOZEN]
Taikobo.

326
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,083
He's almost dead
and he's protecting us

327
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,333
with a wall of wind.

328
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,625
[YOZEN] Honestly,
you really do amaze me.

329
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,583
[TAIKOBO]
I will change it.

330
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,750
I'll make a world
safe for humans--

331
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,375
a world free of
Sennin and Doshi.

332
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,833
[coughs]

333
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,875
[BUNCHU] You used your paopei
until you coughed up blood?

334
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,541
[BUNCHU] I can't let Seiki
have one as great as you.

335
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,666
[clock ticking]

336
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,333
[OHTENKUN chuckles]

337
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,500
[TAIKOBO gasps]

338
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,833
Everything that
I've ever done...

339
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,750
Everything that makes me me...

340
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,000
Am I just supposed to
throw it all away?

341
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:03,750
[clock ticking]

342
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,208
[SHINKOHYO]
So, Dakki.

343
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,875
I think it's time
to come clean with me.

344
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,250
Tell me the name
of your backer--

345
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,458
the one known as the
"Signpost of History."

346
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,083
[SHINKOHYO] Kokutenko here
keeps on bugging me

347
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,375
to find out who she really is.

348
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,625
But what am I supposed
to tell the poor cat?

349
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,250
I mean, the only
information I have

350
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,541
is this "Signpost
of History" business.

351
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,166
It's Joka.

352
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,375
[SHINKOHYO]
Joka?

353
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,041
You don't say.

354
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,791
Interesting.

355
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,541
[DAKKI]
Your turn, Shinkohyo.

356
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,041
Go on and tell me
just how much you know.

357
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,416
To be perfectly frank,

358
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,750
I'm pretty sure
I know everything.

359
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,916
But most of it is
rumors and speculation

360
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,333
so I can't speak with
any degree of certainty.

361
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,708
[SHINKOHYO]
Joka.

362
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,541
A name unfamiliar to
most people in this world.

363
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,208
[JOKA]
You will hear me, man.

364
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,291
I will imbue you
with great power,

365
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,000
and with that power,

366
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:13,708
you will create a new
empire known as Yin.

367
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,708
[DAKKI gasps]
You're...

368
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,291
[SHINKOHYO] There's no denying
that you were shocked,

369
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,541
but somehow still able
to instantly infer

370
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,750
what it was before you.

371
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,166
Not to mention clever enough

372
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,458
to say something that
piqued Joka's interest.

373
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:38,083
At long last, we finally meet.

374
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,208
[JOKA]
Woman.

375
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,958
Would you care to make
an agreement with me?

376
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:51,000
I will give you power surpassing
even that of a Sennin.

377
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:56,041
In return, you will assist me
in recovering my body.

378
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,625
[SHINKOHYO] At some point, Joka
said she wanted to destroy Yin.

379
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,958
So first you seduced
Emperor Chu

380
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,875
and left the nation
to fall into chaos,

381
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:13,041
making its decline
appear natural.

382
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,708
[clock chimes]

383
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,666
[SHINKOHYO] And now, the world
seems to be turning out

384
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,583
exactly how you
and Joka want it.

385
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,750
But... I just can't
shake this feeling

386
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,208
that you're on the verge of
doing something cataclysmic.

387
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,375
And I don't think I'm
overestimating you on this.

388
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,958
I know you.

389
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,750
You're willing to
make a sacrifice.

390
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,416
[GENSHI]
Who might you be?

391
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,291
[OH EKI] I've been waiting
for you, Genshi Tenson.

392
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,166
Nice to meet you.
