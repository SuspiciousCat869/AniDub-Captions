It appears this may be it--

00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,666
the final battle.

00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,083
Ha! You'd never know I
was about to die earlier

with the way I'm moving now.

Bam! I bet we can win
this fight in one round!

Against all the odds,

8
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,625
somehow Taikobo
always pulls through.

I can't believe this encampment

10
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,041
was finished in
just a few hours.

11
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,333
Whatever the task may be,

12
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,750
our guys always
rise to the occasion.

13
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,333
There's no denying that fact.

14
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:39,208
We've also laid a road along
the path we followed here,

15
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,541
and that will allow us
to send food and supplies

16
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,583
quickly by carriage.

17
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,625
[YOZEN]
Food is especially important.

18
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,208
Besides the obvious risk,

19
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,000
a shortage would cause
a drop in morale as well.

20
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,375
It shows great foresight

21
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,458
to ensure the people
have enough in reserves

22
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,291
before the battle begins.

23
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,083
You truly are a
remarkable tactician.

24
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,666
It also means we get
peaches delivered ASAP.

This doesn't look good.

If he's infected with an
illness, he could be contagious.

you could be infected.

yourself in harm's way.

all the help we can get

in order to go up against
Bunchu at this point!

on this in my lab,

Hopefully Taikobo is all right.

were able to get there in time.

question of all is...

...how will this battle end?

00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,666
What made you fight
to come back here?

Even after I gave you the
strongest sleeping drug

74
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,250
that I had?

75
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,666
I have a more important
question for you.

76
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,375
Why would you
underestimate Bunchu

77
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,666
and think you could
fight him on your own?

78
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,750
If Supu had gotten here any
later, you would've been dead.

79
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,916
And for what?

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,333
Heh. You're right.

81
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,375
Don't worry, everything
turned out okay!

[SUPUSHAN] They all left
as soon as he was done.

85

But since I'm much faster
than Kokinrikishi,

I was able to catch up
with you guys a lot sooner!

Oh, speaking of which,
what ever happened to your papa?

88
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,208
He was already weak,

89
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,375
so he exhausted himself
using his power.

I'm sorry, son.

of my Supu usefulness.

he handed me a gift.

Well, what did he give you?

00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,125
I don't know.

98
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,208
It was blank inside.

How unfortunate.

100
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,833
All twelve Elite Sennin
have fully recovered

101
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,000
from Ohtenkun's mites.

102
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,416
But that is of
little consequence.

103
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,291
A few more moments of life
will make no difference.

Taikobo's wind is much sharper.

111
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,083
That must mean he's advanced.

112
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,875
I'm curious to see how
long he can keep this up.

[BUNCHU]
Your defense is strong,

114

but if that's all
you plan to do,

115
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,833
you'll exhaust yourself before
your allies can arrive to help.

Master, just keep
this wind going strong

117
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,583
and the others should
be here to back you up

of minutes, okay?

Yeah!

All right, guys. We did it!

Are you sure about that?

00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,333
I mean, it was flashy, but...

139
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,333
We succeeded in wounding him.

140
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,416
We've never even been able to
get that close to him before.

141
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,666
Sure, it's just a small scratch,

142
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,791
but the blood on his face
means he's not invincible!

Success feels good, doesn't it?

00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,208
Oh, yeah, and this thing
was the ultimate defense.

151
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,375
As long as we can keep
using Taikyoku Fuin,

152
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,000
we'll be able to
combine our paopei

153
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,000
against any we come across.

154

I'm pleased you found it useful.

155
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,791
Of course, I have to
give credit where it's due

156
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,166
and acknowledge
my wonderful paopei.

157
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,833
Yeah, you're the man, Taiitsu.

158
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:05,000
[TAIKOBO] We can use Fugen's
paopei computer, Taikyoku Fuin,

159
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,916
to record any enemy's
attack pattern.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,333
[FUGEN]
Right.

161
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,375
Then I can transfer that
information to an ally's paopei.

162
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,125
And that's what makes
automatic homing

163
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,458
of the enemy attacks possible.

164
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,875
It seems most of your attacks
are actually distractions.

165
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,833
Only about three to five
of your lashes ever hit.

166
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,333
So if we use Dashinben to change
the direction of your strikes,

167
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:30,583
those that would hit
backfire and hurt you instead.

168
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,791
[TAIKOBO]
Neat, huh?

169
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,041
And that's what we call
the B Quick attack!

170
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,250
Surely there's a much
more intimidating name

171
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,916
than that one, Bo.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,041
[TAIKOBO] What do you
think of that, Boony? Ehe!

173
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,916
Does it make you wanna cry?

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,083
[TAIKOBO cackles]

175
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,125
It felt good to get that out.

176
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:50,166
But I should let you know this
is the end of the road for you.

177
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,625
[SUPUSHAN]
Master!

178
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,833
It looks like everyone's here!

179
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,625
Hey, you guys!
Sorry it took us so long.

180
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,250
But we're ready to go!

181
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,333
So that's what
Bunchu looks like?

182
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,125
I'm sorry, Grand Preceptor,

183
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,458
but we're doing
all this out of love!

184
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,958
Come on, guys!

185
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,875
Let's pulverize him!

186
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,125
[ALL]
Prepare yourself, Bunchu.

187
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,875
You're about to fight the
Twelve Elite Sennin of Kongrong!

188
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,625
All right.

189
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,416
We're about to perform
the biggest B Quick attack

190
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,625
of all time, together.

191
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,750
[YOZEN]
Greetings, Taikobo.

192
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,500
Uh--Yozen?

193
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,791
How are you here?

194
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,708
I figured you'd be exhausted.

195
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,125
Ha, ha. I wouldn't miss this.

196
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,166
I've made a personal vow
to get rid of Bunchu myself.

197
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,708
What? That's crazy talk!

198
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,958
[YOZEN] Bunchu, I've
come to repay a debt!

199
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,875
[gasps] Wait a second?!

200
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,541
I've never seen that
transformation before!

201
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,916
[YOZEN]
This is Hanyotai, my true form.

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,458
Yozen's a <i>yokai</i> ?

203
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,708
Whoa, really?

204
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:20,750
[ALL chattering]

205
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,250
I'm gonna need you
to provide backup.

206
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,750
Eh?

207
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,125
The rest of you head
out and follow Yozen!

208
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,625
[FUGEN]
I'm worried.

209
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,666
[FUGEN] My nuclear fusion had
absolutely no effect on Bunchu.

210
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,500
[FUGEN] Perhaps... he's using
something else besides Kinben.

211
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,208
[YOZEN grunts]

212
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,833
[YOZEN]
Have at you!

213
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,416
Did I get him?

214
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,625
I know I made contact.

215
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,458

[TAIKOBO]
Stay strong, Yozen!

218
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,250
Don't forget,
he's super powerful!

219
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,833
Thank you. I know that.

220
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,500
Man.

221
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,833
Yozen just blew my mind a little
with that secret of his.

222
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,083
But I'm not worried about it.

223
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,541
Where are you, Bunchu?

224
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,625

[ALL screaming]

238
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,750
You should know
better than to throw

239
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,250
everything at him like that!

240
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,416
Fugen, how is Bunchu looking?

241
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,666
[FUGEN]
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,166
That last attack created
an errant magnetic field

243
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,708
and I can't use my radar.

244
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,208
[JIKO]
We got this!

245
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,666
Leave it to the close combat
fighters to finish the job!

And if he's dead, we'll
make sure he stays that way.

Hey, Bo.

248

We had better join them.

What do you mean?

250
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,666
Why are you so eager
to fight right now?

251
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,208
Because Bunchu isn't dead yet.

00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,833
I'm sure.

Whoa! It's so freaking hot!

could survive this.

I'm not quite sure.

00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,666
From the way things look--

Huh?

00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,458
[KOKUKIRIN] I don't mean
to interfere, Master Bunchu.

well. Thank you.

see Yin again, isn't it?

Yes, though it appears

267
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,541
it's under Dakki's control now.

[KOKUKIRIN]
Apologies.

270
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,041
I should not have
mentioned that.

No matter.

272
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,708
It shall be under our
control again soon.

You, Hiko, and I will
rule this land together.

[KOKUKIRIN]
Thank you for including me.

I'll always protect Yin.

And I will work to rebuild it.

...for all time.

00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,000
No way. We couldn't break
through that thick shell?

282
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,583
It must be stronger
than our paopei alloy!

283
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,500

It transformed.

coming from Bunchu...

[BUNCHU] I realize it was
rude of me to hold back,

314
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,291
especially when my opponents
are racing to their deaths.

315
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:43,916
But now... I vow to take
this fight more seriously.

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,916
The Sennin world
as we know it...

Do you hate them... Lord Ryo Bo?

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,916
And do you hunger for revenge?

320

Well don't even bother.

321
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,333
Trust me, it's not
worth the effort.

00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,291
Unless you can somehow
change the whole world,

323
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,791
this will keep happening
until the end of time.

324
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,208
[TAIKOBO]
He warned me back then.

325
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,916
He said that we would
never know happiness,

326
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,333
unless we could somehow
change the world.

327
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:58,291
That moment...
is when it all started.

328
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,083
[TAIJO]
The level of your struggle

329
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,875
has no bearing on the outcome.

330
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,708

331

[TAIKOBO gasps]

332
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,208
[TAIKOBO]
What do you mean?

333
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,000
[TAIJO]
Even if you were to defeat Dakki

334
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,416
and create a human world
without Sennin or Doshi,

335
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,166
there's no guarantee
happiness would reign.

336
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,958
There will always be
another unfit ruler,

337
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,250
or a nation with
immense military power

338
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:36,166
to rise up and take
control and bring death.

339
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,791
We won't know the true
outcome until we try.

340
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,625
What I mean to say is
it's already done.

341
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,500
I have seen the future

342
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,541
and it's not the one
you wish to create.

343
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,500
[TAIJO] There will be
endless battles and chaos.

344
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,500
In the end,
everything disappears,

345
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,625
leaving the world barren.

346
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,958
Is this worth your suffering?

347
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,083
[TAIKOBO chuckles]

348
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,750
What?

349
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,500
Tell me why you laugh.

350
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,083
[TAIKOBO]
Because I'm not responsible

351
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,708
for all that happens
that far into the future.

352
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,333
And I'm not arrogant
enough to believe

353
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:33,541
I can save everyone
for all eternity.

354
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,000
[TAIKOBO] There is one
thing within our reach.

355
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,958
That's leaving the
next generation a world

356
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:46,750
that we treated with
compassion and respect.

357
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,458
As long as someone
benefits from our work

358
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,958
and humanity continues...

359
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,875
...honestly, that's
good enough for me.
