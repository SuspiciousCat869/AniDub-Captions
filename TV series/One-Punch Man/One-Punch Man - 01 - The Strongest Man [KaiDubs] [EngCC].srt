Man: It's closing in!

13
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,854
Man #2: Damn!
So who's available?

14
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,789
Woman: We have confirmation
that lightning Max

15
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,658
and smile man
are on their way!

16
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,061
Man #1: Get me
that threat level assessment!

17
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,334
Reporter: As you can see,

18
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,735
explosions are going off
behind me!

19
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:12,604
The wake of destruction
left by this monster

20
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,205
is at an unprecedented scale!

21
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,809
The heroes association
is analyzing the threat level

22
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:17,809
in order to--aah!

( child crying )

29
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,370
Mommy! Daddy!

00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,548
Hmm?

33
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,151
Huh?

34
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,789
You're a fast one.

35
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,090
Who are you?

36
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,796
Hero: Just a guy
who's a hero for fun.

37
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,599
Monster: You're kidding.

38
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,135
What kind
of half-assed backstory is that?

39
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,737
Mine's far superior.

40
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,273
I was formed from the pollution
man wrought upon the earth.

41
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,343
I am vaccine man!

42
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,811
The earth is
a single living organism.

43
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:30,349
You filthy humans are nothing
but a disease-causing bacteria

44
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,351
eating away
at her precious life force.

45
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,352
In order to wipe out humanity

46
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,888
and the evil civilization
built on her surface,

47
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,691
the earth,
in her infinite wisdom,

48
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,293
has given birth to me!

49
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,562
You say you do this for fun?

50
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,363
For fun?!

51
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,366
How dare you confront
mother earth's apostle

52
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,367
for such a mindless reason?!

53
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:52,838
Yet what could be
expected from a hu--

54
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,342
( rumbling )

55
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,383
Hero: Not again.

56
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,984
All it took was one punch.

57
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:10,855
Damn it!

58

00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,825
Monster: What's this?

66
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,495
Are you sure
you don't want to run away?

67

( Monster laughs )

70
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,303
Bet you're a new businessman
already hating the daily grind.

71
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,573
I ate too much crab
and turned into this, crablante!

72
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,510
You should be crapping
in your pants right now.

73
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,311
Why aren't you running?
( Laughs )

74
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,847
Got a death wish or something?

75
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,648
Is that it?

76
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,518
Man #2: Well, not quite.

77
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,253
( Crablante chuckles )

78
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,587
Man #2: I'm no businessman.

79
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,789
I'm unemployed.

80
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,291
Right now
I'm looking for a job.

81
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,794
I had another interview today

82
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:23,328
and got turned down big time.

83
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,730
Man #3: Crab guy!

84
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,598
Man #2: I couldn't
care less about anything,

85
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,402
and I'm in no mood
to turn tail and run

86
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,005
just because you're here.

87
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,940
( Crablante laughs )

88
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,276
Man #2: So what happens now,
crablante?

89
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,011
( Crablante chuckles )

90
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,948
Your eyes are cold and lifeless,
just the same as mine.

91
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,883
Since we have that in common,

92
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,953
I think I'll let you
off the hook this time.

93
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:52,491
Besides, right now I'm out
hunting different prey.

94
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,758
Man #2: Hmm?

95
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:56,295
Crablante: A brat
with a big chin.

96
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,963
And when I find him,
I'm gonna rip his arms off!

97
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,333
( Laughs )

98
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,539
Man: Huh?

99
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,776
Boy: Hmm?

100
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,045
¶¶

101
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:14,646
what are you looking at?

102
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,648
( Man thinking )
The big-chinned brat.

103
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,650
If he's caught, he's dead.

104
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,654
Hey, kid, were you messing
with a big crab monster?

105
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,789
Boy: Uh...

106
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,391
While he was sleeping
out in the park,

107
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,393
I drew some nipples
on his chest.

108
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,661
¶¶

109
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,863
( man thinking )
It's definitely him.

110
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,265
He has no idea what he's done.

111
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,001
What do I do?
I could still help, but...

112
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,469
Boy: Huh?

113
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,472
Man: ...This kid's
kinda weird-looking.

114
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,941
It's none of my business,
really.

115
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,676
I should just walk away.

116
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,878
( Chuckles )

117
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,814
Right. I mean,
who really cares, anyway?

118
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,417
( Crablante laughs )

119
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,752
Found you!

120
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,355
Gaah!

121
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,157
( Man thinking )
What the hell am I doing?

122
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,359
Crablante: Eh?

123
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,628
Man: Listen, kid!
He's after you!

124
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,363
Now get outta here!

125
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,834
Don't worry about me! Just go!

126
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,969
Boy: But I can't.

127
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,971
I gotta get my soccer ball.

128
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,372
Man: Are you serious?!

129
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,575
( Crablante chuckles )

130
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,977
Cold eyes, what's the big idea?

131
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,045
Don't tell me
you're gonna protect

132
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,714
that stinkin' big-chinned brat.

133
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,049
Man: Oh, come on.

134
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,051
You're really
gonna kill this kid

135
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,786
over some harmless little prank?

136
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,587
Doesn't that seem kinda harsh?

137
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:30,722
( Crablante laughs )
Whatever.

138
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,991
I've killed people
for a lot less.

139
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,927
Whoever makes fun
of the way I look

140
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,597
pays the price, no exceptions.

141
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,333
By the way, that little punk

142
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,603
drew ridiculous nipples
on my manly shell-chest

143
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,671
and in permanent marker!

144
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,005
I've got claws!

145
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,108
I can't even use a towel
to wipe it off!

146
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,611
Get in my way,
and I'll make sure

147
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,848
that job interview you blew
today will be your last.

148
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,684

Crablante: Hmm?

151
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,027
Man: Man, it just came to me.

152
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,695
You look just like a villain

153
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,664
from this kid's cartoon
I used to watch.

154
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,105
( Boy gasps ) Ahh!

155
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,906
Crablante: Die.

156
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:23,041
Boy: Ahh!

157
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,543
( Stammers )

158
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,179
Crablante: Hmm?

159
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,647
Man: Stop right there.

160
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,850
If I watch you kill a kid
right in front of me,

161
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:32,785
I'll have nightmares.

162
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:36,522
You know what?

163
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:40,191
When I was a little boy,
I wanted to be a hero,

164
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:42,861
not some damn businessman,
but a superhero

165
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,865
who could send rotten villains
like you flying with one punch.

166
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,801
Screw looking for a job.

167

168

00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,740
Crablante: Oh, a hero, huh?

170
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,807
Ridiculous!

171
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,477
You're pathetic!

172
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:02,081
You don't stand
a chance against me.

173
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,683
Your life ends...

174
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,219
Now!

175
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,487
( Squealing )

176
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,423
( Man growling )

177
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,859
( Crablante yelling )

178
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,167
( Yelling stops )

179
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,169
( Man panting )

180
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,579
Has it really been three years
since then?

181
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:42,187
After that day,
I trained so hard I went bald

182
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,190
and became so powerful
no one can beat me.

183
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,060
I'm the hero
I'd always dreamed of becoming.

184
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,729
( Narrating )
So what is this?

185
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,864
- ( Woman giggles )
- Hero: What's wrong with me?

186
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,933
Why does my heart feel
so lifeless and empty?

187
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,935
- Woman #2: Oh, my.
- Boy: Hey, mom, who is that?

188
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,738
Cashier: 482 yen, please.

189
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,007
Hero: Sure.

190
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,742
Oh, hang on a sec.

191
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,011
- ( Rumbling )
- ( People gasping )

192
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,084
Hero: Here. I have the 82 yen.

193
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:14,887
Huh?

194
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,935
¶¶

195
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,972
( footsteps rumbling )

196
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,243
Scientist: Yes!

197
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,779
This is incredible,
little brother!

198
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,315
I never thought
it would work so well.

199
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,118
( Giant thinking )
Amazing.

200
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,656
This power is more
than I could have ever imagined.

201
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:55,594
My goal was to become
the strongest man in the world,

202
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,863
the strongest man.

203
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,598
That was my dream.

204
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,201
( Scientist laughs )

205
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,739
At last, the ultimate steroid,
"biceps king," is complete!

206
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:08,874
( Giant panting )

207
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,743
Scientist: Hey, marugori,
drink this,

208
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,345
and you will obtain
the power you've been seeking.

209
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,280
Marugori: What?

210
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,549
You sure about this?

211
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,018
Scientist: Indeed!
I added strawberry flavoring

212
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,887
to make it go down easier.

213
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,355
Marugori: Okay.

214
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,827
( Yelling )

215
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:32,364
( Scientist laughs )
Yes! Wonderful!

216
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,901
My brains and your brawn!

217
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,703
By combining
the greatest of minds

218
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,905
and the strongest of bodies
this world has to offer,

219
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,573
the two of us
will conquer the earth

220
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,909
and rule together as kings!

221
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,177
We're unstoppable!

222
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,248
( Marugori roars )

223
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,186
Scientist: Incredible.

224
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,455
Good! Well done!

225
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:57,990
Thousands have perished!

226
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,160
Now then, on to cleanse
the next town as well!

227
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,796
Marugori: This is it.

228
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:06,064
This is what I was looking for,

229
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,868
to be the strongest man.

230
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,938
Announcer: This is
an emergency evacuation warning.

231
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,674
A giant creature
of unknown origin

232
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,943
- has appeared in city d.
- ( Sirens blaring )

233
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:21,347
The creature is currently
on a direct path towards city b.

234
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:25,216
All residents,
please evacuate immediately.

235
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,820
I repeat, the giant creature
is currently heading for...

236
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,088
( People scream )

237
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,691
Scientist: Yes. Run!

238
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,825
Scatter like rats!

239
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,027
Destroy them all!

240
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,162
Marugori: The strongest man.

241
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,299
The strongest man.
The strongest man.

242
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,901
Scientist: So what do you think,
dear brother?

243
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,837
Hero: Yeah, how's it feel
being the strongest?

244
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,906
Scientist: What?! There's
someone on your shoulder!

245
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,109
Hero: Put some pants on.

246
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:51,443
( Scientist growls )

247
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,279
That guy there
on your shoulder, kill him!

248
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,393
Marugori: Brother, no!

249
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,061
How did this happen?!

250
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,465
All I wanted was to be
the strongest man in the world!

251
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:18,336
And now that I finally am,
I kill my own brother!

252
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,138
( Growls )

253
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,942
I don't know who you are,
but this is your fault!

254
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,845
You're gonna pay!

255
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,284
( Roars )

256
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:34,820
¶¶

257
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,822
the strongest.

258
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,894
Behold our brotherly power!

259
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,339
( Panting )

260
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,876
I am the strongest.

261
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,986
But what does that matter?

262
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:10,055
I feel empty.

263
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,491
Hero: You get it, right?

264
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:26,271
Having overwhelming strength
is pretty boring, actually.

265
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:30,843
Whoops.

266
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,954
Hero: There's no sign

267
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:44,556
that the evils of this world
are disappearing.

268
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,492
That hasn't changed
since before I became a hero.

269
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:52,765
So I guess that means I haven't
really made any difference.

270
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,368
I'm not necessarily sad
about that,

271
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,772
but there has been something
bothering me lately.

272
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,575
As the days pass,
my emotions grow more distant.

273
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,778
- ( Cat meows )
- Hero: Fear, tension, joy,

274
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,581
anger, I feel
none of them anymore.

275
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,450
In exchange for power,

276
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,853
maybe I've lost something that's
essential for being human.

277
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,388
- ( Cat yowls )
- Hero: Huh?

278
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,591
- ( Crashing )
- Oh?

279
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,527
Monster: Vroom, vroom?

280
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,061
( Laughs )

281
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,330
No sense hiding if you saw me.

282
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,268
I'm super custom yo649z Mark 2!

283
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,069
I love building custom cars...

284
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,005
Hero: Before, I'd have
all kinds of emotions

285
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,741
whirling inside me
when I fought,

286
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:38,344
dread, panic, rage.

287
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:39,878
Super custom yo649z:
If you were thinking

288
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,546
about getting in my way,

289
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,749
I'll put a spit-shine
on that big headlight of yours!

290
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,452
( Screams )

291
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,659
Hero: But now all I need
is one punch to end it.

292
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:58,964
Eggs over rice sounds good
for dinner tonight.

293
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,333
¶¶

294
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:07,506
every day, I come home uninjured
and wash my gloves.

295
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,442
When I'm out fighting monsters,

296
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:13,812
I never feel as if my heart's
really in it anymore.

297
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:19,118
I mean, I just do the hero thing
as a hobby,

298
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,920
but as long
as I get a kick out of it,

299
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,024
in the end,
that's all I really care about.

300
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,627
( Birds chirping )

301
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:35,934
( Rumbling )

( Snores )

00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,642
( Yelps )

304
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,113
My house.

305
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,428
( Monster growls )

306
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:03,896
Hero: He's tough.

307
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,765
Just what in the hell are you?

308
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,700
Monster: What are we?

309
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,837
That's rude.
We are the true earthlings.

310
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,505
Hero: Did you say "we"?

311
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:17,643
Subterranean: I believe
your kind call us subterraneans.

312
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:21,580
We suffer from overpopulation.

313
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,182
Therefore, we must claim
the world aboveground.

314
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:28,787
We've learned the surface world
is overpopulated, too.

315
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,855
This is a problem for us,

316
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:36,395
which is why we have decided
to eradicate all of you.

317
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,465
Subterranean #2: Since we began
our invasion operation,

318
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:43,402
70% of the surface dwellers
have died.

319
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,737
This is a battle for survival.

320
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:49,007
I hope you can understand that.

321
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,476
Subterranean #1:
However, this is unexpected.

322
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,545
We have encountered
no surface dwellers

323
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,547
that our punches could not kill.

324
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,616
Hero: Oh, yeah? Same here.

325
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:58,951
It's been too long

326
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:00,752
since I've come across
such worthy opponents,

327
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,154
mole men.

328
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:04,490
Subterranean #1: Hmm?

329
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,558
We are earthlings!

00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:16,568
Subterranean #2:
What?! But how?!

00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:17,569
¶¶

333
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,705
subterranean #3:
Human bastard!

334
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,640
( Hero chuckles )

335
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,042

Subterranean #4: It's over.

339
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,766
Subterranean #5:
What was that surface dweller?

340
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:21,967
He was so strong.

341
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,769
Hero: Who, me?

342
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,705
I'm just a guy
who's a hero for fun.

Hero: I never lose.

346
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:32,644
And the surface...

347
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,613
Is guarded by me!

348
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:39,184

Big talk for a race of vermin.

( Hero yells )

350

¶¶

351
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,035
what is this feeling
coming over me?

352
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,905
This wild throbbing
in my heart?

353
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:06,211
This rush? This sensation?

354
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,846
( Subterraneans yell )

355
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,020
Hero: It's been so long,

356
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:20,225
I'd forgotten the exhilaration
of a real fight!

( Panting )

359
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,109
It's all coming back to me now.

360
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,977
This is it!

361
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,378
Subterranean #5: Well, well.

362
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:43,716
It looks like you've
been taking good care

363
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,851
of my children,
surface dweller!

364
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,652
Hero: This is it.

365
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:52,324
King: Let's see how you fare
against the subterranean king!

366
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,593
Hero: This is the feeling...

367
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,796
I've been looking for!

( Rumbling )

371
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:15,814
Subterranean:
The surface is ours, humans!

372
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,617
You surface dwellers must die!

373
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,953
I am the subterranean king!

374
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,088
Now prepare yourselves for the--

375
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,690

Hero: All right!
Now bring it on!

379
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,368
Huh?

380
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:49,982
I've become too strong.

381
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:56,422
¶¶
