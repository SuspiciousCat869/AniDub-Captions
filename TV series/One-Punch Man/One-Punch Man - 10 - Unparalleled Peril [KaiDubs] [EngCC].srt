¶¶

3
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:22,087
monster: Long have I awaited
this moment, human filth.

4
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,356
With the subterranean
and deep sea kings gone,

5
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,692
the terror lizard clan

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,062
can at last reclaim
rulership of the earth!

7
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,064
Hmm?

8
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,107
Man: Now leading target
towards point bravo.

9
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,242
Man #2: Roger.

10
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,112
We are inbound and on schedule.

11
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:50,049
Worker: We'll be on top
of bravo very soon.

12
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:53,052
¶¶

13
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,338
Tornado: Hmph!

14
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:17,876
¶¶

15
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,812
( singing in Japanese )

16
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,436
Monster: And who are you?

17
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,504
( Cell phone rings )

18
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:46,638
Tornado: Hello. What is it?

19
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:47,840
( Monster stammers )

20
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,841
Tornado: Huh?
What do you mean, come back?

21
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,443
Uhh! You're the one who said

22
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,113
some weirdo monster was
waking up and flew me out here!

23
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,581
Monster: Weirdo?

24
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,249
Tornado: Yeah, that's right.

25
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,717
Yeah. I was just about to start.

26
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,652
Ancient king:
I am the ancient king!

27
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,587
- As ruler of the dinosaurs...
- Tornado: Trouble?

28
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,456
So what? That is not my problem!

29
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,857
Hey, shut your snout!

30
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,659
Can't you see
I'm talking on the phone here?!

31
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,593
( Ancient king gasps )

32
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,729
Tornado: I am so tired of this.

33
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,133
I mean, who does he think he is?
Annoying.

34
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,200
Hmm?

35
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,601
Ancient king: Are you done?

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,203
Tornado: What's with the chin?

37
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,404
Trying to be scary?

38
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,340
Should I be
shaking in my boots?

39
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,542
Ancient king: Act brave
while you still can,

40
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,277
you annoying little runt!

41
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,413
( Tornado growls ) Who are you
calling a runt, you toad?!

42
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,416
( Ancient king roars )

43
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,219
Hmm?

44
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,689
Ah, so you aren't helpless.

45
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,358
But to destroy me,
a giant meteor

46
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,695
is about the only thing
that's strong enough.

47
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,297
Tornado: Fine.
I'll get one of those, then.

48
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,333
Ancient king:
Don't make me laugh.

49
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,536
( Roaring )

50
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:53,872
Uh...

51
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,777
( Explosion echoes )

52
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,880
Tornado: How about another
300-million-year nap?

53
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,584
Hmph!

54
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,319
( Tires squeal )

55
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:12,257
( Bird calling )

56
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,194
Bang: Fist of flowing water
crushing rock!

57
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,166
¶¶

58
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,937
it goes something like that.

59
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,739
Want to give it a try?

60
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,541
You're both strong
and look like quick learners,

61
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,743
I bet you'll get
the hang of it in no time.

62
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:32,878
What do you say?

63
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,746
Saitama: Is this
really the cool thing

64
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,749
you said you wanted to show us,
a sales pitch for your dojo?

65
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,284
Thanks, but I'll pass.

66
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,752
You can do it, genos.

67
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,821
Genos: No. I will pass as well.

68
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,490
What I seek to learn
is not the art of self-defense,

69
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,558
but total destructive power.

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,492
Student: You punks!

71
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,428
Mocking our fighting style?!

72
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,464
I, the top disciple,
charanko, challenge you!

73
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,768
I--i give up!

74
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,969
( Groans )

75
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,371
Genos: Is he really
your best student?

76
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,572
Bang: Hmm. Afraid so.

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,375
Genos: But I had heard
that your dojo

78
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,776
was brimming
with skilled fighters.

79
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,447
Bang: Hmm. Well, one of
my best disciples went wild.

80
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,183
He beat my most skilled
students so badly,

81
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,718
they're all
out of commission.

82
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,520
The rest got scared and quit.

83
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,722
Understandable,
but unfortunate.

84
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,724
Saitama:
Is he really that strong?

85
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,258
What's his name?

86
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,460
Bang: Garo.

87
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,462
¶¶

88
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,598
even though he was
my top disciple at the time,

89
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,933
I gave him a good beating
and expelled him.

90
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,269
Saitama: You must pack
a mean punch, old man.

91
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,404
Charanko: Hey, watch it!

92
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:33,806
This is
the famed hero silverfang,

93
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:35,674
class s, rank three!

94
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,943
He toys with opponents,
flowing like water,

95
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,411
then delivers a blow

96
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,746
like a raging river
smashing a Boulder!

97
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,549
A master of martial arts!

98
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,884
You only recently
became a hero, right?

99
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,619
That would explain
your ignorance.

100
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,422
You'll regret ever taking
master bang so lightly!

101
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,357
Bang: Enough, charanko.

102
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,425
Do not disgrace us so.

103
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,029
Our guest saitama is
many times stronger than I am.

104
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,498
Charanko: You can't
be serious, master.

105
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,499
- ( Door opens )
- Worker #2: Mr. Silverfang!

106
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,702
( Panting )
I was sent by the association.

107
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,705
An emergency summons has been
issued to all class-s heroes!

108
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:09,708
Please come
to association headquarters now!

109
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,644
Hey, wait. You're out here
as well, Mr. Genos?

110
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,446
Thank goodness. Perfect timing!

111
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:17,649
Since all class-s heroes have
been summoned, please come, too.

112
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,985
Genos: Has it reached
threat level dragon?

113
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,453
Bang: Here we go.

114
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,523
Charanko, look after the dojo.

115
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,724
Charanko: Be careful, master!

116
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,127
Genos: If all class s
are being summoned,

117
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,863
then they may need
your assistance as well, master.

118
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,798
Will you come with us?

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,734
Saitama: I will.
Nothing better to do.

120
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,070
¶¶

121
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:45,543
hero: Ah.
Hey, there, silverfang.

122
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:48,547
Bang: Atomic samurai.
It's been too long.

123
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,816
Atomic samurai:
I figured you'd be here today.

124
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,018
And this is
the cyborg genos and--

125
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,553
hold on. I don't recognize you.

126
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,889
Bang: This is
the class-b hero saitama.

127
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,292
His great talents
will surely place him

128
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,495
atop class s one day,
so we asked him to come.

129
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,297
Saitama: Oh, hey, there,
middle-aged hero dude.

130
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,099
Nice to meet you. Huh?

131
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,033
Atomic samurai:
No handshake for you.

132
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,635
I only acknowledge the strong.

133
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,439
But someday, once you've
climbed up to class s,

134
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,907
I'll greet you properly.

135
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,643
Besides,
I'm not middle-aged yet.

136
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:20,446
I'm only 37 years old.

137
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,714
Saitama: 37 isn't middle-aged?

138
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,650
I had no idea.

139
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,452
Tornado: Hey, who brought
a class-b nobody along?

140
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,055
Don't you think mingling with
the less-thans is beneath us?

141
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,057
And even if you were invited,
a polite person would decline.

142
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,793
( Scoffs ) The nerve.

143
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,796
You're probably just here to get
close to us class-s heroes.

144
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,466
You disgust me. Get lost.

145
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:41,934
Saitama: Uh...

146
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:44,736
What's with the attitude
from this lost child?

147
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,673
Genos: That is tornado,
class s, rank two.

148
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,541
Tornado: Hey, who're you
callin' a child, chrome dome?!

149
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,876
Genos: She is able
to defeat monsters

150
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,411
with her psychic powers,
using e.S.P.

151
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,612
Saitama: Yeah?

152
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,947
Genos: It appears
everyone has arrived.

153
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,482
We should join them.

154
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,485
Tornado: Ahh! You jerk!

155
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,819
Stop ignoring me!

156
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,422
¶¶

157
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,424
( soft murmuring, smacking )

158
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,967
( Puri-puri prisoner thinking )
Maybe this will be

159
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,835
my chance
to get closer to genos.

160
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,104
Genos: It must be serious.

161
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,506
Almost all of class s is here.

162
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,877
Metal bat: Demon or dragon,
whatever, bring it on!

163
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,112
Tank-top master: Saitama?

164
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,881
That name rings a bell.

165
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,051
( Watchdog man sniffs )

166
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,187
Pretty sure somebody farted.

167
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,522
Blackluster: They're all
checking out my guns.

168
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,091
Boom! Hell, yeah!

169
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,130
( Whirs )

170
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,734
Zombieman: No one looks
particularly enthusiastic.

171
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,136
And does that pig
ever stop eating?

172
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,172
( Heart beating )

173
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,813
Child emperor:
Rank one's a no-show again?

174
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,215
I was hoping to see him.

175
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,484
Atomic samurai:
I still don't get it.

176
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,554
Is silverfang going to take
those youngsters on as students?

177
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,958
Bang: So why have we
all been gathered here?

178
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,759
Tornado:
Who really cares, anyway?

179
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,095
I had to drop
everything I was doing

180
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,130
and was kept waiting
for over two hours.

181
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,501
( Music stops )

182
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,970
Saitama: Can I have some tea?

183
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,006
Heroes: Huh?

184
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,108
Executive: My apologies.
I was delayed.

185
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,709
- We do not know...
- Saitama: Oh, thanks.

186
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,779
Executive: The whereabouts
of metal knight or blast,

187
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,781
nor can we reach them
at this time.

188
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,649
There's no sense
in waiting any longer,

189
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,518
so let's begin
this emergency meeting.

190
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,853
As for introductions,
you can call me sitch.

191
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,522
I represent the association
and will be briefing you.

192
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:47,259
So let's get right down
to brass tacks, shall we?

193
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:50,195
You heroes are here 'cause
you're the best of the best,

194
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,998
the top of the class. And now...

195
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,201
We're asking you to rise to
the occasion and save the earth!

196
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,737
However, I must warn you

197
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,739
that even with
your class-s skills,

198
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,874
there is no guarantee
of survival.

199
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,943
Walking away also takes courage.

200
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,012
Anybody choosing to do so now

201
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,747
will still retain
class-s status,

202
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,683
but those among you
who stay and hear me out

203
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,687
will not be allowed
to walk away from this briefing.

204
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,088
You will be confined here

205
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,490
until we are certain
the incident is over

206
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,692
in order to avoid
a general panic.

207
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:24,229
All right then, are all of you
willing to hear this?

208
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,899
Metal bat: Look, buddy.
Whatever's going on around here,

209
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,902
it better be worth
calling all of us.

210
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,837
I skipped out
on my little sister's

211
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,839
piano recital for this.
She'll be crushed.

212
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,774
If it's a total load of crap,

213
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:38,710
then I'm gonna tear
this whole building apart.

214
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,178
Tornado: Hmph!

215
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,913
Like you could do that
with that skinny stick, anyway.

216
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,181
Metal bat: Yeah?!

217
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,116
How 'bout I
bust your head open instead?!

218
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,052
Tornado:
If you think you can do it,

219
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,387
bring it on!
Stupid pill-bug head!

220
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,788
Metal bat: What'd you say?!

221
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,189
Flash: Just hurry up
and get on with it.

222
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,126
Otherwise, Mr. Pompadour
over here is going to die.

223
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,994
- ( Bat clatters )
- Metal bat: Hey, Bobby pin,

224
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,929
you siding with the girls?
What's your problem?

225
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:02,134
Sitch: The great seer known
as madame shibabawa is dead.

226
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,136
Zombieman:
Wait. Madame shibabawa?

227
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,805
- Was she murdered?
- Worker #1: No.

228
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,140
While looking into the future
for the next six months,

229
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,143
she became agitated
and had a bad coughing fit.

230
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,279
She popped a cough drop in her
mouth to ease her discomfort

231
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,014
and unfortunately
ended up choking on it.

232
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,682
Blackluster: I get it.

233
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,619
So we have to figure out
some way to prevent disasters

234
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,154
without the help of predictions.

235
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,957
That's the reason we were
all called to this meeting.

236
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,224
Sitch: Incorrect.

237
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,760
Madame shibabawa
has only been able to predict

238
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,696
a handful of disasters
over the years.

239
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,765
- Saitama: Excuse me.
- Sitch: The truth is...

240
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,965
Saitama: Hey, you there.

241
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,166
Puri-puri prisoner: Huh?

242
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,302
Saitama: Who is
this shibabawa, a hero?

243
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,437
Puri-puri prisoner:
You haven't heard of her?

244
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,107
She's a seer,
a great one at that.

245
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,175
She correctly predicted

246
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,377
earthquakes
and monster attacks.

247
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,513
Supervisor: We've gotten
through many crises

248
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:49,982
without madame shibabawa's
predictions.

249
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,251
Still, we provided her
with a bodyguard

250
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,053
and gave her special treatment
for her services.

251
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,788
Sitch: Indeed,
and that's because

252
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,391
her few predictions
were 100% accurate.

253
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,060
The crux of the problem,
though, is this:

254
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,597
I hold in my hand her last
and perhaps greatest prophecy.

255
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,134
As she took her last breaths
choking on that cough drop,

256
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,002
she managed to leave this note.

257
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:14,807
It is a grave prediction that
will absolutely come to pass.

258
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,142
Here it is!

259
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,144
Can you read it?

260
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,679
Heroes: "Th-the earth is...

261
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,081
In trouble"?!

262
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,686
Child emperor: Are you kidding?
That is so dumb.

263
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,755
Can I go now?
I have cram school.

264
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,090
Sitch: I know you're a prodigy,
child emperor,

265
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,293
but if you cannot grasp
the catastrophic danger

266
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,894
I've presented before you today,

267
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,097
it reveals
just how immature you are.

268
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:39,297
Child emperor:
What'd you say?!

269
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,900
Sitch: Now calm down.
Everyone, listen up.

270
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:45,437
Madame shibabawa's predictions
are 100% accurate.

271
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,439
She's miraculously foretold

272
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,042
numerous tragedies
and disasters in the past.

273
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,844
While many were saved,

274
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:54,446
a few of them resulted
in the loss of countless lives.

275
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:57,049
But not once
in all of her predictions

276
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:58,717
did madame shibabawa use a word

277
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:00,452
with the same weight
as "trouble."

278
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,788
Something more dangerous
than a dragon-level cataclysm

279
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,722
or monster is on its way.

280
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,992
Of that, we can be sure,
and it will occur

281
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,862
sometime in the next six months!

282
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:12,931
( Heart beating )

283
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,800
Watchdog man:
Okay, but does that mean

284
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,269
you have no idea when
in the next six months?

285
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,805
Flash: Yeah. It's kind of hard
to plan for that.

286
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,406
Sitch: Yes,
your observations are correct.

287
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:24,476
But I want you all
to be ready for a fight

288
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:26,411
in the next six months.
Is that understood?

289
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,213
Saitama: In the next six months

290
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:31,483
means that it could be
tomorrow or even today.

291
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,752
Sitch: Uh, yes, that's true.

292
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,354
Who are you, anyway?

293
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:36,555
( Saitama chuckles )

294
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:38,557
It's a good thing I came.

295
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,557
( Rumble )

296
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:40,959
( Heroes gasping )

297
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,895
Genos: The building
is under attack!

298
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,162
Blackluster: Wait.
That's impossible.

299
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,164
This is the hero association
headquarters.

300
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,133
( Crowd screaming )

301
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,907
( Monster laughs )

302
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:59,511
That's quite the formidable
fortress, to be sure.

303
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,046
( Laughs )

304
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,448
Time to attack!

305
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,449
Hawk, eagle, falcon, and kite!

306
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,918
Monsters: Yar!

307
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,318
Leader: Wipe out
these so-called heroes,

308
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,254
and the land below
will belong to us!

309
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,256
We will dive in headfirst.

310
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,192
Follow me, the sky king!

311
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,260
Fly!

312
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,063
- Soldier: Father, above us.
- Sky king: Eh?

313
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,467
- Soldier: Fly away. ( Gags )
- ( Soldiers squawking )

314
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,935
Sky king: The sky king,

315
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,937
killed like
some worthless little insect.

316
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,073
Who could have--uhh!

317
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,609
Monster: What was that?

318
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,210
( Monster #2 identical )
Who knows?

319
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,945
( Monster #3 identical )
It flew, so we killed it.

320
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,414
Head #4: That is good.

321
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,549
Head #5: Duty,
to protect the ship.

322
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,218
¶¶

323
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,286
( rumble )

324
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,499
Ated.

325
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:55,968
Sitch: What in blazes was that?

326
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,103
What in the hell is
going on out there?

327
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,438
Supervisor: I don't know, sir!

328
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,039
All communications
have been cut off.

329
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,973
We're in the dark!

330
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,942
( Sitch groans )

331
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,746
I-Impossible!

332
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,550
( Child gasping, coughing )

333
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,853
Dad!

334
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,988
Father: We're okay now, son.
Grab on to me.

335
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,525
There you go, that's the way!

336
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,527
That's it. Good job!

337
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,595
( Boy crying )

338
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:26,865
Eh?

339
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,502
¶¶

340
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,873
( shudders )

341
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,108
Monster: What is this?

342
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,612
It appears there are survivors.

343
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,815
Head #5: The ship
failed to kill them all.

344
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,883
- Head #3: We won't.
- Head #5 that is good.

345
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,155
Hero: Get away from here
right now!

346
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,893
( Gasps )

347
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,634
Hero: You think I don't sense
your thirst for blood?

348
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,570
I accompanied master atomic here
and was waiting

349
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,572
for the class-s meeting
to come to an end,

350
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,108
only to meet
thunder and destruction.

351
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,112
Is this your doing, beast?!

352
00:15:13,114 --> 00:15:16,848
Sitch: D-destruction levels
are at 99.8%?

353
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,852
City a has been leveled!
It was destroyed in an instant!

354
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,655
I thought we'd have more time!
How could we have known

355
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,457
her prediction
would come true so soon?!

356
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:27,993
Bang: Hold on. Why was
this building spared, then?

357
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:30,195
Worker #1: Metal knight
was given the assignment

358
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,064
to construct this building.
His cutting-edge specs

359
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,532
are why it's stronger
than the average shelter.

360
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,868
Metal bat: Ah, so that's
why there are no windows.

361
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,470
Child emperor:
We should go outside

362
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,005
and see what's going on
for ourselves,

363
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:41,874
just to be sure
the prophecy's happening.

364
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,009
Saitama: Master, will you--

365
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,614
master.

366
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,216
¶¶

367
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,617
saitama: That's big.

368
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:53,886
Are they aliens?

369
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,692
Oh.

370
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,200
So that's what blew
the city to pieces.

371
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,905
I've had enough.

372
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:14,873
Get lost!

373
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,911
( Hero panting )

374
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,116
Head #1: This is
one militant creature.

375
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:25,650
Head #2: Also cautious.

376
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,586
Head #3: Hurry.
Let us hurry and kill.

377
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,787
Head #4: That is good.

378
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,223
Hero: Can it even be destroyed?

379
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,598
Each of its strikes is lethal.

380
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,533
I can't beat this thing.

381
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:44,202
Head #1: Such a weak
and frail species.

382
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,138
Head #3: So easily killed.

383
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,206
Head #4: That is good.

384
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,807
Hero: It's splitting?

385
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:49,942
Damn it. What is this?

386
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,544
Monster #1:
I will dispose of this one.

387
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,146
You handle the others.

388
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:55,681
Monster #2: Very well then.

389
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,083
Monster #3: I will go kill
those that ran away from us.

390
00:16:58,152 --> 00:16:59,885
- Monster #4: That is good.
- Monster #5: I--

391
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:04,622
hero: Master!

392
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:07,492
Atomic samurai:
Iairon. You don't look so good.

393
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,828
You okay?
Your left arm's kinda--

394
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:11,163
iairon: Master!

395
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,365
Swords have no effect
on this strange creature!

396
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,567
Forget about me!
Get out of here!

397
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,937
Atomic samurai: Begone!

398
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:26,911
Iai, the path of the sword
does not end for you yet.

399
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:27,846
Stop bleeding!

400
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:30,215
( Iairon gasps ) Yes, master!

401
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,058
( Monster laughs )

402
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:42,194
Good. Seems a life-form
on this planet can fight.

403
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:46,264
Excellent. I invite you to try
withstanding our invasion!

404
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,999
Atomic samurai: Planet, huh?

405
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,668
So you're
from outer space, then?

406
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:53,005
And you got friends in that
floaty-toy-ship thing, right?

407
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:54,139
( Alien grunts )

408
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,540
Atomic samurai:
Yeah, that's it.

409
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,010
I doubt you have
the strength or the power

410
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,012
to cause this much destruction
to the city by yourself.

411
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,615
Bang: You can count us in,
atomic samurai.

412
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:06,218
Metal bat: You the ugly bastard
that smashed this town?

413
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,754
Alien: Hah!
What happens if I say, "yes"?

414
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,956
Puri-puri prisoner: For all
the beautiful men you killed,

415
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,824
I claim vengeance!

416
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,227
( Roars )

417
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,162
( Thinking )
Like he said,

418
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,832
each separate attack
must be delivered with intent...

419
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:20,766
To kill!

420
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,967
Dark angel...

421
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:24,369
Flash!

422
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,971
( Roars )

423
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,340
( Alarm blaring )

424
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,710
Supervisor:
Issue an evacuation warning

425
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,912
to city a and all
neighboring cities right away!

426
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:35,314
Workers: Yes, sir!

427
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:37,116
Supervisor: And expand
the system-m vitals monitor

428
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,918
to cover all of city a.
We need an accurate count

429
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:41,853
of the survivors
we'll need to rescue.

430
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,722
Worker #3:
What's the threat level?

431
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:44,923
Worker #1: Dragon,
without doubt.

432
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:45,991
( Workers gasp )

433
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:47,993
Supervisor: Not quite.

434
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:50,929
This might be god.

435
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,132
Child emperor:
Four class-s heroes

436
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,602
can take care
of the enemy on the ground,

437
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,670
but the real problem's up there.

438
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,138
We can't reach that ship.

439
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,274
Any aircraft would be shot down
in a matter of seconds.

440
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:04,876
Blackluster: Any ideas?

441
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,945
You're one of the top fighters
in class s, king,

442
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,880
so I'd love
to hear your take on this.

443
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:11,216
Genos: King, class s, rank 7,

444
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,685
said to be
the strongest man on earth...

445
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:15,154
- ( Heart beating )
- And I see

446
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,890
that he is well respected
by the other heroes.

447
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,959
King: There's nothing
I can do here.

448
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,093
( Both gasp )

449
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,095
King: It's too high in the sky.

450
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:25,964
There's no way to attack it.

451
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:29,501
But the mysterious craft
is currently stationary.

452
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,771
We should use this opportunity
to call in metal knight.

453
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,706
Tornado: Are you kidding?!
How completely pathetic!

454
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,775
Aren't you supposed to be
the strongest man?

455
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,243
Blackluster:
Take it easy, tornado.

456
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,112
If you piss king off,
he will kill you.

457
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,714
Tornado: ...People have
been wiped off the planet,

458
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,115
and you're just going
to give them a free hand?

459
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,183
Unbelievable!

460
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:47,119
( Heart beating quickly)

461
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,453
Tornado: Well, forget it!

462
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,722
I'll just take care
of these creeps myself!

463
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,991
Genos: Wait. I will go, too.

464
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:54,927
I do not know
how effective I can be,

465
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:57,029
but I will attack
the enemy from the ground.

466
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,998
Tornado: Maybe you
didn't hear me.

467
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,266
I said forget about it, okay?!

468
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,269
Blackluster: Whoa!
Take it easy there, genos.

469
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,471
I know how you feel,

470
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,940
but if you piss her off,
she will kill you.

471
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,541
( Genos thinking ) Very well.

472
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,878
There is no need
to team up with others anyway.

473
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:16,148
Master has already successfully
boarded the enemy ship.

474
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,483
Whether this is
the prophecy or not,

475
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,553
there is not a single evil
that could defeat master.

476
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:25,758
If such an evil existed,
then I assume the human race

477
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:28,093
would have perished
into oblivion long ago.

478
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,095
¶¶

Well done making it this far,
intruder,

481
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,235
but you have reached the end!

482
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,570
For I am groribas,

483
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,973
and there is no way
you can hope to defeat me!

484
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:45,511
My acid breath will melt you
into a pile of fleshy pulp!

485
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,179
Blehh!

486
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:51,350

Saitama: Huh.

488
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:03,061
You'd think the boss would
have shown his face by now,

489
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,830
if he's even alive anymore.
