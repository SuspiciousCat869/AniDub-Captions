You must be another soldier

I will tear you to shreds.

19

during the fitness exam,

29
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,342
and he worked
with some class-s heroes

30
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,944
to destroy that meteor,

31
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,346
but because he came
out of nowhere,

32
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,215
people are saying he's a fraud.

33
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,720
Any other class-c hero,
I'd stop.

Worker: Let him go.

35
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,726
This may be our chance
to see how strong he really is.

You could have easily dodged
my little ball of acid.

70

Instead you chose to sacrifice
yourself to save a runt.

00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,987
Great. Perfect.

171
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:45,124
Woman #2: Yeah, but that punch
didn't hurt him at all.

172
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,257
Man #3: That's your imagination.

173
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,326
I mean, you saw how many heroes

174
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,930
were blown away
by that thing's punches, right?

175
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,799
Deep sea king:
King of the deep,

176
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,269
lord of the seas, that's me.

177
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,072
All life on earth
comes from the sea,

178
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:01,940
as if she were our mother.

179
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,743
In other words,
as ruler of the seas,

180
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,212
I am the absolute peak
of a pyramid

181
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,282
that includes every
living organism on this world!

182
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,750
Defying me means--

183
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,153
saitama: Yeah, yeah.
I got it. I got it.

184
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,021
It's raining out,
so let's get this over with.

185
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,991
( Deep sea king roars )

186
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,999
( Crowd gasping )

187
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,979
( Cheering )

188
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,985
- Man #4: Yeah!
- Woman #1: Thank goodness!

189
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,053
Boy: He did it!

190
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,395
Saitama: Well,

191
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,397
that was lame.

192
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,866
I kinda had my hopes up, too.

193
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,338
( Sonic panting )

194
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:11,743
Now I'm back with my weapons,
you monster. Heh.

195
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,146
Damn you, deep sea king.

196
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:20,085
You got away.

197
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,286
Saitama: Ohh.

198
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,421
What's that?

199
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,891
Genos: It is the mail.

200
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,626
The post office
cannot come here.

201
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,094
It is too dangerous,

202
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,162
so the drone
delivers the mail now.

203
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:33,298
Saitama: The post office
has a drone?

204
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,034
Genos: No. It is
the hero association's.

205
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,435
Saitama: Oh, I gotcha.

206
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,038
¶¶

207
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,439
genos: The public
sends these to the heroes.

208
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:44,243
You could say
they are like fan letters.

209
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,546
Saitama: Whoa. For real?
Are any of them for me?

210
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,648
Genos: Indeed.

211
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,983
Saitama: Coolness!

212
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,418
Why don't we go in
and open them!

213
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,188
( Twinkle )

214
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,196
Saitama: Hmm?

215
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,598
( Genos gasps )

216
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,403
Damn it.

217
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,872
I will find out
who sent it, master.

218
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:15,974
Saitama: Here's a guy
with free time.

219
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:23,082
( Crowd cheering )

220
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,084
Man #3: All it took
was one punch!

221
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,352
One punch! Just one!

222
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,221
Man #9: Is he really class c?

223
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,422
Man #2: No way!

224
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,424
- Man #10: Or maybe...
- Man #9: Huh?

225
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:34,092
Man #10:
It's because the monster

226
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,161
wasn't really all that tough.

227
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,431
Man #11: No way. You saw
how many heroes went down.

228
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,899
Man #10: Whatever. Just means

229
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,035
all those heroes
were a bunch of weaklings.

230
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,636
Man #11: Well, maybe.

231
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:48,039
When he took down that thing,
it didn't look that tough.

232
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,041
Man #10: After all,
a class-c hero

233
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:52,177
took it out
with a single punch.

234
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,646
What's that say
about the heroes it beat?

235
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:57,582
They may call themselves
class a or class s,

236
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,985
but it seems like their titles
don't mean a thing.

237
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,187
( Chuckles )

238
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:04,123
Man #12: Stop it!
Enough of that!

239
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,057
Those guys
risked their lives for us!

240
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:07,459
Man #10: Risked their lives?

241
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,261
Come on! Anyone can do that,

242
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,196
but a hero has to beat monsters.

243
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,533
Meh. Guess it all ended up well
this time, so whatever.

244
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:17,001
But I think it's more
than a little annoying

245
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,204
when people
who are really just average Joes

246
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,140
show up and try to save you.

247
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,875
If you're gonna
call yourself a hero--

248
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,077
man #13: Shut your fat mouth,
you smug punk!

249
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,213
Man #10: Relax!
Why are you getting mad at me?!

250
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,949
The hero association's funded
from our donations, right?

251
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,885
As long as we're
the ones paying for it,

252
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,487
those clowns
had better protect us.

253
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,222
The fact of the matter

254
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,092
is that bald guy pretty much
took care of it all by himself,

255
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,428
so in the end, all those
other guys died for nothing.

256
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,365
Anyone can come up with a way
to buy a little extra time.

257
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,233
When you get right down to it,

258
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:51,035
the other "heroes" didn't do
anything heroic at all.

259
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,504
Man #13: I said shut up!

260
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:55,507
Man #12: We were all saved.
Just leave it at that.

261
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,043
- Woman #2: Exactly!
- ( Saitama laughing )

262
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,912
( Laughing continues )

263
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,848
Today's my lucky day!

264
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,917
The other heroes
wore the monster down,

265
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,986
so beating it was child's play,
a piece of cake!

266
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:10,189
Good thing I was late.

267
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:14,193
I barely did anything, and now
I get to take all the credit.

268
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:17,129
Hey! Go spread the word
about this, all of you!

269
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:20,198
I'm the one who finished
the monster off! It was me!

270
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,133
If anyone says
the only reason I won

271
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:24,202
is because I got here late,
I'll kick your ass!

272
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,205
Man #14:
What's he talking about?

273
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,273
Man #15: The monster
was already weak?

274
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:29,340
Man #16: Huh?

275
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,543
Hang on. That's saitama!

276
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,611
Man #17: Saitama?

277
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,479
Man #16: Yeah. Heard of him?

278
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:37,215
He's the hero from city z
that everyone calls a cheat.

279
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,550
Man #17: What? A cheat?

280
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,019
Man #18: I know that guy.
He appeared out of nowhere

281
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,420
and climbed
up the ranks super fast.

282
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,621
Man #16: Yeah, pretty fishy.

283
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:45,223
Saitama: Hey, you guys,

284
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,426
gonna need you to look after
the fallen heroes, okay?

285
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:50,428
'Cause if they up and die on me,

286
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:52,631
how am I gonna cash in
on their work?

287
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:53,899
Man #9: Man, what a dirtbag.

288
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,434
Man #2: Whoa, he is a cheat.

289
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:57,169
Man #3: So he's
just taking the credit?

290
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,504
Man #9: Compared to him,

291
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,639
those other guys
seem a little more heroic.

292
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,175
Man #2:
Where would we be right now

293
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,510
if the other heroes
hadn't fought?

294
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:06,111
They saved us!

295
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,179
Man #3: Yeah, I feel so grateful

296
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:10,282
to every last one of them.

297
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,587
( Genos thinking )
Master saitama,

298
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,123
is this really what you want?

299
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,926
Saitama: Hey,
it stopped raining.

300
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:24,129
Genos: If this is the path
you choose to walk,

301
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,465
I promise I will not interfere.

302
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,001
But in the future,
if the day comes

303
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,537
that you are ever
caught out by this,

304
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,007
at that moment, I will--

305
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,074
saitama: Hey...

306
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,343
There's one more.

307
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,512
Hmm.

308
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,084
Someone's thanking me.

309
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:49,354
Genos: Then it must be
from somebody you saved, master.

310
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,623
Saitama: I see. Any left?

311
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,560
Genos: Oh, there is one
from the hero association.

312
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,228
Saitama: What? Really?

313
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,163
Are they firing me?

314
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,365
Fine. Let me see.

315
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,501
Wait. What's this?

316
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,237
I'm class c, rank one?

317
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,572
¶¶

318
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,907
so what's the deal?

319
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,909
Why'd you call me in?

320
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:13,978
Interviewer: When you listed
yourself with the hero registry,

321
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:15,980
you were given
the association handbook.

322
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,982
Interviewer #2:
Haven't you read it?

323
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:21,920
It clearly lists each one
of our rules and regulations.

324
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,390
Saitama: Yeah, I guess
I've got it somewhere.

325
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,325
Interviewer #1: No matter.

326
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:29,261
Congratulations on attaining
rank one in class c.

327
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,129
Saitama: Huh? Oh, I get it.

328
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,598
You guys decide the rankings.

329
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,199
It's all up to you, right?

330
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,268
Interviewer #1: Well,
there are actually more members

331
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:39,070
on the review board,
but the four of us here today

332
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,338
will be handling your interview.

333
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,673
Saitama: What interview?

334
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,675
Interviewer #1:
The top-ranking class-c hero

335
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,677
is given the opportunity
and option

336
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,546
to be promoted to class b.

337
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,215
However, if you wish
to remain in class c,

338
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,350
that's fine as well.

339
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,085
Interviewer #2:
How about it, Mr. Saitama?

340
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,020
Do you want to move up?

341
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,355
Although, if you do,

342
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:58,289
you'll be ranked
at the very bottom again.

343
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,958
Saitama: Well,
either way is fine,

344
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,293
but I suppose moving up
would be pretty cool.

345
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:05,230
That way, there'll be no more
of the weekly quota stuff.

346
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:09,234
And besides that,
I can't stick to class c forever

347
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,102
with genos in class s.

348
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:13,505
Interviewer #1: I see.
So you're wanting a promotion.

349
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,307
Interviewer #3:
First, we'll need you

350
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,642
to answer some questions

351
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,310
and undergo
a psychiatric analysis.

352
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:21,847
Executive: So that's saitama,

353
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:25,317
the one who finished off
the deep sea king. Hmm.

354
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:29,054
Executive #2: What do you think?
Some say he's a fraud.

355
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:32,257
Executive #1: He set new overall
records in the fitness exam,

356
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,660
so his physical ability
is far from fraudulent.

357
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,128
Executive #3: Interesting.

358
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,329
Well, if you want
to believe the rumor mill,

359
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,199
he cheated
on the written exams, too.

360
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,934
Worker: Rumors are just rumors.

361
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,201
It doesn't make much sense

362
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,604
to have any doubts
about him at this point.

363
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,273
The situation before us
is that he's wanting to move up.

364
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,409
For the time being,
why not let him do so?

365
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:54,346
If he's for real,
he'll make it in class b.

366
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:56,481
- Executive #2: Hmm.
- Executive #1: I see.

367
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,551
And if he's a fake, he'll
soon regret making that choice.

368
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,555
That young man is entering
a cruel and callous world.

369
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,492
Worker: When the time comes,
we'll know what to do.

370
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,561
Amai mask: Promotion to class b?

371
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,497
Heh. You really interrupted
my filming for this?

372
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,900
It's not something
that needs my attention.

373
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,234
Supervisor: I understand,

374
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,036
but this is a verdict
for the executive--

375
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,437
amai mask: Listen to me.

376
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,439
I don't want to be involved
in every decision,

377
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,975
just the ones regarding
heroes class a and above,

378
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,977
since they have
an impact on society.

379
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,114
As a hero in the same class,
if they're inadequate,

380
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,183
it ends up
hurting my image, too,

381
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,118
especially this last incident.

382
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,987
It was absolutely appalling.

383
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,123
Surely you must agree?

384
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:40,058
Supervisor:
Speaking of social impact,

385
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,994
the hero now wanting
to move up the ranks

386
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,932
is the very same man who
finished off the deep sea king.

387
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,039
Amai mask: Hmph.

388
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,076
( Ambulance siren wailing )

389
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:04,883
( Stinger growls )

390
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,151
( Lightning Max growls )

391
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,553
( Both sigh )

392
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,088
Puri-puri prisoner:
Why the sour pusses, kittens?

393
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,889
Both: Huh?

394
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,092
Puri-puri prisoner: It doesn't
show off those cute faces!

395
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,426
- Stinger: It's you!
- Lightning Max: No way!

396
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,094
I thought you were in prison!

397
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:19,765
Puri-puri prisoner:
I escaped just to see you two!

398
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,835
Now time for your angel shots!

399
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,970
( Both screaming )

400
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,238
Puri-puri prisoner:
Come back, you guys!

401
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,173
You need your injections!

402
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,375
Eh?

403
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:31,810
( Grunts )

404
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,386
( Footsteps )

405
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:44,256
Saitama: So I'm class b now.

406
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,991
All those tests
sure took long enough.

407
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:49,928
Meh, it's not like
I had to be somewhere.

408
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,196
Oh.

409
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,065
Something smells good.

410
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,134
Owner: Welcome.

411
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,202
( Bubbling )

412
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,870
Saitama:
The house special, please.

413
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,005
Owner: You got it.

414
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,806
Mumen rider: Care for a drink?

415
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:03,007
Saitama: Huh?

416
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,543
Mumen rider:
If you're not drinking,

417
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,011
let me buy your food.

418
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:07,346
Saitama: What for?

419
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:09,013
- Mumen rider: Heh. For that.
- Saitama: Huh?

420
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,549
Mumen rider: You were
at the association.

421
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:15,020
Think we should celebrate
your promotion.

422
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:16,922
¶¶

423
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,892
saitama: Thanks.

424
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,294
I appreciate the ride.

425
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:26,498
Should I walk?

426
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,233
Mumen rider: No, it's okay.

427
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:30,169
I can handle it just fine.

428
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,173
Hey, are you scared?

429
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:35,573
- Saitama: Hmm?
- Mumen rider: You got separated

430
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:38,177
from your friend, didn't you,
genos, class s?

431
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:39,445
Saitama: Mm-hmm.

432
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,846
Mumen rider: The enemy
is threat level demon,

433
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,115
a monster so formidable

434
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,517
that even if all
the s-class and b-class heroes

435
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,318
ganged up on him,
they'd still lose,

436
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:48,854
so if you wanna run...

437
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,522
Saitama: Are you class s, too?

438
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:52,924
Mumen rider: No, I'm class c.

439
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:56,395
It's all right. Go ahead,
and laugh if you want to.

440
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,197
Saitama: Why would I
laugh at that?

441
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:01,667
It's pretty tough
having to try and make

442
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,370
those weekly quotas
for us class cs, isn't it?

443
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,005
( Mumen rider chuckles )

444
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,074
You're a pretty funny guy.
You know that?

445
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:10,275
Saitama: Hmm?

446
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:12,144
Mumen rider:
The name's mumen rider,

447
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,480
and I'm a hero, like you.

448
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,882
( Saitama chuckles )

449
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,184
Uh, hey! Watch it!

450
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,021
Oh! You're that guy!

451
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:25,490
Mumen rider: I've been
on the lookout for you.

452
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,627
I couldn't say everything
in my letter.

453
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,195
( Saitama chuckles )

454
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,099
I see.

455
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,036
Maybe some mozuku then?

456
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:40,572
Mumen rider: Hey,
give us your best mozuku!

457
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:42,374
Owner: Comin' right up.

458
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,376

¶¶

462
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,418
it's coming, coming!

463
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,087
Assistant: Madame shibabawa,
what is it? What's wrong?

464
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,423
Shibabawa: A violent catastrophe
looms over our future!

465
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:33,892
Assistant: Madame shibabawa,
get a hold of yourself!

466
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,160
Please, you--

467
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:37,830
shibabawa: This is the end!
I've seen it!

( Gasps )

469
