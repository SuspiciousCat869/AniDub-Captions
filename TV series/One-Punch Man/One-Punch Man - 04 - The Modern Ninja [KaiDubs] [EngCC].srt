1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,002
Man: Answer me this!
Why are we forced to work?

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,271
Why must we pay money to eat?!

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,408
It's insane!
Can't we all just share?!

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,943
Look around.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,278
The rich get fat
while the poor die.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,747
Where is the freedom
in this world?

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,416
Does it even exist?

8
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,685
We are all just slaves
to our work!

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,153
And is work fun?

10
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,822
No! How could it be?!

11
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,758
We do not want to work, period!

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:30,362
That's why I, hammerhead,
will change our society!

13
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,364
I'll make it where only those
who want to work will work,

14
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:34,633
while the rest
are supported!

15
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,502
We will create a utopian world!

16
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,438
The paradisers,
led by hammerhead,

17
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,306
will realize this!

18
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,342
( Bystanders murmuring )

19
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:47,713
Paradiser: Boss,
nobody's listening.

20
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,514
Hammerhead:
All these damn idiots!

21
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,451
( Groans ) They're--
they're not ready for us anyway!

22
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,719
Let's go!

23
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,187
That guy zeniru's loaded.

24
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,789
We'll wreck his posh penthouse

25
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,191
and show everyone
that we mean business!

26
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,527
High-rise apartments
are symbols of inequality!

27
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,796
Paradisers: Yes, sir!

28
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:05,864

( singing in Japanese )

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,759
Paradiser #2: What a show-off.

31
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,094
This whole building
is zeniru's home.

32
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,562
( Hammerhead growls )

33
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,765
There's no way in hell
he made so much money legally.

34
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:41,700
It's unforgivable.

35
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,767
Bring it down!

36
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,069
Paradiser #3: Yes, sir!

37
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:49,107

00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,785
Paradiser #3:
The target has been destroyed.

40
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,119
( Hammerhead chuckles )

41
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,721
Man, these experimental
battle suits

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,122
sure do pack a wallop.

43
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,724
I mean, sure,
we had to steal them,

44
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,593
but when it's all said and done,
it was totally worth the risk!

45
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:12,131
Paradiser #2: Wait.
That was the wrong building.

46
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,465
My bad, boss.

47
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,701
Actually, his house
is a little further up.

48
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,737
Hammerhead: Whatever!
Everyone makes mistakes!

49
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,673
But the important thing is
to learn something from them.

50
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,807
Am I right?

51
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,676
Paradiser #2:
Right you are, sir!

52
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,344
Hammerhead:
Then onward to zeniru's!

53
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,412
Move out!

54
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,413
Paradisers: Yeah!

55
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,883

00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,329
Thanks a lot, bicycle guy!

58
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,279
( Saitama snoring )

59
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,584
( Shrieks ) I will not play
rock-paper-scissors with you!

60
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,821
You've got a booger
on your finger!

61
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,593
- What a dream.
- ( Beep )

62
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,795
Newscaster: The terrorist group
responsible for the riots

63
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,731
call themselves the paradisers.

64
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,466
They've destroyed
a high-rise building in city f,

65
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,669
and the situation seems to be
spiraling out of control.

66
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,338
I'm receiving word

67
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,673
that we've just learned
the identity of their leader.

68
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,409
This is hammerhead,

69
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,411
a b-class criminal
who's been involved

70
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,679
in several violent incidents
in the past.

71
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,681
He's a man of large stature,

72
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,686
standing 6'6" tall
and weighing 462 pounds.

73
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,421
According
to one eyewitness report,

74
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,823
he fought 20 men
in a street brawl

75
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,426
and sent each of them
to the hospital.

76
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,628
The paradisers sent
the following message

77
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,563
directly to this TV station.

78
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,833
"We will continue to riot until
food, clothing, and shelter

are provided free of charge
to those who do not work..."

Saitama: Sounds pretty boring.
( Gargles )

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,774
Newscaster:
Like their leader hammerhead,

82
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,909
the group is made up
of unemployed young men...

83
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,844
Saitama: No need for me
to get involved.

84
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,847
Newscaster: Reports indicate
that they all have shaven heads,

85
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,383
making them
not only uniform in appearance,

86
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,517
but quite intimidating.

87
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,853
It is advised
that those who encounter

88
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,921
any shaven-headed men
on the street

89
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,857
should leave
the area immediately.

90
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,459
Saitama: What?

91
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,861
No. Bastards!

92
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,931
Those thieves,
they stole my look!

93
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,800
I spend all this time
trying to be a hero,

94
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,269
but if they keep
acting like jackasses,

95
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,904
I'll be treated like a villain!

96
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,941
No! They will pay!

Officer: Man, they're tough.

101
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,483
They're not gonna back down.

102
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,617

What a joke!

112
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,583

you must flee!

( Zeniru scoffs )

What, are you kidding?
I can't do that.

118
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,664
Running away from terrorists
would hurt my reputation.

Bodyguard:
There's no need to leave.

Bodyguard: Not while I'm around.

122
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,407
You're quite the lucky man
having this occur

123
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,409
while I'm still under contract.

124
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,744
Butler: You're just
one bodyguard, you can't--

125
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,612
zeniru: Whoa, Sonic,
that's the spirit!

126
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,015
But are you sure you can
handle this by yourself?

127
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,683
The men coming are--

128
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:52,884
Sonic: Of course I can.

129
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,353
( Both gasp )

130
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,621
Sonic: You should be
concerned with their lives,

131
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,757
so start thinking
of a way to dispose

132
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,693
of the pile of dead bodies
I'm about to make.

133
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:05,497
The paradisers,
a bunch of upstarts

134
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,834
lucky enough to be equipped with
some new type of battle suit.

135
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,970
But they're led by that
b-class criminal hammerhead.

136
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,439
He might have some backbone.

00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,117
You can see zeniru's building
across the woods.

140
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,053
People call it
"the golden turd."

00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:40,532
Something's wrong.

Sonic: I've been waiting
for you, hammerhead.

Zeniru sent me.

Sonic: Let me start out
by saying this.

148
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:57,482
No opponent of mine has ever
escaped alive, not once.

149
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,684
I plan on keeping it that way.

150
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,821
When it comes to my job,
I'm a perfectionist.

151
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,157
But if you surrender right now,
I'll let you live.

152
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:10,095
So what's it gonna be, then?

153

Sonic: What's all this?

164
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,486
Trying to intimidate me?

165
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,022
You can't see me, can you?

166
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,825
Hammerhead: There you are!

167
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,096
( Man screams )
It's a terrorist!

168
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,732
Saitama: No, I'm not! Chill out!

169
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,635
( Sonic chuckles )

170
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,674
So he decided to fight
instead of run.

171
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,182
( Giggles )

172
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,852
Oops, there goes
my bad habit again.

173
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,987
( Hammerhead laughs )

174
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:44,990
You're just a little dog
bought by zeniru's money.

175
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,259
You really think someone like me
who's fighting for a noble cause

176
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:51,062
can lose
to a gun-for-hire dog like you?!

177
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:53,131
Sonic: I see what he's up to.

178
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,068
It's just as I thought.
He's a complete fool.

179
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,536
He could have at least

180
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,072
tried to arrange the rocks
in a less obvious way.

181
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,074
( Hammerhead growls )

182
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:04,809
There are plenty more more rocks
where those came from!

183
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,345
And if you don't stop me,

184
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:09,014
they're just
gonna keep on coming!

185
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,548
Sonic: So let me guess.

186
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,751
You think you'll be able
to deal with my speed

187
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,553
if you know which direction
I'm coming from?

188
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,622
How utterly pathetic,
but I'll play along.

189
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:21,092
In fact, I'll take you...

190
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:22,627
Head-on!

191
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,064
¶¶

192
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,702
hammerhead: He's too fast.
I can't see him.

193
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,638
But it doesn't matter,

194
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,573
'cause I got this!

195
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,711
Gotcha!

196
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,780
Think about how stupid you were

197
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,916
to face off against the likes
of me on your way down to hell!

198
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,151
Agh!

199
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,855
Sonic: It's over.

200
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,725
Yeah. Unfortunately
I couldn't go easy on them.

201
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:57,796
Yes, hammerhead's body
is over here as well.

202
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,898
I'll head back now. ( Gasps )

203
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,802
The corpse is gone?

204
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,671
( Birds flapping, squawking )

205
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,206
Hammerhead: Whew.
That was close!

206
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,274
It's a good thing

207
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,210
that ninja freak
hit me in the head.

208
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,878
Luckily, my skull's

209
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,081
always been several times
thicker than a normal person's.

210
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,417
Damn it. I don't know
who that bastard was,

211
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,885
but one day,
I'm gonna kill--huh?

212
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:24,022
Great. Now what?

213
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,191
( Bird squawking )

214
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,962
Saitama: Huh?

215
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:33,732
Oh, there you are.

216
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,570
Genos: As with
the mosquito monster,

217
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,106
it seems
I grossly underestimated

218
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,375
my opponent's power once again.

219
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:47,112
I let my guard down, and kabuto
took advantage of that.

220
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,381
If master saitama
had not been there as well,

221
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:53,185
I am certain that I
would have been destroyed.

222
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,720
Man: I see.

223
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:57,189
Well, either way,
I'm glad you're all right.

224
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,524
Genos: Doctor, he saved me
from certain death

225
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,060
on two different occasions.

226
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,396
You were the one responsible
for restoring my life.

227
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,466
Later, this same life
was saved by master saitama,

228
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,468
who now has saved it again.

229
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:14,072
Dr. Kuseno: Ah, yes, I think
I get the picture, genos.

230
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,341
You're trying to tell me
just how amazing

231
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,544
this saitama fella is.
Am I correct?

232
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,678
Genos: Yes, sir.

233
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,546
Dr. Kuseno: Listen to me, genos.

234
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,415
They're not quite ready
just yet,

235
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,684
but I'm developing
a new set of augmentations.

236
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,754
When I replace
your existing parts with them,

237
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,690
you may even be able
to surpass your friend.

238
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,760
He must possess
an enormous amount of strength

239
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:38,097
for you to go on and on
about him to such a degree.

240
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,467
Genos: Yes.

241
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,236
Hammerhead: So what's your deal?

242
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,705
Did you come out here
to sign up with the paradisers?

243
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,173
Saitama: Not at all. Actually,

244
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,175
I'm just a guy
who's a hero for fun.

245
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:51,377
For personal reasons,

246
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,379
I'm out here
to smash all your heads in.

247
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:54,646
( Hammerhead stammers )

248
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,181
Saitama: So, uh,
where are your followers?

249
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,617
Hammerhead: Then die!

250
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,391
( Chuckles )

251
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,458
All right, enough.

252
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,726
I better get out of here quick.

253
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,395
Eh?

254
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,663
How?

255
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,266
I thought I punched him.

256
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,135
Saitama: Aww. What a letdown.
I was pretty excited

257
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,338
to see the battle suits
I'd been hearing about,

258
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,139
but the design's pretty lame,

259
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,676
and all they do is give you
superhuman strength.

260
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,278
( Hammerhead stammers, growls )

261
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,680
You have no idea how hard it was

262
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,482
to get ahold of these things!

263
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,684
How could
an insignificant gnat like you

264
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,886
know their true value?! Huh?!

265
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,822
( Growls )

266
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,557
Today is your lucky day!

267
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,825
I've been waiting

268
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,428
to test the full power
of this suit on someone!

269
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,765
( Yells )

270
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,367
( Growls )

271
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:53,572
Spin attack!

272
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,174
Saitama: Whoa.
When I was just a kid,

273
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,377
I used to use that move
all the time.

274
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,313
Hammerhead: Guh?

275
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,715
No! Impossible!

276
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,184
¶¶

277
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,786
saitama: Hammerhead, huh?

278
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,788
He's a lot like me.

279
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,324
Hammerhead: No way.
What the hell are you?!

280
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,627
( Groans )

281
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,532
( Gasps )

282
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:21,733
( Shrieks )

283
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,469
Wait! Hold on! I just--

284
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:26,738
I just wanted to get out
of working, that's all!

285
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,540
( Nervous laugh )

286
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,741
( Winces )

287
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,743
Saitama: Don't be bad
anymore, okay?

288
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:32,878
Hammerhead: What? Wait.

289
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,413
You mean you're
not gonna kill me?

290
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,547
Saitama: Get lost.

291
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,615
Hammerhead: Right!
You got it!

292
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:39,685
( Yells )

293
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,688
( Birds trilling )

294
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,692
( Saitama sighs )
That's that.

295
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,629
Sonic: Where did hammerhead
wander off to?

296
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:51,797
Saitama: Huh?

297
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,367
Sonic: There's no one
left here but you.

298
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,242
Saitama: Hmm.

299
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,844
He was heading
in that direction,

300
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,279
screaming and yelling,
buck naked.

301
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:12,818
Saitama: What's this thing?

302
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,188
( Sonic gasps )

303
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,459
Saitama: Hey, you got it wrong.

304
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:22,928
Sonic: What have I got wrong?

305
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,529
Saitama: I know how this looks,

306
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,398
but I'm not one
of the paradisers.

307
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,667
Sonic: You're a terrible liar.

308
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:29,868
Saitama: No, no, no!

309
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,737
Don't be stupid! Look at me!

310
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:33,272
Sonic: I don't really need to.

311
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,408
With that bald head,
there's no denying it.

312
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,478
Saitama: Come on. Really,
take a good look at me!

313
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,480
I'm the guy who's out
being a hero for fun!

314
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,749
- I'm not a villain.
- Sonic: Never heard of you.

315
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,518
( Wind blows )

316
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:48,687
Saitama: Oh, I see.

317
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,954
Sonic: Either way,

318
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:52,424
it doesn't matter to me
in the least.

319
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:56,228
You were able to read my attacks
two times in a row.

320
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,297
That's the real problem.

321
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:59,832
Born in a ninja village,

322
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,367
I've been honing
and perfecting my techniques

323
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,703
since my earliest days
of childhood.

324
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:07,906
Yet you saw right
through them in an instant.

325
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,409
This, I cannot permit.

326
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,711
Saitama:
What's he talking about?

327
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:15,980
My pride won't allow it.

328
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,982
I don't care who you are.

329
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:20,986
I can't let you
simply walk away.

330
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,388
- Saitama: Oh, come on.
- Sonic: Hmm?

331
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,923
Saitama: You just
want to try out

332
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,992
those honed and perfected moves
on me.

333
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:30,396
I can tell
by that innocent smile of yours.

334
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:31,996
( Sonic giggles )

335
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:34,333
¶¶

336
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:42,007
what do you think of this speed
that breaks the sound barrier?

337
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:43,875
Of these shock waves?

338
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,811
Can you even see me?

339
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,984
How can you possibly
keep up with me?

340
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,921
Saitama: Uh...

341
00:15:57,825 --> 00:15:58,957
Can I go home?

342
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,425
( Sonic gasps )

343
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:01,760
Bastard!

344
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:03,562
Wind blade kick!

345
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:09,034
Saitama: Checkmate.

346
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,504
Oops.

347
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,773
Sorry. I--

348
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:15,908
I didn't do that on purpose.

349
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,643
I meant to stop
before hitting you,

350
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,711
but your momentum
carried my fist into your, um--

351
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,447
( Sonic shrieks )

352
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:22,514
( Gags )

353
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,516
¶¶

354
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:31,122
listen, I've worked every job
from assassin to bodyguard.

355
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:32,391
I'm the deadly ninja,

356
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,926
speed-o'-sound Sonic!

357
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,796
But for the time being,
my work will be on hold.

358
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:40,399
Now that I've found
such a formidable opponent,

359
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,335
I'm dedicating myself to
training until we settle this.

360
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,470
( Winces )
Let me know your name!

361
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,806
Saitama: It's saitama.

362
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,341
Sonic: Saitama!

363
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,877
Next time we meet,
it'll be your demise!

364
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:53,411
( Shuddering )

365
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,547
Saitama: Sure.

366
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,749
I, speed-o'-sound Sonic,
the ultimate ninja,

367
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,819
will not rest
until I have brought you down!

368
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,421
Saitama: Go train hard.

369
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:06,024
¶¶

370
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,426
genos: Speed-o'-sound Sonic?

371
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,894
Who is that?

372
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:11,563
What kind of person would
possess such a redundant name?

373
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,899
Saitama: Don't know.
He appeared out of nowhere,

374
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,901
said we were rivals,
and then took off.

375
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,771
Genos: If he is bothering you,
I will get rid of him.

376
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,506
Saitama: You're not much better,
you know.

377
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,507
Actually,
why are you here again?

378
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,643
Go home.
It's not like we're related.

379
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,979
Genos: Master, I must
become stronger, because--

380
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,113
saitama: Shut up!

381
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,985
The incidents from today made me
aware of a serious problem,

382
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:34,653
and I'm reeling from shock,

383
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:37,056
so I beg you, just go home.

384
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:38,724
Saitama: A serious problem?

385
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,992
For somebody
as great as you are?

386
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,794
But what could it possibly be?

387
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:43,729
Please tell me.

388
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,764
¶¶

389
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:53,605
Saitama: No one knows who I am.

390
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,006
( Genos gasps )

391
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,876
Saitama: It's been
right around three years

392
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,945
since I first became a hero.

393
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,414
I've defeated a lot of monsters

394
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:04,216
and evil organizations
during that time.

395
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,884
Come to think of it,

396
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:09,087
I've never heard of any other
heroes doing as much as me,

397
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,622
not even close.

398
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,958
Everyone in the world
should know my name by now.

399
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,760
I mean, isn't it kind of weird

400
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:16,562
that I don't have any fans
or anything?!

401
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,765
You know
what he said to me today?

402
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,101
"Never heard of you."

403
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,035
"Never."

404
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,702
On top of that,

405
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:27,439
everyone in town thought
I was one of those terrorists.

406
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,974
They forgot how I beat
those monsters

407
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:31,043
and all the other stuff
I've done for them.

408
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,977
Genos: He is right.

409
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,647
I recall seeing
the news report earlier today.

410
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,649
There was no mention
of master saitama

411
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,184
or speed-o'-sound Sonic.

412
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,454
Instead, the one credited
for defeating the paradisers

413
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,122
was a hero
called mumen rider.

414
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,059
Hold on. Master...

415
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,593
Saitama: Hmm?

416
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,763
Genos: Are you listed
with the hero registry?

417
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,199
Saitama: "Take a test

418

of the hero association.

than the cut-off,

420

"you will be registered
in the hero registry

421

00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:03,742

just some weirdo..."

Genos: "...Some weirdo
spouting nonsense

432

great suspicion," it says.

434
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,300
I had no clue.

435
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,836
So, genos, are you registered?

436
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:34,039
Genos: No. Should I be?

437
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,241
Saitama: Huh?

438
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,177
Hey, let's sign up!

439
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,113
Go register with me, and I'll
make you my official disciple.

440
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:43,115
Genos: Sounds like a plan.

00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:48,787
P-Please...

443
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,656
Don't do this. Forgive me.

He truly understood nothing.

Cyborg #2: Of course,
we did let the theft take place

00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:05,203
in order to collect the data
from the suits in the field.

Newscaster: Our guest
this morning is Mr. Majimeda,

455
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,753
an expert on the labor issues
confronting young people today.

456
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:22,821
Thanks for being here.

457
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,356
Majimeda: Thank you
for having me.

458
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,558
Newscaster:
Mr. Majimeda, as we saw

459
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,227
with the paradiser
incident recently,

460
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:29,695
there's an increase
in young people

461
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:31,096
who lack motivation to work.

462
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:32,965
Would you care to comment
on this phenomenon?

463
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,833
Majimeda: Even in the case
of the paradisers...

464
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:36,701
Saitama: Honestly, I'm really
not that different from them.

465
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,637
Majimeda: ...By trash television
and irresponsible lyrics...

466
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:42,040
Saitama: Those unemployed guys
are a lot like me.

467
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,975
Majimeda: ...And
"make your dreams come true."

468
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,376
People who believe such hogwash

469
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:47,645
end up making excuses
for themselves

470
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:48,914
and become discouraged...

471
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,183
Saitama: If I'd taken
a wrong step,

472
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,319
would I have ended up
like that, too?
