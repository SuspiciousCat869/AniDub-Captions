00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,968
¶¶

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:05,537
man: It's decided.

3
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,074
Mumen rider will remain
the top-ranked class-c hero.

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:12,211
Man #2: Understood. I will
inform him of our decision.

5
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:14,546
Man #3: It's baffling.
I don't know why

6
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,215
he has no desire
to move up to class b.

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:20,418
Man #1: Our next item
on the agenda for this meeting,

8
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,488
the 55th hero certification exam

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,156
and the circumstances
surrounding it.

10
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,425
Currently, the total number
of candidates is...

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,293
Woman: Over 11,000,

12
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,629
with the exam offered
at six different venues.

13
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:34,433
That's an increase of more
than 22% over the previous exam.

14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,368
( Men gasp )

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,304
Man #3: We mustn't be happy
with simple quantity.

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,173
Even with more candidates,

17
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,109
if the quality
of the heroes is reduced,

18
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,446
then the numbers
are meaningless.

19
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:52,384
Therefore, we must be even more
critical during evaluations.

20
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,653
Also, it's my understanding

21
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,655
that a certain
person of interest

22
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,256
is taking the exam this time.

23
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:01,193
Man #4: Yes, sir.
It hasn't been confirmed yet,

24
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:05,364
but I'm confident that his
participation will indeed occur.

25
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,803
¶¶

26
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,405
( singing in Japanese )

27
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,961
¶¶

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,997
( overlapping chatter )

29
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,169
Worker: Candidates, please form
two lines for registration,

30
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,703
each line single file.

31
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:46,772
Thank you!

32
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,461
( Applicants laugh )

33
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,065
Examiner: Next, side-to-side
jumps for 30 seconds!

34
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,266
Ready.

35
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,300
Go!

36
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,138
( Applicants gasp )

37
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,941
Examiner: Next,
the 1,500-meter run.

38
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,976
Go!

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,746
( All gasp )

40
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,716
Examiner: Next, weight lifting!

41
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,152
( Applicants gasp )

42
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,553
Examiner: Next, shot-put!

43
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,121
( Judge gasps )

44
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,159
Examiner: Vertical jumping!

45
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,695
( Judges gasp )

46
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:44,630
Examiner: Whac-a-mole!

47
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,666
Punching machine!

48
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,371
( Applicant gasps )

49
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:54,773
Applicant #2: I'm leaving.

50
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,709
¶¶

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,247
( overlapping chatter )

52
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,182
( Saitama sighs ) Finally.

53
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,184
I'm done with all the tests.

54
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,655
Now I just wait
for the results.

55
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,724
Uh, hey. Are you done, too?

56
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,926
Genos: Yes.

57
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,460
Saitama: Say, uh,

58
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,462
what's the point in you
taking fitness tests?

59
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,998
Genos: Huh?

60
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,266
Saitama: Well, I mean,
can't you just give them

61
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,268
the data on your specs
or something?

62
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,203
Genos: Uh...

63
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,270
Saitama: Never mind.

64
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,605
So, how did it go?

65
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,673
Genos: The challenges
were far too simple,

66
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,608
both the written
and fitness exams.

67
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,210
Saitama: I know, right? Heh.

68
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,147
Is that really all there is
to becoming a hero?

69
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,749
Genos: We should get
our results soon.

70
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,085
70 points is a passing grade.

71
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,620
Heh. The written test
was so easy,

72
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,024
anyone could get
full points on it.

73
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,026
That just leaves
the fitness test,

74
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,261
which, for us, poses no problem.

75
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,099
I got 100 points.

76
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,300
Saitama: Seriously?

77
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,302
Genos: Yes. Hmm.

78
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:01,974
It says that I am now fully
certified as a class-s hero.

79
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,642
Saitama: Class s?
What's that mean?

80
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,310
Genos: When it comes down to it,

81
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,379
I am sure these rankings
mean very little.

82
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,180
So how did you do?

83
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,517
Saitama: Huh? Hmm.

84
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh! The letter says I'm also...

85
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:15,988
Genos: Class s.

86
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,322
I am not surprised.

87
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,257
Saitama: Huh?

88
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,724
Genos: On top of that,

89
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:22,060
the font size
is bigger than mine.

90
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,128
( Saitama chuckles )

91
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,596
Genos: Just as I expected.

92
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:28,200
By the way, what did they
ask you at the interview?

93
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,468
Saitama: The interview?

94
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,736
Genos: Yes.

95
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,271
Interviewer: All right, then,

96
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,473
just one final question, genos.

97
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:38,477
Does this building
look familiar to you?

98
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,079
We've been
secretly investigating

99
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,682
a group of troublemakers.
These ne'er-do-Wells

100
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,485
call themselves
the house of evolution.

101
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,154
Just when we identified
their center of operations,

102
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,156
we found
the building in question

103
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,558
had been
mysteriously destroyed.

104
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,262
Interviewer #2: Obliterated
by intense firepower.

105
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,033
Interviewer #1: Are you...

106
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,967
Responsible for this?

107
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,969
Genos: Actually, I am.

108
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,704
( Interviewers gasp )

109
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,173
( Interviewer #3 gasps )

110
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:10,142
( Grunts )

111
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,514
Genos: Ah, I see.

112
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,650
I suppose that since they found
your performance satisfactory,

113
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,252
no interview was needed.

114
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,389
Master?

115
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,124
Saitama: Maybe,

116
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,260
or it's because
I'm a class-c hero

117
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,262
with a score of 71 points.

118
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,262
Maybe that?

119
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,332
( Genos gasps ) I see.

120
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,735
Viewing only part
of the document, I mistakenly

121
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,404
thought the top half of the "c"
was an "s."

122
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,539
Saitama:
Stop analyzing it, jerk!

123
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,340
Genos: It must be a mistake.

124
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,210
I will speak to the person
in charge about this.

125
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,278
Saitama: No, don't!
You'll just embarrass me!

126
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,614
( P.A. chime rings )

127
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,683
Man: Mr. Genos, Mr. Saitama,
there will be a seminar

128
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,085
for successful candidates
at 4:00 P.M.

129
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,555
Please come
to lecture hall number three.

130
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,223
Saitama: All right then.
Come on.

131
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,225
When you get right down to it,

132
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,628
only thing that really matters
is we passed.

133
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,297
Let's get this over with
and go home.

134
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,699
Man: We finally found

135
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,701
the cyborg
we've been looking for.

136
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,237
Man #2: Yeah? So I've heard.

137
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,174
Man #1: In consideration
of his past accomplishments,

138
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,177
we've made an exception and
certified him as a class-s hero.

139
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,446
I just wanted to make sure
you were notified

140
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,448
of this recent turn of events.

141
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,616
Man #2: Yes, and I approve.

142
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,088
Hmm.

143
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,690
Genos, huh?

144
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,529
Lecturer:
Congratulations on passing.

145
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,531
( Saitama chewing gum )

146
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,267
Lecturer: Now, to be honest,

147
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,202
one of you only made it
on a fluke,

148
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,338
so unless you want
your luck to go to waste,

149
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,741
I'd better see you
giving it your all.

150
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,810
And don't get cocky. Got it?

151
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,212
Keep your certified hero status
in mind.

152
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,682
From here on,
I expect you to act modestly.

153
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,351
After all,
your faces'll be placed

154
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,488
on the main page
of the hero association website.

155
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,492
( Growls ) Did you hear me?

156
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:08,293
That goofball head
on your shoulders

157
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,763
is gonna be shown
to the whole world.

158
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,031
If you don't want
to humiliate yourselves...

159
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,501
Hyah! ( Yelling )

160
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,373
...aspire to be
a distinguished hero like me.

161
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,513
Genos: Master!

162
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,183
Lecturer: As a class-a hero,

163
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,053
I have influence over
the association's decisions,

164
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,254
so those
who behave irresponsibly

165
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,523
will lose their points
and get demoted!

166
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,592
Have I made myself clear?

167
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:44,262
( Saitama thinking ) What should
I have for dinner tonight?

168
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,531
¶¶

169
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,933
genos: Apparently
the hero association

170
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,935
was formed
about three years ago.

171
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,071
Saitama: Oh. Huh.
So they're relatively new.

172
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,073
Genos: A monster
attacked the grandchild

173
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,209
of some millionaire named agoni.

174
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:00,145
The child was saved
by someone passing by.

175
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,348
When agoni heard what happened,
he created this system

176
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,352
and used his fortune to
establish the hero association.

177
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,953
The rest is history.

178
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,488
Saitama: Well, they have
some pretty boring seminars.

179
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:12,691
Genos: In any case,
as new heroes,

180
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,027
we will be known
around the world.

181
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,962
We will be respected
and compensated.

182
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,299
From now on, we can work
with our heads held high.

183
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,469
Master.

184
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,105
Saitama: Huh?

185
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,174
Genos: Now I am
officially your disciple.

186
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,176
Saitama: Uh...

187
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,646
Genos: Please, continue to teach
and guide me as my mentor.

188
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:35,713
Saitama: Sure.

189
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,182
Genos: All right, then.

190
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,383
Good night, master.

191
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:41,086
Saitama: Y-yeah. See you later.

192
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,323
Crap.

193
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:46,058
Maybe I shouldn't have
been so quick

194
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,327
to say I'd take someone on
as a disciple,

195
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,596
especially this guy.

196
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,465
Lecturer:
Those two newcomers today,

197
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,801
did they really pass the exam?

198
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,669
Their attitudes were awful.

199
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,072
I'm class a,
rank 38, damn it.

200
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,674
They hadn't the slightest idea
who I was.

201
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,611
Plus they have no clue
how the world works.

202
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,346
They're a couple of amateurs.

203
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,548
They'll be dead in no time.

204
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,083
- Interviewer: No.
- Lecturer: Huh?

205
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,951
Interviewer:
Genos got perfect scores

206
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,220
on both the written
and physical exams.

207
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,488
He's a phenomenal rookie

208
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,291
who gained a class-s ranking
right off the bat.

209
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,026
The other new recruit, saitama,

210
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,295
had terrible scores
on the essay,

211
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,564
but got a perfect 50
on the physical.

212
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,967
That score was how
he was able to pass at all.

213
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,904
In practically every activity
on the fitness exam,

214
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,373
he broke the hero association's
test records

215
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,709
by inconceivable margins.

216
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,115
Frankly, it's as if there's
a god residing in that body.

217
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:47,519
Snek, you've already
been outranked by genos.

218
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,255
His s-class status
reflects that.

219
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,924
And with
his physical test score,

220
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,460
saitama might soon
catch up to you.

221
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,697
Snek: That jackass?

222
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,468
Saitama: If I get
to the top of class c,

223
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,602
then I'll get promoted
to class b,

224
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,738
and class a is above that,

225
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,476
with class s
being even above that.

226
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:14,113
I guess genos is
actually pretty amazing.

227
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:18,683
I don't know.

228
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:23,288
Maybe this isn't the kind
of hero I wanted to be.

229
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:24,356
- ( Running footsteps )
- Huh?

230
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,227
Snek: The newcomer seminar
isn't over yet!

231
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,429
In this business,
there's a little thing

232
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:32,231
we like to call
rookie crushing.

233
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,232
A lot of us established heroes

234
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,168
hate the prospect
of being outranked,

235
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,303
so we crush newbies...

236
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,206
With moves like this!

237
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,711
- ( Groaning )
- ( Bird squawking )

238
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:57,056
( Wind blowing )

239
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,134
Saitama: Hero registry?

240
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,204
Genos: Yes, I am a class-s hero,

241
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:16,674
and you are a class-c hero,
both ranked last in our classes.

242
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,877
Right now, we are still listed

243
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,480
under the designations
of genos and saitama,

244
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,815
but as we perform
more heroic acts,

245
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,884
we will acquire hero names.

246
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:28,086
Saitama: Hold on. "Hero names"?
What are those?

247
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:31,156
Genos: Well, I believe
they are considered to be

248
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,692
like nicknames based
on a hero's characteristics.

249
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,228
For example, I might be
the blonde cyborg.

250
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,830
Saitama: Wait.
If that's how it works,

251
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,765
I could end up
with a really sucky name,

252
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,833
like the caped baldy.

253
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:41,900
Genos: Huh.

254
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,835
You can be ranked by ability,

255
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,304
but you can also
be ranked by popularity.

256
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,173
There are some heroes
that have fan clubs.

257
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,641
( Saitama gasps )

258
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,710
Genos: But no one really cares
about that stuff.

259
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,178
Saitama: Wha?!

260
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,181
Genos: Master, thank you
for agreeing to my odd request.

261
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,248
I appreciate it.

262
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:58,917
Saitama: No problem.

263
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,254
I mean, I did promise
to make you my disciple and all.

264
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:03,589
Is right here good?

265
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:04,990
Genos: Perfect!

266
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,993
Saitama: So we're just having
a practice bout, right,

267
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,260
not fighting for real?

268
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,996
Genos: That is
what I had in mind, yes,

269
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:14,065
but I want you
to go all out.

270
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:17,268
In return, I, too, will give it
everything I have got.

271
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:19,471
¶¶

272
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,643
please, master.

273
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,826
( Saitama gasps )

274
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,903
Oh.

275
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,913
Oh, man.

276
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:02,981
That was close.

277
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,183
Could've burned my clothes.

278
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,987
( Genos gasps )

279
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,121
Damn.

280
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:11,757
I need more speed!

281
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:16,829
Saitama: Hmm?

282
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:34,113
( Genos grunts )

283
00:13:39,954 --> 00:13:41,720
( Beeping )

284
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:46,892
There.

285
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:51,864
Saitama: Oh.

286
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,400
Genos: Incinerate.

287
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,170
I got him this time.

288
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,906
Master will have to take me
more seriously now.

289
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,174
What the?!

290
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,376
Saitama: It looks like I win.

291
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,715
Whoa. Nyah.

292
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,984
- Genos: Master.
- Saitama: Yeah?

293
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:14,319
Genos: You still remember
the rules of the bout, right?

294
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,921
You are supposed to evade

295
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,323
any attack
you are able to dodge.

296
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,458
Take it seriously,
and no fooling around.

297
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,594
Do not hold back,

298
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:23,928
and lastly...

299
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:28,867
Keep fighting until I am
no longer able to fight.

300
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:32,004
Even master saitama
cannot explain it,

301
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:35,274
the secret
to his incredible power.

302
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,510
This fight may finally
give me some insight.

303
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,613
You are to show me no mercy.

304
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:48,554
Now then, again!

305
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,422
( Gasps )

306
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,359
No way.

307
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,506
Saitama: Come on. I'm hungry.

308
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:09,508
Time for lunch.

309
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,243
Let's grab some udon noodles.

310
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,681
Genos: Unbelievable.

311
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:20,518
I am fully prepared
to do anything

312
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:23,522
in order to become stronger,

313
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,858
but I cannot picture myself

314
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,293
ever approaching
master's power...

315
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,964
Not even close.

316
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,404
He is on a different level.

317
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,540
Saitama: What's the matter?

318
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,575
You don't like udon?

319
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,813
Man: I see.

320
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:50,482
That's his location?

321
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,285
Thanks. I'll head there now.

322
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,354
No. Don't worry about a thing.

323
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:59,158
I'm just gonna let him know what
the industry's expecting of him.

324
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,695
Saitama: I'm glad you like udon.
I love it.

325
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,699
Genos: Yes. Although,
I am not a picky eater.

326
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,634
Saitama: Well, to be honest,

327
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:11,636
I'm also kinda low
on funds right now. Oh?

328
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,106
Hey, how 'bout
another match, genos?

329
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,240
Genos: Hmm?

330
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,646
Girl: Look at them!
That's insane!

331
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:22,847
Girl #2: No way!

332
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,317
Woman: My goodness,
what a handsome man.

333
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,785
( Saitama groans )

334
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:28,187
I give.

335
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:32,657
( Genos slurps )

336
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:33,725
( Gasps )

337
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:35,193
So, do I win?

338
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,461
( All gasp )

339
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,730
Saitama: Holy crap.
You're awesome.

340
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,698
Genos: Hmm?

341
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:42,867
Owner: Welcome. Sit anywhere--

342
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:43,836
( diners gasp )

343
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:48,673
Man: You must be genos.

344
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,275
- Saitama: Huh?
- Genos: Hmm?

345
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:53,212
Amai mask: I'm amai mask,
class a, rank one.

346
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:55,214
I'd like to talk to you.

347
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:57,483
Saitama: Class a, rank one?

348
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:59,084
Girl #1: It's amai mask.

349
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,020
- Girl #2: He's so gorgeous.
- ( Woman swoons )

350
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,621
Genos: Talk? About what?

351
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,357
Saitama: He might be
another rookie crusher.

352
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,159
Be careful, genos.

353
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,761
Genos: I see.

354
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,763
Wait here, master.
I shall return.

355
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,698
Very well.

356
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:16,101
I was considering a walk
to digest my food.

357
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,103
( Amai mask chuckles )

358
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,443
Heard you were certified class s
by special exception.

359
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:25,711
Genos: True, and what of it?

360
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,447
Amai mask: Hmm.

361
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,149
( Saitama chewing ice )

362
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,319
Wonder if he's doing
all right out there.

363
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,721
- ( Clatter )
- Eh?

364
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,558
Ohh.

365
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:45,330
So, are you finished already?

366
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,465
Genos: Yes.

367
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,467
Saitama: You really
are a class-s,

368
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:50,602
to have
the top-ranked class-a hero

369
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:52,204
come to personally crush you.

370
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,672
- Genos: No.
- Saitama: Hmm?

371
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:56,074
You're saying
he wasn't here to fight?

372
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,542
Then why was he here?

373
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:59,345
Genos: Well,
from the sound of it,

374
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,747
he came to welcome me.

375
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,748
Saitama: Wait. What?

376
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:05,016
What's that mean?

377
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,485
- Girl #1: Excuse me!
- Both: Huh?

378
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,287
Girl #1: Sorry,
but you're friends

379
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,822
with amai mask, aren't you?

380
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:11,790
May I shake your hand?

381
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,493
( Squeals )
Thank you very much!

382
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,162
Girl #2: Shake mine, too!

383
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,298
( Woman swoons )

384
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,633
¶¶

385
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:24,236
saitama: Class-s heroes
and class-c heroes

386
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:26,171
sure get treated differently.

387
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,573
If you think about it, though,

388
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:29,307
isn't that kind of
like fraud money?

389
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,309
I mean, you're a cyborg, right?

390
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:32,377
Genos: Yes.

391
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,846
Saitama: Never mind.

392
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:37,315
Anyway, now we have one win
and one loss between us.

393
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,786
Starting today, we're certified,
professional heroes.

394
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,322
Let's do our very best, okay?

395
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:45,057
Genos: Right.

396
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:49,261
Amai mask: Listen to me.
A professional hero

397
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,264
must always be
a beautiful symbol of justice.

398
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:55,333
That is my philosophy,

399
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:57,269
especially if you're class s.

400
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,336
( Genos grunts )

401
00:18:58,405 --> 00:18:59,538
Amai mask: Come on.

402
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,074
There's no need to glare at me.

403
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,410
I came all the way here
just to see you.

404
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,545
How was the certification exam?

405
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:09,280
Genos: It was utter garbage.

406
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,549
Such exams are a waste of time.

407
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:12,751
( Amai mask gasps )

408
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,286
( Chuckles )

409
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,089
Genos: If you came here
to fight, get on with it.

410
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,724
This, too, is a waste of time.

411
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:22,627
Being hot-blooded is fine,

412
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,064
but if you take it too far...

413
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,300
You get burned.

414
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:34,840
I'll forget about your criticism
of the association.

415
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,575
Thank you for your time.

416
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:39,177
We expect great things from you.

417
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,780
Welcome to the team...

418
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,248
Genos.

419
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:55,927
Genos: Master.

420
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,329
Saitama: Huh?

421
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,000
Excuse me. I will be back.

422
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,201
Saitama: Oh.

423
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,737
Sure. Okay.

424
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:06,939
See you later.

425
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:09,340
Genos: Yes. Good-bye.

426
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,310
¶¶

427
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:40,038
Amai mask: A waste of time, huh?

428
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:41,440
Humph.

429
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,976
What an interesting fellow
you are.

430
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,747
¶¶

431
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:54,353
( singing in Japanese )

432
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,146
Saitama: So, uh,
when you said, "back,"

433
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:23,215
you meant later tonight?

434
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,150
Genos: Yes. I needed some time

435
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:27,186
to go home
and gather up my things.

436
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:30,822
May I live here with you now?

437
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,958
Saitama: No way. Absolutely not.

438
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:35,761
Genos: I have rent money.

439
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,101
Saitama: Did you
bring a toothbrush?

440
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:43,135
Genos: Yes!
