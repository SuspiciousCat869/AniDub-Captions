00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,201
¶¶

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,668
saitama: It's been five days

3
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,737
since I debuted
as a professional hero.

4
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:08,474
There haven't been
any serious incidents so far.

5
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:11,677
However, in the midst
of this new beginning,

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,013
genos ended up
staying at my house.

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,615
So, uh, what are you
writing over there?

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,350
Genos: I'm recording the details

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,152
of your lessons
and training regimen.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,155
( Saitama thinking ) Crap.
He's raising the bar again.

11
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,023
I can't think of a single thing

12
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:26,491
I could possibly
teach this guy.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,494
I feel bad, like i'm
scamming him or something.

14
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,429
Come on. Think.

15
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,164
Just make up some techniques

16
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,699
or a spiritual theory
or something!

17
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,567
Ahh! Strength training
is all I've got!

18
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,368
I know genos won't be
satisfied with that!

19
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,237
- Plus the dude's a cyborg!
- Genos: By the way...

20
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,172
Saitama: Huh?

21
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,440
Genos: Earlier, at the seminar,

22
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,575
they said
if you are a class-c hero

23
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,643
and you have
no activity for a week,

24
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,646
your name will be removed
from the hero registry.

25
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,181
Will you be all right, master?

26
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,250
( Saitama gasps )
Seriously?! They said that?!

27
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,317
Genos: Yes.

28
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,719
Saitama: But I was watching TV,

29
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,454
and there wasn't
anything to act on.

30
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,723
Genos: The news only reports
major incidents,

31
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,392
like natural disasters,
terrorism,

32
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,261
and dangerous monsters.

33
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,195
You always battle
the most powerful enemies,

34
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,332
so you were probably
not aware of this,

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,535
but class-c heroes mostly
take care of purse snatchers,

36
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,470
robberies, and random attacks.

37
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,739
With class c so full of heroes,

38
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,408
they must actively look
for cases to survive.

39
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,077
Many get discouraged
and change careers.

40
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,480
Much in the same way
a salesman makes cold calls,

41
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,215
nothing will come your way
without legwork.

42
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,418
Saitama: This is no time
to be reading manga!

43
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,353
- Genos: Are we leaving?
- Saitama: I am!

44
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,289
You stay here! Don't you get it?

45
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,157
If I'm with
a class-s hero like you,

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,360
- then I won't get any credit!
- Genos: But as your disciple--

47
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,096
saitama: Genos,
from the very beginning,

48
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,232
my intense desire to be a hero

49
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,701
was what led me down
the path of strength training.

50
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,703
That's how I made it this far.

51
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,705
For you,
perhaps things will change

52
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,574
if you aim higher as a hero,

53
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,308
to be more
than what you are now.

54
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,777
Frankly speaking,
you're a cyborg,

55
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:55,380
so training your body
would be useless.

56
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:59,384
Instead, a change in mindset may
lead you to greater strength.

57
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,520
( Thinking )
Damn, listen to me.

58
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,322
I'm just making
all this crap up.

59
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,725
( Aloud )
So in other words,

60
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,394
it's not about having
raw power or technique.

61
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,997
Not at all.
It's about training your mind.

62
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,132
You must first fight your way

63
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,467
through
the professional hero industry.

64
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,737
Aim to break into the top 10
of the class-s heroes.

65
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,207
That will be your goal
for the time being.

66
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,209
¶¶

67
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,410
genos: I understand.

68
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,146
I will try!

69
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,347
Saitama: He totally bought it.

70
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,515
Sweetness.

71
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,619
¶¶

72
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,086
( woman yelps )

73
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,422
Saitama: After that,
I sped around town

74
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,158
while frantically looking
for bad guys.

75
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,560
I ran...

76
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,961
And ran...

77
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,563
And ran...

78
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,631
But...

79
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,767
The city was completely quiet!

80
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,235
( Cat meows )

81
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,703
Saitama: I give up.

82
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,305
( Panting )

83
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,607
Just one more day left.

84
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,311
Guess I'll just head home, then.

85
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,449
( Dog barking )

86
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:07,386
Saitama: I'll leave tomorrow's
problems to tomorrow's me.

87
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,654
¶¶

88
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,623
( singing in Japanese )

89
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,350
( Saitama shuddering )

90
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,485
It's quiet out here today, too.

91
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,288
There's nothing to do! Nothing!

92
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,425
I'm gonna lose my registration.

93
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,426
Huh?

94
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,493
Uh...

95
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,028
¶¶

96
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,497
hold up!
I've run into you before!

97
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,199
What was your name again?

98
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,169
Seed-on-the-ground.

99
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,237
No, wait. Lost-and-found?

100
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,906
( Gasps )
Jack-o-lantern panic!

101
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,908
Sonic:
No, it's speed-o'-sound Sonic.

102
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,178
I've finally found you,
saitama.

103
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,046
Today is the day we settle our--

104
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,447
saitama: Hey, sorry. I'm busy.

105
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:10,716
See you around, okay?

106
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,785
Sonic: Huh?

107
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,120
Insolent worm!

108
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,290
Think you can run from me?!

109
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,395
What the--
I didn't even see what happened.

110
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,064
His face should have
been sliced open,

111
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,466
but the blade was--

112
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,868
saitama: I told you...

113
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,437
I'm busy.

114
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,739
Plus I'm pissed,

115
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,307
so anyone in my way...

116
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,943
Gets punched.

117
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,212
( Sonic gasps )

118
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:41,814
Woman: That's the guy.

119
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,415
He's very, very dangerous,

120
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,351
a public nuisance.
Please stop him.

121
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,352
Hero: Is that so?!

122
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,487
You're the offender, huh?!

123
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:52,824
Well,
the tank-top tiger is here!

124
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,027
( Saitama thinking )
A hero?

125
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,895
( Laughs aloud )
Bad news, Sonic.

126
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,031
They think you're
some sort of criminal.

127
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,565
Maybe getting tossed in a cell

128
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,835
will cool off
that hot hea--hmm?

129
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,770
Tank-top tiger:
She means you, cue ball.

130
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,971
Saitama: Huh?

131
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,041
Woman: He's been running
all around town

132
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,843
with this scary look on his face
since yesterday morning.

133
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,712
Saitama: Hey, wait a minute!
I'm a hero, too!

134
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,913
Tank-top tiger:
You are, huh?

135
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,448
I've never heard
of a hero like you.

136
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,916
Saitama: So what?
I just started, okay?!

137
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,451
Tank-top tiger: In any case,

138
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,920
you're causing problems
around here for everyone.

139
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,521
If you're really a hero,

140
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,857
then don't go around
frightening people.

141
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,794
You're hurting all
the other heroes' reputations.

142
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,995
Man: Hey, isn't that
tank-top tiger over there?

143
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,197
Man #2: Can't believe it!

144
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,932
- It is tank-top tiger!
- Woman #2: No way!

145
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,468
Man #3: Awesome!
He's the real deal.

146
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,805
( Tank-top tiger chuckles )

147
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,407
Even class-c heroes
get recognized,

148
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:45,009
well, if they're
in the top 10, anyway.

149
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,278
So, how 'bout it, new guy?

150
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:50,949
You wanna fight and make me
look good in the process?

151
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,085
Sonic: Exploding shuriken.

152
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:56,355
( Tank-top tiger screams )

153
00:05:59,025 --> 00:05:59,958
( Woman #3 screams )

154
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,093
Man #4: Tank-top tiger!

155
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,228
Man #5: Is this
really happening?

156
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,698
Saitama: What was
all that for, Sonic?

157
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:09,300
Sonic: He was interfering,
so I tucked him in for a nap.

158
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,169
Man #6: Hey, call a hero!

159
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,237
Now! Quick!

160
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,838
Man #7: Run for it!

161
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:16,241
Sonic: Interesting, though.

162
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,043
So you, too, have become

163
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,113
one of these worthless
association heroes?

164
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,115
Then all I have to do

165
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:27,051
is to create a situation
where you're forced to fight,

166
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,921
saitama the hero!

167
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,923
Hail of carnage!

168
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,826
Saitama: Hmph.

169
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,467
( People screaming )

170
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,001
Saitama: Hey, stop it!

171
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,471
Sonic: Saitama,
come forth, and fight me!

172
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,873
You're a hero!

173
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,340
Can you prevent their deaths?!

174
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,275
( Explosion )

175
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,344
Boy: Dad. ( Crying )

176
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,949
Saitama: Ugh, damn it all.

177
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,351
Can't everybody
just let me do my job?

178
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,321
I don't have time for this crap.

179
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,425
I gotta find a bad guy
to take down.

180
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,492
( Shuriken whooshing )

181
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,894
Hmm?

182
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,229
( Sonic laughs )

183
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,031
Saitama: A bad guy...

184
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,098
Sonic: Not coming?

185
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,833
Then I'll go to you!

186
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,035
Saitama: I'm right here.

187
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,773
( Sonic sputtering )

188
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,111
Saitama: Huh.

189
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,914
I wonder if taking out
this guy'll count as work.

190
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,384
Man: The man apprehended by
the class-c hero the other day

191
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,453
in city z is suspected
of being involved

192
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,056
in several heinous crimes,
including assassination.

193
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,925
( Supervisor sighs )

194
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,393
City z again, huh?

195
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,265
What's the status of
the investigation I requested?

196
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,800
Woman: You mean the one
for the ghost town?

197
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,402
- Supervisor: Yes.
- Woman: Let me see.

198
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,005
It appears an official inquiry
has been submitted.

199
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,474
- Supervisor: Hmm.
- Woman #2: Well,

200
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,209
doesn't that sound
ever so interesting?

201
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,944
Want me to check it out?

202
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:01,146
Supervisor: T-tornado?

203
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,415
- Now, how did you get in here?
- Tornado: Why?

204
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,417
- Aren't I allowed in here?
- Supervisor: Of course.

205
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,153
For city z,
the investigation's a formality.

206
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,354
It's not worth your time.

207
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,156
Tornado: What?

208
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:14,827
You mean you don't think
I'm good enough?

209
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,761
( Supervisor gasping )

210
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,163
Woman: That's not it.

211
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,032
The association decided
this was not a class-s matter.

212
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,300
That's all.

213
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,770
Supervisor: Yes, exactly right.

214
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,239
Tornado: Hmm.

215
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,773
Humph.

216
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,375
You'd better tell me

217
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,846
if you find anything
that looks like it can fight.

218
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,850
It'd be so much faster
if I went myself.

219
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,286
You guys are idiots.

220
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:45,891
( Supervisor sighs )

221
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,606
Man: Reports have come in

222
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,609
from each location
being investigated.

223
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,546
First is watchdog man,
class-s hero,

224
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,683
investigating city q.
"Nothing unusual."

225
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,751
- Man #2: Nothing unusual?
- Man #1: Yes, sir.

226
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:16,622
Man #2: That's hard to believe.
We all know city q is a hot zone

227
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,890
with more casualties
and monsters

228
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,559
than any other area
under our jurisdiction.

229
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,827
Man #1: Well, sir, knowing him,

230
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,628
I'm confident
he's implying that.

231
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,165
It says, "whatever occurs,
I'll be able to take care of it

232
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,566
on my own, without assistance."

233
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,968
Though he's focused
his efforts on city q,

234
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,504
his track record at monster
elimination is top-notch.

235
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,439
There's really no need to worry.

236
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,309
Man #3: Class-s heroes
don't pay attention to details.

237
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,244
They're not ones
for writing reports.

238
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,713
Man #1: Next, city w.

239
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:44,383
Class-a hero heavy Kong
reports, "nothing unusual."

240
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:46,718
In city h, mushroom, class b,

241
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,254
and horsebone, class c,
report, "nothing unusual."

242
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:52,524
In city d, lightning genji,
class a, reports,

243
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,526
"slow restoration
after the devastation caused

244
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,929
by the gigantic creature aside,
nothing unusual."

245
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,799
Woman: Cities b and d
both sustained extensive damage.

246
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,669
The association
took a lot of heat for that.

247
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,604
Man #1: In order to prevent
more disasters from occurring,

248
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:09,407
we must be diligent
and uncover any covert activity

249
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:10,809
that could threaten
our society.

250
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,411
Man #4: Well, keep in mind
this investigation

251
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:15,280
was requested
for that express purpose,

252
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:18,217
but detecting these monsters
is more difficult than expected.

253
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:22,221
Man #1: City f, class-a hero
snakebite snek reports,

254
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,823
"hammerhead, former leader of
the paradiser terrorist group,

255
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,292
has been spotted
in a suit and tie."

256
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,693
Hammerhead:
I'm really impressed...

257
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,361
Man #1: "Further investigation
is being conducted."

258
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:31,430
No other reports.

259
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,298
Man #2: What about city z?

260
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,502
I've heard repeated rumblings
of a potential disaster

261
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,571
brewing somewhere
in the abandoned area.

262
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,839
Man #5: No reports available.

263
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,442
However, two highly capable
class-a heroes

264
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,510
have been sent to investigate,

265
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,380
so we should get to the bottom
of these rumors soon.

266
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,650
Hero: Here we are in city z.

267
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:56,321
Are you ready to begin
our little inquiry?

268
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,791
Golden ball:
Yeah, let's get on with it

269
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,259
and get outta here.

270
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,265
Spring mustachio:
City z is quite expansive,

271
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,668
but further ahead
lies the abandoned area,

272
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,803
the one we were told
to investigate.

273
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,272
Compared with other areas,

274
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:16,408
city z
has an abnormally high rate

275
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:18,477
of monster-related incidents.

276
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,745
The frequency
has been increasing

277
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,281
over the past 10 years,
the last few

278
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,284
having more and more advanced
monsters appearing,

279
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,687
and the residents have fled for
the safety of the city center.

280
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,689
Golden ball:
Yeah, I know all that.

281
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,225
This place is
like a real ghost town,

282
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,493
only the water and electricity
are still intact, right?

283
00:11:35,563 --> 00:11:37,029
Spring mustachio: Indeed.
Looking for a cheap house?

284
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,630
Golden ball: Heh. Come off it.

285
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,499
People say something
real nasty's living round here.

286
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:44,303
I'm sure even you
must have heard about it.

287
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,837
Spring mustachio:
But of course.

288
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,039
I assume
that's why the two of us

289
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:50,308
have been assigned
to this investigation.

290
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,843
Golden ball:
Once we hit the abandoned area,

291
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,446
we're gonna need to walk in
with our game faces on.

292
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:55,781
Spring mustachio: Agreed.

293
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:59,585
We mustn't let our guard down
for a second.

294
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:01,320
Golden ball: But why here?

295
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:03,856
Why an increase in monsters
in this place?

296
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:05,724
Spring mustachio: Well,
that's the mystery, isn't it?

297
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,993
There are quite a few theories
out there about it,

298
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:09,194
and here's mine.

299
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,329
A colony of monsters
resides here

300
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,265
and is naturally producing
more of them,

301
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,935
or perhaps a queen exists,
birthing more of her kind.

302
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,003
Hmm.

303
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,804
¶¶

304
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:22,741
of course,
I have no proof of this yet,

305
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,011
but there is something
to this ghost town,

306
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,547
or rather, something in it.

307
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:31,416
Of that, you can be sure.

308
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,751
( Beeping )

309
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,887
Genos: Proximity alarm.
What tripped it?

310
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,955
Golden ball: If we can hunt down
this mysterious being,

311
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,557
the two of us'll go straight
to the top of the rankings.

312
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:40,759
- No doubt.
- Spring mustachio: True.

313
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,561
We can't let Mr. Amai mask

314
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:43,562
remain first forever, can--

315
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,296
both: Something's there!

316
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:46,698
Golden ball: Was that a monster?

317
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,567
Spring mustachio:
There's no way to be sure,

318
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,035
but it's rather hard

319
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,904
to imagine a human still living
in these conditions.

320
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,506
Let's pursue it!

321
00:12:56,844 --> 00:13:00,579
Genos: It seems
they are not after us.

322
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,783
Monster: Can this be
the place I heard about?

323
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,318
I don't know.

324
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,920
Sure don't seem like it.

325
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:10,856
Aw, man!
I came all this way for nothing.

326
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,291
Isn't anyone around?

327
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,862
Spring mustachio: A monster.
It came out of nowhere.

328
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,597
Let's take it down!

329
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:20,599
Ready, golden ball?

330
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,933
Golden ball: Hell, yeah.

331
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:25,337
- Victory to the swift!
- Monster: Hey! People!

332
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:28,006
Golden ball: I can blast through
a 20-millimeter steel plate

333
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,476
with one of my shape-memory
golden bullets!

334
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,277
Suck on this!

335
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,646
¶¶

336
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,287
( gasps )
He just flicked it away.

337
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,359
( Screams )

338
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,833
( Sputters, gags )

339
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:55,868
Spring mustachio: Golden ball!

340
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,250
( Yelling )

341
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,332
Hmm.

342
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,300
Monster: Wow!

343
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:37,543
Hmm?

344
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,879
Spring mustachio: Tomboy...

345
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,548
Thrust!

346
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,882
( Monster gasps )

347
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:48,420
Spring mustachio: It slipped
past my tomboy attack.

348
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,562
Monster: Not too bad.

349
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:57,962
Spring mustachio:
Those tentacles,

350
00:14:58,032 --> 00:15:00,632
from the way they react,
they're tough as steel.

351
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,568
A monster that can use

352
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,904
its infinite number of tentacles
like steel whips.

353
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,340
Such power.

354
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,510
( Sighs )

355
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:15,247
I must call in reinforcements
from the association.

356
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,783
I would like to ask you
a question, if I may.

357
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,585
I was just wondering if you
were born in this neighborhood.

358
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:21,920
Monster: Hmm? Nah.

359
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,922
Actually I'm from out of town.

360
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,458
I heard a bunch
of crazy-strong monsters

361
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,460
were all getting together
around here.

362
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:32,865
Too bad. Looks like it
turned out to be just a rumor.

363
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,533
But now...

364
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,204
I feel like it'd be kinda fun
to stick around

365
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,807
and make the rumor true,
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

366
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,476
I could be
"the ghost town monster."

367
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,878
It's got a nice ring to it!

368
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,814
Woman: We have
a request for backup

369
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,817
from the two heroes that were
dispatched over to city z.

370
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:55,287
Class a, rank 29, golden ball
has been knocked out.

371
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,157
Class a, rank 33,
spring mustachio is in trouble.

372
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,558
They're in the abandoned city.

373
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,560
Supervisor: Call in
all nearby heroes

374
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,496
for immediate assistance,
class a and above.

375
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,631
Hero: See the monster alert
for city z?

376
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,568
Hero #2: The threat level
seems to be tiger or higher.

377
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,636
Hero #3: Is it
the ghost town monster?

378
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,505
Hero #4: They're not sure yet.

379
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:14,773
Hero #5: I'll go.

380
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,944
I wanna catch the tiger
by its tail.

381
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:22,748
( Spring mustachio panting )

382
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:31,189
( Laughs )

383
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,391
Now I understand.

384
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:35,861
If it means running into
monsters like this all the time,

385
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:39,531
I wouldn't want to live
around here either.

386
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,733
( Groans )

387
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:41,767
( Sword clatters )

388
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,003
Monster: Ugh. Boring!

389
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,471
Come on! Seriously?

390
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,407
I finally kick a hero's butt,

391
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,942
and I don't even get
a single scream.

392
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,879
Now that I think about it,
even if I start living here,

393
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:57,482
I'll never be famous
if there's no people around.

394
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,551
Guess I'll just keep going.

395
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,420
Gotta find out
where they're living.

396
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,422
( Gasps )

397
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,957
There's somebody.

398
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,225
Is it another hero?

399
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,294
Hmm? Or just a dude?

400
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,231
I thought all
the regular humans cleared out.

401
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,566
If the monster really did exist,

402
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,769
there's no way
he could live here.

403
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:22,508
I guess that means
it was just a rumor.

404
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:23,709
Saitama: Crap.

405
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:27,346
I forgot to buy
konbu soup stock.

406
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,784
( Door opens )

407
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:35,587
Genos: Master, I saw a lot of
konbu right outside the door.

408
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,723
Saitama: Oh, yeah.
Funny story. I, uh...

409
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:40,325
Just happened...

410
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:41,259
To catch it...

411
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,795
For a really good price.

412
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:49,468
Genos: People say that konbu
is good for growing hair,

413
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,935
but there is
no scientific proof,

414
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,205
so its real benefits
have yet to be confirmed.

415
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,208
I did some research,
so I am sure, master.

416
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,477
For example,
according to this site--

417
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,746
saitama: No one said
anything about hair!

418
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:03,215
Man #1: City z
investigative report.

419
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,283
"There is nothing
noteworthy to report

420
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,285
"in the downtown
or residential areas.

421
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:08,887
"During our investigation,
we encountered

422
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,223
"a ferocious monster
in the abandoned area,

423
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,624
"but were unable
to exterminate it

424
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:13,625
"and left it in defeat.

425
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,761
"Fortunately, we escaped death,

426
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,296
"but the monster we
encountered there disappeared,

427
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,965
"and it's possible
that it still roams the area.

428
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:22,768
"Also, according
to the monster itself,

429
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,436
there's a rumor
that powerful..."

430
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:26,438
Man #2: "...Monsters
have gathered in secret

431
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:27,973
and already exist in this area."

432
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,441
That's rough.

433
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,977
It sounds like it was
a pretty brutal encounter.

434
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:33,645
Woman: A monster, huh?

435
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:34,880
Man #2: Eh, yes.

436
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,585
( Woman sighs )
Think I'll pass this time.

437
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:41,653
Tornado: You see?
I told you I should've gone!

438
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:42,720
You're so lame!

439
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,922
Supervisor: I'm sorry,

440
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:46,324
but when faced
with something like this,

441
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,261
I'm sure even you
would have had a tough time.

442
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,328
It's unprecedented.

443
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,530
Tornado: Hmph!

444
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,799
( Supervisor gasps )

445
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,667
Tornado: You idiot.

446
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,736
I would have been just fine.

447
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,873
Man #1: The rumor
has not been confirmed yet,

448
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,808
but the reinforcements saw signs

449
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:06,411
that point to the existence
of some horrible monstrosity.

450
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,480
Hero: Holy crap,
what happened out here?

451
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,883
What kind of monster
could cause such violence?

452
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:14,219
I'd hate to face off against
whatever this crazy thing is.

453
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:16,688
Hero #2: Hmm? What's this?

454
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:19,224
Is it a part of the monster

455
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,625
spring mustachio's
been fighting against?

456
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,361
Hero #3: There may have been

457
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,296
a territorial dispute
between the monsters.

458
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:26,231
But either way,

459
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,767
seems like there's
definitely something here.

460
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,769
Man #1:
This requires resolution.

461
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,504
We must continue
our investigation

462
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,506
and maintain vigilance
over city z.

463
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:35,640
¶¶

464
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:37,643
man #3: Hey,
did you hear the news?

465
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,845
There are monsters living
in the city z ghost town.

466
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,380
Man #4: Yeah.
I heard someone say

467
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,850
the toughest ones
are secretly plotting something.

468
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,852
Monster: No, no. Not that rumor.

469
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,854
It's about
a more dangerous monster.

470
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,589
Monster #2: What do ya mean?

471
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:52,524
Monster #3: You didn't hear?

472
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,593
I'm told the place
has now become terrifying

473
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,362
for both humans and monsters.

474
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,936
¶¶

475
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:09,975
( singing in Japanese )

476
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:35,968
Genos: Master, I filled in
the holes in front of the house.

477
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,236
Saitama: Ah. 'Kay, thanks.

478
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:42,307
Genos: Also, your rank has
gone from last place, 388th,

479
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:44,777
to 342nd. Congratulations.

480
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,311
Saitama: Oh? Wait.

481
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,846
'Cause of that panic guy?

482
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,448
Guess he boosted my ranking.
Cool.

483
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:53,384
So I think it's been
about a week now.

484
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:54,586
Have you done anything?

485
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,321
Genos: No. Not yet, anyway.

486
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,390
Saitama: Well,
you've still got time, I guess.

487
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:00,859
Genos: I am still ranked last
in class s for ability,

488
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,527
17th place.

489
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:06,998
Saitama: Heh. Sounds like
you still need lots of training.

490
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,867
Genos: But according
to popularity rankings

491
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:12,470
voted on by the public,
I am number six.

492
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,939
Saitama: Why?!

493
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:17,476
Genos: "A 19-year old genius
who made his debut in class s."

494
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:18,410
"He is fantastic."

495
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,878
"He is so handsome."

496
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,548
"Love how he refuses to do
media interviews. Cool."

497
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,616
- Those kinds of comments.
- Saitama: Good god.

498
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:27,486
How are you not embarrassed
to read those out loud?

499
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:28,753
Genos: Quite simple.

500
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:30,889
This is based on impressions
from my photo.

501
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,758
They are not
true evaluations of me.

502
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:33,959
I think nothing of them.

503
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,627
Saitama: Oh? Yeah?

504
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,362
Genos: "The cyborg prince."

505
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:40,632
"Behind the steely exterior,
I feel his fragile self."

506
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,434
"Top five handsomest heroes."

507
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:43,969
Saitama: Enough already!
