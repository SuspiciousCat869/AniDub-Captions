2
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,746
( Man gasps )

3
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,882
( Man #2 gasps ) This is bad.

4
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,686
Astronaut: Initiating
docking procedures.

5
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,488
Operator: Roger.

6
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,494
( Astronaut gasps )

7
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,899
( Overlapping chatter )

8
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,102
Man #3: Elevating from six
to nine on the Torino scale!

9
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,071
( Overlapping chatter )

10
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,808
( Beeping )

11
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,812
Supervisor: So the course
suddenly shifted?

12
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:49,647
I see.

13
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,618
Then we'll discuss how best
to deal with the situation.

14
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,054
Genos: Should I go
right now, then?

15
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,656
Understood.

16
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,125
Master, for some reason,

17
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,794
the hero association
wants me to come in.

18
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,596
I will be back later.

19
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,865
Saitama: Okay.
Maybe you're getting fired.

20
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,834
( Laughs )

21
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,345
¶¶

22
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,314
( singing in Japanese )

23
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,577
Hero: Ah, you must be genos.

24
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,713
It's very nice
to make your acquaintance.

25
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,247
I'm bang.

26
00:01:56,317 --> 00:02:00,119
( Genos thinking ) Class s,
rank 3, a.K.A. Silverfang.

27
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,855
He possesses true skill.

28
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:05,791
( Aloud )
The association called me in.

29
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,994
Bang: Everyone else
is over at headquarters.

30
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,929
This branch office
is empty now.

31
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,865
Every class-s hero
got the call to come here,

32
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,869
but you and I are
the only ones who showed up.

33
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,671
Genos: And why is that?

34
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,206
Bang: Maybe this branch
is too far away,

35
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,675
or perhaps they're busy.

36
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,744
Of course, some of
the more coldblooded ones

37
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,012
simply don't bother.

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,281
Then again,
it's hard to blame them.

39
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,016
We're only called

40
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,952
when there's an impossible
problem to take care of,

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,021
and today's dilemma
is no exception.

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,356
The threat level is dragon,

43
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,826
meaning it's
a worst-case scenario.

44
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,427
35 minutes from now,

45
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,096
a huge meteor
will strike city z.

46
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,766
They're asking
if nearby class-s heroes

47
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,234
can do anything about it.

48
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,770
( Genos gasps ) Meteor?

49
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,707
Bang: Apparently
it suddenly changed paths.

50
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,375
That new trajectory
means the end for us.

51
00:02:57,445 --> 00:03:00,912
The impact
will wipe out city z.

52
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,449
I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do this time.

53
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:06,118
You should think about
evacuating with your loved ones,

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,186
as the others have.

55
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,321
Genos: Do the citizens know?

56
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,324
Bang: I was told
the powers-that-be

57
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:15,994
would issue evacuation orders
30 minutes before it hits.

58
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,130
( Siren blaring )

59
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,799
Announcer: Attention! This is
an important announcement

60
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,134
from the hero association.

61
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,135
( Bang chuckles )

62
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,936
People are surely
going to panic.

63
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,671
Genos: And you, old fellow?

64
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,206
Bang: "Old fellow," is it?

65
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,209
I told you. Call me bang.

66
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,944
Genos: You are not evacuating?

67
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,679
Bang: There's a dojo
for martial arts here

68
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,081
that's been in my family
for generations.

69
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,316
I cannot abandon it.

70
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,020
Fist of flowing water
crushing rock.

71
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,222
Ever heard of it?

72
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,893
Huh. He left.

73
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,229
¶¶

74
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,765
announcer:
Emergency evacuation warning.

75
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,166
- The threat level is dragon.
- ( Horns honking )

76
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,903
Evacuate immediately
to a safe distance.

77
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,106
T-minus 21 minutes
until meteor impact.

78
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,108
City z will be
completely destroyed.

79
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,309
Man: It's huge.

80
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,912
Man #2: No way
we can escape that thing.

81
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,249
Announcer: ...Leave
as quickly as possible.

82
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,918
Genos: So many people
have given up hope

83
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,119
of surviving this tragedy.

84
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,189
It is not just city z
that is in danger.

85
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,459
The neighboring cities
will also sustain damage.

86
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,127
It is too late to evacuate.

87
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:24,929
I did not expect

88
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,931
to be testing
this prototype so soon.

89
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,267
( Beep )

90
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,870
¶¶

91
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,220
Let me see if an attack
from my incineration Cannon

92
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,889
at full power
will do the trick.

93
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,359
Master saitama lives here, too.

94
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,261
I cannot possibly evacuate
without him.

95
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,033
What is that?

96
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,380
You are bofoi, correct?

97
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,583
Bofoi: And you are
the new boy, genos.

98
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,252
Have you come
to stop the meteor?

99
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,387
Genos: Yes.

100
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,123
( Thinking )
Class s, rank 7.

101
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,258
Uses intense firepower
to obliterate opponents

102
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,260
along with everything
in their vicinity.

103
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,329
Does he also live in city z,

104
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,932
or did he rush here
putting his life at risk?

105
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,202
Bofoi, I am in need
of your assistance.

106
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,136
Bofoi: I refuse.

107
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,871
Genos: Why is that?

108
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,475
Bofoi: I only answered the call
to field-test my new weapon.

109
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,411
The meteor is a perfect target.

110
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,879
Genos: A field test?

111
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,415
If that meteor hits,
you will die, too.

112
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,950
- Bofoi: Fortunately I won't.
- Genos: How so?

113
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,020
Bofoi: What you are talking to
is a remote-controlled drone.

114
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,889
I am a good distance away.

115
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,623
Terribly sorry
to disappoint you,

116
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,826
but my life's
not at stake here.

117
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,495
Also, I am not bofoi.

118
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,364
I am metal knight.

119
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,166
Heroes call each other
by their hero names,

120
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,635
not their real names.
Everyone knows that.

121
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,370
Looks like it's time.

122
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,239
Sorry to cut off
our little chat.

123
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:15,274
( Genos scoffs )

124
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,447
All right.

125
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,417
Bofoi: Launch missiles!

126
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,356
( Genos thinking )
Metal knight?

127
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,961
I cannot fire
with his missiles in the way.

128
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,944
Amazing.
Such destructive power.

129
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,013
This hero is dangerous.

130
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,081
I must be careful around him.

131
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,290
( Gasps )

132
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,159
Bofoi: Unfortunate.

133
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,493
Not quite potent enough.

134
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,362
¶¶

135
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,631
genos: 33 seconds remain
until impact.

136
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,168
To fire my incineration Cannon
at full power,

137
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,703
I need five seconds
to charge it,

138
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:20,639
but the target
is already dangerously close.

139
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,709
Additionally,
if I do happen to take it out,

140
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,244
what then?

141
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,580
The meteor may break apart
and still cause a disaster.

142
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,450
Will my weapon
be powerful enough to stop it?

143
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:34,586
Even metal knight's countless
missiles had no effect.

144
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,654
( Gasps )

145
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,522
Bang: First off, be calm.

146
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,390
I see you've lost composure.

147
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,126
Put your mind at rest.

148
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,063
You're far too young
to be worried about failure.

149
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,665
When your back's up against
the wall, you must take action.

150
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,269
Overthinking
won't change things.

151
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,338
The best course
is to muddle through.

152
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,607
Genos: Muddling through
is the best course?

153
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,448
Bang: Hmm?

154
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:06,618
Genos: He is right.

155
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,956
If the outcome
will not change either way,

156
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:15,494
then how can I just die
without giving it my all?

157
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:20,366
- Bang, get down!
- Bang: Ohh!

158
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:23,702
Genos: I will no longer think
about failure or repercussions.

159
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,237
I will just
pour everything I have...

160
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,173
Into one shot!

161
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:36,015
( Yells )

162
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,987
Damn, it is not working.

163
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,255
Bang: Hold on!

164
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,257
I think I see the meteor
being pushed back!

165
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:47,459
Genos: Really?

166
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,394
Bang: Nope.
It was just my imagination.

167
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,462
Genos: You old fool!

168
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,201
So this--this will be my grave.

169
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,173
( Groans )

170
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,345
( Powering down )

171
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,281
Only nine more seconds.

172
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,750
Leave now, bang,
or you will die.

173
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,819
Saitama: Old man,
take care of genos.

174
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:14,753
Bang: Hmm?

175
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,523
¶¶

176
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,829
w-who are you? Who sent you?

177
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:27,433
Saitama: I'm just a guy
who's a hero for the fun of it.

178
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:29,368
¶¶

179
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,646
Genos: Master?!

180
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,217
Saitama: You're not...

181
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,387
Gonna fall...

182
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,357
On my town!

183
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,602
Bang: He shattered it!

184
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,405
Unbelievable!

185
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:07,339
Oh, no.

186
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:19,417
Genos: It is falling!

187
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:21,620
Bang: It's not
just this building.

188
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,822
The destruction
from the splintered meteor

189
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,725
is spreading
throughout the entire city.

190
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,102
Saitama: I guess
that takes care of that.

191
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,242
Reporter: Although city z
was able to avoid

192
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,643
total destruction
from the meteor,

193
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:48,046
the city was still
relentlessly devastated,

194
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,448
with the destructive effects

195
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,451
of the giant fireball's
fragments visible everywhere.

196
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,385
- According to...
- Genos: Look at this.

197
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:55,654
If only the hero association

198
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,257
had called you to help
instead of me, master.

199
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,193
If you had been assigned
to work with metal knight,

200
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,929
all the damage caused could have
easily been minimized.

201
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,131
Saitama: But you said
that metal knight guy

202
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,333
wasn't interested
in helping at all, didn't you?

203
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:10,335
So stop worrying about it.

204
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,071
I think we kept the damage
to a minimum.

205
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,274
Since no one died,
we should just call it a win.

206
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,075
( Genos thinking )
He is right.

207
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,677
Master's punch greatly lessened

208
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:21,012
the meteor's momentum
and destructive power.

209
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,216
Theoretically,
the shockwaves from the meteor

210
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,284
would have annihilated
everything for miles around.

211
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,353
Stopping it
was nothing short of a miracle.

212
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,689
I would not be surprised

213
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,358
if people talk about master
for years to come,

214
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,560
praising him
as a man of courage.

215
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,762
But master himself has no idea.

216
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:41,232
Some are even making him out
to be the bad guy

217
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,368
for causing the partial
destruction of city z,

218
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,237
despite saving it as a whole.

219
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,640
No, I should not
mention it to him.

220
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,308
Saitama: By the way,

221
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,379
do you think what happened
moved us up in the ranking?

222
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,447
Genos: Yes, in fact, it did.

223
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,317
I progressed
from rank 17 to 16.

224
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,453
Metal knight moved up
from rank seven to six.

225
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:06,324
Master, you shot from class c,
rank 342, up to rank five.

226
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,593
Saitama: Number five?!

227
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,595
- From 342 to five?
- ( Birds squawking )

228
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,332
Whoa, what the hell?!
That's crazy!

229
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,800
Genos: Well, honestly,

230
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:18,403
your performance was worthy
of class a or even class s.

231
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:21,740
I mean, the threat level
to this event was dragon.

232
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,075
Saitama: Yeah?

233
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,543
Genos: If there
had been no damage,

234
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:27,079
I am sure you would be
at class s, rank 5.

235
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,147
Saitama: Huh?

236
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:30,215
Genos: Smashing the meteor alone

237
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:33,552
would earn a jump
from class c to class a,

238
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,555
but I think the hero association
must have assumed

239
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,024
that metal knight and I
played a big role

240
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,093
in the tide of events
that occurred.

241
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,695
Saitama: By the way,
they always report threat levels

242
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,564
as demon or tiger or whatever.

243
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,699
Does all that
really mean anything?

244
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,768
( Genos gasps ) It does.

245
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:53,639
Tiger--a crisis threatening
massive loss of life.

246
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:56,308
Demon--a crisis threatening
to halt the functioning

247
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,577
of an entire city
or its destruction.

248
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,512
Dragon--a crisis threatening

249
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:02,247
the destruction
of multiple cities.

250
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:05,316
God--a crisis
threatening human extinction.

251
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,453
Saitama: Wow. I had no idea.

252
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,188
Genos: I believe that heroes

253
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,456
normally take these
threat levels into consideration

254
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,660
when deciding whether or not
to respond to a call.

255
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,529
But I guess such things
do not matter to you.

256
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,197
Saitama: Well,
of course they don't.

257
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,266
- Genos: Hmm?
- Saitama: If heroes run away,

258
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,434
who's left to help?

259
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,206
Um, what are you doing?

260
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,609
Genos: I must record
your words of wisdom.

261
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:33,545
Saitama: Well, anyway,
it wasn't much

262
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,348
for such a huge jump
in rankings.

263
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,150
Right.

264
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,119
I'll be out for a bit.

265
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,821
Genos: You are
going out, master?

266
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,823
Hold on. I will come with you.

267
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,625
Saitama: You stay here.

268
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,159
If something heroic happens,

269
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:50,195
you'll get
all the credit again.

270
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,804
This place is a total wreck.

271
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,240
Oh.

272
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,843
My favorite supermarket
got smashed,

273
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,578
and the crappy
apartment building

274
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:08,580
I got kicked out of is...

275
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:09,715
Just fine.

276
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,316
Damn.

277
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,784
- Tank-top tiger: Hey.
- Saitama: Huh?

278
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,520
Tank-top tiger:
You no-good cheating bastard.

279
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,856
Saitama: Uh, who might you be?

280
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,324
( Tank-top tiger sputters )

281
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,660
You know damn well who I am!
Tank-top tiger!

282
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:24,129
Hey, brother!

283
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,198
It's that guy I told you about!

284
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,867
( Saitama thinking )
Seriously, who is this guy?

285
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:32,471
Hero: Did I hear you
call me, little bro?

286
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,938
Tank-top tiger: Brother!

287
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:37,876
Hero: The hero known
as tank-top blackhole is here!

288
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,412
So it's you,
the fraud who takes credit

289
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:43,282
for work done by class-s heroes
to jump the rankings!

290
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,683
Saitama: What the--

291
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,618
tank-top tiger:
Nobody could move up the ranks

292
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,887
to number five so quickly
without cheating, you cheater!

293
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,155
Saitama: Huh?

294
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,558
So what do you guys want?

295
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,359
Tank-top tiger:
What? Don't you know?

296
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:57,162
We came here to beat you up
so bad you'll never be able to--

297
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,497
tank-top blackhole:
Hang on, little bro.

298
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,964
Tank-top tiger: Hmm?

299
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:01,767
Tank-top blackhole:
That plan's not gonna work.

300
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,169
The bastard won't learn
from that kind of lesson.

301
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,771
Let's make him
really pay for this

302
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,641
by using
the most brutal method there is.

303
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:10,843
( Deep breath )

304
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:13,245
Was it you?!

305
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,515
Are you the jerk-off responsible
for destroying this city?!

306
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,450
Saitama: Huh?

307
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,851
( Tank-top tiger thinking )
I get it!

308
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
There are tons of people
in this city

309
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,455
who are totally pissed at him.

310
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:24,656
Tank-top blackhole:
You're unbelievable!

311
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:27,259
How can you even
show your face around here?!

312
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,326
Woman: Hmm?

313
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,328
Tank-top tiger:
Smart play, brother.

314
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,729
He's gonna use their anger...

315
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,797
Tank-top blackhole:
Do you feel nothing

316
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,332
at the sight
of this devastation?

317
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,201
( Onlookers murmuring )

318
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,670
Tank-top tiger: ...To completely
break his spirit.

319
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,939
Tank-top blackhole:
Look at you gloating,

320
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,341
thinking you've actually
saved these people!

321
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,212
Why else would you be walking
around here so shamelessly?

322
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,680
Thanks to your screw-up,

323
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:50,749
these citizens
have nowhere to go!

324
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,418
Their homes
have been destroyed!

325
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,018
If you were
gonna fail this hard,

326
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,487
why'd you even butt in?!

327
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,889
The other heroes would
have done a way better job

328
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,024
without your help!

329
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,493
And yet you still
wanna play hero,

330
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,695
even after causing
such a disaster?

331
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:04,896
Look at this place!

332
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,767
All this destruction
is your doing, you jerk!

333
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:11,970
Man: Yeah, that's right.

334
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,705
You, all this is your fault!

335
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,307
( Tank-top blackhole chuckles )

336
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,709
( Thinking )
They took the bait.

337
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:18,377
Hey, do you hear that?

338
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,313
The heart-wrenching cry
of someone who lost his home!

339
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,915
Look at them all,

340
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,783
victims of your
thoughtless actions!

341
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,985
You should
be ashamed of yourself!

342
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,319
Man #2: That's right!

343
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,654
Man #3: Yeah, you tell him!

344
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,723
Tank-top blackhole:
Haven't you even thought

345
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,525
- to take responsibility?
- Woman: Yeah, creep!

346
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:34,727
Man #4: You're inhuman!

347
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,862
Tank-top blackhole:
You're no hero!

348
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,530
Give it up!

349
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,399
Give it up! Give it up!

350
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,000
Give it up! Give it up!

351
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:42,934
Give it up!

352
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,602
( Together )
Give it up!

353
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:47,006
Give it up! Give it up!

354
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,741
Crowd:
Give it up! Give it up!

355
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,609
Give it up! Give it up!

356
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,012
Give it up! Give it up!

357
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Give it up! Give it up!

358
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,816
Give it up! Give it up!

359
00:16:57,885 --> 00:17:00,018
Give it up! Give it up!

360
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,954
Give it up! Give it up!

361
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,822
Give it up! Give it up!

362
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,891
Give it up! Give it up!

363
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,894
Give it up! Give it up!
Give it up!

364
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,762
- Tank-top tiger: We got him.
- ( Chanting continues )

365
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,964
His pride should be
shattered to pieces by now.

366
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,535
That's what he gets
for cheating, the idiot.

367
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,579
( Genos gasps )

368
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,648
Crowd: Give it up! Give it up!

369
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,449
Give it up! Give it up!

370
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,718
Give it up!

371
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,786
Tank-top tiger: So this
is mob mentality, huh?

372
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:37,589
I'd sure hate to be
on the wrong side of this.

373
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:40,392
Crowd: Give it up! Give it up!

374
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:41,993
Give it up! Give it up!

375
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,528
- Bang: Saitama.
- ( Chanting continues )

376
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,865
Without a shadow of a doubt,
you saved this city.

377
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,335
Yet look
how the city treats you.

378
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,004
Reality can be so ugly.

379
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,405
You're strong,

380
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,473
the strongest man
I've ever seen.

381
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,876
That's why I refrain
from saying anything.

382
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,878
I don't want to influence you.

383
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:04,483
I'd hate to see you rotting away
into oblivion in this industry.

384
00:18:04,485 --> 00:18:07,018
Unfortunately, resigning
may be your best option.

385
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,821
Tank-top blackhole:
Time to finish him off!

386
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,957
Hey! Look, you guys!
He's getting ready to fight!

387
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,693
Saitama: Huh?
What are you talking--

388
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:16,561
tank-top blackhole:
No way! Seriously?!

389
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,630
You're gonna take out
your frustration

390
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:19,698
on these people here,

391
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,367
just like you
destroyed their city?!

392
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,568
Do you just kill
everyone you don't like?

393
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,437
I won't let you do that!

394
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,772
We, the tank-top brothers,

395
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,041
won't stand by
while you resort to violence!

396
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:31,443
If you're the hero
you say you are,

397
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,445
then fight us both
fair and square!

398
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,981
Bang: So they're out
to crush a rookie

399
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:39,651
and perform a publicity stunt
at the same time, are they?

400
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,187
( Sighs ) I'd say
they've gotten a little greedy.

401
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:45,924
No wonder they can't rise
above class b.

402
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:48,794
( Crowd murmuring, jeering )

403
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,198
Tank-top tiger:
I, tank-top tiger,

404
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
who fights
like a true tiger, and...

405
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,469
Tank-top blackhole:
Tank-top blackhole,

406
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,739
who can crush them all with
a grip strength of 2,800 p.S.I!

407
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,941
Tank-top tiger:
We will punish all who stray

408
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:05,610
from the path of a hero!
Now prepare for pain!

409
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,613
( Yells )

410
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:10,148
- ( Yelps )
- Tank-top blackhole: Hmm?

411
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,551
- ( Crash )
- Damn it!

412
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,953
You're dead!

413
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,221
( Screams )

414
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,890
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

415
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:19,692
I give up! I give up!

416
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,893
You're crushing my hand!

417
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,427
Saitama: Wait. Really?

418
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,829
You're kidding, right?

419
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,030
Tank-top blackhole:
Please let go!

420
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,698
I give up for real! I'm sorry!

421
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,968
I'm so sorry
for lying about you!

422
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:31,970
Saitama: Nope,
you weren't lying.

423
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,773
I'm the one
who smashed that big meteor!

424
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,975
Anyone with a complaint,
let's hear it!

425
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:37,976
Speak up!

426
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,878
( Man #5 gasps )

427
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,714
Man #6: Because of what you did,

428
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:43,848
my brand-new car was--

429
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,917
saitama: You shut
your damn mouth!

430
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:49,121
Why would I give a crap
about how you're put out?

431
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:51,523
Tell it to the meteor,
not me, jackass!

432
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,859
Listen up!
I don't do this hero thing

433
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,661
for admiration or approval
or anything like that!

434
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,931
I do it because I want to,
understand?!

435
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,734
So if you wanna blame me,
go ahead, you baldies!

436
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:03,601
Man #7: But you're
the one who's bald.

437
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:05,938
Saitama: What did you say?!

438
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,205
Genos: Master.

00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,675
Saitama: Oh, hey, genos.
What's going on?

440
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:12,077
Give me just a minute.
These guys are saying i'm--

441
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,547
genos: We must go home, master.

442
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,748

You think we should?

00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:26,691
Damn it. That guy's face
is burned into my brain.

446
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,894
I'll never be able
to forget him.

- Genos: Master.
- Saitama: Hmm?

448
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,898
Genos: Listen.
I want you to know

449
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,634
I have never met anyone
as amazing as you.

450
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:37,769
Saitama: What brought that on?

451
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,171
You're creeping me out.

452
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:42,107
Genos: Even if the public
does not appreciate you

453
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:45,044
or what you have done,
I will still follow you.

454

have to butter me up like that.

man: I hear there's
some amazing hero

459
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,557
in class c right now.

460
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,225
Man #2: Wait. Class c?

461
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,627
Man #3: The guy who says
he smashed the meteor, right?

462
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:36,695
Woman: That's just a rumor.

463
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:38,230
Man #4: Going after weak guys

464
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,099
and then
calling yourself a hero?

465
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,968
Man #5: Heh.
Guess it just goes to show

466
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,304
you can't really count
on any of 'em.
