00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
[ERHART] Here's the focus
in question, Your Majesty.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
It's enchanted with
increased magical defense,

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
increased physical defense,

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.944 position:50% align:center
a resistance to
all status ailments,

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.990 position:50% align:center
and it was created by none
other than Sei Takanashi.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:35.702 position:50% align:center
You've just described an item
of legendary power.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
I understand now, why you
insisted we speak in private.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
Astonishing.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
You were able to estimate
her abilities, then?

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
Yes, sire. I made
various requests,

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
requiring different
types of enchantment.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.133 position:50% align:center
The answer was clear.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
Her holy-affinity magic

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.679 position:50% align:center
is matched only by the
Grand Magus himself.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
Though, in truth,
she may be more powerful.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.560 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Hmm...

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.106 position:50% align:center
Extraordinary. Less than
a year since her Summoning,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center
and already she has such power.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.780 position:50% align:center
Doesn't it seem, just logically
speaking, that she is the Saint?

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
Still unconfirmed, Your Majesty.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.828 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the only
mage in the kingdom

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.915 position:50% align:center
with the ability to Appraise
her is the Grand Magus,

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.376 position:50% align:center
which complicates things.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:25.794 position:50% align:center
So, we can only know whether

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center
she is the Saint once he
awakens from his deep slumber.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
Morning!

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
[SEI shrieks]

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh. Morning, Jude.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
Hm?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.458 position:50% align:center
If you'd asked, I would've
helped you water.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
Thanks for offering, but I'm
pretty sure I can handle it.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
[JUDE chuckles]

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's right.
There's a potions delivery

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.177 position:50% align:center
going to the Third Order today.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Yeah?

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] From what I understand,
it's bigger than usual,

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
to the point that the director
even made an official request:

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.145 position:50% align:center
Anyone with free time,
please lend a hand.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.648 position:50% align:center
Are there that many
of us who're free?

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
[SEI humming]

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
Seriously? I swear.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
[SEI yelps]

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
Sei! I told you not to
make this many potions!

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!
It's like I can't help myself!

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hmm.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:08.915 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
I think I'll come help
deliver potions with you.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's no biggie.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'll get to spend some
time with my new friend!

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
[JUDE grunts]
Wait, who would that be?

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
There you go, nice job!
You're such a good boy.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
[WOLFF]
Is that you, Sei?

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]
Ser Wolff!

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
Did you come by
to deliver potions?

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
Sure did! I'm glad we
can be of service.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.068 position:50% align:center
We're certainly grateful.

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
The Institute's potions
are something special.

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
They're of a much higher quality

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
than the ones you'd
find in the market place.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center
Just how do you do it?

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:48.163 position:50% align:center
Uh, well, I'm afraid
that's a trade secret.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Heck, my dude,
I'd like to know why

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
I'm cursed to make everything

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
one and a half
times stronger, too.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
Must be a challenge for you
to craft so many of them for us.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
And pretty soon,
we're gonna need even more.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center
For real? You're gonna
need more than this?

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
What? You haven't heard?

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Heard what?

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
There's a big expedition
about a month from now.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
A joint one at that.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
It'll be us and the Second
Order moving out together.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
Yes, extra numbers for safety.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
We'll be heading into
the Ghoshe Forest, so...

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Ghoshe?

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
Oh, where the Salamander
attack happened.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
The huge delivery
makes sense, then.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
[SEI] So, what about
the First Order then?

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
They won't be
heading there with you?

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS chuckle]

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
Am I not supposed to
ask about them or what?

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
First Order's tied up.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
They're helping out
the Crown Prince.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
The Crown Prince?

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 04A] Yes, Prince Kyle
and his Academy entourage

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
have apparently gone to
the Eastern Woods to train.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Prince Kyle?

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
Oh, that guy. Of course.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.852 position:50% align:center
However, I'm not sure
how much training

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
they'll actually be doing there.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
What're you talking
about? How come?

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 04A] Well, you know,
like all the other nearby areas,

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
it's usually
relatively peaceful.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
So, there's nothing
there for them to battle.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
I suppose it makes sense.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
He's got the Saint
with him after all.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.328 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Did you just say, "the Saint?"

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
Yes, she's this young woman
under Prince Kyle's care.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
We know because he
keeps calling her that.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
Her actual name is Aira Misono.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
Prince Kyle's men are
keeping a close eye on her.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50% align:center
They've kept her
at the Royal Academy

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
and take her safety
very seriously.

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
Yes, they certainly do.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
The prince always says

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.308 position:50% align:center
the Saint's vital to
our kingdom's future.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50% align:center
He's pulling out all
the stops for her.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Makes sense.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I'm glad she's doing okay.

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:41.443 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm?

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS]
Hmm...

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Huh?

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
You're the Saintly one, Sei.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:49.159 position:50% align:center
Much more so than that other
supposed Saint, anyway.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS]
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks. I appreciate that.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
[SEI] It's funny. I know
everyone likes to joke about it,

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:03.340 position:50% align:center
but the irony is, I think
I probably am the Saint.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.924 position:50% align:center
But I don't feel
ready to come out

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center
and announce that to
the world--not just yet.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
Can't I just, like, live
my life as a regular person

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
till someone else
figures it out?

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Man, no matter what I do,

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.740 position:50% align:center
I can't seem to get
that conversation

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
with the knights out of my head.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
I keep thinking
about Aira Misono.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.456 position:50% align:center
I'm gathering, from everything
I've heard about her,

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
that she doesn't have

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.543 position:50% align:center
the same crazy cheat-code
powers that I do.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
Why are we on such
different levels?

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I think
I know the answer.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:49.135 position:50% align:center
It's because she's not
actually the Saint at all.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
It's me. I'm the real Saint.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.101 position:50% align:center
But I really don't
want it to be true.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
My, my.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
You've sure been crafting up
a storm, haven't you?

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Ser Director!

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
Sorry! I was lost in my
thoughts and got carried away.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.072 position:50% align:center
Just like every other time!

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:13.201 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.748 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
And he kicked me out of the lab.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
At first, he was
only worried about

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
my endless supply
of magic power.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.129 position:50% align:center
But now, he seems concerned

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
about the Institute's
herb supply, too.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hmm...

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.015 position:50% align:center
Well, I've got the whole
rest of the day off,

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
so I might as well take
advantage and do some research!

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
Let's see. Ooh, maybe
I can find a book on herbs,

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
so I can make potions even
better than high-grade!

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I mean, I've been low-key
looking around for books

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
on subjects like that
for a while now, but...

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
Oh, I feel certain that
you would find tomes

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
with that type of knowledge
in the Forbidden Collection!

[SEI]
I don't think normal people can

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
just waltz in there
whenever they want.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.878 position:50% align:center
Though I'm sure Liz had
the best of intentions.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
[SEI] The knights said
that their next expedition

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
was into the same forest as
that awful salamander attack.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
[SEI] If they come back with
that many casualties again,

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
could there be some
other way to help them?

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
I mean, outside of
just making potions?

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Okay, yeah, this
one's a bit too complicated.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
Let's find one for beginners.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
Do you have an interest
in learning magic?

[SEI grunts]

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.925 position:50% align:center
Forgive me,
but I believe that tome

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
will prove too
difficult to start with.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking that.
I was looking for another.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
One for newbies that
covers more of the basics.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Who is this guy?

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
Try this one, then.
You'll like it.

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.077 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]
Hey, it's perfect!

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
I can totally work with this!

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:22.914 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Thanks, this is great!

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:27.669 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
My apologies. I've been remiss.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
How rude of me. Siegfried
Salutania, at your service.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Wait, Salutania. Isn't
that the name of this kingdom?

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
And if I'm not mistaken,

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
I believe your name
is Sei, is that right?

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Oh, yes, very
pleased to meet you.

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center
Please, there's no
need for formalities,

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
especially when
I've yet to thank you.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
I'm deeply in your debt.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.532 position:50% align:center
[SEI] But I haven't done
anything for this guy.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
Why does he want to thank me?

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
A short while back,
when you arrived,

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
I heard that my son was
inexcusably rude to you.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
I apologize. Please
forgive his behavior.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, who?

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Ah, my first-born son.

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
His name is Kyle.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hold the phone--Kyle?

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
But, he's the crown
prince, isn't he?

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
So, like, logically,
wouldn't that make this guy...

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
...the freakin' king?!

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
[SEI] No, no, no!
Please, do not apologize!

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
I'm not bothered by that
in the slightest anymore!

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
Well, regardless, I'm ashamed.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
I should have offered a formal
apology, and much sooner.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Seriously, don't give it
another thought--I mean it!

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED] That's not all I'd
hoped to speak with you about.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
I wish to reward
the commendable deeds

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
you've performed
for our kingdom.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
Would you like land
or a court title?

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't need
that stuff, really!

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:57.300 position:50% align:center
Well, then, your own
estate in the capital?

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:58.593 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not live alone!

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
All right, with servants?

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
Servants? For real?!

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED chuckles] I should
have known to trust Johan.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
I had spoken with him about
this before approaching you,

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center
as I'd intended to
reward you properly.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
He urged me to reconsider
because he insisted

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
you were likely to
refuse any offers.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Good job, Director!

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED] Now, forgive
me for disturbing you.

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.578 position:50% align:center
I must go.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
Mark my words,
you'll be rewarded,

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.207 position:50% align:center
properly, and at court.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center

At court?!

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Wow. It may
have taken a while,

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.754 position:50% align:center
but I'm so glad I powered
through to learn this!

Something smells good!

--Oh!

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Huh? Oh, you know!

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
Just whippin' up some snacks!

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
I heard the Knights are back,

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
but many are still
recovering from the trip.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
They're down at the hospital.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.641 position:50% align:center
So, I thought I'd visit
to cheer them up.

[JUDE]
Hmm...

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
Right, I think I remember
the Director mentioning that.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
There. Okay! I'm gonna head out!

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:40.195 position:50% align:center
Oh. Bye then.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone!

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 04A]
Look! Sei's come to visit!

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
You came all this way for us?

00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:00.090 position:50% align:center
'Course I did!
So, how is everyone doing?

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 04A]
Right as rain, as you can see!

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 04C] Oh, please,
you were on death's door

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
when they brought you in here!

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't tell her that!

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
It's true. He was a mess;
you should've seen him.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
Sounds like the expedition must
have been quite the ordeal, huh?

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 04C] Yes, there
were hordes upon hordes

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
of beasts out there.

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.815 position:50% align:center
We only made it back
because of your potions.

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
I really don't think
we would've otherwise.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
No doubt, there.

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that!

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]
You're welcome.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.532 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad we could help.

00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 04B]
Though, have you ever seen

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.160 position:50% align:center
that many monsters at one time?

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
Hey, how's it going?

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.607 position:50% align:center
Oh! Hello, did you
come to visit?

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.068 position:50% align:center
Your... Your arm. What happened?

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
Well, I, uh, got
a little clumsy.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
[WOLFF] Your potions
helped us stay alive,

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
but unfortunately,
they can't do much about this.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
Well, if the potions won't work,

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
do you think we'd be able to
heal you by using magic instead?

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't know.

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
I have had wounds healed
with magic in the past.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
But this one, well, it's no
ordinary flesh wound, now is it?

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.432 position:50% align:center
I'd have to find
a high-level mage

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
who can use holy magic
and, believe me,

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
that can be a lot
harder than it sounds.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming by today.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
Glad to talk one last time.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait,
what does that mean?

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:50.033 position:50% align:center
[WOLFF] I'm quitting the Order
and heading back home.

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
I don't have much of a choice,
since it's not like

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
I can keep being a knight
with this and all.

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
[WOLFF]
I'm a commoner who rose up

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
through the Academy
to become a knight.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
Now that I'm not one anymore,

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
I'm not allowed to
stay at the palace.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
[WOLFF]
I wish I could.

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:12.931 position:50% align:center
I could do so much more for
this kingdom, for its people.

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
But now, it's just...

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Wolff.

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
Listen, if you could
have your arm back,

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
would you want it?

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
If I heal him here,

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center
I won't be able to pretend
I'm an ordinary person anymore.

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:47.507 position:50% align:center
That's all over.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.634 position:50% align:center
[WOLFF groans]

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
[SEI] If he were just a
stranger, that would be...

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
No!

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
Even if he was some stranger,
it would be no different.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.311 position:50% align:center
I still wouldn't be able to
walk away. Not from anyone.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
I'd stay and help
however I could.

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
Please...

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
Please, let this heal him!

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
Heal, now.

[gasps]

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
Oh, um...

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
You're welcome?
Glad I could help, I guess.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
Why are you saying that
like it's a question?

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.706 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I couldn't tell ya.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center

C'mon, you're a hero!

Look!

[MAN 04C]
What in the world?

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Wow, that's right.

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
[SEI] The other men in this
room are also gravely injured.

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
When they're done healing,
most won't be able to return

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center
to serve as knights
of the Order.

Listen, Sei--

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
There's no turning back now.

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
I'll heal everyone here!
It's the least I can do.

You have to see this!

[BOTH]
Hm?

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
[MAN 04D gasping]
I can see.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
I can see again!

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
[PATIENT 04B]
Unbelievable!

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
[PATIENT 04C]
It's a miracle!

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
Easy. You all right?

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm fine.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
How many more rooms are
left on this little tour?

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
This is the last one.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
We've already hit the rooms
with the worst injuries.

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
Everyone here's only
got minor cuts and bruises.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Okay.

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
[SEI] There was a high-level
spell in that book,

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
strong enough to
help a whole crowd.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Can't hurt to try it, right?

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
If it'll help them, I mean.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
I just need to focus my magic
throughout my whole body

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
instead of only my hand.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
Then imagine it
filling the room.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.820 position:50% align:center

Area Heal!

[SEI]
Wow.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50% align:center
I feel like that drained all
the power right outta me.

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center
[PATIENT 04D]
I'm healed!

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
[PATIENT 04E] I am, too!
My wounds are completely gone!

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN] Did you use an
area-wide healing spell?

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center

Ser Director!

[SEI grunts]

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
You sure do know
how to show off.

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.904 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I know,
that's totally fair;

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
I probably went a
little too far this time.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
But I couldn't leave without
doing something, you know?

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
I couldn't.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:46.037 position:50% align:center
Have to earn my keep.

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
Sorry about this.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
Don't be. You've done well.

00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:47.200 position:50% align:center
Don't turn around,
but that young woman is here.

00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:49.119 position:50% align:center
The one who apparently
heals people.

[KNIGHT 04D]
Lady Sei!

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.749 position:50% align:center
I've come to escort you home!

00:22:55.834 --> 00:22:57.252 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm.

00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:01.548 position:50% align:center
Were you escorted home again?

00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:04.676 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Mm. I tried to tell
them it was unnecessary,

00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:07.679 position:50% align:center
but they refused to give up
no matter what I said.

00:23:07.762 --> 00:23:09.806 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN] I suppose you'll
have to live with it.

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:11.725 position:50% align:center
Ever since that
hospital spectacle,

00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:14.936 position:50% align:center
the Second Order's been
saying you're the real Saint.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.312 position:50% align:center
[SEI sighs]

00:23:16.396 --> 00:23:18.732 position:50% align:center
Apparently, they're also
far from being the only ones

00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:20.984 position:50% align:center
in the kingdom
with that opinion.

00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:26.448 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:27.782 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Thankfully,

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:31.494 position:50% align:center
we'll know if those rumors
hold water soon enough.

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:35.206 position:50% align:center
You see, I've just received a
missive from the Royal Assembly.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.458 position:50% align:center
Seems they're finally ready

00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:38.918 position:50% align:center
to have your abilities
officially Appraised.

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:41.254 position:50% align:center
Sei, they'd like to evaluate you

00:23:41.338 --> 00:23:44.341 position:50% align:center
to see if you are,
indeed, the Saint.
