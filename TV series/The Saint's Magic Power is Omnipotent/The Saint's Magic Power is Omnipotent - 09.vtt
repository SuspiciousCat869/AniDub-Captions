What a spectacular display!

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.267 position:50% align:center
I'd borne witness to the
Saint's very presence leading

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.270 position:50% align:center
to a vast reduction of an area's
monster population before,

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.147 position:50% align:center
but the Saint
completely eradicating

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.732 position:50% align:center
an entire swarm
of them instantly

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
is something else entirely!

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
Not to mention the
fact that you also

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
dissipated the miasma
that spawned said monsters!

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.574 position:50% align:center

Jeez, take it easy.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
But now, we must
explore this further,

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:44.669 position:50% align:center
delve much deeper!

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
Ah. Sure, if you say so.

Oh, fret not, Sei.

Sorry, I couldn't resist.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.649 position:50% align:center
Thank you for all you did today.

I didn't do it on
purpose, though;

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center
it all just kinda happened!

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
It must weigh on you to possess
such formidable magic powers.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:28.046 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad...
that you are you.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
Uh, thank you.

Did you her about her
latest feat on that mission?

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
Yes. I did.

still have faith in that,

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center

It's just that...
I don't know...

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
Everyone's been acting so
strange around me lately.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
Indeed, considering the

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
around the Palace.

I'm sorry.

I wish I had the power
to grant your every desire,

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center

The truth is your life will only

get more complicated
from now on.

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
So, I guess

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
I probably won't be able to live
here very much longer, will I?

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.417 position:50% align:center

to join the Knights

You mean in the countryside?

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN] The capital
is hardly the only place

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center

Something wrong?

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
Maybe it would be better

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
if I just transferred to
the Royal Magi Assembly.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN chuckles]
I don't see why you should.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
The countryside's a resource,

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50% align:center
teeming with unique herbs
and potion recipes.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
Treating your extended tour
as a chance to study them,

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
leaves no reason I can find

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
that you couldn't remain
with the Institute.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
You sure about that?

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center

say that you could?

[SEI] Well, I have
no idea how to cast it,

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
so I don't know
how to answer that.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
Well, that's partly my fault.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
If only I'd been paying closer
attention to you when you cast.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50% align:center
Not at all! There's no
reason for you to feel bad.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
Even so, I regret missing

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
the opportunity to
verify your conjury.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
Had I been more observant,
this would not be happening.

[SEI]
What he really means is that

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
I could be casting it
willy-nilly for him.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
Perhaps next time.
Why not end here, shall we?

[sighs]

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
[SEI] By the way,
why did you decide to

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center
have our lesson
at the palace today?

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
I simply thought a change
of scenery might spur--

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center

I'm sorry, Your Highness,

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
but, if you keep this up,
it will be to her detriment.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center

to care about her,

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
but I know your true motive.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, Your Highness?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
Please don't play dumb with me.
I'm aware you've been trying to

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
get Aira away
from me at all costs.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
That isn't true. I have no
idea what you might be implying.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50% align:center
This is awkward.

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:22.132 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
It's quite obvious.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
You want to isolate her
because you're jealous.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
Jealous?

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
[KYLE] Hm. Of course.
After all, you are my fiancée

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
so I can imagine her being
constantly at my side

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
is upsetting for you.

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
[scoffs] Really. Well,

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:42.569 position:50% align:center
if I did find that upsetting,
why not acquiesce to my request,

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.863 position:50% align:center
if only to keep up appearances?

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's not
lost on you all

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
how ungentlemanly it is
for a betrothed man

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
to devote the majority of
his time to another woman.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
It's my duty!

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
I supervised the Summoning
Ritual, so I am responsible!

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
As the one who summoned
her without warning,

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
I'm obligated to keep
Aira out of harm's way.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
I've no qualms about my
behavior, nor should I.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
And yet, Aira is
not the only woman

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
you summoned here
from another world.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:12.515 position:50% align:center
Why don't you feel obligated
to take responsibility for Sei?

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, Sei,
the talk of the palace.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
Because she is not the Saint.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
Excuse me?

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
Our people want to see
their Saint joining in

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
on important expeditions,

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
and therefore I presume

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
they felt they had to send
someone to appease the masses.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
Make no mistake, Your Highness,
I say this with all due respect.

Pardon me, Liz,

continue your discussion,

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center
perhaps you could in private?

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.277 position:50% align:center
Father--

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50% align:center
I'm appalled my son lacks the
decorum to restrain himself,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
giving his
foolishness free reign.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
To add insult to injury,

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
you've disrespected the Saint,
like an insolent child.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
[exhales] You've got
it all backwards.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
I'm not the culprit.
These two have disrespected me.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Oh? Are you calling me a liar?

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.720 position:50% align:center
I just heard you accuse the
Saint of being an impostor.

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
Is it not true?

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
She's indeed a fraud--
one you yourself created.

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
What gave you that impression?

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.605 position:50% align:center
I did supervise
the ritual, remember?

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
Only Aira was summoned--

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Untrue.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
The Lady Sei was also summoned
here during the ritual.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED] I could have
forgiven you this oversight

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
if you had let it go,

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
but since then, countless
reports have confirmed

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
that two women were summoned.

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.623 position:50% align:center
Your willful ignorance
of that fact is inexcusable.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:42.999 position:50% align:center
Father--

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center
Grand Magus Drewes'
appraisals support the claims.

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
Lady Sei is undeniably
the true Saint.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
You would do well to accept it.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Wait, seriously?

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Mm-hm.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50% align:center
Many others agree, as well.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
Commander Hawke, for one.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
His report from his Order's
recent expedition

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
states Lady Sei fulfilled
her Saintly duties

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
and quite brilliantly.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
Other reports from
the Second Order Knights

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
corroborate his statement.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
I know that you were
responsible for the ritual,

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
and, therefore, feel it's your
duty to keep Lady Aira safe.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
But do you not see how

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.910 position:50% align:center
you've failed to do
the same for Lady Sei?

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
You've neglected your duty
and labeled her an impostor.

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
After all that Lady Sei has
done in service to the kingdom,

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
how dare you treat her this way?

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center
As for Lady Aira,
what has she achieved?

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
[AIRA gasps]

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.217 position:50% align:center
She's achieved nothing, or at
least nothing notable enough

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
to warrant an
official statement.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
So, why do you
insist that she's the Saint?

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
And why, when you
have no evidence,

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
do you accuse Lady Sei
of being an impostor?

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.854 position:50% align:center
Don't answer; we shall
continue this discussion

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
somewhere more appropriate.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
Lady Ashley, as this began with
you,

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
might you join us in that
conversation?

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
Lady Sei, I shall
attend you later.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll forgive
my son's impertinence.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center
Yes, Majesty.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
[AIRA]
Um, excuse me.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Lady Aira.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Hmm.

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
I believe I understand now.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
Is there anything else
I ought to know?

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
There's not.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
The fault rests squarely on me.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
I accept responsibility.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
I'm prepared to endure whatever
punishment you deem fit.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
But I would ask that you
promise me only one thing.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
And what would that be?

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
True, Aira Misono
is not the Saint.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
We're all well
aware of that now.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center
She was only ever considered

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
to be the Saint because
I insisted she was.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:55.924 position:50% align:center
As such, please allow her
to live life as she chooses.

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.550 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Hm. Very well.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
I will honor and protect
her freedom and agency.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
You have my word, son.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
I thank you, Father.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
Now, then, as for the
appropriate punishment

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:07.185 position:50% align:center
for this offense,

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
Kyle Salutania and his
associated companions

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
are to be placed
under house arrest.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
Aira's care will be
the responsibility

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
of Second Prince Rayne,
who will monitor her, as well.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
I would be most grateful

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
if you would assist him in
that regard, Lady Ashley.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
That is, if you're willing.

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
Of course, Your Majesty.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED] Hm. I have
nothing further to discuss.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.840 position:50% align:center
I think you planned for
this to happen all along.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
Whatever do you mean?

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
No matter what happened,
you knew Lady Aira

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
was always going to
be labeled as no more

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
than an impostor.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
But by embroiling her
in your foolish antics,

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
she instead appears a victim,
so no one will openly mock her.

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
Your behavior was intentionally
crude, but also kind.

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
Willing to cast yourself
in an uncomplimentary light

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
if it meant squashing
criticism of her.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.245 position:50% align:center
You needn't flatter me. Please.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
I'm nothing more than a selfish,
brash, imprudent prince.

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:12.417 position:50% align:center
If that's truly the case,

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
then I'll make sure to
remember that henceforth.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Liz.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
Your pet name for me?
Haven't heard that in a while.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Please take care of Aira.

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
[LIZ] Of course I will--
you needn't even ask.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
If only he weren't so awkward.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
I shudder at the mere thought--

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
my son making such
a fool of himself?

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
He is honest, though,
that can be a virtue.

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED chuckles]

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time,
you two were very much alike.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know it.
Please don't remind me.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.307 position:50% align:center
[AIRA gasps]

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
Hello and good day to you, Sei!

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.480 position:50% align:center
Hello and good day to you.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
And you, too!

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
I guess we should start with
a proper introduction, huh.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:23.321 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'm Misono Aira.

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.491 position:50% align:center
It's so nice to meet you, too.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
I'm Takanashi Sei.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I'd better say something.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
Jeez, I don't know how
to talk to girls her age.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
Well, it would appear that

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.181 position:50% align:center
you have officially been
canonized as the Saint.

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.809 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Right out with it.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
[LIZ giggles]
Have you decided

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
what you're going to
do about your work?

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
I can stay with the
Institute.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
Oh, good! I'm so
delighted to hear that!

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
I was thinking that I would love
to know more about you do there!

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you, Aira?

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
Yes, uh...

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
So you've been working at the
palace I guess, Takanashi- <i>san</i> ?

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
Sort of. I work at the Medicinal
Flora Research Institute

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:17.000 position:50% align:center
studying potion-making.

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center
[AIRA grunts]

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:21.921 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I have no idea
what I'm going to do now.

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
I really wish things didn't
have to change, but, I get it.

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not
like I've done much.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
Well, is there anything
you'd like to do, Misono- <i>san</i> ?

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
I'm not really sure.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
If I could, I do know
that I'd love to keep

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
studying magic
and stuff like that.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
I have an idea.

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
Why don't you join up with
the Royal Magi Assembly?

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
What a spectacular notion!

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
Aira is a supremely
talented mage--

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
why, mages with her
abilities only come around

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.037 position:50% align:center
once every other century or so!

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
[AIRA]
What? Liz!

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
Now you're embarrassing me.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.543 position:50% align:center
No, you'd fit right
in at the Assembly.

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
What are you waiting for?

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
But do you really think
that they'll accept me?

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, without
a shadow of a doubt!

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:08.927 position:50% align:center
Because, on top
of all your talent,

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.637 position:50% align:center
you're an extremely hard worker!

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.056 position:50% align:center
[AIRA grunts]

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
And, you know, if you join, I
would get to see you more often,

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center
so that's another upside,
dontcha think?

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
[AIRA]
Huh?

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
I am there a lot learning
from the Grand Magus.

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.066 position:50% align:center
He gives me lessons.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
Who knows, we might get
to take some together.

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
And then have tea or hang out
after, before I head back.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
[AIRA] Mm! Yeah,
I would really enjoy that!

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
Leaving me out, are you then?
I see how it is.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
You could always join
the Assembly, too, Liz.

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
How cruel of you to even
suggest that I could, Sei.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
[AIRA] Uh... Well, you could
certainly join us for tea.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
After all,

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
you're the first friend I made
over here in this world.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.426 position:50% align:center
Oh! Aira, that's sweet!

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.345 position:50% align:center
[AIRA laughs]

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.936 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED] The countryside
is as fraught as ever, then?

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
Yes. While things near the
capital have calmed somewhat,

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
we're still getting
petitions for aid.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:06.609 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Now that the previous dispute

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center
has been resolved,

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
it seems all have come to
recognize Lady Sei as the Saint.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
I've no doubt the noble lords
are all abuzz about it.

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
With people certain
the Saint is in our midst,

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
naturally, all regions
call for her help.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED] The region
most in need of assistance

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
is likely Klausner's Domain.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIC]
Indeed, given it is

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
the kingdom's largest
producer of medicinal herbs.

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center
Not only have they been hard-hit
by the miasma's monsters,

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
but their herb production has
decreased dramatically as well.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Hmm.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
[SEI humming]

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
Uh, Sei, are you
making potions again?

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
I'm worried.

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:51.154 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, don't freak out.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
I don't think
I'm "freaking out,"

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
and it's not you
I'm worried about either.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
It's that our herb supply
is critically low.

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center
Ahh...

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
Our stores are looking
pretty meager, huh.

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
Yes, due to all the import
restrictions on herbs

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
out of Klausner's Domain.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on,
Clausna's what now?

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
It's where they grow most
of the herbs we use, of course.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.720 position:50% align:center
Sometimes called the
"Alchemist's Holy Land."

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
Wow, I had no idea.

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN] Sei, Would you
mind bringing a spot of tea

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
up to my office?

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Yes, ser.

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center
Make sure it's to this
fine gentleman's liking.

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
That took forever, sorry.

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN] Why don't you
have some with us?

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Didn't you have
important matters to discuss?

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
No, we're all done with that.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT chuckles]

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.263 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I started staring at him again.

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
Uh, ahem. Try not to forget
about little old me over here.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT clears throat]

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
Ah, so, uh, what was it you
two needed to talk about today?

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
Al's going to be away

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
from the capital on
a mission for a while.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Huh?

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
It's true, I'm afraid.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
The monster presence near
the capital's decreased.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
I've been reassigned to the
countryside from here on out.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
Do you know where
you're headed to first?

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
To Klausner's Domain.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
Where all the herbs are grown?

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
Right. The palace must
want to do something about

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
our problematic herb shortage.

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
Might I ask when do you plan
to begin the journey out there?

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
Just about two weeks from today.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
In that case,

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure that
I'm ready to go before then.

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Wait, what do you mean?

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Huh?

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.272 position:50% align:center
Why would you need to
get ready before his departure?

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.191 position:50% align:center
Do you need to
prepare some potions?

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, that,
but also I need to pack.

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
I gotta bring clothes.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Clothes?

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
Are you planning
on joining them?

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Yeah, duh, didn't we
just have that conversation?

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
Oh, I suppose
that did just come up.

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
Though I'm surprised
you're so eager.

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, Klausner's Domain

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
is called the "Alchemist's
Holy Land," isn't it?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
Seems like a no-brainer.
So, you know...

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
I gotta see it.

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
I understand.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
You'd like to see
Klausner's Domain

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
to learn more about
herbs and the like.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Mm-hm.

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
I'm catching on.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center
There's a veritable
treasure trove

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:29.896 position:50% align:center
of herbology knowledge there--

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
some of which we lack
here in the capital.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can bring
some back to us.

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
And also, the Knights would
be stationed there a while.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
So then, does
that mean I can go?

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN chuckles]

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I'd be honored
if you'd join us.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
And, in fact, the palace
had already sent word

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
requesting that you
accompany this expedition.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
Hold on, did they really?

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
They did, but we were
initially opposed to it.

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
We were just discussing
how we could turn them down.

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:01.261 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] Our travels would
not be without danger.

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
And, after all,
your safety is paramount, Sei.

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
You're the Saint.

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
And also, if you're
unsuccessful,

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:10.895 position:50% align:center
some of the nobles will
have harsh words for you.

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
Oh, great.

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
Uh, there's one more thing
I should probably address.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center
You don't like
attention, do you?

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for causing
you so much trouble.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
No. We're sorry
for asking favors.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
That's right. You have
nothing to apologize for.

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
What's Klausner's Domain's
claim to fame again?

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Thinking back, ever
since I joined the Institute,

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
I haven't had very many bad
experiences at the palace.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
And I think I know why.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center
It's because they've been
protecting me like this.

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
Together, from behind the
scenes, without me knowing.

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
Thank you for all that you do.

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
Pardon? What's that?

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
Nothing, just thinking
out loud, as usual.

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:57.734 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.415 position:50% align:center
You can get a good view
of the city now, Sei.

00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:36.374 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:38.168 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:43.173 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
