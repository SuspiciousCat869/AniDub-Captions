Hm?

Tell me something. Can your

Why do you ask?

I was just thinking.

What?! I mean, sure, but--

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.784 position:50% align:center

It's improper for ladies

could you possibly put
some ice in there, maybe?

[JUDE] What?! You know you're
asking the impossible, right?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.469 position:50% align:center
The only ones who're able

I'll take that to mean you

I remember you told me you often

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.625 position:50% align:center
he wouldn't invite a woman
he wasn't interested in.

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Interested romantically?

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
Why are you shocked?
Was he cruel to you?

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
No, of course not!

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
He even helped me get down

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
from the carriage
when we got there.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
He was extremely attentive.

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
I guess I just thought that was

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
something the upper class
did for women!

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.476 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Well, yes, they do.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.936 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
See?

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
He also held my hand when we
were walking through town.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
He even bought me a little
souvenir on our way home.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
He did?

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
[SEI] It's the same
beautiful hair clasp

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
I noticed when we were in town,
but the stones are different.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Interesting.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
First, just so you know,

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
it is quite common for men to
help women down from carriages.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
Good to know.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.838 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
But... one thing's sure:

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
This isn't a souvenir. This is
a gift that means something.

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Then is it even
appropriate for me to accept it?

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
My advice is if you like it,
then you should keep it.

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.327 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
What a remarkable ornament!

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
Was it a present from someone?

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
Huh? How'd you know?

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50% align:center
[LIZ] It's a bit on the fancy
side for everyday use.

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
That's how I knew
it had to be a gift.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
Now, let me guess who it's from.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
Commander Hawke?

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps] No, seriously,
how'd you know that?!

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
Why, it honestly
couldn't be more obvious

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
when you think about it!

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
The stones in the ornament match
the color of his eyes exactly.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
I don't have
your eye for detail.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
No, it's just that it's
a fairly common custom here.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
Men will often give
the women they fancy

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
little items that match
the color of their eyes

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
so they'll think of them.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
But there's no way!

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
Commander Hawke
couldn't possibly--

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
My goodness, you're delightfully
cute when you blush!

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
I-I'm not used to
this kind of attention!

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
[LIZ giggles]

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
So it's enchanted?

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
Your hairpin's simply reacting
to your own magic power.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
What kind of enchantment is it?

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
Not sure.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
We'd need someone who
knows appraisal magic,

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
and there's no one
like that here.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
Well, that's too bad.

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
Sounds fascinating.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.231 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
So this accessory of
yours is enchanted, too.

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
[SEI] He totally knew
this whole time, didn't he?

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
Want to give it a try?

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
You're interested, yes?

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
Sure, but it can't
be that easy, can it?

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] Nuh-uh. Your problem's
going to be the cost.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
That, and very few people
have the knowledge to enchant.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
Right, lemme guess,

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.587 position:50% align:center
an enchanted item
costs a whole lot more

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
than an unenchanted one.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, substantially more.

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
Or you could learn...
if you want.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
[SEI giggles]

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
[SEI] So this is the
Royal Magi Assembly.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.070 position:50% align:center
[MAGE 3A]
Thank you for your patience.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
If you will, allow me to explain
the theory of enchantment.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
Please, by all means.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
[MAGE 3A]
First, one selects a focus.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
Then, they channel magic into it

00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
while thinking about
the desired enchantment.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
The possible effects
depend a great deal

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
on the caster's
elemental affinity,

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
as well as the quality of
the focus they've selected.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
What type of effect
would you like to imbue?

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Ooh, let me think.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:11.685 position:50% align:center
Is it possible to completely
resist one type of magic?

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:15.438 position:50% align:center
Ah! Good question.
Full resistance is difficult.

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
But if you're able to
cast holy affinity magic,

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
then you could enchant it
with a slight mitigation.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
Holy affinity magic.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
Sure, let's do that.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:27.867 position:50% align:center
Very well, as you wish.

00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
And, here, this focus
would be well-suited for it.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
[SEI] If I'm going through
the trouble of enchanting it,

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
I might as well make it
work against all affinities.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
I just gotta
concentrate on that.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I broke it?

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
--[MAGE 3A] What?
--[JOHAN] Yes, you sure did.

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center

[MAGE 3B]
Is everything okay?

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
Damage mitigation, yes?

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center
You tried to imbue it
against one affinity?

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
I assume that wasn't all you
tried to imbue it with, correct?

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
Not... exactly.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
Then what else did you attempt?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
I guess I just figured,
why mitigate against one type

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
when you could do it
for all of them?

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
Ah, now I see.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
That focus wasn't
strong enough for that.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center

00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
However, word of them has made
its way to the Knightly Orders.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:09.881 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
So the Orders have asked

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:12.342 position:50% align:center
for those enchantments
to be created for them.

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
Alas, our mages are
not equipped for this.

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:18.306 position:50% align:center
They're unable to produce some
of the requested enchantments--

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
the very ones you
successfully imbued.

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:23.853 position:50% align:center
The Orders were shocked

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
when they were told
that our most powerful mages

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
could only perform
the enchantments after

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:29.651 position:50% align:center
receiving help from an outsider.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
My apologies as I do hate
to impose upon you like this,

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
but might you be willing
to assist us once more?

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
Of course, no problem at all.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
Just this once, all right?

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center
And make sure to
pay her for her time.

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
You have my gratitude.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
[MAGE 3B sighs]

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Uhh...

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
[ERHART]
We start work early most days.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
Is it always this way
for the Royal Magi Assembly?

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
Not at all. But we were
told to fill the request

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
before their next expedition.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
that's happening quite soon.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Guess crunch-time
is a thing here, too.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
Who was it that made
such a large request?

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
Was it the Third
Order of Knights?

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.412 position:50% align:center
No, it's the First Order.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.622 position:50% align:center
I told the Assembly
not to mention you.

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
But someone's tongue
must have slipped.

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
That's why we had
to ask for your help.

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
I do hope you'll accept my
sincerest apologies for that.

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
I know it's not fair.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
Oh, no; it's totally fine.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:40.889 position:50% align:center
Leaving?

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
No, I just thought I should

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
probably go round up
a few potions.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
You should remain seated.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Really, it's okay.
They're for me, anyway.

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
There's no need for you
to carry such heavy items.

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
[ERHART]
Sei?

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
Sei?

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
Are you well?

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Oh, yes.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
[ERHART]
Hm.

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
[ERHART]
You've done so many.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
Easy. If all goes well,

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
I should finish them
for you by tomorrow.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center
[ERHART]
Appraise.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
[ERHART]
Appraise.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:37.070 position:50% align:center
Appraise.

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
[ERHART chuckles]

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
Brilliantly done.
I expected no less.

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
--[MAGE 3B] He's smiling!
--[MAGE 3C] It's a miracle!

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
[ERHART grumbles]

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
That was short-lived.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your help.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, but how would
you like to be compensated?

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
I have some thoughts.

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
[ERHART]
Hm?

00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:39.025 position:50% align:center
[inhales] Okay!

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.865 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:46.991 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Yes?

00:22:47.075 --> 00:22:48.326 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 3A]
Pardon me, Ser Commander,

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.453 position:50% align:center
but you have a visitor.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.834 position:50% align:center
It's you.

00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:57.585 position:50% align:center
What brings you by?

00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:59.671 position:50% align:center
Not much, I just made
some sweet treats.

00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:02.007 position:50% align:center
I thought you might enjoy some.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.800 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
You did? How kind--

00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:05.301 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway,

00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:06.845 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't want to interrupt
your work, so see ya around!

00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:07.595 position:50% align:center
Bye!

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:08.471 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:23:08.555 --> 00:23:10.640 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:23:10.724 --> 00:23:14.811 position:50% align:center
Oh, um... it's to
thank you for the gift.

00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:16.980 position:50% align:center
I had an opportunity
to learn enchantment

00:23:17.063 --> 00:23:18.982 position:50% align:center
while I was at the
Royal Magi Assembly,

00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:20.483 position:50% align:center
and they referred me
to a craftsman

00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:22.819 position:50% align:center
they apparently
partner with sometimes.

00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:26.072 position:50% align:center
The gem is enchanted to mitigate
magic damage of all affinities.

00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:29.743 position:50% align:center
I was thinking it might come in
handy on your next expedition--

00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:37.417 position:50% align:center
[SEI] That was the last
thing I could remember.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.420 position:50% align:center
I'm not even sure how
I got home after that.

00:23:40.503 --> 00:23:42.380 position:50% align:center
Or how I kept breathing.
