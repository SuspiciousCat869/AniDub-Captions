Really, is that so?

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
This small plot was only
recently prepared for us,

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
so nothing's actually
been planted yet.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
First, we wanted to make
sure the Saint's conjury

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.610 position:50% align:center
wouldn't harm any of the plants.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
Good point. I don't
believe it would cause harm,

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
but it's quite possible
that it could affect the soil.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center

what has this done to the soil?

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hmm. Hard to say.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
The power may have
flowed directly into the soil,

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
or it may have
imbued the minerals

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
within the soil with magic.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
Both seem just as
probable as the other.

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
But do understand that
those are only my hypotheses.

Yes, of course.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50% align:center
We'll need to perform

[YURI]
Hmm. About the Saint's conjury--

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
it seems to expend
quite a bit of your power.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
That's an understatement,
honestly.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
Yep. [sighs] I mean,
just look at me.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
You see how wiped I am after
casting it over and over.

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
Yes, but repetition
is the key to mastery.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
With more training
and diligent practice,

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
you should be able to wield it

What? Even faster than now?

now that I think about it,

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
I'm not convinced
that's possible

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50% align:center
since I have to prepare myself
before I can even cast it.
