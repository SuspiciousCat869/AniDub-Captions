00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.265 align:middle
[YURI] Yuri Drewes,
personal magic tutor!

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.767 align:middle
At your service, milady 

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.939 align:middle
You're gonna teach me magic?
Is that necessary?

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.441 align:middle
[YURI]
You'd prefer someone else?

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.068 align:middle
No! Sorry, that's
not what I meant.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:29.112 align:middle
It's just that I'll need to
start at the beginning

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.322 align:middle
and learn the
most basic of basics.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.116 align:middle
Surely, you have
better things to do

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.784 align:middle
than teach me remedial magic.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.703 align:middle
Oh, you needn't
worry about that.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:38.413 align:middle
Besides, I was in no way willing

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:41.249 align:middle
to entrust this task
to anyone else.

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.834 align:middle
Why's that?

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.462 align:middle
Because the Saint's
abilities are state secrets.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.964 align:middle
The kingdom has
officially deemed it so.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.467 align:middle
As such, it's best for
as few people as possible

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.093 align:middle
to know about what she can do.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.805 align:middle
That's not all of course.
I have one other reason.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:56.848 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:58.308 align:middle
Uhh...

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.686 align:middle
I'm anxious to do my own
research into your magic power.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.979 align:middle
Uh?

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.647 align:middle
[YURI] Don't worry;
the 'research' I speak of

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.233 align:middle
can be conducted by
observing your casts,

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:08.735 align:middle
so it won't require you to do

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.154 align:middle
anything special
or out of the ordinary.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle
Are you willing to help me, Sei?

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:18.495 align:middle
Of course! If that's all
you need, then why not?

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.997 align:middle
I'm ready to start learning!

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.931 align:middle
You're the Saint's
personal magic tutor?!

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.267 align:middle
What the--? Why?
Why should it be you?

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.643 align:middle
Simple!

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.563 align:middle
This will obviously give me
more time with her, yes?

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.273 align:middle
I'm so interested
in learning more

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.609 align:middle
about her mysterious powers!

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle
[ERHART grumbles]

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:16.321 align:middle
So there's no need for
a death glare from you.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:20.575 align:middle
I'm just hoping to have her cast
a few spells for me, that's all.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.285 align:middle
[sighs]

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.873 align:middle
[ERHART]
Yuri Drewes: magical researcher,

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:30.251 align:middle
and the greatest mage
in all the kingdom.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.878 align:middle
He spends very
little time on things

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.588 align:middle
that don't hold his interest,

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.882 align:middle
but the moment something
does stoke his curiosity,

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.884 align:middle
he's obsessed.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle
No harm will come to her.
You have my word.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.097 align:middle
Well, how could it?

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.015 align:middle
You and your brother
would have my hide,

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.143 align:middle
not to mention everyone
else in the kingdom.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.687 align:middle
[ERHART gasps]

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle
[ERHART]
If only he was trustworthy.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.029 align:middle
[YURI]
Now then,

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:00.115 align:middle
I'm sure you're tired
of learning theory.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.575 align:middle
Let's do some
practicals, shall we?

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.952 align:middle
[SEI]
Huh?

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.203 align:middle
[YURI]
You've received magic power

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:08.331 align:middle
from another caster before, yes?

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.417 align:middle
[SEI]
Yeah, one time at the Institute.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.587 align:middle
[YURI] Then today, I'd like you
to transfer power to me.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.802 align:middle
[SEI grunts]

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.138 align:middle
[YURI chuckles]

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.764 align:middle
[SEI]
Back off, dude.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.016 align:middle
Is there something wrong?

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.435 align:middle
[SEI]
Oh, no, sorry!

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:36.026 align:middle
[SEI]
Transfer power from my hand.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.284 align:middle
Good. There, you've done it.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.535 align:middle
Now again,

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.412 align:middle
but perhaps transferring
a bit more this time?

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle
[SEI]
Uh... Okay, I'll try.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.625 align:middle
[SEI]
Right. I can do that.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.011 align:middle
My...

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle
What? Did I do something wrong?

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:09.142 align:middle
No! Forgive me!
Your power's fascinating.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:10.643 align:middle
[SEI grunts]

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.314 align:middle
[SEI] Okay, but, come on,
what was with that weird grin?

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.484 align:middle
[YURI] As I'd expected,
your magic's unusual.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.153 align:middle
I've never seen anything
quite like it before.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.739 align:middle
It is aligned with
the holy affinity,

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle
but it's also aligned with
something else entirely.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:28.036 align:middle
Do you think that could be
why my potions are different?

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.497 align:middle
Since they're much more
powerful than the others.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.832 align:middle
[YURI]
I don't know enough to say yet.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.501 align:middle
Please, don't worry.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.337 align:middle
You and I will
figure it out as we go.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.631 align:middle
[SEI chuckles]

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:42.759 align:middle
[panting]

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.517 align:middle
Once you're better
at manipulating it,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.936 align:middle
you're greater control will
allow for quicker casting,

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle
you see?

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle
Let's do that again, yes?

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:58.108 align:middle
Okay!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.443 align:middle
Now, heal!

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:06.366 align:middle
[SEI]
Hm!

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.369 align:middle
All right, but this time,
could you do it a bit faster?

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.455 align:middle
[SEI] Uhh... Hard to say.
I mean, as much as I'd love it,

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.998 align:middle
I don't think I could possibly

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:16.167 align:middle
cast as fast as you
at this stage, Ser.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.628 align:middle
[YURI] Actually, you should
be able to do it that fast

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:21.006 align:middle
if you cast it
exactly as instructed.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.507 align:middle
[SEI grumbles]

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.675 align:middle
[SEI] Why would he put me
through the wringer like this

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.719 align:middle
when I just learned this stuff?

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.138 align:middle
I think I know the answer.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:31.725 align:middle
I'm already casting
slower than usual, so...

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:32.809 align:middle
Hmm.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.770 align:middle
[SEI grunts]

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle
[SEI] After I started taking
lessons from the Grand Magus,

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.985 align:middle
every now and then I'd stumble
across a weird scene.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.946 align:middle
The Grand Magus' training
is apparently so intense,

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.282 align:middle
that even the Assembly's
best and brightest

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.535 align:middle
are forced to admit
defeat after a day's work.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle
[SEI] So, there's no doubt
he's telling the truth

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.542 align:middle
when he says
he's going easy on me.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:00.628 align:middle
He must really believe
that I can do it if I try.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:01.963 align:middle
Which is nice, I guess?

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:05.342 align:middle
But try as I may,
I still can't seem to get it!

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.678 align:middle
C'mon, me!
Gotta practice harder!

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:17.896 align:middle
[sighs]

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.566 align:middle
[ALBERT]
Yes?

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle
[door opens]

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.529 align:middle
Sei. It's been a while.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:30.533 align:middle
Oh. Right. I guess
it really has been.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.078 align:middle
[SEI]
His smile is blindingly bright!

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.706 align:middle
Come in. Johan filled me in
on all the details.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.708 align:middle
So you'd like to practice
during our drills?

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle
That's right.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.879 align:middle
So far, I've only been healing
myself during my lessons,

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.964 align:middle
but now I'm ready
for a bigger challenge,

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:48.093 align:middle
like perhaps casting in
a more practical situation.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.469 align:middle
I see.

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.179 align:middle
That makes perfect sense.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.306 align:middle
And yes, we'd be
honored to help you.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.433 align:middle
Thank you so much!

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:58.144 align:middle
[SEI gasps]

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.021 align:middle
You look thin. You all right?

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:01.439 align:middle
[SEI]
Uh, yeah?

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.024 align:middle
I mean, I don't think
I've lost weight or anything,

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:06.152 align:middle
but, yeah, I'm doing okay.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.571 align:middle
[SEI]
Is he really still touching me?

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.741 align:middle
Grand Magus Drewes'
lessons must be intense.

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.576 align:middle
Please don't push
past your limit.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.662 align:middle
Oh! Don't worry, I'm not!

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.038 align:middle
[SEI] You're kinda
pushing past the limits

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.457 align:middle
of my heart right now, though!

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.796 align:middle
[SEI grunts]

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.011 align:middle
[ALBERT chuckles]

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:34.597 align:middle
[SEI grunts]
Um, awkward.

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.599 align:middle
[laughs] My apologies.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.810 align:middle
I'm just happy to see you
now that you're back.

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:40.854 align:middle
[SEI grunts]

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:51.489 align:middle
Beginning today,

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:54.617 align:middle
a healer will be assisting
with our training exercises.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:58.288 align:middle
It'll be an excellent way to
make them feel more realistic.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.082 align:middle
Lady Sei here will be
providing the healing spells.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.001 align:middle
Many of you know her
from our past expedition

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:04.753 align:middle
or meeting her at the hospital.

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:08.006 align:middle
Those who don't, trust me, I do.

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle
That's all! Begin the exercise!

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.594 align:middle
[KNIGHTS]
Yes, sir!

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.269 align:middle
[exhales]

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:25.607 align:middle
[SEI giggles]

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.322 align:middle
Now, heal!

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.701 align:middle
My, how magnificent!

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.829 align:middle
You've obviously
made a lot of progress.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.831 align:middle
Thank you, Grand Magus!

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.416 align:middle
I'm impressed.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.419 align:middle
You've improved far faster than
I ever imagined or anticipated.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.255 align:middle
I assume you've been practicing
outside of our lessons, then?

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.007 align:middle
[SEI]
Uh, just a little.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.135 align:middle
That's excellent.
What are your personal goals?

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.262 align:middle
[SEI]
Oof, there's a question.

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:57.639 align:middle
Well, I think I'm supposed to

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.517 align:middle
eventually accompany
the Knights on expeditions.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.394 align:middle
Unless I'm mistaken?

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:03.687 align:middle
Are you in earnest?

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.856 align:middle
You intend to join
the Knights on expeditions?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.441 align:middle
Wait. I mean,

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle
isn't that why I've been doing
all this practical training?

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.198 align:middle
[SEI]
Was... Was that not it?

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle
[YURI] Well, no. That was
certainly never my intention,

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.077 align:middle
Lady Sei.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.203 align:middle
[SEI]
Then I don't get it.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.664 align:middle
Why have you been
training me so hard?

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:24.416 align:middle
[YURI] One reason
my lessons have been aimed at

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:27.669 align:middle
developing your practical skills
is that I believe every mage

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.296 align:middle
should build and establish
control over their casts.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.631 align:middle
The other reason,

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.049 align:middle
and I've mentioned this before,

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.469 align:middle
is that I wish to study
your abilities and your power.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:39.514 align:middle
[SEI] Ugh! Do I really
have to be studied?

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:43.184 align:middle
I mean, yeah, okay,
he did warn me, but still!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.769 align:middle
You're right, though.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:48.398 align:middle
You may well be asked to assist
with expeditions in the future.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.774 align:middle
[SEI gasps]

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:51.401 align:middle
The Assembly does
have a few mages

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle
who can assist Knights in the
field with holy-attribute magic.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.574 align:middle
But none as skilled
with it as you are.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.535 align:middle
I can cast it as well,
but when I join expeditions,

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle
I tend to assist primarily
with offensive magic.

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:05.582 align:middle
And did you know?

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.335 align:middle
The next expedition will
be to the Western Woods.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.794 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.176 align:middle
[SEI]
Hmm...

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:17.552 align:middle
[YURI]
Don't be alarmed.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.803 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.138 align:middle
You'd be fine

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.016 align:middle
because I would accompany
you on that expedition.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.434 align:middle
[SEI]
Huh...

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.729 align:middle
You can trust me. I'll ensure
no harm comes to you.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.148 align:middle
I will keep you safe.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.359 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:34.527 align:middle
[SEI] Oh, jeez.
If he were any other guy,

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle
my heart would be
racing like crazy by now.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.366 align:middle
But the unspoken reason
for that promise was

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.827 align:middle
"because I really need you
for my studies, Lady Sei".

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.288 align:middle
Ugh. Lucky me.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.759 align:middle
[SEI groans]

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.053 align:middle
[SEI]
I gotta get up...

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.308 align:middle
[SEI]
...'cause this is a "Lady Day."

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:07.727 align:middle
Well, that's what
I call 'em, anyway.

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:09.562 align:middle
On Lady Days, I spend my time

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.898 align:middle
learning about things
like etiquette and dancing--

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.901 align:middle
stuff court ladies
are s'posed to know.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.279 align:middle
[grunts]

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.327 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:28.373 align:middle
Welcome, Lady Sei,
and a very good morning.

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.337 align:middle
[SEI grumbles]

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.965 align:middle
All right, now, here we go.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.758 align:middle
[MARIE yells]

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:42.887 align:middle
[SEI groans]

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.016 align:middle
You're doing great. Just be
patient a little while longer.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.642 align:middle
[MAIDS]
Hm!

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.769 align:middle
[SEI groans]

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:52.022 align:middle
[MARIE]
You all right, My Lady?

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle
[SEI]
Yeah...

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.192 align:middle
But I've wondered
this for a while.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.652 align:middle
Why do I have to dress up?

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle
For these lessons, I mean.
Is it necessary?

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.782 align:middle
It's to get you accustomed
to dressing this way.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:05.076 align:middle
Wearing a gown is a skill.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.747 align:middle
[INSTRUCTOR 06A] One, two,
three. One, two, three.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.548 align:middle
Keep that back straight now!

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.175 align:middle
[door opens]

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:26.348 align:middle
Oh, no. My apologies. I thought
you'd already finished.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:27.849 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:30.435 align:middle
Why, hello. What a pleasure
to see you, Commander Hawke.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.312 align:middle
How can we be of help?

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:35.398 align:middle
I just came to see how
she's doing. May I watch?

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.733 align:middle
But of course!

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.361 align:middle
In fact, would you like
to join her on the floor?

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.197 align:middle
It's good to practice
with other partners.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.449 align:middle
Keeps one on their tip-toes.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.825 align:middle
[SEI]
Oh, I'm sure.

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:48.578 align:middle
I'm just a little nervous.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:49.788 align:middle

Don't be.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.708 align:middle
May I?

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.043 align:middle
[SEI]
Uh...

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.466 align:middle
[SEI]
Okay.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.862 align:middle
[INSTRUCTOR 06A]
That was lovely, both of you.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:07.574 align:middle
And on that note, I think
we'll conclude today's lesson.

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:10.994 align:middle
[sighs]

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:13.872 align:middle
Just me. May I sit with you?

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:16.499 align:middle
Um, of course!

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.043 align:middle
I heard something about you.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle
You'd never danced
until you came here.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.629 align:middle
Yes, that's right.

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.214 align:middle
Remarkable.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.425 align:middle
When I started,
I was a disaster.

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.052 align:middle
I couldn't dance
half as well as you.

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.387 align:middle
Well, I think my teacher
rushed my lessons

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.973 align:middle
since the social season's
coming up soon and all.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:33.224 align:middle
That makes sense.

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:35.226 align:middle
The capital loves
a formal dinner.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.188 align:middle
I have no doubt you'll be
invited to a few of them...

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.065 align:middle
...whether you actually
want to or not.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:41.649 align:middle

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.151 align:middle
Same here. Hah.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:46.321 align:middle

that social requirement.

They will invite me, though.
I mean, I dread going,

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:14.933 align:middle

[SEI] Sorry, yes.
I was just lost in thought.

If you really wouldn't mind,

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:44.254 align:middle
Yes, indeed.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.131 align:middle
So that's your etiquette
assignment for the day.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle
You shall attend that tea party

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.884 align:middle
and apply everything
you've learned so far.

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:51.761 align:middle
[SEI]
Hm.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.472 align:middle
I don't see a name
on the envelope.

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.684 align:middle
Miss Marie, do you know
whose crest this is?

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.395 align:middle
That would be Marquis
Ashley. It's his crest.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle
His house is
prominent on its own.

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle
But now, in addition to that,

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:06.693 align:middle
his daughter is also engaged
to the crown prince, Kyle.

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.987 align:middle

Prince Kyle?

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.697 align:middle

[MARIE]
Uh?

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:14.993 align:middle
[SEI] But why would
someone so high-ranking

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:19.372 align:middle
invite me to hang out?
At an intimate little tea party?

[LIZ giggles]

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.896 align:middle
[LIZ] Thank you for
coming to my tea party!

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.732 align:middle
I didn't know your

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:48.234 align:middle
[LIZ] That's strange;
did I not tell you?

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:50.653 align:middle
[SEI] Oh, right,
her last name's Ashley.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.947 align:middle
Go me, just piecing
that together.

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:54.324 align:middle
[LIZ]
Anyway, I've noticed that

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle
you haven't been coming
into library at all lately.

[chuckles]

00:17:58.453 --> 00:17:59.537 align:middle
[LIZ]
So when my teacher said

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.081 align:middle
they were planning
an assignment for you,

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:03.917 align:middle
I was only too happy to help!

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.173 align:middle
It smells just wonderful!

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:13.426 align:middle
Oh, thank goodness
you like it. I'm so glad!

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.222 align:middle
Now for the gossip!
I've been hearing

00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:20.392 align:middle
lots of fascinating stories
about the Lady Saint as of late.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:23.603 align:middle
[SEI]
Uh! Really? Like what?

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:24.979 align:middle
Oh, yes!

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:27.148 align:middle
Like that she's quite adept at
using healing magic,

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:28.483 align:middle
and that recently,

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.694 align:middle
she even saved the lives
of several of our knights.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:34.072 align:middle
Heh! How nice! She sounds great!

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle
I agree.

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.534 align:middle
I also heard that some of the
knights even regard her

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:41.079 align:middle
in such high esteem now that
they refer to her as a goddess!

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.331 align:middle
Wow.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:45.792 align:middle
[LIZ] Goodness, Sei, I knew
you were a little different,

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle
but I didn't know you were so
talented at magic.

00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:52.382 align:middle
[SEI chuckles]

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.802 align:middle
[LIZ giggles]

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:59.764 align:middle
Joking aside, I believe
that magic is new to you.

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle
Just since you arrived
in our world, correct?

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:03.601 align:middle
Yeah, that's right.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:06.646 align:middle
We don't actually have
magic where I come from.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:07.647 align:middle
Huh? Wait.

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:11.067 align:middle
How... How long have you known

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:13.737 align:middle
that I was summoned
here from another world?

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.697 align:middle
From the very beginning.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.948 align:middle
I had already heard

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:18.283 align:middle
what the woman who was
Summoned looked like,

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.617 align:middle
so when I met you,

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.536 align:middle
it wasn't difficult to
put two and two together.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:24.247 align:middle
You fit the
description perfectly.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.957 align:middle
That's how I identified
the other girl

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.376 align:middle
who was Summoned, too.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.338 align:middle
[SEI]
You've met her, then?

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:34.174 align:middle
Yes, I couldn't help it since
she attends the Royal Academy,

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:35.842 align:middle
as I do.

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.594 align:middle
[SEI]
Is she in your class?

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:38.928 align:middle
She's not.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.972 align:middle
She ended up being placed
in the year above mine.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.682 align:middle
[SEI]
Oh, I see.

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:49.022 align:middle
Well, good I guess.
I hope she's doing all right.

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:51.566 align:middle
Yes, I suppose
she's well enough.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:55.612 align:middle
She appears to be in good
health, at the very least.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:56.488 align:middle
[SEI]
Mm...

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:58.573 align:middle
Do you remember that classmate

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.784 align:middle
I introduced you to
a little while back?

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:02.869 align:middle
The one who was troubled?

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.996 align:middle
[SEI] Right, you said
there was some new student

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.542 align:middle
who was drawing the
attention of her fiancé. Oh.

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.671 align:middle
Wait, are you saying that
the new student is Aira?

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:17.801 align:middle
Is that it?

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.261 align:middle
[LIZ] We've tried to
address the situation,

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:24.057 align:middle
but unfortunately, nothing comes
of it, no matter what is said.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.934 align:middle
Ah...

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:28.186 align:middle
[LIZ] Why? Has something
occurred to you?

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:31.690 align:middle
Well, it's just that, in the
world Aira and I are from,

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.525 align:middle
a country called Japan,

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:35.402 align:middle
we don't actually
have the same kinds of

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:38.113 align:middle
social customs that you
all have developed here.

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:41.408 align:middle
Japan is a lot more
socially relaxed.

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:42.742 align:middle
[LIZ]
Hm?

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.912 align:middle
For example, my skirt.
Remember that incident?

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.706 align:middle
Fanning my legs?

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:50.125 align:middle
You got so upset with me.

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:51.459 align:middle
In the same vein,

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.503 align:middle
she probably doesn't
realize that making friends

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:57.841 align:middle
with a young man who's "taken"
isn't considered "proper" here.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.676 align:middle
[SEI] Being engaged
when you're that young

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.886 align:middle
isn't normal in Japan, either.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.888 align:middle
No wonder it
wouldn't occur to her.

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:07.058 align:middle
Yes, I suppose
that might be true.

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:10.145 align:middle
But, hey! You've helped teach
me what's acceptable here.

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:12.147 align:middle
Maybe if those boys
explained things to her then--

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.732 align:middle
I doubt that they would, though.

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:15.233 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle
If there truly were such a
gentleman in her little circle,

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.739 align:middle
then it wouldn't be
a problem in the first place.

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:23.867 align:middle
[SEI gasps]
Back up just a minute.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.744 align:middle
I want to make
sure I understand.

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:28.621 align:middle
Do you think your fiancé
is one of her admirers?

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:29.914 align:middle
[LIZ]
Yes.

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:31.791 align:middle
Hold on. Does that mean...?

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:33.293 align:middle
Is your fiancé...?

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.669 align:middle
That's right.

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:37.088 align:middle
I'm engaged to Prince Kyle.

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:39.507 align:middle
[SEI]
Girl, no...

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:40.759 align:middle
And on top of that,

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.719 align:middle
I heard that he
was unspeakably rude

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:44.929 align:middle
to you when you first arrived.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:46.973 align:middle
[SEI]
Uh?

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:50.518 align:middle
[LIZ] Sei, I'd like
to apologize for him.

00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:53.146 align:middle
You didn't deserve it.
Nobody deserves it.

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:56.066 align:middle
Thank you, but you don't
have to apologize, Liz.

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:57.525 align:middle
[LIZ]
I know, but...

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:00.487 align:middle
It's fine.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.114 align:middle
What he did had
nothing to do with you.

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:05.784 align:middle
Thank you.

00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:08.411 align:middle
You're a good friend, Sei.

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:11.206 align:middle
[SEI] Nuff o' that! I wanna hear
more about the Royal Academy!

00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle
What kind of stuff do you do?
