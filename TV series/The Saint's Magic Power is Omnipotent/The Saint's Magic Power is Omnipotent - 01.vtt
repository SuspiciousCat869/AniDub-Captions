00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:52.676 position:50% align:center
To the Medicinal Flora
Research Institute.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.512 position:50% align:center
I was really into plants
and medicinal herbs before

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:56.722 position:50% align:center
when I lived in my world.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
Oh, so that's where
you've been wandering.

00:09:58.724 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
Although the
Research Institute is

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:02.603 position:50% align:center
quite a distance
from here, is it not?

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh...

00:10:05.147 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
[SEI] She's got a point.
It's pretty far.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.903 position:50% align:center
Wait. You live
at the Institute?

00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:13.363 position:50% align:center
I do. We are a fair
distance from the palace

00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:15.782 position:50% align:center
and even further away
from the Capital.

00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:18.660 position:50% align:center
There's a handful of us
who just prefer to live here.

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:19.953 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:21.747 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN grunts]

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
Hello there, Miss Sei.
It's good to see you.

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:27.169 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello. Thanks for
letting me visit again.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to come
visit us here anytime.

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
Well, Ser Director,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.926 position:50% align:center
Miss Sei just said she'd like
to live here at the Institute.

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.968 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:36.762 position:50% align:center
Well then, what
do you think about

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.347 position:50% align:center
officially becoming
a researcher?

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:43.519 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Whoa, if that's allowed,
then yeah, absolutely.

00:10:43.602 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
But it can't possibly be that
easy to become a researcher.

00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:48.899 position:50% align:center
The thing is, though,

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:51.151 position:50% align:center
if I'm coming here all the time
just to keep myself busy,

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.861 position:50% align:center
I might as well
make it official.

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
It's better than sitting around
bored all the time, anyway.

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.533 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's way
more interesting

00:10:57.616 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
to live here than at the palace.

00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:04.498 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I'd like that! I'll do it!

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:05.958 position:50% align:center
Be a researcher!

00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:07.543 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
Uhh...

00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
If that's what you want,
then great!

00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:12.089 position:50% align:center
I'll sort out all the details.

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
[SEI squeals]

00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:16.927 position:50% align:center
Well, no time to
waste then, I guess!

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
I'll see you later on, roomie!

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.226 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Miss Marie!

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:28.939 position:50% align:center
That's quite all
right with us, Sei.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.649 position:50% align:center
Wait, so no one
here would object?

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.150 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:34.236 position:50% align:center
In fact, someone from the
Institute already stopped by.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.530 position:50% align:center
We discussed the particulars
and have both agreed.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.781 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:40.409 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Well, they work
fast, don't they?

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:41.869 position:50% align:center
On behalf of us all,

00:11:41.952 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
I'd like to apologize for
causing you so much trouble,

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
so we're more than
happy to accommodate you.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
Wow! That means so much to me!

00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:53.714 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Here you are.

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.841 position:50% align:center
Inside this case
you'll find every item

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.594 position:50% align:center
you had on your person
when you arrived in our world.

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.721 position:50% align:center
And as for the
rest of your effects,

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.724 position:50% align:center
they've already been transported
to your room at the Institute.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.435 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much
for everything, truly.

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
Should you ever need anything,

00:12:08.187 --> 00:12:10.898 position:50% align:center
please don't hesitate
to reach out to us.

00:12:10.981 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
I will. Thank you again!

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
Safe travels to you!

00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:20.866 position:50% align:center
[SEI sighs]

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHERS gasp]

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:32.169 position:50% align:center
Hello, everybody,
my name is Sei.

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.879 position:50% align:center
I'll be joining you.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.506 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you all!

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:39.051 position:50% align:center
Very well then, who should
I task with your orientation?

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.427 position:50% align:center
Jude, are you up for that?

00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:42.304 position:50% align:center
Wait, you want me to do it?

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:43.347 position:50% align:center
You're the one who brought her

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.598 position:50% align:center
into this whole mess,
aren't you?

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
working with you.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
I as well.

00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center
Should be fun.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.613 position:50% align:center
First, I guess I should
explain what it is we do here.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.073 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:05.035 position:50% align:center
As I said before, our main
focus is on medicinal herbs,

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
and on the potions that
make use of their effects.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
Here's a typical potion.

00:13:10.082 --> 00:13:11.542 position:50% align:center
Its uses are vast;

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:14.545 position:50% align:center
it can revitalize wounds or
serve as an antidote to venom,

00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
whether ingested or applied
externally as first aid.

00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
So why don't we try
making one, yes?

00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:22.094 position:50% align:center
Yes, please!

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.805 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
First, we fill a pot with water.

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
And bring that to a light boil.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.857 position:50% align:center
For the next step, we add
some fresh herbs to the water.

00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:40.654 position:50% align:center
Then, once that's heated
to the right temperature,

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.198 position:50% align:center
we imbue it with magic power.

00:13:43.282 --> 00:13:46.702 position:50% align:center
And how do you imbue it
with magic power exactly?

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.663 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
Miss Sei, are you telling me
you've never used magic before?

00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:56.712 position:50% align:center
No, never.

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
Not even for cantrips?

00:13:58.839 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
And those are...?

00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
[JUDE gasps]

00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
It's all right to be a beginner!

00:14:03.302 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
And it's good for me
to practice basics.

00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:07.264 position:50% align:center
So then...

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:17.441 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
There! One potion.

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:18.442 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:19.610 position:50% align:center
To be perfectly candid,

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
I can only make
low-grade potions now.

00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
But still, you can use magic,

00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
which is a lot more
than I can say!

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:26.450 position:50% align:center
It's incredible!

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.869 position:50% align:center
Oh, you really think so?

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:30.454 position:50% align:center
In any case,
you should start off

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.539 position:50% align:center
by learning to cast
magic yourself.

00:14:32.623 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
Lend me your hands.

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:35.626 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm?

00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:38.921 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:41.757 position:50% align:center
Allow me to channel some
of my magic power over to you.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.301 position:50% align:center
Concentrate on
receiving the current.

00:14:45.511 --> 00:14:47.846 position:50% align:center
Ready, here it comes.

00:14:55.312 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I feel

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
an odd, tingly feeling,

00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:00.317 position:50% align:center
like energy coursing
through my veins.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.361 position:50% align:center
Yes! That's the magic!

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:05.113 position:50% align:center
You felt it so quickly.
You're a natural at this!

00:15:05.197 --> 00:15:06.532 position:50% align:center
Oh. I don't think so.

00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
It must be because you're
such a good teacher, Jude.

00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:10.369 position:50% align:center
[JUDE chuckles]

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:11.870 position:50% align:center
I think you're ready to make
your potion! Let's try!

00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:12.913 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.248 position:50% align:center
But shouldn't
I study more first?

00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:15.666 position:50% align:center
No, you're going to be fine.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
It won't explode if
you make a mistake,

00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:18.836 position:50% align:center
so there's no need to worry.

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:20.671 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Are you sure?

00:15:26.844 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Just imagine
that flow from before.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
Visualize it
pouring into the pot.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]
Hold on. I forgot to ask.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.860 position:50% align:center
How much magic power
am I supposed to add?

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:45.112 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Oh, jeez.

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.948 position:50% align:center
I wonder if this is enough.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.867 position:50% align:center
Should I keep going?

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.411 position:50% align:center
That's perfect, Sei.

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
Oh! Director!

00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:56.832 position:50% align:center
I see. Wonderfully done.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:00.169 position:50% align:center
All you have to do now is let it
cool, then pour it into a vial.

00:16:00.252 --> 00:16:01.295 position:50% align:center
Congratulations!

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
You made your first potion!

[RESEARCHER 01A]
Sei, may I have a word?

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.881 position:50% align:center
Oh. Of course.

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER 01A] By chance, did
you happen to craft this potion?

00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
Yes, this is one of mine.

Yep. That's what
the man said, anyway.

00:17:00.604 --> 00:17:03.023 position:50% align:center
All my potions are one
and a half times stronger.

Did you put something
else into them?

00:17:04.942 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
No, sir. I did it exactly
the way that you taught me.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] Hmm. It's the same color
as any old low-grade potion.

00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:15.911 position:50% align:center
Are mid-grade potions
different colors than low-grade?

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.496 position:50% align:center
Yes, they are.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
This is a mid-grade potion

00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:22.501 position:50% align:center
and this one is high grade.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.419 position:50% align:center
Cool!

00:17:24.503 --> 00:17:26.505 position:50% align:center
Don't get ideas.

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
Those things are tough
to craft. Really tough!

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
Matter of fact, no one at the
Institute can even make them,

00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:33.929 position:50% align:center
so we have to order them in.

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.556 position:50% align:center
Well, look at the bright side!

00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
It's a little bonus for
whoever uses them, yeah?

00:17:37.975 --> 00:17:41.520 position:50% align:center
I'd call 50% quite a lot more
than a bonus, but I understand.

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
Fine, I guess we'll just
have to experiment, then.

00:17:44.523 --> 00:17:47.234 position:50% align:center
I mean this is a research
institute after all.

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:48.402 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
You're right.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Look, why not
at least show me how

00:17:49.862 --> 00:17:51.572 position:50% align:center
to make mid- and
high-grade potions?

00:17:51.655 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
Uh! You're not ready yet!

00:17:53.407 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
[SEI] C'mon, I just want to
see how it's done, please?

00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:07.838 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.729 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] Hmm. I can't believe
you can actually craft them.

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.731 position:50% align:center
I know, but I still
need practice;

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
it's only my third one.

00:18:27.316 --> 00:18:31.153 position:50% align:center
That's not the point; you've
only been here three months.

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
And your output.

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:35.324 position:50% align:center
You keep churning them
out like it's nothing.

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
You never seem to run out
of magic power, do you, Sei?

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:41.914 position:50% align:center
So, how many potions
does this total for today?

00:18:41.997 --> 00:18:43.790 position:50% align:center
Uh, no clue.

00:18:43.874 --> 00:18:46.293 position:50% align:center
The director will
scold you again!

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
Your potions are far
too strong for us to sell--

00:18:48.504 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
at least not in the
civilian marketplace!

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.757 position:50% align:center
Bleh!

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.343 position:50% align:center
All the storehouses are
overflowing with them already

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:55.886 position:50% align:center
and we'll soon run out of herbs.

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
If you keep--

00:18:57.513 --> 00:19:00.599 position:50% align:center
There's an emergency! Gather up
all the healing potions now!

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:07.523 position:50% align:center
About a week ago, the
Third Order of Knights went into

00:19:07.606 --> 00:19:10.484 position:50% align:center
the Western Woods to subdue
the monster population.

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.945 position:50% align:center
However, they were
attacked by a Salamander.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.780 position:50% align:center
They've just returned
to the Royal Palace,

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:17.616 position:50% align:center
and while none perished,
there are so many grave injuries

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:19.785 position:50% align:center
there aren't enough
potions to heal them.

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:23.622 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN] We are to gather
all the potions and supplies

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
we possibly can

00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:28.043 position:50% align:center
and head to the palace to
assist the chairurgeons at once.

00:19:28.126 --> 00:19:29.545 position:50% align:center
Hurry!

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm.

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:40.806 position:50% align:center
I guess there are dragons
in the Western Woods, then?

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
Dragons?

00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
A Salamander is a kind
of fire dragon, isn't it?

00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:47.855 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] Hm? No, a Salamander
is a fire-breathing lizard.

00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:49.064 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
A lizard?

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.941 position:50% align:center
You mean one lizard
did that much damage?

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.276 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
It's much bigger and faster

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:53.652 position:50% align:center
than the name might suggest.

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
It may not be as
powerful as a dragon,

00:19:55.696 --> 00:19:58.532 position:50% align:center
but it's up there with
the more deadly beasts.

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.951 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
A huge lizard.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
We've arrived.

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.417 position:50% align:center
This way follow me!

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.710 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS chattering]

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.129 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:24.308 position:50% align:center
[MEDIC 01A] You, over there!
Bring those potions, now!

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.310 position:50% align:center
[JUDE, SEI, RESEARCHERS]
Sir!

00:20:29.438 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Take this.

00:20:34.026 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
That's better. Thanks.

00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad.

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:39.990 position:50% align:center
Thank you. You're kind.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.241 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:43.202 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 01C] How is it
that things are this bad

00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
and the Saint is
nowhere to be found?

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.289 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 01D] I hear she can
use high-level healing spells.

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
We could use a few
of those right now.

00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
Prince Kyle, I overheard him
say, "The Saint is not to

00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
bear witness
to such a horrific scene--

00:20:54.046 --> 00:20:54.922 position:50% align:center
that's the final word."

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.507 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 01D]
He said that?

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.383 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Prince Kyle?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
[SEI] That means
the Saint must be her.

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I mean, it makes sense that

00:21:05.182 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center
she might not be
able to handle all this.

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Sei!

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.772 position:50% align:center
Do you have any
high-grade potions left?

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:15.192 position:50% align:center
Yes, I have plenty!

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:18.904 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 01F] Commander!
Stay with us; we need you!

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts, gasps]

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.797 position:50% align:center
Here!

00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:41.218 position:50% align:center
Drink this now, please!

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:46.723 position:50% align:center
Swallow!

00:21:50.227 --> 00:21:53.146 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Please, you have to drink it!

00:21:55.649 --> 00:21:57.401 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:21:59.236 --> 00:22:01.488 position:50% align:center
Drink, dammit!

00:22:07.244 --> 00:22:08.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:22.593 --> 00:22:24.928 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT groans]

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.645 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:22:38.859 --> 00:22:39.651 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHTS gasp]

00:22:39.735 --> 00:22:40.777 position:50% align:center
[KNIGHT 01G]
Thank you, miss!

00:22:40.861 --> 00:22:41.778 position:50% align:center
[MAN 01B]
That potion must be strong!

00:22:41.862 --> 00:22:43.155 position:50% align:center
You've saved the
commander's life!

00:22:45.866 --> 00:22:49.286 position:50% align:center
That man--he is a very
old friend of mine.

00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:52.372 position:50% align:center
You gave him another
chance at life.

00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:55.375 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful, Sei.

00:22:59.296 --> 00:23:01.298 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.721 position:50% align:center
What'd you find?

00:23:07.804 --> 00:23:09.765 position:50% align:center
The exact mechanism is unclear,

00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:11.391 position:50% align:center
but the potions that she crafts

00:23:11.475 --> 00:23:13.810 position:50% align:center
seem to be 50% more effective.

00:23:13.894 --> 00:23:16.772 position:50% align:center
Too great a difference to
attribute to mere happenstance.

00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:18.607 position:50% align:center
And you've checked the
materials and processes

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.275 position:50% align:center
she uses to create them?

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:21.401 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Yes.

00:23:21.485 --> 00:23:23.028 position:50% align:center
Is she possibly more
proficient because

00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:24.863 position:50% align:center
she's actually the Saint?

00:23:24.947 --> 00:23:28.200 position:50% align:center
It's too early, though perhaps.

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:32.579 position:50% align:center
Well, have you observed
anything else worth noting?

00:23:32.663 --> 00:23:34.373 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
No. Not at this time.

00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:36.416 position:50% align:center
I see. Thank you.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.919 position:50% align:center
Send word if you learn
anything else of import.

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:40.587 position:50% align:center
That'll be all.

00:23:40.671 --> 00:23:42.506 position:50% align:center
At your service, sir.
