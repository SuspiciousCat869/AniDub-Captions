00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
Welcome. Take your time.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Yikes, security's tight
in the Forbidden Collection.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.922 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Okay, this is
freaking incredible.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center
None of this info was
available in the main library!

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Are we planning
on killing someone?

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.473 position:50% align:center
[SEI yelps]
Oh! Ser Drewes! Hi!

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.308 position:50% align:center
When the heck did you get here?

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
When, indeed? I wonder.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center
Poisonous plants, correct?

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:09.277 position:50% align:center
Well, I thought in
small amounts, of course,

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
they could potentially be used

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:13.281 position:50% align:center
to create new
types of medicines.

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:14.783 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hm.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.161 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
What? I'm telling the truth!

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.705 position:50% align:center
[YURI chuckles] I suppose
we can leave it at that.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.249 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I swear to you, it's the truth!

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
I thought I might
be able to use them

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.462 position:50% align:center
to make even stronger
potions than before.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.297 position:50% align:center
At least that's the goal anyway.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:30.507 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.966 position:50% align:center
And due to that,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.636 position:50% align:center
I'm looking for herbs that
haven't typically been used,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.972 position:50% align:center
because maybe they'll open the
door to some new possibilities.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:42.060 position:50% align:center
New possibilities, eh?
Think of that.

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:43.395 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.
Did you know that plants possess

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.899 position:50% align:center
small amounts of
magic within them?

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:48.983 position:50% align:center
Generally speaking.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.319 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Wait, really?

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:52.612 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Yes, indeed.

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:55.115 position:50% align:center
The truth is, though
it's rarely obvious to us,

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:57.659 position:50% align:center
all living things possess
some quantity of magic.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.411 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I didn't know that.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.663 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
I'm not surprised--most do not.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center
I, myself, only learned of it
through my own research so...

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.753 position:50% align:center
I have a hypothesis about
why your potions are so strong.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.297 position:50% align:center
It has something to do
with your specific magic.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:15.260 position:50% align:center
I believe it is in some way
different from other casters'.

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
As such, imagine
what could be possible

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.724 position:50% align:center
if you were to imbue the herbs
themselves with your power.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.393 position:50% align:center
Shut up! Can you
really do that?!

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:25.270 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
[SEI grumbles]

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:31.234 position:50% align:center
[YURI] However, you might
be able to, Lady Sei.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
[JUDE grunts]

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunting]

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
Well, that was a failure.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
So, it's still just water, then?

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I guess since water
is the base for the potion,

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.432 position:50% align:center
you can't imbue it with magic.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] I'll admit, trying to
imbue the water we use

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
for the garden is a
pretty interesting idea.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
Imagine how that might turn out!

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hmm.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Hold on, in the
video games back in Japan,

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
they had this thing
called "holy water."

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Hey, does holy
water exist in this world?

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
Water with holes?

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
[SEI] No, it's like
water that has magic in it.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
Definitely haven't
heard of that.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Okay, lemme think.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
How did they make holy water?

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
So you're asking for a blessing?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
You see, in my world,
we have this thing.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
It's a special kind of water
that people call "holy water."

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Go on.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
It can purify areas,
or take out undead monsters,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
protect the innocent,
things like that.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
I see.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
And the way
holy water is created

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
is with a blessing bestowed
upon it by the clergy.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
Huh. I'm not familiar
with it at all.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Yeah, I figured.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
But it's an interesting concept.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
Its effectiveness is
quite fascinating to me.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
Being best against
one type of monster.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Oh, in my world,
we didn't actually have magic,

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
so those facts I dropped
are really just fantasy.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
That doesn't matter.
Still, one wonders.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm?

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center
Yes. I have a thought,
but please,

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
I encourage you not to
dwell upon it too deeply.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
I know of one type of magic.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
Unique, in that
it's effective against

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center
all different types of monsters.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm?

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.822 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
All I know is that it exists.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
There are no records

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
of its particular
properties or potency.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
However, we are aware that

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
there were casters who
were proficient in it.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
But what is it?

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
This magic is called
a Saintly conjury.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
Oh, that does sound promising.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
Do you know exactly how
the Saints used this conjury?

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
[YURI grunts]

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.013 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Why me?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
I have two questions about
that if you don't mind.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
By all means. Go ahead.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.939 position:50% align:center
So first, what does
Saintly conjury do?

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
Purifies miasma,

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
as well as destroying
the monsters born of it.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
Second, what is it
I'm trying to do?

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
Imbue plants with
your magic power

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
for the purpose of creating
even more powerful potions.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right?

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's just that

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
it doesn't really sound like
this could help with that.

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
No. That is true.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center
Which is why I told you
not to think on it too much!

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Just kill me.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Ah, working late, I see.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Ser Director!

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
I saw you before,

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
casting spells out
in the garden.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
Is this related to that somehow?

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
Hoped you wouldn't notice that.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
It's a bit hard to miss when
you're casting up a storm.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
Well, did it help you
learn anything new?

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
It did, actually.

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
And it's promising.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
I learned that magic can somehow
have an effect on plants.

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Really? Interesting.

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:39.959 position:50% align:center
So holy-affinity magic
also works on them, does it?

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean also?

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
In addition to?

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
Because we already know
for a fact that earth

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
and water-affinity magic can
have an effect on plants.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
Oh, I had no idea.

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
So, why exactly were you

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
attempting to cast holy-affinity
magic out there, anyway?

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
That's a good question.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.068 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Ah, I understand.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
You're trying to imbue the
plants with magic, aren't you?

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:11.366 position:50% align:center
Yes, but it didn't quite work
out as I had hoped it would.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
There's one thing left.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
Though, no one seems to
know anything about it.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50% align:center
It's called Saintly conjury.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
Saintly conjury, you say?

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
Wait, have you heard of it?

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
Only through stories
and rumors. Nothing exact.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
I haven't read any detailed
accounts of its use.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.675 position:50% align:center
Well, that figures.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
There is the possibility

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.555 position:50% align:center
that it isn't the type
of magic the casters

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:35.890 position:50% align:center
thought they could preserve.

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.767 position:50% align:center
In terms of their
names and effects,

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
all of our spells
are generally the same.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
There's no variance
no matter the caster's ability.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Which is why we find merit in

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
preserving that information
in tomes and grimoires

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
to communicate it
to other magic users.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
But this Saintly conjury--

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center
it's only used by
a handful of casters.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Yes.

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
Its monster-destroying
usage may be too specific,

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center
and the casting method
was varied enough between Saints

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.878 position:50% align:center
making it pointless
to record for posterity.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center

those herbs make it possible

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.596 position:50% align:center

But the truth is,
I still haven't been able to

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center

Sorry about that.

Please, I'm sorry that we
can't be of more help to you.

Today?

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
Earlier, a messenger
came from the palace.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
They're requesting
a healer to support them

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
on their next expedition.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
Congrats on your new gig.

[JOHAN] Don't play dumb.
They're after you.

Bad joke, sorry. Yeah, I know.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.717 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
You're certainly calm.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center
I expected you to be
a little more upset.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not like I'm excited.
I wouldn't choose to go.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
But I do know that I want
to do whatever I can to--

to make sure nothing
like that happens again.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
I see.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
And anyway,
it'll be an adventure!

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center

pretty excited at the prospect.

You're here as well?
Why are you up so early?

[JOHAN] You're not
really asking us that?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center

Now, tell me, how did you
manage to accomplish that cast?

any more information?
