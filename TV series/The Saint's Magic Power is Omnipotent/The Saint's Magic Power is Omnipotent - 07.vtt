00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.770 position:50% align:center
[LIZ] You're back to your
other dress again today.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
Don't you prefer the one from
yesterday? You looked so lovely!

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.860 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I could never wear
a corset like that every day.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
It's like torture.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.865 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Really? You find it difficult?

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:33.158 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Well, not difficult,
just painful.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
That dark hair.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Aira!

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
There you are.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
Come along.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:44.711 position:50% align:center
[SEI] To be honest, I was
kinda hoping I wouldn't be.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:03.141 position:50% align:center
[KYLE] Well, t'would seem
you've regained your composure.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
In that case, I am Kyle,
the crown prince of Salutania.

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
Welcome to my kingdom.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
If it's not too bold,
may I ask your name, please?

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50% align:center
My name is Misono Aira.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.740 position:50% align:center
Uh! Aira's my given name.

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
[KYLE chuckles]

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Can I ask how
exactly I got here?

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
We called you,

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
utilizing our ancient
Saint Summoning Ritual.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Damian.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN grunts]

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
Allow me to explain.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
Our kingdom faces
unprecedented danger.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
Terrible monsters,
birthed from a dark miasma...

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
[AIRA]
Wait, what? Monsters?

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
What the heck is a "miasma"?

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
I literally don't
understand a word he's saying.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
Am I, like, in a manga?

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN] However, no Saint
has appeared in our age,

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
so following with tradition,

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
we decided to use a ritual
devised by ancient mages

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
to summon a woman...

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
[AIRA]
Nope. It's really happening.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Therefore,

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
my duty as the future
king of Salutania,

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50% align:center
was to address this
crisis we faced!

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.172 position:50% align:center
So I called for Summoning
to be carried out!

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.716 position:50% align:center
[AIRA]
If...

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
Yes? If what?

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
[AIRA] If I do somehow
kill all the monsters,

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
then, can I go back home?

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.978 position:50% align:center
[KYLE] I don't believe
I've ever read any accounts

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
of the Saint
returning to her world.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
You're saying I can
never go home, then?

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
[AIRA sobbing]

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
How is Aira now?

00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
It seems she finally cried
herself to sleep, Your Highness.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
I see.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Damian.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:08.767 position:50% align:center
Ser?

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
You will become the
next Prime Minister

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center
once your father's gone.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
Tell me, would you
die for your king?

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
Yes, if he so commanded it.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
As I thought.
I would do the same.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:26.409 position:50% align:center
That is our lot in life.
And no one else's.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
But never mind that.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
I've signed the
necessary documents.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
I leave the rest to you.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.709 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
It will be done.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 7A]
Lady Aira, which of your gowns

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
would you like to wear today?

Uh! Yes, sorry!

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:54.396 position:50% align:center
Might I suggest
this one, my Lady?

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
Yes, that is quite lovely.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center

See?

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center
I think this sweet little cutesy
one looks best on you, Aira.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
Aw, you're just adorable!

You do.

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
I knew that color
would suit you.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
Well, thank you very much.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
Do you find you
still lack anything?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
[AIRA]
No, not particularly.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
I've been given clothes and
a room, and I'm being fed well.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
Everyone's been
so kind to me, too.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
As they should be.
You are the Saint, after all.

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.703 position:50% align:center
Right, well, um, about that.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
It still doesn't seem
quite real to me yet.

What do you think of Salutania?

Beautiful and lively.

It's a lovely place,
Your Highness.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
Oftentimes a bit
too lively I'd say,

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
which can be
somewhat troublesome.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
It's part of our duties,

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
ensuring proper
social discipline.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
Uh... Sorry?

[DAMIAN]
Hm?

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
In simpler terms,

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
we must sometimes be strict
with the kingdom's people

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
to uphold the kingdom's peace.

00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
Though, as you can imagine,

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
that does not endear us
to its citizens.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see.

This kingdom,
I think it's wonderful.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.356 position:50% align:center
I truly hope you come to
love it as I do in time.

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:27.192 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I will, Your Highness.

When all this is over,

what it means to be the Saint,

a blast learning magic!

Glad to hear it.

No, we'll be there
with you of course.

Prince Kyle has a fiancée.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center

Oh, it's okay.

[DAMIAN]
Oh, forgive me!

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
I've never seen anyone wield
magic in such a precise manner.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
Incredible.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
You truly are completely dry.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
[AIRA grunts] Well, I didn't
quite get all of it off.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
It's just... I've
noticed my hair and skin

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
kind of drying out
since I got here,

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:56.206 position:50% align:center
so I thought if I left a little
bit of moisture it might,

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
like, help with that.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
[gasps, laughing]

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
This report is so astounding

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
that its contents seem nothing
more than desperate falsehoods.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.398 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Indeed.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
Like that bit about her
magic healing lost limbs?

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
And there's more.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.446 position:50% align:center
The house of Count Valdec,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.492 position:50% align:center
the house of Margrave Hawke,
the house of Marquis Drewes--

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.119 position:50% align:center
all powerful families

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
stepping in together to
provide her patronage.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
[grunts, sighs]

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
I turned my back on her
because of the way she looked!

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
Like some sort of servant, or
a wet-nurse! Well beneath me!

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
Why would a prince address her?

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
Your Highness, forgive me,
but it would do you well

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.762 position:50% align:center
to learn about
otherworldly cultures.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
Yes! I know!

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
It was a mistake... born out
of my own stubborn pride.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
But admitting that
now is dangerous.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
It could trigger another
quarrel over my succession.

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Hmm...

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
The Second Prince
would very likely

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
approach those aforementioned
noble houses if necessary.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
Most importantly, what happens
to Aira if she's not the Saint?

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
Well, even if she isn't the one,

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
surely the kingdom
could find use for her,

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
seeing as she does
come from another world.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:26.129 position:50% align:center
So she'd live her life
as a captive in the Palace.

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:29.966 position:50% align:center
I don't know. Would Aira
even want such a thing?

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN grunts]
Doubtful, Highness.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.096 position:50% align:center
There's no place for
her in high society.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.350 position:50% align:center
[KYLE] It was a rhetorical
question. I know the answer.

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
She had a home and
a place where she belonged.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center
I took that.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
As such, I'll find her
a new place to call home.

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
That's my duty
as the future king.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center
Uh! What do you
plan to do then?

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
Nothing yet. For now,
I'll go on as planned.

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
That's the way.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.997 position:50% align:center
I'll keep playing the role of
"incompetent, stubborn prince."

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
After witnessing all my
reckless behavior with Aira,

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
the court will take pity on her.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Now I understand.

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:12.092 position:50% align:center
[KYLE] It will cause
you some trouble, though.

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center
Uh... Your Highness.

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
Handling trouble is my duty
as your future Prime Minister.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
May I have a moment?

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
[AIRA]
Huh?

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
I don't believe
we've spoken before.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
My name is Elizabeth Ashley, and
I'm betrothed to Prince Kyle.

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
[LIZ] As I'm sure
many other young ladies

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.161 position:50% align:center
have already warned you,

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
it truly doesn't reflect
favorably upon you

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
to be so close to
a man with a fiancée.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
So...

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
I thought, if you'd
be comfortable with it,

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
might I join you?

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
What are you doing?!

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
[AIRA gasps]

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
Highness!

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
Elizabeth, what business
do you have with Aira?

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Begging your pardon.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
I only wished to speak
with her for a moment.

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
That's all?

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
Since Lady Aira always studies
with you and your friends

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
after classes are done,

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
I thought I might
offer her my assistance

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
with her studies,
as well, if she'd like.

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
[AIRA gasps]

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Hm.

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
No need.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
I will keep looking
after Aira myself.

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
[LIZ gasps]

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Hm...

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
Was there anything else?

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
[RAYNE]
Ah! Finally. There you are.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
I've been looking
for you, my brother.

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
[AIRA gasps]

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
[LIZ grunts] Oh, Prince Rayne.
Good day to you.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:49.064 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
[RAYNE]
Nothing too terrible.

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
The Professor would
like a word with you

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.402 position:50% align:center
about next week's expedition.

00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
Aira, let us go.

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
What unfortunately poor timing.

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
[LIZ sighs]

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
I genuinely only
wished to help her,

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
but he absolutely
refuses to listen.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
[RAYNE] That seems to be
the case with anything

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
that happens
regarding the Lady Aira.

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
Oddly enough, I've been hearing
rumors that the other woman

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
who was Summoned is believed
to be the true Saint.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.188 position:50% align:center
How will they all react

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
when one woman is recognized
and the other is not?

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
I have asked Sei for
her thoughts, but alas...

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:41.241 position:50% align:center
UH. Wait, Liz, are you saying
you've met this Saint woman?

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
Indeed!

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:46.663 position:50% align:center
We've become fast friends
over the past few months.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50% align:center
[LIZ] Honestly, I'd like to
befriend Lady Aira one day, too.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
[AIRA grunts]

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
So, I thought, if it's
all right, I might join you!

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.273 position:50% align:center
If she'd been allowed
to keep talking,

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
then maybe we could've
become friends.

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
[AIRA] Next time
I see her, I'll say hi.

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:24.701 position:50% align:center
Even if I do it wrong,
and even if I'm awkward,

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
I can still be direct.

00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:04.926 position:50% align:center
[KYLE] I hear you've grown
quite skilled at using magic.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.386 position:50% align:center
Right, Damian?

00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:08.179 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Yes, I've never seen anyone

00:23:08.263 --> 00:23:09.931 position:50% align:center
with as much control as you.

00:23:10.015 --> 00:23:12.684 position:50% align:center
[MARK] I was astounded,
as well, my Lady!

00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:14.477 position:50% align:center
[KYLE] Well, perhaps
you can begin joining us

00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:16.396 position:50% align:center
on our expeditions soon, then.

00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:18.023 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
So now I've got a bunch.

00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:19.858 position:50% align:center
I'll give you some
next time I see you.

00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:21.151 position:50% align:center
[LIZ] My, are you sure?

00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:24.029 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Yeah! I'm proud
of them. I hope ya like!

00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:26.156 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
I can hardly wait!

00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:28.992 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I wonder how
they'll turn out today.

00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:31.286 position:50% align:center
[LIZ giggles]

00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:33.288 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Aira!

00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:34.539 position:50% align:center
[AIRA gasps]

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:39.627 position:50% align:center
Coming!
