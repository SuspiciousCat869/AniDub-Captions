Now then,

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.895 position:50% align:center
as you know, you're here
today to be Appraised.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center
[YURI] One unique thing
about Appraisal magic

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.654 position:50% align:center
is that it requires the
target's conscious consent,

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
therefore, do try
and relax if you can.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll do my best.
Hope my anxiety cooperates.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.957 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
All right. Let's begin.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.292 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:22.642 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.269 position:50% align:center
Why the long face?

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:26.896 position:50% align:center
Are you really that nervous
about being Appraised today?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.190 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.609 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Ever since that
crazy day in the hospital,

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:32.777 position:50% align:center
it seems like everyone

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.738 position:50% align:center
from one corner of
the Kingdom to the other

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.991 position:50% align:center
is now convinced I'm the Saint.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.536 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I guess ordinarily,

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.663 position:50% align:center
Aira and I would've
been appraised by now.

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.206 position:50% align:center
The only reason we haven't yet

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.584 position:50% align:center
is because the one person
who could Appraise us,

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center
the Grand Magus,
fell into a coma

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.797 position:50% align:center
right after the big
Saint summoning ritual.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.341 position:50% align:center
And now that he's woken up,

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
my mind's racing with
all these questions.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:01.598 position:50% align:center
Like, if he appraises me,
and they do say I'm the Saint.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
what happens then?

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50% align:center
You must have known
this was coming

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
after that little stunt
you pulled, right?

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't call that a "stunt."

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:09.105 position:50% align:center
Some people were hurt,

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
so I just healed them up
a little, that's all.

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center
It was hardly "a little,"
and you know it.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
We did learn one
interesting thing.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
Since the Summoning,

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
the monster population
has steadily decreased.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
Which means, there's no doubt
the Saint was, indeed, Summoned.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
In the past, the Saint would
go with the Knightly Orders

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
on all of their expeditions,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.931 position:50% align:center
assisting them on the
field as only She could--

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
eradicating the monsters.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
It's safe to assume

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center
the same is expected
of the current saint.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
Wait, does that mean
I'd have to go into battle?

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
I've never even been near one.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.447 position:50% align:center
The world I'm from is peaceful.

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I could do it.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.704 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. They won't make you
fight without proper training.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
Apparently, that's what Aira
has been up to with the Prince.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
Working hard at the academy,
or so I've been told.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Oh, she has?

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
[SEI] So, um, what happens
if they appraise me

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
and when all is said and done,

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
it ends up I'm not
the Saint, after all?

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
In that case,

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
Aira would most likely take
on all the Saint's duties.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
However...

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
...one thing they might do is
ask you to play a support role.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
Mages who can cast healing
magic are few and far between.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
But then if I agree
to help them,

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
would I have to move there?
To the Royal Magi Assembly?

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.250 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
You see, I'd...

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
I'd like to stay at the
Institute if at all possible.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
Understood. I'll see
what I can do about that.

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
Look, she's coming now.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.111 position:50% align:center
Is that really the Saint?

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.072 position:50% align:center
Oh, so that's her.

Hello, friends.

I'd like to welcome you
to the Royal Magi Assembly.

It's an honor to meet you.

This dude is the Grand Magus?

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
He legit looks like he just
stepped right out of a painting!

00:05:55.855 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec. How did I get
surrounded by gorgeous guys?

Ah, that's right!

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.030 position:50% align:center
You're already acquainted

That's true, I am.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.328 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I mean, I knew for sure
he had to be important,

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
but I had no idea he
was that high-ranking.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.208 position:50% align:center
Wait, "Hawke"?

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.168 position:50% align:center

Uh-huh.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.598 position:50% align:center
[YURI] One unique thing
about Appraisal magic

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
is that it requires the
target's conscious consent,

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
therefore, do try
and relax if you can.

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:41.693 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll do my best.

Oh, no! Does this mean...?

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.298 position:50% align:center
Interesting, Sei.

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
But I didn't even do anything!

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
Are you quite certain?

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
Yeah, really, I swear!

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
I take it you didn't
purposefully resist?

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
No, Ser.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
How fascinating.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
In that case,
there's only one answer.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
The reason the spell didn't work

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.733 position:50% align:center
is because your magic
is greater than mine.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
Greater than the Grand Magus?

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
I'm confused. Since when
were you this powerful, Sei?

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Mm...

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
We're finished here.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
There'd be no point
in continuing.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center
U-Uh...

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.831 position:50% align:center
I mean, are you sure?

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
Quite certain.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
[ERHARDT]
But, Ser!

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
[YURI] Instead of that,
might I prevail upon you

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.547 position:50% align:center
to show me how you
cast your spells?

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure. I can do that.

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.511 position:50% align:center
Let's start with "heal."

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50% align:center
Huh? Really? Just "heal"?
That's all you need?

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
If you would.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.561 position:50% align:center
[SEI] It's such a simple spell.
Will that show him anything?

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
Now, heal.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
Oh, my word!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
Yes, I see it, too.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.744 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Please, observe.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center
Now, heal.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Huh?

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
Did you notice the difference?

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:28.466 position:50% align:center
Typical mages, including myself,
only produce a white light.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
But your healing spell

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
evidently produces
a golden shimmer as well,

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
which, at the least,
makes it very unique, indeed.

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
The knights you
healed at the hospital

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.019 position:50% align:center
reported witnessing
that same effect,

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
but I had my doubts.

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
As such, I wished
to see it for myself.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:47.610 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your cooperation.
You have my gratitude.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Ser?

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.004 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Hm?

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center
Well, I was just wondering.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
Do you have any guesses as
to what that shimmer could be?

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately not.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
Well, not quite yet, anyway.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
A result of your otherworldly
origins, perhaps.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50% align:center
Or something else.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Now that I think of it,

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center
I might have a
good idea why that is.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
The same reason for everything

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
that's happened
since I got here.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:32.030 position:50% align:center
Including the crazy curse
that makes everything I do

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
about one and a half times
more powerful than it should be.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.744 position:50% align:center
All the things I've
done since I've arrived

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
have been a total surprise
to everyone around me,

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
each time, without fail.

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center
When I think back
on those moments,

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
the shock is always
tied to this new power.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
Well, and that weird shimmer

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
that shows up
when I cast spells.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.968 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
I've come with a report,
Your Majesty.

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center
I'm Yuri Drewes. Grand Magus,
Royal Magi Assembly.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
Good. I'd like to see
him alone, please.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
Of course. I'll take
my leave then, Sire.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.116 position:50% align:center
I assume this is
about the Saint?

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Indeed.

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
I performed her Appraisal
today, as requested.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.876 position:50% align:center
So I see your spell was unable
to affect her, Grand Magus.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
You're sure she didn't put
up some kind of resistance?

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:32.257 position:50% align:center
[YURI] I am. That was
not why it failed.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIC]
Well, why, then?

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
There's only one explanation.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
It must be because her
magic far surpasses my own.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
Preposterous!

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
You are the most powerful
mage in this entire kingdom!

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center
It can't be true!

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
And yet, surprisingly, it is.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
You were able to measure
Lady Aira's potential

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
without any trouble,
isn't that right?

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
[YURI] Correct. The results
are in that report.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Hm. Her quick improvement

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.951 position:50% align:center
in all manner of skills
is most remarkable.

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Agreed.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
As we cannot properly
Appraise Lady Sei,

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
we're left with these facts:

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.043 position:50% align:center
she is blessed with an
incalculable amount of power.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.544 position:50% align:center
Likewise,

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
Lady Aira possesses another
rare and unnatural ability:

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:13.965 position:50% align:center
rapid skill improvement.

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
So you're saying

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
we still don't have
enough information, then.

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
We don't know which
one of them is the Saint?

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
Even after all that?

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
Not quite.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
[SIEGFRIED]
Hm?

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
I believe Lady Sei is the Saint.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIC, SIEGFRIED grunt]

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
I once had very different ideas

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
about what the
golden shimmer meant.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
Simplistic ideas.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
I thought it was
just a side-effect

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
from being from another world.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center
However, when Lady Aira
casts magic,

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
that shimmer has never
once appeared for her.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.580 position:50% align:center
That leaves only one answer.

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
It's simply a facet of
Lady Sei's Sainthood.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, the spells she
casts are incredibly potent.

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
Much stronger than a normal
mage's could ever hope to be.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
To the point, Sire, they're
more potent than Lady Aira's.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
[exhales] This
is excellent work.

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
You may go now.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
[YURI] I shall continue
my research on this issue,

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:07.560 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
Well, that makes matters
all the more complicated.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
If things take a downward turn,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
it could even result in
a crisis of succession.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
Kyle shows no sign
of slowing down, then?

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
That does appear to be the case.
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
From his mortifying
impropriety at the Summoning,

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
to his behavior towards Sei--

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
all of it can no longer
be overlooked or ignored.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
We must formally invite Sei
to court as our honored guest.

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:37.632 position:50% align:center
Make the necessary
preparations at once.

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:48.852 position:50% align:center
Seriously? An audience
with His Majesty the King?

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.645 position:50% align:center
But, Ser...

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
What is it?

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:53.857 position:50% align:center
I know it's silly,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
but I don't have anything
fancy enough to wear to court.

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 05A] That's quite all
right. Don't trouble yourself.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
Just enjoy. We'll take care
of everything you may need.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
But I have no clue
how to conduct myself.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
Rest assured,

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
His Majesty will not be bothered
by that in the slightest.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.624 position:50% align:center
Wont' you honor him
with your presence?

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I have to stand
my ground and be firm,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
or he'll keep asking.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.005 position:50% align:center
But if I turn him down,

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
he might think I'm still mad
at him about the Summoning.

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
I for sure don't wanna
give him that idea.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Saying no could also put

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:28.183 position:50% align:center
the director in an
uncomfortable position.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:31.061 position:50% align:center
Very well. I'll go.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 05A]
Excellent.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
Then we'll come to collect you
on the aforementioned day.

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 05B]
Lady Sei, this is where

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
we'll have you prepared
for your visit to court.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
Welcome back. It's good
to see you, Lady Sei.

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
We have all missed
you so dearly.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
Miss Marie! Hi!

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
I've been fully briefed
on your situation.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
I encourage you to relax
and leave everything to us.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:01.216 position:50% align:center
Now, first things first.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
Please allow us to relieve
you of your current clothing.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
My... I can totally
undress myself!

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Ahh...

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
[SEI sighs]

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Lady Sei.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Whoa. Who the heck is this?

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
[SERVANTS exhale]

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
And now...

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
...here are your garments for
today's presentation at court.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Oh, jeez.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
I know the Grand Magus
supposedly failed

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
to Appraise me and all,

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.931 position:50% align:center
but if they're
making me wear this?

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:51.641 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on.

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
What else could that mean except

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
they're pretty sure
I'm the Saint?

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 05A]
There you are.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT 05A]
You look just beautiful!

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
[SERVANTS giggle]

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I appreciate your help.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Lady Sei?

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
You have a visitor
waiting to see you.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
I do?

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Commander Hawke!

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
Good morning, dear Sei.

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Good morning, Commander.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
So, um, what brings
you here today?

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
I'm your personal bodyguard.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.862 position:50% align:center
I'll escort you to
His Majesty's court.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Isn't it just down
the hall? I'm so confused.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
I thought you might get
lonely or anxious by yourself.

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.037 position:50% align:center
But should I not have come?

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, I promise;
I don't mind at all!

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
Well, good.

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
Johan was concerned that you
might be just a touch nervous.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
Your first audience
with the King, and all.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT chuckles]

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center
Well, that's incredibly
kind; thank you.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful to you both.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.056 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
You okay?

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
You may look a bit different,
but you're as lovely as ever.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center

Somebody, just kill me!

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:55.473 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Still, I really am glad
the Commander's here with me.

Uh.

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.386 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
When I saw that smile,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center
I knew he meant
everything would be okay.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
I knew he meant
everything would be okay.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
I am His Majesty,

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
ruler of this great

I'm Sei. Sei Takanashi.

[SIEGFRIED]
First, I must apologize

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
for Summoning you
here so suddenly,

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
and for my son's behavior.

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:14.886 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
[SEI] When they first
summoned me to this place,

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:27.565 position:50% align:center
then proceeded to
ignore me completely

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
and tell me there was
no way I could go home,

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
I remember being so angry.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:37.409 position:50% align:center
But now, I've decided
to stay in this world.

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
I've fallen in love with
my work at the Institute,

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
and everyone around me
is so wonderful and kind.

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
It's not as if I've
completely forgotten

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
that anger I felt
in the beginning,

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
but living in this world,
it just feels right.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.723 position:50% align:center
There's no need, Your Majesty.

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
We're humbled by your grace
and generosity of spirit.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
[COURT gasps]

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
Since you've arrived, you have
performed many remarkable

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
and meritorious deeds for our
people.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
An apology isn't enough--
you simply must be rewarded.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
So, Lady Sei,
what is it you desire?

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
A court title, or perhaps land?

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
It can be anything you like.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
I can't think of
anything specific.

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
[COURT murmuring]

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I guess I'd better
ask for something,

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
or else I'll never
hear the end of this.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
What do I want?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.518 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
Oh! My research into
making higher-grade potions

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.106 position:50% align:center
is still stalled out,

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
so, maybe, if I could
find the right info...

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
Like in a book?

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
Oh, I feel certain
that you would find tomes

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
with that type of knowledge
in the Forbidden Collection!

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
I know.

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
May I have access to the
library's Forbidden Collection?

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
And I have another request.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
I want to learn more about magic

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
and everything
having to do with it.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
Would it be possible for you
to find me a good teacher?

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
I can do some,
and I'm always improving.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
But there's only so much I can
learn about this from books.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:26.685 position:50% align:center
I'd like a formal
spellcasting education.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
Very well. Consider it done.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Your Majesty.

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
[COURT chattering]

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
[DAMIAN]
Your Highness.

00:20:57.632 --> 00:20:58.883 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Hm?

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Father did what?!

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid it's true.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
He has apologized to
her formally in court.

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
[KYLE grunts] Honestly,
what is that man thinking?

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.562 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But wait,
does that mean my father

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
has now acknowledged that
other woman as the Saint?

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
No, Ser, he didn't
explicitly say so in court.

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
Well, that's good, at least.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
The thing is, many subjects in
the palace have been whispering,

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
claiming that she is
the one, true Saint.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
Let 'em whisper.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.037 position:50% align:center
Because when the time comes,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
they'll see once and
for all that I am right,

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
as Aira's deeds will prove!

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
There's no need to fret.

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
We'll stay the course
until our time arrives!

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:41.843 position:50% align:center
For we and no one else,
have the true Saint!

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.762 position:50% align:center
[AIRA grunts]

00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:17.480 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:20.400 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:28.283 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Lady Sei!

00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:30.493 position:50% align:center
But--

00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:33.204 position:50% align:center
Now then, let's begin
our lesson, shall we?

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're gonna
be my teacher?

00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.209 position:50% align:center
You?! Grand Magus Drewes?!

00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:41.921 position:50% align:center
Indeed! Yuri Drewes,
personal magic tutor!

00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
At your service,
milady. Shall we?
