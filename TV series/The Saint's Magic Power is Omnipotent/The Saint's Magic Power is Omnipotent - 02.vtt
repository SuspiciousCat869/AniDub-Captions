00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.557 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN] Sei, what do you
want more than anything?

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:17.935 position:50% align:center
What do I want? Um, why?

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.145 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN] We received
additional funding as a reward

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:22.314 position:50% align:center
for assisting with the
Salamander incident.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:23.857 position:50% align:center
And I've been informed
that the Knights

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:26.985 position:50% align:center
will be making regular
purchases of your potions.

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.362 position:50% align:center
That is to say,

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.073 position:50% align:center
we've got a bit of a budget
surplus on our hands.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, that's
awesome news, I suppose.

00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:36.912 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] You have
just as much of a right

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.915 position:50% align:center
to the surplus as we do.
More right to it, actually.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:43.627 position:50% align:center
After all, our recent successes
are largely thanks to you.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.504 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:48.841 position:50% align:center
So is there something
you really want?

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
There is one thing. [chuckles]

00:02:28.232 --> 00:02:29.525 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.235 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
A pleasant surprise, I hope?

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
Yes! I can't believe
you did this in a week!

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.072 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Accomplishing this much

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.949 position:50% align:center
would make any
Japanese contractor cry.

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.368 position:50% align:center
Guess Salutania's work
standards can be brutal, too.

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.078 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
I'm quite surprised.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.288 position:50% align:center
Of all the things you
could have asked for,

00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:44.665 position:50% align:center
you wanted a kitchen?

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.625 position:50% align:center
I'm not nobility, Ser Director.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
So I have to cook for myself.

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:49.795 position:50% align:center
That's right. I'd forgotten.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.089 position:50% align:center
By our kingdom's standards,
you're well educated,

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.466 position:50% align:center
even in matters outside of your
specialization.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
So it's easy to mistake
you for an aristocrat.

00:02:56.844 --> 00:02:59.847 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Here I thought I only had
a hobbyist's knowledge of herbs.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.057 position:50% align:center
We can hire a chef
to work in your kitchen.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
There's no need for you
to be wasting time cooking.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.353 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Oh, really?

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.941 position:50% align:center
Actually, I quite
enjoy cooking for myself!

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Truth is,
the food here is disgusting.

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.403 position:50% align:center
But I can't tell him that!

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.572 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Hmm.You'll be cooking, then?

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
I would like to learn
if you don't mind.

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:20.868 position:50% align:center
So what dish will
you be making first?

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.160 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:24.538 position:50% align:center
Without any ingredients,
it's hard to say.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
I see. I can't wait to hear.

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.251 position:50% align:center
Forgive my presumption, but
didn't I see you eating lunch

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.044 position:50% align:center
just a little while ago,
Ser Director?

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN chuckles]
Well, as a researcher,

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.174 position:50% align:center
it's only natural
I'd be very interested in

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
sampling the cuisine
of your homeland!

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:38.635 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
What does my cuisine

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.554 position:50% align:center
have to do with herbal
research, though?

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.306 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
We'll foot the bill, too!

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.724 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
You've got a deal.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
But please try not to get
your hopes up too high!

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.229 position:50% align:center
Agreed!

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Well,

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
if he's going to
get that excited,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.031 position:50% align:center
I might as well
make something good!

00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
So what are you making?

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.204 position:50% align:center
Oh, just some
herb-crusted chicken

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:06.038 position:50% align:center
with a little light salad.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Um, "herb-crusted?"

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.501 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
I'm using some of our
medicinal herbs in the cooking.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
Is that okay?

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN]
Yes, of course.

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
Though, I have never heard
of a chef using medicinal herbs

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:20.302 position:50% align:center
in one of their dishes before.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.180 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]
Are you serious?

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
It's strange.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.937 position:50% align:center
This world resembles
my own in so many ways

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.064 position:50% align:center
that when the
differences do show up,

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.775 position:50% align:center
they're all the more
striking by contrast.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.321 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Here you are.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.079 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
Delicious! Absolutely amazing!

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.209 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you like it!

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
To think using herbs could
so enhance the flavor.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
No. It's not that,
or not only that.

00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
Back in my home world,

00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
it's common to use many herbs
in our everyday cooking.

00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
We have medicinal cuisine, too.

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
It uses them to ward
off certain diseases.

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:09.643 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.103 position:50% align:center
Could you teach our chefs that?

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.938 position:50% align:center
Do you know those recipes?

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.648 position:50% align:center
If they're all
as delicious as this,

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
I'm sure everyone would want
some!

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.406 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Marjoram here can
be used in soups and sauces,

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.824 position:50% align:center
and salad dressing, too.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sei, busy?

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]
What is it?

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.121 position:50% align:center
The director
needs a little favor.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
He'd like you to
deliver these missives

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:34.877 position:50% align:center
to the Third Order barracks,
if you have some time.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact,
I am a bit busy.

00:05:38.422 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] He insisted that
it had to be you, though.

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:43.719 position:50% align:center
Oh, he insisted?

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.847 position:50% align:center
All right.
I'd better do it, then.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.268 position:50% align:center
You'll find the Knight
Commander up in his office.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.978 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Got it.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
Don't eat too much, you hear me?

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
I won't! Thanks, Sei!

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:01.195 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.738 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
Ah, there she is.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.574 position:50% align:center
Come on in.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Pardon the intrusion.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
Here are the documents
you requested.

00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:15.334 position:50% align:center
I can take those. Thanks.

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:17.169 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Of course.
I'll take my leave, then.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
One moment.

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:21.882 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Huh?

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.346 position:50% align:center
This is her, Sei.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:30.599 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
I see. So, it was you.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
Albert Hawke.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:34.019 position:50% align:center
I'm Knight Commander of
the Third Order of Knights.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
Pleasure to meet you.

00:06:35.646 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:37.648 --> 00:06:40.192 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Those gorgeous blue-grey eyes.

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.903 position:50% align:center
I've seen a lot of handsome men
in this world at this point,

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
but out of all of them,
he's the one who's most my type.

00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:49.451 position:50% align:center
A girl could get
used to this place.

00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:50.953 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT chuckles]

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]
Oh, lovely to meet you.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.373 position:50% align:center
My name is Sei.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.958 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT chuckles]

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.671 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN] You recall the Third
Order's most recent expedition

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
I should hope.

00:07:02.673 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
The incident with the
Salamander? You must remember.

00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:08.971 position:50% align:center
You treated a gravely wounded
man with a high-grade potion.

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.182 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.976 position:50% align:center
That's him.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Wow. You wouldn't ever
know he was on death's door.

00:07:20.983 --> 00:07:22.526 position:50% align:center
Sure healed up beautifully.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
He looks great.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:27.406 position:50% align:center
Thank you for saving my life.
I'd be dead if not for you.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:28.949 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.577 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I'm such a dork! I was
staring at him for way too long!

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.287 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT chuckles]

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.997 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN chuckles]

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
Care to share?

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.041 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's nothing.
Please pardon me.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT clears throat]

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN chuckles]
Apologies.

00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:43.005 position:50% align:center
So, Sei, you wanted
more ingredients

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.548 position:50% align:center
for your high-grade
potions, correct?

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.966 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Uh, yes.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
Then journey into the
Southern Woods to gather them.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.137 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
What? Uh, but, Ser Director--

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50% align:center
I know, there are
foul beasts there.

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
You see...

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:55.976 position:50% align:center
...that's where
he comes into play.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.019 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
As his way of thanking you.

00:07:58.854 --> 00:08:01.273 position:50% align:center
If you would do me
the honor, of course.

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:02.441 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
That's kind of you,

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.902 position:50% align:center
but you've already
thanked me sufficiently.

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.029 position:50% align:center
He doesn't think it was
quite personal enough

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.280 position:50% align:center
if you catch my drift.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.282 position:50% align:center
Johan! That was unnecessary!

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.910 position:50% align:center
I don't quite catch
your drift. "Personal"?

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:15.996 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT clears throat]
Forgive Johan's lack of tact.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.040 position:50% align:center

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.069 position:50% align:center
but he refused to
hear of it and insisted.

00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:27.571 position:50% align:center
After that initial trip,

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.156 position:50% align:center
the Commander would
give me a ride back

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.575 position:50% align:center
from the palace quite often
as it turned out.

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
I didn't mind.

00:16:35.204 --> 00:16:36.997 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Hmm...

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
[SEI] As it happened,
I also ran into Elizabeth

00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
at the library often
enough to befriend her.

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:42.920 position:50% align:center
Now that we've become close,

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.547 position:50% align:center
I can even call her
by her nickname.

00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
Yes, Liz?

00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:50.469 position:50% align:center
You have such beautiful skin.
I can't stop staring!

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:51.887 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
Yes! It's so easy to get
burned in this hot season,

00:16:54.056 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center
but your skin looks lovely--
not even a hint of pink!

00:16:57.226 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but your skin looks way
prettier to me than mine does.

00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose I do try
my best to take care of it.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.317 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's the cosmetics
we're using?

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
I've actually been
making mine on my own.

00:17:07.945 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
Oh? You have? That's incredible!

00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:11.949 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I use medicinal
herbs to craft them.

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:13.450 position:50% align:center
I can make you some
if you'd like.

00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:15.619 position:50% align:center
I would love some! Thank you!

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Liz, you're such a girly girl.

00:17:17.663 --> 00:17:19.957 position:50% align:center
You're just now
discovering that, are you?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.418 position:50% align:center
[SEI] No, I'm just
now saying it out loud!

00:17:23.502 --> 00:17:25.546 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
Okay, what's that all about?

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
It's nothing, really.

00:17:31.802 --> 00:17:34.805 position:50% align:center
Just reflecting on the
endless struggle for beauty.

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
[SEI] You don't have to
struggle--you're stunning.

00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:39.393 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Thank you, Sei.

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
But I was thinking of
someone other than myself.

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm?

00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
[LIZ] I feel terrible
gossiping about this,

00:17:46.984 --> 00:17:49.528 position:50% align:center
but I suppose you should know.

00:17:50.571 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
All the trouble started

00:17:51.822 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
when a new girl joined
the class mid-semester.

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:57.870 position:50% align:center
[SEI] She grew unusually
close with a number of boys

00:17:57.953 --> 00:17:59.288 position:50% align:center
who were already betrothed,

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.665 position:50% align:center
causing quite the
ruckus at the academy.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.293 position:50% align:center
Many warned her what would
happen if she continued

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:05.961 position:50% align:center
to no avail.

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:07.713 position:50% align:center
Then, one of the boys' fiancées

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
suddenly stopped
attending classes.

00:18:10.883 --> 00:18:14.553 position:50% align:center
She was just the right age for
acne to be a constant problem,

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:15.721 position:50% align:center
not to mention a persistent

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
source of anxiety
for her as well.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
Try as she might,

00:18:19.558 --> 00:18:22.853 position:50% align:center
nothing seemed to prevent
her breakouts, but then...

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:25.981 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:28.734 position:50% align:center
So she compared herself
to that popular girl.

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:32.738 position:50% align:center
[LIZ] Mm. If her skin
condition were resolved,

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.032 position:50% align:center
I think it might give her
back her confidence.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:36.617 position:50% align:center
Yeah, makes sense.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
I might be able to help her
with her skin issues, though,

00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
if she's open to it.

00:18:40.037 --> 00:18:41.580 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Really?!

00:18:42.873 --> 00:18:44.625 position:50% align:center
Shh!

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
[LIZ gasps]

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
[LIZ giggles]

00:18:54.593 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
What's this?

00:18:55.886 --> 00:18:57.888 position:50% align:center
You're back to
making cosmetics again?

00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
That's right. I'm trying to make
a product to help with acne.

00:19:01.517 --> 00:19:03.894 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] Well, I'm certain
yours will be more effective

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.605 position:50% align:center
than anything else out there...
in our world at least.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:07.898 position:50% align:center
Yeah, prob'ly.

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.650 position:50% align:center
[SEI] All I wanted was
to get rid of my bags,

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.527 position:50% align:center
but now my eyesight's
better, too.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.445 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I scare myself.

00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] Your potions help,
but it's more than that.

00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
You've become so much prettier
since you first arrived!

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
Ugh! What?! Where
did that come from?

00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:25.624 position:50% align:center
Aw, look at you.
You're blushing!

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:26.792 position:50% align:center
[SEI groans]

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:30.087 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Sheesh! Don't tease me!

00:19:41.807 --> 00:19:43.559 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Sei!

00:19:43.642 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
Allow me to introduce
Lady Nicole Adler,

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
the woman I mentioned
the other day.

00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:50.983 position:50% align:center
You may call me
Nicole if you wish.

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:53.944 position:50% align:center
Hi, Nicole. My name's Sei.
I work at the Institute.

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
Here's a special lotion
I crafted just for you.

00:20:02.286 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to give it a try.

00:20:03.829 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
[NICOLE grunts]

00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt Sei's lotion

00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
will be of great
help to you, Nicole.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
[NICOLE] If you believe so,
Lady Elizabeth,

00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
then I am hopeful.

00:20:12.129 --> 00:20:15.549 position:50% align:center
But if it still doesn't work,
what will I do?

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:20:19.011 --> 00:20:21.597 position:50% align:center
It's only natural
to fear the unknown.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
There's no rush.
Give it a try whenever you wish.

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.603 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]
Hey!

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
Liz! Do a patch test first!

00:20:30.022 --> 00:20:31.815 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it.

00:20:31.899 --> 00:20:32.900 position:50% align:center
Incredible!

00:20:32.983 --> 00:20:34.484 position:50% align:center
[SEI, NICOLE gasp]

00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:38.155 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's so soft.

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.324 position:50% align:center
Oh my, Lady Elizabeth.

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
Your skin looks lovely!

00:20:42.326 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Hm!

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.460 position:50% align:center
You see, Lady Nicole,

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
you shouldn't try
to change your looks--

00:20:53.462 --> 00:20:55.923 position:50% align:center
not for anyone
but yourself, I mean.

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:58.342 position:50% align:center
That's why I take
care of myself.

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:01.929 position:50% align:center
I want to look lovely for
my sake and no one else's.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
Your own opinion matters most.

00:21:05.057 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
Right, Sei?

00:21:06.475 --> 00:21:11.063 position:50% align:center
Uh? Oh, yes, absolutely.
You should do it for yourself.

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
[NICOLE]
Lady Sei.

00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:16.193 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate that!

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.070 position:50% align:center
[LIZ, SEI chuckle]

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.957 position:50% align:center
[SEI giggles]
Really?

00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:54.958 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad.

00:22:55.042 --> 00:22:57.085 position:50% align:center
[LIZ]
Yes. As am I!

00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:59.671 position:50% align:center
Word of your cosmetics has
spread throughout the academy

00:22:59.755 --> 00:23:01.965 position:50% align:center
and even to a few
neighboring villages.

00:23:02.049 --> 00:23:04.092 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
That I am less glad about.

00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:06.637 position:50% align:center
But if it helps people
everywhere feel prettier,

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.138 position:50% align:center
then I have no complaints.

00:23:08.222 --> 00:23:11.141 position:50% align:center
[LIZ] Although, none of them can
hold a candle to you, Sei.

00:23:11.225 --> 00:23:12.351 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm?

00:23:12.434 --> 00:23:14.228 position:50% align:center
After all, your beauty
comes from much more

00:23:14.311 --> 00:23:16.688 position:50% align:center
than just
well-crafted cosmetics.

00:23:16.772 --> 00:23:18.148 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Uh...

00:23:18.232 --> 00:23:19.566 position:50% align:center

Come, now.

You're in the midst of a
budding romance, are you not?

00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:22.694 position:50% align:center
Me?

00:23:22.778 --> 00:23:25.113 position:50% align:center
Rumor has it that a certain
beautiful young lady

00:23:25.197 --> 00:23:28.283 position:50% align:center
has been melting the Ice

Who's the Ice Knight?

00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:31.537 position:50% align:center
Don't be coy with me.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.288 position:50% align:center
Many have seen you both
riding in tandem

00:23:33.372 --> 00:23:35.082 position:50% align:center
on horseback like love birds.
