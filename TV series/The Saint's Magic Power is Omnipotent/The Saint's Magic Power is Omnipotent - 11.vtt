What is the meaning of this?

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.307 position:50% align:center
[ERHARDT]
Of what?

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.643 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, "Of what?"
Don't be coy with me!

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50% align:center
How is it that
they've already left?

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
[ERHARDT] Their departure date
was apparently moved up.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:24.816 position:50% align:center
[YURI]
Why wasn't I informed?

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.776 position:50% align:center
[ERHARDT]
Because I didn't inform you.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.944 position:50% align:center
Why should I have?

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't have
been able to go, anyway.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
[YURI] I am the Grand
Magus of this Assembly.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
[ERHARDT]
Is that so?

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
Then please, by all means, feel
free to finish his work for me.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.873 position:50% align:center
Pardon, Ser, but we've
just received a missive.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
The Second Order of Knights
are requesting... help...

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
It... seems quite urgent.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center

Hmm...

[MAGE 11A]
As new recruits,

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
your work will primarily involve
research here in our offices.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
Many of your fellow colleagues

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.016 position:50% align:center
require intense
focus for their work.

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:00.060 position:50% align:center
So, please be
mindful of any noise.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center

Yes, ser!

Right this instant!

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center
You can't avoid your duties!

Hmm...

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.876 position:50% align:center
I recognize this one.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.712 position:50% align:center
You're from the
same world as Lady Sei.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.589 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes, ser.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.800 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:34.928 position:50% align:center
Right, come with me!

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:36.346 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center

Oh, jeez, what's going on?!
What's happening?! Stop, stop!

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[SEI]
Huh? Yes?

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Forgive the
disruption, Lady Sei.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
But I thought you might
care to take a break

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
for some afternoon tea?

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.778 position:50% align:center
Oh! Actually, yes,
I would. Thank you!

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
That sounds just lovely.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
I get that you do
this all the time,

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
but you're so
good at it, really.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Thank you.
What a kind compliment.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
I don't think too much about it,

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:21.845 position:50% align:center
so your bringing it up
out of the blue like that

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
is truly flattering.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
You don't think
much about it? Why not?

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.978 position:50% align:center
Because! See, being skilled
at many various duties

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
is simply a part of my job here.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
If it's your job,
you don't have to think.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
So, if you treat something
like it's part of your job,

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.781 position:50% align:center
then you just do it without
it being such a big deal!

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.783 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Huh?

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
Ah! Well, then, there you are.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Hello! Yes,
I'm excited to be back.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'd like
to ask for your help.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
What is it?

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
You want to experiment
with your blessing?

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
Right, and I thought, or hoped,

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
you might have a few
ideas about how to do that.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:14.939 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA sighs]

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm?

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
Follow me.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
First, I thought we might try

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
testing it out on
these potted plants.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
That's a good idea.
I'll give it a try!

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
Nope, nothing! Nothing at all!
Everything's perfect!

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
This is my job. That's all.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
No big thing. Just
a job, just a job.

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
It's the blessing!

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
What do you think? Did it work?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
[SEI] I'm not sure. I was able
to cast it, at the very least.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
Well, then.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
The way we'll know
if it didn't work

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
is if these seeds won't sprout.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.686 position:50% align:center
We'll keep an eye on them.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Sounds like a plan.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
Next, you'll do this one.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
And after that, this one here.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
Then, you should
move on to that one.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
Magnificent work.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.170 position:50% align:center
Thank you, ma'am.
I'm glad you approve.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
These'll grow fast,

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
so I think we should see sprouts
in about two or three days.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Wonderful.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
I'll come by to check on them
tomorrow, though, just in case.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] Yes, that's
probably a good idea.

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
Hey, there she is!

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
Yo!

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
Be a mercenary! Join us!

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
Please!

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT] Remember how you
healed a whole bunch of us?

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
Well, we don't see mages

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
who can use healing
magic all that often!

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
I'm tellin' you, alchemy's
a waste of your talents!

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
Bite your tongue!

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
What do you mean,
alchemy's a waste?

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.667 position:50% align:center
Where in the blazes
did you get that idea?

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT] That's not what I
meant!

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
It's not that it isn't helpful
or anything!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
But look, I'd be stupid if I
let a high-level healing caster

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
go without even tryin'!
Surely you can understand!

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm well aware of the fact

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50% align:center
that they're few
and far between,

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center
and of course I can see
where you're coming from.

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.307 position:50% align:center
You get it?

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:56.393 position:50% align:center
But! You must give up on Sei.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't see why!

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
She makes potions
and casts healing magic.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.776 position:50% align:center
You only see that
once in a lifetime!

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
You'd better believe
I'm not just gonna let her go!

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center
What do you think you're doing?

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
Nothing, really.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
I was just having a harmless
little chat with her, milord.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.748 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] I see. And what
were you discussing?

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
Nothing of importance, milord.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
What rubbish.

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
You were just imploring her
to join your mercenary company.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot, Gran!

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] Sorry, Sei will be
doing nothing of the sort.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT grunts] Why are
you making that decision?

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
You've got nothing
to do with her.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50% align:center
On the contrary, I, in fact, do,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
as she traveled here
with us from the capital.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
What? Interesting.

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
She's with the
Royal Magi Assembly, then?

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
Why's a mage like her
making potions for--

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
Uh! Okay, wait just a minute.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
Are you the Saint?!

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT groans]

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] That's
Lady Saint to you, dimwit!

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear, did I forget
to mention that before?

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
Looks like everyone
did, apparently!

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
So, as you can see,

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:04.336 position:50% align:center
she will not be able to join
your mercenary company.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
Was there anything else you
wished to speak with her about?

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
[groans] No, milord.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
Excellent. Then might I intrude?

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
It's just that there's something
I need to discuss with her.

Huh?

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.350 position:50% align:center
Well, that being the case,
I shall now take my leave.

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for taking
the time to help me today.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate it.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
You're always welcome.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
As it was,
I learned plenty, too.

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:27.984 position:50% align:center
So, I'll see you later.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
Now, then.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
Come on, you!

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
Ow! Be gentle!

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
Feels like you're
about to rip off my ear!

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
Ow!

--[ALBERT grunts]
--[SEI chuckles]

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
So, there was something
you wanted to discuss with me?

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
Yes. We've finished our
initial scouting of the area,

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
so we'd like go ahead and begin
our expeditions into the woods.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
Oh. I guess that means
I'll be joining everyone

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center
from here on out, then.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
We have mages with us,
but there aren't many

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
like you who can
cast healing magic.

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center
I regret that we have
to ask for your help.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.901 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I'd planned
on coming, anyway.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
The monsters here are powerful.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
The good news is,

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
we shouldn't encounter
hordes of them all at once.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
Although, as of yet, we haven't
discovered any dark swamps.

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
Oh, now I see.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.831 position:50% align:center
Actually,
I'm a little embarrassed.

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
I thought getting rid of
that one would solve it all.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Not to mention,

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50% align:center
preparing myself to cast the
blessing is really awkward.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
You appear somewhat flushed.
Are you all right?

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
Do I need to go?

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
Uh! N-No, I'm good, thank you!

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] You're sure?

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
Because if you're feeling
unwell, we can--

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:45.270 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Nope, I'm
totally fine! Honest!

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT grunts]

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.566 position:50% align:center
[SEI squeaks]

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
[SEI] How the heck do
I explain all of this to him?

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
I can't. Not yet.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.128 position:50% align:center
[JOHAN grunts]

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
[JUDE]
Huh?

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
Teatime for you, too, ser?

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
Same as you, then?

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
I always start to crave tea
right around this time of day.

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
Me, too, so at some point,
it just became my routine.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
I can relate.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.365 position:50% align:center
I wonder what she's up to now.

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
[JUDE] Hmm. Oh, the usual,
I would expect.

[exhales]

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT] Boy, I mean,
I'd heard the rumors,

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
but you sure are one
of a kind, aren't you?

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute. What rumors?

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT] Oh, I heard some
people sayin' how the new girl

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
can craft loads
of potions at once.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
Which "people" exactly
are you referring to?

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.601 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT grunts]
Deepest apologies,

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
I need to mind my tone, milady.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
Or not. That's fine.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Why would you need to do that?

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
Well, I... I assumed
you were offended.

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
I need to be more aware of
the tone that I take with you,

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.155 position:50% align:center
our Lady Saint.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, not at all.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for you
to be all formal with me.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
I'd actually really
prefer it if you weren't.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? All right!

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
Then in that case,
I won't change a thing.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
Great, I'd appreciate that.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT] It's way easier
on me, that's for sure.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
I'm terrible at formalities
and manners n'all that.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, you going on the
big expedition coming up?

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
Of course. I mean, that is
why I came all this way.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT] I know you've been
out on expeditions before,

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
but I guess I can't help but
worry about you a little.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
You mean when it comes to
battles and things like that?

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center
The forests in this
area are very dangerous--

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
way more than near the capital.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
There might be
fewer monsters lately,

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
but there are still a ton.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.490 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hmm.

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm sure
I'll be all right.

we will be on our way.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
Is there anything you need me
to do? Anything that would help?

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
Well, how would you feel about
giving them a speech, yourself?

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:46.493 position:50% align:center
No, I didn't mean that!

No, I'm just stiff
from sitting for so long.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
Nothing that a few good
stretches can't fix!

But, hey! We're finally here!

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.656 position:50% align:center

be looking forward

to discovering new herbs in
these woods.

Well, of course! It's always
my pleasure to assist.

to these formalities.

if you'd go back

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
What're you looking at?

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
Just some herbs.

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
But I thought you said
you weren't an alchemist.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.591 position:50% align:center
But I work at the Medicinal
Flora Research Institute.

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:50.844 position:50% align:center
You're the Saint and
you work full time?

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
Though I'd say my Saint work
is more of a side job.

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
Is our kingdom

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center

Anyway, isn't this great?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
It's so lovely here,
don't you think? I sure do!

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
Really? Maybe I'm just jaded,

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
but it seems like a pretty
typical forest to me.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.539 position:50% align:center
[SEI] That's exactly
what makes it so nice!

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
You can really become
one with nature here.

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT] No doubt.
Nothin' out here but nature.

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
That and memories.

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center

here as a kid.

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
You love the woods.
I can see it in you.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm not sure
I would say that.

[LEONHARDT]
What's your home like?

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
[SEI] The forests of
the capital are good,

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
though the flora
is a bit different.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
Hm.

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:52.030 position:50% align:center

Bet your hometown's nice.

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Yeah, it really is.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
Though I guess I haven't
thought about it much before now

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.037 position:50% align:center
to be completely honest.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.456 position:50% align:center
But it is, yeah.

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center

Hm?

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
What is it? Something wrong?

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
We've made a discovery

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
that leads us to
believe a monster is close.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
What'd you discover?

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hmm.

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Okay, what
the heck is that?

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
Looks to me like a puddle
of slime digestive juice.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.328 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
A slime?!

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:42.205 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] Physical attacks
barely damage them at all,

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
so we'd like to avoid engaging
it in combat if at all possible.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
[SEI] What about magic?
Does that work on them?

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] It does. When we do
engage, we typically use magic.

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
Somethin's still off, though.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
Why would such a dangerous
slime stick around

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
when all the other monsters in
the area seem to have vanished?

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] So, there are fewer
monsters in these woods now.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT] Yeah, I heard
you'd killed a bunch,

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
but I had no idea
you'd killed this many.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:09.441 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT] The same phenomenon
occurred in the capital, too.

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT] Wow. And do
you think that's because...

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
Most likely.

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center

Right. Fine. I get it, okay?

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
Now, if you two could please
stop staring at me like that,

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:21.244 position:50% align:center
that'd be great.

Should we proceed?

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
If there's a miasma swamp here,
then yes, we should.
