00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.770 position:50% align:center
Thank you. I'm so glad
you're here with me.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Hm.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.232 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
[DANIEL] Friends! I trust
your journey was pleasant.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
Welcome, I'm Daniel Klausner,
lord of this region,

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
and while you're here,
I am at your service.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
My name is Sei Takanashi. Thank
you so much for hosting us.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.914 position:50% align:center
Commander Albert Hawke
of the Third Order of knights.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.666 position:50% align:center
It's an honor.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:18.471 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I'm exhausted.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:21.516 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you would like to change
out of your robe, my lady?

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.018 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't know.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.812 position:50% align:center
I've got dinner with Lord
Klausner later tonight, don't I?

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.064 position:50% align:center
Yes, but you have
some time until then.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.399 position:50% align:center
It would be fine to change into

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.443 position:50% align:center
something a bit more
comfortable while you wait.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.820 position:50% align:center
Heck yes, it would!

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
This robe's a lot.
It makes my shoulders achy.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] If your robe
is causing you discomfort,

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.830 position:50% align:center
then might I suggest
a formal dress instead?

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Nope, not necessary--
the robe is totally fine!

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
Very well then, my lady.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.135 position:50% align:center
It's delicious!

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
I believe it's infused
with rare herbs--

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
ones we don't see
much in the capital.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:05.685 position:50% align:center
Makes sense. They are this
region's claim to fame.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
You're really going to love
the Alchemist's Holy Land.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
I bet it will seem like
a bit of heaven for you, Sei.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.109 position:50% align:center
Why's that?

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
Well, because ancient
alchemist families reside there,

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.865 position:50% align:center
and they're known to keep secret
ancestral secret recipes.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center
Who knows, right?

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
You might find
a way to make potions

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.703 position:50% align:center
stronger than
the high-grade ones.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Secret recipes.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.092 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Mm. Mm!

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
I do hope it's to your liking.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.137 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Mm. It's fantastic!

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
Is this recipe
specific to your region?

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.643 position:50% align:center
Well, no. We heard that
using herbs in cooking

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
had become popular at
the palace, so, we adopted it.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Wow. Alrighty, then.

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
That technically makes
this one of my recipes!

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.154 position:50% align:center
They're using
a much more complex

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
combination of herbs
than I did, though.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
Klausner's Domain
just keeps impressing!

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Mm! Mm!

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
What types of herbs
do you typically cultivate

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:08.915 position:50% align:center
in this area?

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
I spotted a few
I was unfamiliar with

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
as we traveled
through the region.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
We take great pride in them,
as well as our distinction:

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center
being the number one producer
of herbs in the kingdom.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
I hear you've taken an interest

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
and that you enjoy
crafting potions.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
Yes. I do enjoy it.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
I make plenty for the
Flora Research Institute.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that so?

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
You must be quite the
competent alchemist, then.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
I don't know. I wouldn't
say I'm that good.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
Here in the castle, we actually
have our very own practitioners,

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
including one many call
the best in the entire domain.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
You have the best
right here? How lucky.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
[DANIEL] If you'd like,
I can arrange an introduction.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
In fact, it would
be my pleasure!

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]
I'd love that, thank you!

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
I got so distracted by all
that talk of herbs and alchemy,

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
I forgot to ask a thing
about local monster attacks.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Don't worry.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
I made sure to
ask the palace guard

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
about that earlier this evening
before we went in to dinner.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
I figured you would be far too
exhausted from our long journey.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
Wow, thank you.
I appreciate that.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
So, we'll start our
expedition tomorrow?

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. We'll need to spend a
few days scouting out the area.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
You rest and recharge
in the meantime.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
Then, all right.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
maybe I should make an attempt

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.881 position:50% align:center
to meet up with
that master alchemist.

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:43.593 position:50% align:center
Also, I'd like to craft
some potions. Then, after--

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Before I forget,

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
there's something
I wanted to tell you.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.056 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
You are stunning
in that white robe.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
You took my breath away, truly.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
Uh, thank you so much
for the compliment!

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
[SEI stammers]
You also look very...

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
Uh, I mean, you look...

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
[ALBERT]
Hm?

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
Uh, never mind!

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
[DANIEL]
Corinna.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
Hm? Well, it's milord Klausner.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
How can I help you, Ser?

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
This is the Saint,
newly arrived from the capital.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
May I present Lady Sei.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50% align:center
I'm Sei Takanashi.

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
It's such a pleasure
to meet you.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
My name is Corinna, and I'm one
of the castle's alchemists.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
You are very
welcome here, milady.

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
Lady Sei has developed
a great interest

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:47.741 position:50% align:center
in medicinal herbs, you see.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
She'd like to learn from you,
if that's all right.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind! Yes.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
Not at all. In fact,

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50% align:center
I was just about to start
making today's batch of potions.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
How about we chat
while I get that done?

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
Actually, I would
love that! Thank you!

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.798 position:50% align:center
Would you mind if
I helped you out with them?

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Yes! A chance to learn
from a master alchemist!

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
Of course not. This way, dear.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.389 position:50% align:center
Thank you! I'm excited.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center
[DANIEL]
She's in your hands, Corinna.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:20.565 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
Of course. Understood, milord.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA gasps]

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
All right then, next!

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
Hold on a moment.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
You've done all that
and can still make more?

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
Sure, I usually make
much more than this.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA gasps, laughs]

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50% align:center
Um, what's so funny?

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.716 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] Well, when
I first heard that the Saint

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.468 position:50% align:center
enjoyed making potions,

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
I had assumed that it was
nothing more than a hobby.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
But now you're outdoing
me in my own workshop!

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
Well, I appreciate your
letting me hang out with you!

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
I can already tell
we're going to

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:01.690 position:50% align:center
have some interesting
conversations, my dear Lady Sei.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
Would you mind not calling me
"Lady" Sei anymore?

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
What's that? You're
saying you'd rather be

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
called simply "Sei"
and nothing else?

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
Please!

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.953 position:50% align:center
Right then, Sei,
why don't we head to the--

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
Yo!

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Wow.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
His arms are, like, huge.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
Why must you always
make such a ruckus?

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA growls] Can't you
just pipe down for once?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
So you finally got yourself
another apprentice, Granny?

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] Don't be silly.
Where'd you get that?

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
She's definitely
not an apprentice.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:35.849 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
Hmm?

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] Anyway, was there
something you wanted?

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. I'm here for
those potions we ordered.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.316 position:50% align:center
Huh? You only just put
in that order last night!

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
Did you honestly think
we'd be finished by now?

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.405 position:50% align:center
You do realize these
things take time, yes?

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I know.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:56.411 position:50% align:center
But they just told us to sortie,
and it was kind of sudden, so...

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
He's like a big puppy.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT grunts]

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
Lucky for you, they're ready.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
Uh! Aw, thanks, Granny!

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
You should thank Sei, not me.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.215 position:50% align:center
Who's Sei?

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50% align:center
She made all of the potions,

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
and I can vouch
for their quality.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
You're going to be very pleased.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.389 position:50% align:center
Hello, I'm Sei.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
I'm Leonhardt!

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:21.478 position:50% align:center
Captain of the mercenaries
stationed in the castle!

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much
for helpin' us out!

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.774 position:50% align:center
I owe ya one!

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh... Uh...

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
Leo! She's not one of your
mercenaries! Calm down!

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
Oh, right! My apologies!

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
No, I'll be okay.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
I swear, boy.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
If you would just take a moment
to think every now and then.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
[LEONHARDT]
I know... Sorry, Granny.

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center
[SEI] It's true. He really
is a big ol' clumsy puppy.

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:52.008 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] Earlier today,
I believe I was able to attain

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
a fairly accurate measurement
of the Saint's magic power.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
Any thoughts?

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
You may rest assured, My Lord.
She is most certainly the Saint.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
Which means,

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
it must follow that Lady Sei
can then bless our fields.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] I can't be sure
of that yet, unfortunately.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
[DANIEL]
Hm?

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
Although,

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50% align:center
I did learn something that
sounds very promising indeed.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
During her stay with the
alchemist at the Institute,

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:17.367 position:50% align:center
she was witnessed
casting golden magic.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
You don't say. The magic
described in that diary?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
I believe so. It's intriguing.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
This Saint has a great interest
in the art of crafting potions.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
If we could just
show her the diary,

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50% align:center
she may end up discovering how
to perform the blessing herself.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
[DANIEL]
Hmm.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
[DANIEL]
She must.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
The Saint is our
last and only hope.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] Sei, tell me,
do you remember what

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
these little herbs are used for?

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
Well, when combined
with other herbs

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.160 position:50% align:center
they can boost the healing
potential of potions.

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
So, by adding them
into certain recipes,

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
you may end up using
fewer herbs altogether.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
Do I have that right?

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
That you do.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.669 position:50% align:center
I suppose you must've memorized

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:12.005 position:50% align:center
most of my house's
recipes, then.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
Thank you for teaching me.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
I'm so incredibly grateful
I got the opportunity to

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
come here and
learn this from you!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
Oh, you stop that.

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:23.099 position:50% align:center
It just so happens, you've
taught me plenty of things, too.

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
For example,

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.729 position:50% align:center
I had no idea that this wheat
provided a health boost.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Yep, it's true!

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
Where I'm from,
they call it "spelt,"

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
and it's packed with
loads of good nutrients.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
Let me tell you,

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
no matter how old I get,
there's always more to learn.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
What would happen if
we mixed this into a potion?

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
I would love to know the answer.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
Do you think it could make one

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
that's more effective
than high-grade potions?

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
I see. So that's what
you want to create, is it?

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
[SEI] Yes. I've done
plenty of research,

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
but I can't seem to
find any good recipes.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50% align:center
Well, they existed
a very long time ago.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
[SEI gasps]
Did they really?

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, but no more
I'm afraid.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.979 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
Are you coming?

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.089 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
Sei.

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] It's a diary, and it's
one of our most precious tomes.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:48.935 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] It was written by the
one we call the Great Alchemist.

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
The mother of
Klausner's know-how.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
The Great Alchemist?

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA]
Read it.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
You're sure it's all right?

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.738 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
You're the one person
who should read it.

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:04.993 position:50% align:center
[SEI grunts]

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
[CORINNA] Just be sure
to put it back in the safe

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
when you're done.

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Hm.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST] I love the people
here, in Klausner's Domain.

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
I love this land they call home.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
I've never been to the capital,

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.353 position:50% align:center
but I feel certain

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
that Klausner's Domain
would outshine it.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST] However,
this year's drought is horrific.

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:42.280 position:50% align:center
Crops are dying,

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
and it seems that our precious
herbs have all wasted away.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
And not just the herbs, either--

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
our wheat, our produce,
everything.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
This famine has lasted
over a month now.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
They're slowly starving.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.174 position:50% align:center
If only there were
something I could do to help!

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST] A horrible disease
is spreading amongst the people,

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:11.935 position:50% align:center
and my darling younger brother,
Curt, is bedridden with it.

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
I can barely stand to see

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:18.149 position:50% align:center
how gaunt his once rosy,
chubby cheeks have become.

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
I can't allow this
famine to continue.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
I must change our
fate for the better.

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.159 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST] Thankfully,
my research has taught me

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
how to craft
new forms of medicine.

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
I had hoped they
could cure Curt,

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
but I can't cultivate
the necessary herbs.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
If I can't grow them,
then he won't be cured

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
no matter how often he's Healed.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center
Isn't there any way to
restore vitality to our land?

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:49.931 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST] Today, Curt
sang me a beautiful song.

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center
He suffers so greatly,

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
yet he still finds the
strength for kindness.

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
He is the best of souls.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
What am I to do to save you?
I love you, sweet brother.

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
Please don't die.

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST]
Curt... Curt... Please stay.

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST] A brilliant gold
flowed across the fields.

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
I've been so busy, I barely had
time to write in this diary.

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
The famine came to an end

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
and our crops began
to grow once more.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
Curt's cheeks grew
plump and rosy again,

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
and soon, I couldn't
slow him down.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
My darling Curt! I love him so.

00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
I dub this magic a blessing
and will always consider it so,

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
as it was Curt who
gifted it to me.

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
[SEI] So then, was the
Great Alchemist a Saint?

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.588 position:50% align:center
[SEI]
Golden magic, blessings...

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
But how was she able to cast it?

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST 10A]
Do we have any more potions?

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
No, we're all out!

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
What about a mage, then?

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST 10B]
Of course we don't have a mage!

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
What the heck is going on?

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
[RUSHING MAN 10B]
Hurry!

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
[RUSHING MAN 10A]
Are they all right?

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center

[LEONHARDT]
Hey! It's you.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
We ran into some rare
monsters near the forest

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
and got our asses handed to us.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
Were there a lot of injuries?

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, but we're
gonna be just fine now.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Those new potions you made
for us really saved our skin.

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center
[MERC 10A]
Really? You made those potions?

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
[MERC 10B] They worked
like nothing I've ever seen!

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
[SEI chuckles]
So, uh,

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
would you like for me to run and
get you some more from inside?

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm pretty sure
we went through them all.

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
Don't worry; a little rest
and we'll be right as rain.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
Well, but it looks like a few of

I could just Heal you.

Thanks, but remember,
we're outta potions.

[SEI] No, not with
potions. With magic.

you were an alchemist.

Well, uh...

at Healing magic, too!

well call for your help, too.

that came here from
the capital, right?

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Of course.

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
They went out to scout the area

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
but got pinned down
by a big horde of 'em.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
It can't be...

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
