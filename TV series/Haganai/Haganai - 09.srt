1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,125
It's that time
of year again.

2
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,208
People everywhere are
flocking to their local beaches

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,791
to try to beat this heat.

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,041
It's a sight to see.

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,583
The shore's so packed
with umbrellas;

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,166
you can hardly see the sand.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,250
We're live at the
Yumigahama Beach

8
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,541
--where it looks like a...
--A swimsuit?

9
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,041
Huh? You okay...?

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,250
What's wrong?

11
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,083
Kobato! There you are!

12
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,250
I've been looking
for you everywhere!

13
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,708
-So?
-So.

14
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,000
What games should
we play today?!

15
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,333
None.

16
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,625
We could hit the pool
and shout marco polo?

17
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:53,958
No!

18
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,416
How cute...! She's
totally rejecting me!

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,458
What about you, did you
bring your swimsuit?

20
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,500
I did... Stupid Yozora
told me to, just in case.

21
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,208
-We're here.
-Ha, ha...!

22
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,750
You're so hilarious!

23
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,541
-A horse?!
-The hell?

24
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:17,333
[Music]

25
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,083
I never would've guessed I'd
encounter the demon Astaroth

26
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,500
in a place like this.

27
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,333
Wait, I thought the
evil gate was destroyed

28
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,291
during the last war
between God and the Devil.

29
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,041
Stop it, you're
creeping me out.

30
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,375
Yozora?

31
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,375
-That's Yozora?!
-Indeed.

32
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,083
What are you doing
dressed up like that...?

33
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,541
You weirdo...
It's creepy.

34
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,208
Don't... Stay back.

35
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,541
Get away from me, freak...!

36
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,250
You're gross.

37
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,458
Dammit...!
What was that for?!

38
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,583
Someone wanna tell
me what's going on?

39
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,375
-Today is swimsuit day!
-It is?

40
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, the plan was to wear
swimsuits all day at the club.

41
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,708
Why would we do that?

42
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,500
Because it would be a shame
not to wear my swimsuit

43
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,416
after all the
money I spent.

44
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,708
This is all your fault;
you just had to go home!

45
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,958
The pool was too crowded;

46
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,166
it was impossible
to have any fun.

47
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,333
You could barely get in,

48
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,666
much less find
a place to sit.

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,250
Are you serious?

50
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,416
Uh... Yeah... I am.

51
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,958
So what's going on...?

52
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,333
Like... Why in the hell are
you wearing that horse mask...

53
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,833
Not to mention the full
bodied zebra swim suit.

54
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,000
It's embarrassing
to show your skin

55
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,666
in front of a bunch
of strangers.

56
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,125
And like you said,
the pool was packed.

57
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,666
With this outfit,
my flesh isn't exposed,

58
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,625
and no one can see my face,
so I can keep my dignity.

59
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,083
If you went to the pool
wearing that ridiculous thing,

60
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,333
everyone would hate you.

61
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,708
They can hate me
all they want,

62
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,000
there's no rule that says
I can't wear a horse mask.

63
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,541
Yeah, maybe not,

64
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,208
but I'm pretty sure there's
a rule against freak shows.

65
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,791
Then they wouldn't
let you in either.

66
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,958
You take that back!

67
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,333
When you walk into
a swimming pool,

68
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,375
everyone immediately
starts throwing up.

69
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,333
Hey, Kodaka.

70
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,666
Rika's wearing a swimsuit
under her coat...

71
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,625
Wanna take a look?

72
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,083
Uh... Not really.

73
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,000
Rika thinks you'll
like it a whole lot!

74
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,250
It's called...

75
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,000
"The Emperors
New Swim Suit!"

76
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,083
That's no suit,
that's going nude!

77
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,125
Why don't you
sneak a peek then?

78
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,541
Knock it off, all right?!

79
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,083
Rika's just
pulling your chain.

80
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,166
Come on...

81
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,750
Tell Rika how she looks.

82
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,916
You look pretty normal.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,666
What...? Normal...?

84
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,625
It might seem that
way on the outside...

85
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,166
But this suit's special...

86
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:43,958
Once it gets in hot water,
it's completely see thru.

87
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,666
Rika... Stop!

88
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,625
Rika will take him to a private,
secluded hot spring.

89
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,750
He'll think Rika's wearing
a regular swimsuit,

90
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,000
but before his very eyes,

91
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,458
she'll emerge from the
hot water totally naked!

92
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,000
Kodaka will lose control

93
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,833
and give into his carnal desires
rising up from deep within!

94
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,750
Not gonna happen...

95
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,250
I wouldn't go to a
hot spring with you,

96
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,208
not if my life
depended on it.

97
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,791
Why not?

98
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,958
Hey... Big bro, it's you!

99
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,958
Oww. A monster!

100
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,416
There's a monster in here!

101
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,625
No, it's okay...

102
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,916
She's just...

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,458
Guess what little girl,
I'm-a gonna eat you!

104
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,916
Oh, please
don't do that...

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,291
I'm raw...
I don't taste good raw!

106
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,125
Don't worry I'll throw
you on the grill first.

107
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,541
No, I still won't taste good,
not even then!

108
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,500
Plus, all I've been
eating are vegetables!

109
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,416
Good, cause
I'm a vegetarian!

110
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,708
Oh no!

111
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,333
If I would've known
this was gonna happen,

112
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,916
I never would've
stopped eating steak,

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,666
I would have given myself
a nice fat, flabby flavor

114
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,458
-so he wouldn't want me!
-She doesn't eat steak? Weird.

115
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,375
Recently, Maria
changed her diet...

116
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,958
She decided she was
really into normal food.

117
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,916
Do it, horse devil!
Take that girl out...!

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,416
Start at the head and
munch your way down

119
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,416
to the toes of that
snobby agent of God!

120
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,333
Okay, this is just
getting ridiculous.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,791
I see... You're a friend of the
blood sucker, aren't you...?!

122
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,333
You and that
stupid, moronic,

123
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,583
poop head of a vampire
can both rot in hell!

124
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,125
It's time for you to die!

125
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,000
I like my little
girls medium rare,

126
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,708
-so after I throw you on the...
-Don't eat me...!

127
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,916
Somebody rescue
me, please!

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,250
Okay, Yozora, I think
she's had enough.

129
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,375
Oh, all right.

130
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,791
Oh no... It turned
into Yozora...!

131
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,500
Be gone now you devil!

132
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,166
The mask has secret
dark powers...

133
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,000
If you put it on,
the demon Astro

134
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,083
takes over your body
and possesses you...

135
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,833
Now the power's
taking over my hands.

136
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,250
I can't see anything,
its pitch black in here!

137
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,958
I got some bad news
for you Church Lady;

138
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,125
the power of darkness has now
fully invaded your mind.

139
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,541
But I don't wanna be a
horse monster forever...!

140
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,500
Help me!

141
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,708
If you really want help,

142
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,666
then swear you'll never go
near my brother again!

143
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,916
Never...!
I love Big Brother!

144
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:56,125
Don't you dare say you
love him, you stupid head!

145
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,791
Ah! It's off...!

146
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,125
You just broke the curse!

147
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,000
That's what you get, turd!

148
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,333
Why you... you... you what...?

149
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,833
Ho bag!

150
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,333
Yozora, I've
got an idea...

151
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,958
Since you don't want your
swimsuit to go to waste,

152
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,375
how 'bout we go
to the beach?

153
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,708
But that place is packed
to the brim with people.

154
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,333
We could always go to my
family's private beach instead.

155
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,958
-Wait... Private beach?
-Yeah...

156
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,291
We've got a place
right by the water.

157
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,208
It Figures... Rich girl.

158
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,125
Well... To be
completely honest,

159
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,333
I've only been
there one time,

160
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,875
back when I was
little kid...

161
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,541
Besides, it's so far away

162
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,250
you have to plan
to stay overnight.

163
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,625
Hold on... Does that mean
we'd be able to go out there

164
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,125
and hold a training camp
sometime over the summer?

165
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,625
Oh yeah...
I guess we could...

166
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,416
Actually, that
sounds really fun.

167
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,708
Like an overnight
club field trip!

168
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,791
Plus... This could be
a perfect experience

169
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,375
to prepare all of us

170
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,416
for what life will be like
when we become 'happy people.'

171
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,166
Sounds good...

172
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,041
I'll ask my Daddy then.

173
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,375
So... It's okay
to set it up...?

174
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,916
Does anyone have any
plans they know about?

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,333
I'm guessing we're free...

176
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,375
I mean, let's face it,

177
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,916
it's not like
we have any friends.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,166
Way to bring the
whole room down.

179
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,958
But wait... I don't know
what a training camp is?

180
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,041
Huh. We will need
an advisor...

181
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,041
Good point.

182
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,458
It's still piping hot and
it's still very crowded.

183
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,666
If you're planning on
making a trip to the beach

184
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,375
with your
friends or family,

185
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,458
you better get there
early and grab a spot,

186
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,791
-Hey.
-Uh... Hello?

187
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,833
Hi there...

188
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,833
This is Sena Kashiwazaki...

189
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,625
Is Kodaka available?

190
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,875
Relax, Sena...

191
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,291
Don't you know this is
my cell phone number?

192
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,541
Huh?

193
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,458
Oh yeah. Right, I knew that.

194
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,000
So... What's going on?

195
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,041
Uh, are you free today by
any chance? Kobato, too?

196
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,041
Yeah, just have to drop
by the club after lunch.

197
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,000
Great! Then come
to my house!

198
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,500
Why? Do you remember
what you said before...?

199
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,750
About wanting to pay
respects to my father?

200
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,708
Yeah, but this is
kind of outta nowhere.

201
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,208
Well... The thing is,

202
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,083
when I asked him about us
using the summer house,

203
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,375
I mentioned your name...

204
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,916
And now Daddy says he
wants to meet you 'asap.'

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,583
-How come?
-I don't know...

206
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,916
Would you mind
coming over?

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,875
Uh... Yeah, I'll be there.

208
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,916
Great, I guess all you'll
need are directions then.

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,666
Cool, let me
write them down.

210
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,125
The due date's written
down on the card,

211
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,208
He won't be there?

212
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,041
Oh, wow.

213
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,291
All right, here we go.

214
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,708
Um... Hello.

215
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,291
Good day to you both.

216
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,166
Thank you for coming
all this way...

217
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,166
I am President
of the Academy...

218
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,208
But I moonlight
as Sena's Dad, too.

219
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,083
Uh... It's very nice
to meet you, sir...

220
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,791
My name is Kodaka...

221
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,958
This is my younger
sister, Kobato.

222
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,333
Has anyone told you

223
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,625
that you look exactly
like your father...?

224
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,208
This one's lucky enough
to have Airi's lovely face.

225
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:53,750
Please dine with us...

226
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,833
Come...

227
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:55,916
This way.

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,791
Sir. Wait...
It's extremely rude

229
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,833
to invite someone
into your home

230
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,708
without giving them
your name first.

231
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,916
Right...
I'm Mister... Kashiwazki.

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,083
That's my name...

233
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,333
But you can call
me 'heaven stud.'

234
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,708
Wait, 'heaven stud?'

235
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,375
That's really your name?

236
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,208
No, his name's Pegasus.

237
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,458
Pegasus?

238
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,083
How dare you insult
me by calling me that?!

239
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,500
Sorry...

240
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,791
It's... just...

241
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,208
people made fun of me
a lot in high school...

242
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,500
I'm real sensitive.

243
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,125
No... I understand.

244
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,208
My name's Stella,

245
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,416
I'm the official
steward of this house.

246
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,041
Steward?

247
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,833
Please don't stare
at me like that, sir,

248
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,291
it makes me uncomfortable...

249
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,041
I fear you might
get me pregnant.

250
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,833
Is a steward the same
thing as a butler?

251
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,541
At first I thought
Stella was Sena's mother.

252
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,458
Sorry this is
all so new to me.

253
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,791
My wife's currently
vacationing around the world.

254
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,041
I gotta say I'm surprised,

255
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,083
it's not very often
you take the time

256
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,708
to greet our guests
at the door, Daddy.

257
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,250
That's true.

258
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,250
He's been very anxious
about meeting the two of you;

259
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,333
he's hasn't stopped
talking about it all week.

260
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,791
Hey... I have not been
anxious about anything...!

261
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,750
Now bring out the
damn food already!

262
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,166
As you wish, sir.

263
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,500
Wow!

264
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,833
Everybody, dig in.

265
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,291
Thanks for the food...!

266
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,375
-Yay!
-Go ahead...

267
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,916
Eat as much as you like!

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,666
Don't forget manners... Okay?

269
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,125
Thanks for the food.

270
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,041
Oh yeah...
Thanks for the food.

271
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,250
Umm... Sir...

272
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,083
Thank you for helping us
get into the academy...

273
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,541
It seems like my Dad asked
you for a pretty big favor.

274
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,500
That's true
it was indeed...

275
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,875
Right when the entrance
season is over,

276
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,500
I hear from him...

277
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,500
That idiot father of yours
called me up outta the blue

278
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,583
and all but demanded,

279
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,833
"You better let my
son and daughter

280
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,750
in that fancy
school of yours."

281
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,833
Well... I'm very
sorry about that.

282
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,458
You two aren't
exactly the same...

283
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,416
Unlike him, you know
what manners are.

284
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,250
That's right...! Here...

285
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,083
It's our way of
saying thank you.

286
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,375
Well, what is it?

287
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,625
A world-famous
spicy sesame oil...

288
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,583
Next time you cook a meal,
add in a little bit of this,

289
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,416
and I promise you
won't regret it.

290
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,750
Thank you?

291
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,291
Trust me, it can make
everything taste better...

292
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,791
It goes good with rice,
pasta, really anything...

293
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,250
Even Kobato likes it
and she hates spicy food.

294
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,750
Do you mind if I open one?

295
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,083
Please, go ahead.

296
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,375
That's good!

297
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,625
You're right...!
This stuff is awesome!

298
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,583
Glad you like it.

299
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,250
Me too! I want some!

300
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,375
Well... Then your big sister
will feed you some more!

301
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,625
Well...

302
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,166
Maybe you're more like
him than I thought;

303
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,375
he was always
the master of

304
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,541
finding unusual
spices for his food.

305
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,375
Thank you... I guess
that's what happens

306
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,541
when you move around from
town to town your whole life...

307
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,041
He's out traveling right
now, as a matter of fact.

308
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,125
After all these years,
the man's not changed...

309
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,708
I'm not surprised.

310
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,625
That must've been
hard on you kids.

311
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,916
Unbelievable...

312
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,083
Devoting his wasted life
to digging up ruins,

313
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,666
and then dragging his own
kids into it, the scum.

314
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,083
He's not scum!

315
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,375
Uh... I'm sorry.

316
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,875
Sir... I don't think it's
fair to call my dad scum.

317
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,000
He's just a
hardworking guy.

318
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, you don't have
to tell me, I know.

319
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,958
Stay here...?
Tonight?

320
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,875
It's not an
imposition at all.

321
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,041
Uh... It's not that,
it's just...

322
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,500
Actually, on weekends,
the buses stop at eight...

323
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,791
So it looks like you don't
have much choice in the matter.

324
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,958
Huh?

325
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,833
If you absolutely have
to get home tonight...

326
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,458
I suppose it's possible
I could give you a ride.

327
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,500
But honestly,
it would be a pain.

328
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,250
Right... We don't
want that, do we?

329
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,291
Come on, just stay over.

330
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,708
But... We didn't bring
pajamas or anything.

331
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,916
That's no excuse,
you can wear mine...!

332
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,166
That's what your
old man used to do

333
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,708
whenever he spent the night.

334
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,666
And Kobato, I've got
an old pair of p.j.'s

335
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,208
that would fit
you perfectly.

336
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,458
Umm... Well...
But where will we...?

337
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,541
We have a guest room
you can sleep in.

338
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,708
I don't know.

339
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,291
Thank you for
the kind offer.

340
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,708
She's cute when
she's sleeping, too.

341
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,750
Don't touch her,
you'll wake her up.

342
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,541
My Daddy likes you...

343
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,958
I'm surprised, that doesn't
happen often at all...

344
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,291
It's been a
long time since

345
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,041
I've seen him in a
good mood like this.

346
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,791
I'd hate to see
his bad mood.

347
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,041
He really loved you.

348
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,500
Uh... Bro...

349
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,916
What happened,
where are we?

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,666
You're at my
house, silly...

351
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,208
How about you and me take
a bath together before bed?

352
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,708
A bath...
But why?

353
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,625
Uh... Hey... Kobato...

354
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,208
It wouldn't hurt
you to skip a night.

355
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,541
Come on, let's get
you cleaned up!

356
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,458
President.

357
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,541
Care for a nightcap?

358
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,333
I appreciate it, sir, but
the thing is, I'm a minor.

359
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,833
Relax, will ya?
It's regular grape juice...

360
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,500
Have a drink with me.

361
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,208
I don't know about this.

362
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,958
Mine...? It's
the real deal...

363
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,375
Sure you don't
wanna trade?

364
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,125
No, it's like I said,
I'm a minor...

365
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm just kidding.

366
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,916
Back in the day
when we were students,

367
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,750
your Dad and I drank this
stuff by the barrel.

368
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,208
That's cool, I guess I'm
standing in for my Dad.

369
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,291
Way to take it down, son!

370
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,041
Hey, it's just
grape juice, right?

371
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,916
Uh... Are you gonna be okay?

372
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,583
Huh...?! I'm fine... Why?

373
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,250
He chugged it
down like water!

374
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,250
Back in our shtuden daysh

375
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,666
yo dad and I used to
love to dwink dis...

376
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,125
A... Lot!

377
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,125
Back in our shtuden
daish we used to drink!

378
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,791
Back in the day...

379
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,208
We used to sdrink...

380
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,416
It was good...

381
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,750
Ah ha!

382
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,958
You all right...?!

383
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,750
Please sir, you've
really gotta wake up!

384
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,000
Uh... How do you feel?

385
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,583
Wonder if I should
let Stella know?

386
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,041
What's wrong?

387
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,750
Big bro!

388
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,208
What happened to you?

389
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,875
Uh. Kobato, wait...!
Don't run away!

390
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,333
Oww.

391
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,958
What in the world are you doing
out here, spying on me...?!

392
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,250
You stupid, perverted,
disgusting, molesting,

393
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,166
peeping Tom freak boy!

394
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,333
Hey that's no way to talk

395
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,125
to one of your father's
guests, is it?!

396
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,208
My life is over!

397
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,416
Why'd she go outside?

398
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,833
Beats the heck outta me.

399
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,166
Well, well, well...

400
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,750
Looks like
Kodaka's a pervert.

401
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,333
No way, this isn't what
it looks like, I promise!

402
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,791
Don't worry, I know.

403
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,125
Come... Let's get
you to bed...

404
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,583
While you still
have a chance.

405
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,583
Wait... The President
got drunk on wine

406
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,041
and fell asleep in there.

407
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,000
Once he's out,
there's no way

408
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,416
he'll get out of
bed till morning,

409
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,958
especially when he's
been drinking heavily.

410
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,750
I'll put her to bed in
the servant's quarters,

411
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,208
she should be just fine there
for the rest of the night...

412
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,083
I'm very sorry but
there's no more room...

413
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,250
You and the master
of the house

414
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,625
are going to have to
share a bed tonight.

415
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,708
Um... Can I sleep in
the servant room?

416
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,166
I sleep naked and don't
wanna get pregnant.

417
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,041
Fine then, I'll just
go sleep with him.

418
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,875
You and my Dad used to
drink wine together

419
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,208
back in the old days...

420
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,958
Cool.

421
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,291
There's no question...

422
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,666
The President
thinks of my Dad

423
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,666
as being one of the closest
friends he's ever had.

424
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,958
That makes sense...

425
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,541
I guess that's why Dad
felt comfortable

426
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,208
leaving me and Kobato behind
to go off on his own.

427
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,666
It does make you think...

428
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,041
I wonder if I'll ever make a
friend like that someday.

429
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,833
Well, we're off...

430
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,500
Thank you so much for letting
us both stay the night.

431
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,541
Of course.

432
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,333
Kobato.

433
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,791
Uh... Okay...

434
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,666
Um... Thank you...

435
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,333
The food was good.

436
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,250
You're welcome here
anytime you like.

437
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,166
Thanks, that's very kind.

438
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,000
Next time, how about we take
another hot bath together?

439
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,458
No!

440
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,791
Nooooooooo!

441
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,708
She's freaked...

442
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:35,875
What did you do to her?

443
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,291
Don't look at me,
I didn't do a thing!

444
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,583
That aside... Kodaka?

445
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,583
What's up?

446
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,458
Uh... Well I...

447
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,791
I wanted to talk to you about
what happened last night.

448
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,208
What do you mean?

449
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,541
It's all a blur...

450
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,208
Your Dad made me chug wine
with him after dinner...

451
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,291
I can't remember a
single thing that happened.

452
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,666
Did I do something?

453
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,625
Uh... Well...

454
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,666
No.

455
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,041
Nothing at all!

456
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,083
Hey, Kobato...!
Wait for me!

457
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,666
Sometimes it's best to
say you don't remember,

458
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,875
even if it is a lie.

459
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,125
-Oh, Kodaka?
-Yeah?

460
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,750
Hey... Let go of me!

461
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,375
Do this much...

462
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,000
Take care of my daughter.

463
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,791
Yes, of course.

464
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,958
Pegasus.

465
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,291
You twerp!

466
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,416
I gotta go...

467
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,416
Thank you so much.

468
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,083
Stella, what are you...?!

469
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,083
All right!

470
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:32,375
[Music]

471
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,291
When I woke up
in the morning,

472
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,375
an old man's sleeping face

473
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,458
was only centimeters
away from me!

474
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:05,958
Hayato! Oh no, you say my
Dad's name in your sleep!

475
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,000
Where did you come from?
Why are you in my bed?

476
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,333
What in the name of everything
holy is going on here?!

477
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,916
I'm Kodaka,
Hayato's son,

478
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,208
and this is supposed
to be my bed!

479
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,416
You're the one
who got wasted and...

480
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,458
So you're saying
nothing happened?!

481
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,416
Sorry, you're not my type!

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,791
Next. No one sleeps at camp!

00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,625
Really? If you're telling
me little white lies,

484
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,625
I swear, I will
never forgive you.

485
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,166
That's actually kinda cute.
