1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,333
-This is some view up here.
-Yeah.

2
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,833
As long as you
and I are friends,

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:25,291
then as far as I'm concerned,
I don't need anyone else.

4
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,458
I'll always be here
by your side...

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,375
Even if the whole world
turns its back on you.

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,416
Don't say things like that,
it's so embarrassing.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,625
Hey.

8
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,625
I think you should
have a nick name...

9
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,166
What do you want
me to call you?

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,000
A nick name huh...?

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,083
What about Sora?

12
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,583
You should call me...

13
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,666
Taka.

14
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,625
You're so slow, Taka!

15
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,083
No fair, wait up!

16
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,250
Another dream?

17
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,666
You're such a slow poke!

18
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,458
No, I'm not...

19
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm fast.

20
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,458
I'm fast.

21
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,666
So weird...

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,208
I can't remember.

23
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:34,375
[Music]

24
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,166
Only one more week of
summer vacation left.

25
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,625
But I've been
a good student,

26
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,333
and I'm almost done with
all of my prep work.

27
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,291
I forgot to tell you.

28
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,333
I heard about a summer festival
that is starting tomorrow

29
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,666
at the shrine near the
Tooya shopping district.

30
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,083
A festival, huh?

31
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,041
And... Is that all?

32
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,291
I don't understand.

33
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,083
Is there a reason
you're telling us that?

34
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,750
Well. I'm pretty sure I saw
a flyer hanging somewhere

35
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,083
on my way to school yesterday

36
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,208
and I didn't know if any
of you guys had heard yet.

37
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,250
Thanks for passing
that info on...

38
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,041
I guess I was hoping
you were gonna suggest

39
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,708
we all go to the
festival together.

40
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,541
Why in the world would
I ever waste my time

41
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,833
going to a stupid,
over-crowded event like that?

42
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,416
Rika's with you there.

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,875
A couple of years ago,

44
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,541
Rika decided to go to the
biannual anime festival in Tokyo

45
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,041
thinking it might
be a lotta fun,

46
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,125
but boy was she wrong...

47
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,416
The train was so
cramped with people,

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,958
Rika could barely move.

49
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,541
She got off at the halfway
point and went home.

50
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,500
Rika learned her lesson:
no more festivals.

51
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,500
I've actually heard
of that festival...

52
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,208
People say it's
ridiculously crowded

53
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,500
because it's the only place

54
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,875
you can buy these exotic,
special edition books.

55
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,166
As big a fan as you are,

56
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,958
I'm surprised you
didn't stick it out.

57
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,791
Are you questioning
Rika's fandom right now?

58
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,375
That really chaps her hide!

59
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,625
And making a
girl's hide chapped

60
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,958
is not a very
gentlemanly thing to do!

61
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,333
There's no need to drag this
conversation into the gutter!

62
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,541
Do you know who
you're speaking to?

63
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,416
Without the gutter,
Rika has nothing left!

64
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,333
You could talk about science
or all your inventions.

65
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,000
Or how you're a cool girl
with awesome glasses.

66
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,125
You really should give
yourself more credit.

67
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,916
Rika needs her glasses
to learn science

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,250
so she can sell
her inventions

69
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,708
in order to pay for her
expensive smut habit!

70
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,583
This is who
Rika really is!

71
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,208
Besides, Rika has plenty of
contacts in the anime world

72
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,291
because of her
scientific capabilities,

73
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,875
so she gets special edition
volumes whenever she wants.

74
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,500
In fact, the only reason

75
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,458
she works with these
companies in the first place

76
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,208
is for all the
free cartoon porn!

77
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,041
I'll never doubt
your fandom again,

78
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,708
I can tell you
that much for sure.

79
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,208
Told you.

80
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,291
Uh... Hey, Kodaka?

81
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,666
At these festivals,
do they sell food...?

82
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,958
'Cause... if they have Octopus
Dumpling booths, I'm in!

83
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm not sure
about Octopus,

84
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,250
but there's plenty
to eat there.

85
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,166
Wait, do you actually
like Octopus Dumplings?

86
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,750
Why...? You don't?

87
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,583
I do... Those dumplings
are my favorite.

88
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,708
Way back... When I was
a little kid in Osaka,

89
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,333
I didn't really fit in
with the people around me,

90
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,208
and I guess you could say
I was a bit depressed.

91
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,125
But my Dad used to bring me
home these Octopus dumplings

92
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,750
from this famous store.

93
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,125
And it became
my comfort food.

94
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,500
They say, "Octopus
dumplings every day,

95
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,625
keeps the depression away."

96
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,208
They're great...

97
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,333
Although. I can't
stomach those bastards

98
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,041
who sell crappy octopus
dumplings with a straight face!

99
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,833
Hey... Calm down,
it's just food...!

100
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,291
I agree they're super yummy,

101
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,750
but it's not worth working
yourself into a frenzy over.

102
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,000
They taste really good,

103
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,791
let's just leave
it at that, okay?

104
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,708
I love them so much,

105
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,041
if you want to buy me
some as a present,

106
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,583
I would totally let you.

107
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,916
Do you really want me to
get you Octopus dumplings?

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Dumplings rule!

109
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:13,083
Big bro...! If she gets them,
then I get them too!

110
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,666
Looks like it's a
done deal then...

111
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,208
We're going to
the summer festival.

112
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,291
Yeah!

113
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,291
Octopus is probably
against your religion...

114
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,250
Maybe you should
stay home, freak!

115
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,833
Big bro and I are going alone,
you vampire scum...!

116
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,000
You should stay home...

117
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:26,958
-Don't ruin our date!
-Me too...

118
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,250
I wanna go...

119
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,625
Yeah...! Dumplings
would hit the spot!

120
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,958
Same here...

121
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,916
I'd like to come, if
that's all right with you.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,541
Of course.

123
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,375
So... That brings our group to
five people total... How fun!

124
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,833
-Hold on a second!
-Just hold your horses!

125
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,916
I'm not gonna be the
only one to miss out!

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,791
Guess that makes
it seven...

127
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,291
I thought you two
didn't like crowds.

128
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,041
We like Octopus dumplings!

129
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,916
All right...

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,166
Now that's a commitment to
food if I've ever seen it.

131
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,750
Kodaka, we're over here!

132
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,750
Hey...! Here early as usual.

133
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,166
Rika?

134
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,375
Look what you can do when
you put your mind to it.

135
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,458
Is that some kind of
back handed compliment?!

136
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,625
If you're gonna
be insulting,

137
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,500
just come out with it!

138
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,125
I think you look
really nice.

139
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,333
Thank you very much,

140
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,708
that's such a lovely
thing for you to say.

141
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,166
You're going to
make Rika blush.

142
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,333
I guess I can't win
with you, can I?

143
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,625
Since we're just
missing Meat

144
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,375
there's no point
in waiting around...

145
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,041
Let's move out, she'll
have to catch up to us.

146
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,750
Trying to leave me
behind, are you?

147
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,375
You're so rude!

148
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,000
That figures. Never can be
too careful around you...

149
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,250
Well, I'm here now,

150
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,916
so let's get this party
started, shall we?

151
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,500
What the heck was that for?

152
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,791
Don't worry about it...

153
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,083
Come on guys, let's go!

154
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,125
Hey...! Wait for us!

155
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,625
What's the matter
with you, Kodaka...?

156
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,458
It's tradition for girls to wear
Yukatas to summer festivals.

157
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,625
So why didn't you
make Kobato wear one?

158
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,916
It's not like she's
required to wear a Yukata;

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,791
I mean look at Yozora;
she didn't wear hers.

160
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,666
Please, let's not bring
commoners into this...

161
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,166
Listen: I wanna
see Kobato wearing

162
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,666
one of those
robes right now!

163
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,083
I hate to disappoint you

164
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,291
but Kobato doesn't
own a Yukata.

165
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,750
Kodaka!

166
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,916
Rika has good news:

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,208
there's a shop right here

168
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,541
where you guys can purchase
whatever you need.

169
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,750
That's perfect!

170
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,250
You wanna wear a Yukata

171
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,000
just like the rest
of us girls don't you?

172
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,375
What do you say we give
it a shot and try some on?

173
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,791
Kay.

174
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's make it quick though,
I'm hungry for octopus.

175
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,833
I hope you have to spend
the rest of eternity in there

176
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:35,916
and never get to eat!

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,333
Oh yeah...?!
Eat this, bloodsucker!

178
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,041
They'll never give up.

179
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,291
Yukimura...

180
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,916
Go on ahead and
buy some dumplings

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,708
so we can avoid
all this drama.

182
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,041
That sounds like a plan...

183
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,708
And thanks for trusting
me to be your gopher;

184
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,000
I won't let you down.

185
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,958
You should probably
buy one too.

186
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,750
Thanks for the advice,
but I'm okay.

187
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,625
Your good looks are your only
redeeming quality, you know...?

188
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,000
You really should take
advantage of that.

189
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah... Sena's right...

190
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,166
A Yukata would
really compliment

191
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,458
your long, beautiful hair,
don't you think?

192
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,458
Uh.... No.

193
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,500
Thank you.

194
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,166
But that's not
really my style.

195
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,125
Too bad she won't wear one,

196
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,750
I bet she'd
look beautiful.

197
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,083
Big bro!

198
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,583
She's so cute.
She's just adorable...

199
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,708
Oh, I wanna gobble
her to pieces!

200
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,416
I think you look great.

201
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,916
She looks better
than great...

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,833
She's the cutest little
thing I've ever seen in my life

203
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,250
and you'd better
be nice to her

204
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,125
and tell her as much or else,
do you understand me?

205
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,416
You heard me tell you
I loved it, right?

206
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,000
But you on the
other hand...

207
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,458
You look completely
ridiculous

208
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,291
with your pudding colored hair
clashing with that robe.

209
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,416
My hair?

210
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,916
Specifically the color.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,333
You're a laughing
stock at school.

212
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,875
Literally everyone
makes fun of you.

213
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,458
Maybe you should
try making it black.

214
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,750
Funny you should
mention that,

215
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,000
I've actually considered dyeing
it a different color before.

216
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,625
But the thing is, my mom's
hair looked just like this.

217
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,500
And she's gone.

218
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,125
Oh... Right.

219
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,958
You see... For the most part
I'm a spitting image of my Dad,

220
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,208
but the hair's
my Mom's...

221
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,375
Sometimes, I wish I
looked more like Kobato,

222
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,000
she's got her face, her hair

223
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,125
and basically
everything else too.

224
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,041
Since my hair is the only
thing I got from my mother

225
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,833
that you can tell
by looking at me,

226
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,458
it'd be way too difficult
to ever let it go.

227
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,166
Dyeing it another color
would feel like

228
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,625
turning my back on
where I came from,

229
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,833
and who I really am.

230
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,083
They can make fun of me...

231
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,166
But I like my hair,

232
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,875
'cause it always
makes me think of her.

233
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,708
That's so cool.

234
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,541
There's no question...

235
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,250
You're way different from
the other boys at school.

236
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,166
Come on...!
Let's go have fun!

237
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,541
Ready to go?

238
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,625
Hey... We've been
looking for you.

239
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,625
Sorry we're so late!

240
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,500
That's okay!

241
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,500
It's so good!

242
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,291
It's rude to talk
with your mouth full.

243
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,833
These Octopus
Dumplings are amazing!

244
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,041
You're so tiny, how
can you eat that much?

245
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,250
I think I've died and
gone to food heaven!

246
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,375
Huh...? Be lady-like,
that is no way to eat!

247
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,416
Rika's practicing her
erotic eating techniques

248
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,875
on this banana.

249
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,833
Are you getting turned on?

250
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,083
Not at all, no.

251
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,833
Here... Have some of mine...

252
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:55,875
-Ahh!
-No!

253
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,541
Something's not right.

254
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,333
Here you go.

255
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,666
Sorry to keep you waiting.

256
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,500
Oh... That's okay.

257
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,375
For you.

258
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,041
Hey thanks a lot.

259
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,458
Let's see here...

260
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,041
I wonder how this
one will taste.

261
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,375
Well what do you think...?

262
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,458
Is it good?

263
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,875
It's got a light
fluffy texture,

264
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,958
but the thin skin ruins
the whole experience.

265
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,458
Plus there's not enough
Octopus meat inside.

266
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,500
It sucks.

267
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,875
This is all my fault.

268
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,500
Gross... Come on you guys,

269
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,875
let's all look for a better
octopus dumpling stand!

270
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,791
Count me out I think
I've had enough.

271
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,000
Rika feels the same.

272
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,708
Sounds great...!
I'm still hungry,

273
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,916
I wanna eat that thing
that looks like a cloud!

274
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,333
Thanks for buying
me all that food;

275
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,541
everything was awesome!

276
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,375
Yeah I'm completely
stuffed after that.

277
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,041
But hold on...

278
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,000
You guys...! You said
you wanted to eat

279
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,250
delicious octopus dumplings,

280
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,291
didn't you?!

281
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,041
If I eat more, I'll puke.

282
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,541
Then why the heck did we
come here in the first place?!

283
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,833
I think we've all had plenty
to eat, right everyone?

284
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,958
-Let's go home.
-Good idea.

285
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,458
No you can't leave yet!

286
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,083
You're not the boss
of us, okay Meat...?

287
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,833
Besides, what else is
there to do here?

288
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,416
No one's leaving
till I say so!

289
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,916
Yeah... you can't go...!

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,041
We're here, we might as well
stick around and play games!

291
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,708
If you wanna
scoop up goldfish

292
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,791
and throw rings like a little
child, you can be my guest!

293
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,333
Hey... I'm not a little kid,

294
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,375
I just like to have fun...

295
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,250
I was going to ask you
to compete against me

296
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,916
in a 'head to head' festival
gaming competition.

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,750
But since you're a chicken,
I won't waste my breath.

298
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,375
I already told you,

299
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,000
there's nothing I hate more than
being around a massive crowd.

300
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,625
But I'm not afraid
of you, Meat!

301
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,750
Besides... This place...?

302
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,458
Compared to how crazy the
pool was the other day

303
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,000
it's a piece of cake...

304
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,041
I think it's about time I give
you a little reality check,

305
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,333
what do you say?

306
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, I suppose
I'll let you try...

307
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,625
So what game should
we play first...?

308
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,916
I'm an expert at
scooping gold fish.

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,250
What I mean to say is...

310
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,166
I challenge you to
a goldfish showdown!

311
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,875
I hate to break it to you,
but when it comes to goldfish,

312
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,125
I'm the queen of the pond!

313
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,458
Sorry to shatter
your delusion,

314
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,708
but the only thing you're
queen of is the morons...

315
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,125
Time to find out
who's number one!

316
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,833
Here's your money, sir.

317
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,625
Thanks...! Here ya go!

318
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,375
Thank you!

319
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,291
Go!

320
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,041
Hey, it tore...!
This is all a rip off!

321
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,291
Yeah, because it's
made outta paper...

322
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,708
The idea's to catch a
fish without tearing it.

323
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,708
Crap!

324
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,875
Come on... Just stop
moving so I can catch you,

325
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,291
you stupid little gold fish.

326
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,041
After I win, I'm gonna
make you pay me back

327
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,625
for all the money it'll
cost me to beat you

328
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,000
in this dumb competition!

329
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,666
I'll take ten more please.

330
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,958
Sure thing.

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
All right...!

332
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,208
That's cheating,
you can't do that!

333
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,333
I prefer to think of
it as 'sound strategy.'

334
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,583
I'm real sorry Miss,

335
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,666
but I don't allow
cheating at this booth...

336
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,458
Take a hike before
someone sees you,

337
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,083
and I can let you off
the hook this time.

338
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,541
Be thankful I
rescued you, fishy.

339
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,375
I've decided I'm gonna call
you 'Kandata' from now on...

340
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,083
You're lucky you made
it outta there alive.

341
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,416
Meat. We're gonna
do that next.

342
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,083
It doesn't matter
what we play,

343
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,833
because in the end
you're going down.

344
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,291
Try not cheating this time...!

345
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,500
Let's go!

346
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,041
-Okay, you're on!
-They're nuts...

347
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,875
Come on, why don't you
leave those two alone,

348
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,125
and come play some
games with us?

349
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,625
That's way too
simple, you idiot!

350
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,166
-Sounds fun!
-Awesome!

351
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,208
Yay! I'm gonna play
with my big bro!

352
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,875
Check it out, my water balloon's
way bigger than yours is!

353
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,166
Well, mine's a
whole lot prettier

354
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,541
so I guess I win,
you big stupid face!

355
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,125
Oh come on!

356
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,291
You seriously think you
beat me with that crap?!

357
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,541
Anyone with eyes could see
I dominated you back there!

358
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,666
Your umbrella looked
like a spaceship!

359
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,583
You're pathetic, Meat!

360
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,916
I'm not cut out for puny
detail work like that anyway!

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,250
Right there!

362
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,708
Let's settle this at
the roulette wheel!

363
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,000
Wait: sauce rice crackers?

364
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,166
Oh, fine!

365
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,333
Rika did good!

366
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,208
Wow... nice shot!

367
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,833
Okay...

368
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,000
Here. The special prize.

369
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,083
Hey, guess what...!

370
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,041
Rika already has
this gaming system,

371
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,958
so she's going to give
it to you as a present...

372
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,750
Please think of Rika
whenever you play it

373
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:19,166
and let her know if
she can help you out!

374
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,500
Wait... Why don't we
put it in the club room?

375
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,416
Yeah...

376
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,833
That sounds like
a good plan.

377
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,666
Boobs...!That
was a dirty trick!

378
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,125
Oh, shut up!

379
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,125
A win's a win,
don't be a sore loser!

380
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,291
How can you call
that a win, you jerk?!

381
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,000
Hey...! You two get
the hell outta here!

382
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,750
Take one.

383
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,708
Thanks a lot, Rika
really appreciates it.

384
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,791
There you are!

385
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,791
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

386
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,000
We're going to need
somebody to help

387
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,333
with all of
the stuff we won.

388
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,041
These stupid prizes are
really getting in the way

389
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,333
of our show down.

390
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,583
So we want you to carry
them... Right now.

391
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,666
No, I can't... I've
got my own things here.

392
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,708
What...? Is that
a game system?

393
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,000
But... How?

394
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,541
This is all courtesy
of 'bulls eye Rika.'

395
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,583
Neither of us
came out on top.

396
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,083
True... But if we would've kept
playing until the bitter end,

397
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,416
I feel confident
I would've won.

398
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,875
That's crap
and you know it!

399
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,250
Did you forget?
I'm ahead by one win, dummy!

400
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,791
Please, the gold fish
scoop doesn't count

401
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,000
because you cheated.

402
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,833
Let's go find Yukimura
and the girls.

403
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,500
I'll be waiting at the
west gate of the shrine.

404
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,416
So Stella said she was
cool to come get you?

405
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,083
But, because of all
the Festival traffic,

406
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,375
she told me
she doesn't know

407
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,833
how long it's gonna
take her to get here.

408
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,666
Oh.

409
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,958
Well, since we're
killing time,

410
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,583
why don't we go shoot
off some fireworks?

411
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,708
They have tons!

412
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,708
-For real?!!!
-Sounds like fun...

413
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,000
Besides, summer's almost over;

414
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,750
this could be our
only opportunity!

415
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,041
This is totally awesome,

416
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,375
I've never shot off
actual fireworks before...

417
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,083
Let's do this thing!

418
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,166
Okay, I'll buy a bucket
and some candles!

419
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,125
Here we go.

420
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,541
Wow...

421
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,083
It's on fire...

422
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,750
It's really on
fire, you guys!

423
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,416
Now, gaze upon my secret fire
magic technique, church lady...!

424
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,208
Burn in the fire of purgatory
and die in obscurity...!

425
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,708
Megiddo flame!

426
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,750
I know that trick, too!

427
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,583
Stop it, no copying me!

428
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,083
So cool...

429
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,583
Rika will take up an interest
in fireworks after this.

430
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,333
Our lives are exactly
like these sparklers...

431
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,208
They shine on,
big and bright...

432
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,083
But the beauty of it
only lasts an instant

433
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,875
before it dies
out completely.

434
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,583
Look, triple sparklers!

435
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,875
Oh grow up;
three is child's play!

436
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,833
Oh, that's beautiful!

437
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,833
Rika is ready for liftoff!

438
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,041
Well, we saved the
best one for last.

439
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,666
This is gonna
be incredible!

440
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,958
That's it?

441
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,291
An utter disappointment
just like our friend Meat there.

442
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,166
And what exactly do
you mean by that?!

443
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,291
Right when I'd given
up on it completely,

444
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,583
it comes through in the end.

445
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,208
Yeah, like me.

446
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,416
That comment wasn't about
you in any way whatsoever.

447
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,208
Look, it's still going...

448
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,916
Rika thinks we're getting
our money's worth.

449
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,625
Hey guys... Is it me,
or does something stink?

450
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,041
You're right...

451
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,750
Rika doesn't think
that's gunpowder either.

452
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,250
Yozora, it's your hair!

453
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,208
It's on fire!

454
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,250
Stop, drop and roll!

455
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,500
Quick, we need water!

456
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,291
-Turn around, Yozora!
-Hurry!

457
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,375
Good job...
You put it out.

458
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,333
Yozora...!
Are you all right?

459
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,666
No.

460
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,083
That poor thing.

461
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,000
For the rest of
summer vacation,

462
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,541
we didn't see Yozora at all.

463
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,958
Not once.

464
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,791
She didn't even
show up to the club.

465
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,791
-Danabe.
-Here.

466
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,208
-Tsuda.
-Here.

467
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,541
-Hasegawa.
-Yeah.

468
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,375
-Hirasawa.
-Here.

469
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,166
-Fujioka.
-Here.

470
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,708
-Horiguchi.
-Here.

471
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,625
-Matsushita.
-Yozora.

472
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,166
Mikazuki.

473
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,416
Here.

474
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,875
Well... You made it
in the nick of time...

475
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,416
If I were you
I'd take a seat.

476
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,333
Yes, sir.

477
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,166
Sora?

478
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,916
It's been a while...

479
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,958
Taka.

480
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,333
She's right.

481
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,125
Ten long years...

482
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,541
Feels like forever.

483
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:32,333
[Music]

484
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,250
So, after the summer
festival fireworks incident,

485
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,583
Yozora didn't show up
at the club like usual.

486
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,958
Ahh! The club room is
so much more relaxing

487
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,000
without that stupid
vixen hanging around!

488
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,958
Chill out, that's not a nice
thing to say, you know?!

489
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,375
Sorry, the
truth's the truth!

490
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,666
This is a problem for me!

491
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,625
I need Yozora here
or I'll go nuts!

492
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:14,916
Just tell me
what's the matter.

493
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
She's how I get
my potato chips!

494
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,625
Oh... Right.

495
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,708
Next time, folks...

496
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,500
We don't have
many friends.

497
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,791
You know, without her here,
it's actually so relaxing,

498
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,208
I'm kinda bored.
