1
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,250
Oh, look. It's about
freakin' time.

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,541
Oh, hey.

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,958
What's up, Kashiwazaki?

4
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,000
Call me Sena.

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,541
Gah.

6
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,750
Uh. You call harpy face by
her first name, don't you?

7
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,166
But for whatever reason

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,916
you feel the need to
squeeze out five syllables

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,541
when you want to talk to me.

10
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,250
Okay, fine.

11
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,083
Hey. Sena.

12
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,125
Can we just get this
show on the road already.

13
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:53,166
-Right. Mikazu...
-It's Yozora!

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,208
Kay.

15
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,833
Yozora.

16
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,250
So. How does this
club even work?

17
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,500
We're just supposed
to make friends

18
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,125
even though none
of us know how?

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,250
Oh, I know one way
of making friends.

20
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,416
Video games.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,208
[Music]

22
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,500
So you want us to make
friends with gamers, now?

23
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,833
-Because, why?
-Don't be so judgmental.

24
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,750
Gaming has gone way
beyond mainstream.

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,583
Check it out.

26
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,708
I've got a PSP
plan of attack!

27
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,291
Are you serious?

28
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,125
My little sister has that.

29
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,208
Last night when I went
out to dinner by myself.

30
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,416
You went out to eat alone?

31
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,625
Shut up!

32
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,166
Anyway, four
guys from school

33
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,791
were sitting at
the table behind me.

34
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,333
And they were all playing
this game together.

35
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,166
Nice! Monster Hunting!

36
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,541
Have you played it?

37
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,916
No, but it's your
basic fantasy RPG.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,166
You get to hunt monsters.

39
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,875
But the cool thing is
you have the ability

40
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,166
to play with other
people at the same time.

41
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,333
If you're good at it

42
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,125
other players will
want to play with you,

43
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,208
which you can use as a
way to make new friends.

44
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,125
They let you
exchange items too,

45
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,875
so that's an easy way
to start up conversations

46
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,083
with people you don't know.

47
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,958
I get it. If we play
this game with each other.

48
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,125
We'll have the opportunity

49
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,541
to practice our friendship
making skills!

50
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,458
I'm not gonna make it
any dirtier than you are!

51
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,291
Um. Are you listening to me?

52
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,750
Now, bring your own
PSP in by next Monday.

53
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,375
Then we can all go Monster
Hunting together, you got it?

54
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,041
Sure, why not.

55
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,000
And so, the
following Monday.

56
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,708
You guys have both practiced
using this thing, right?

57
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,166
-Yeah.
-Yep.

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,583
I was busy this weekend.

59
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,833
But I found some time
to mess around with it.

60
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,000
Not for very long,
but you know how it is.

61
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,166
-Such is the life of me.
-Milk Cow.

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,000
Kodoka What level
are you ranked?

63
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,833
I'm at level, one.

64
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,416
I can't seem to kill
any of the bad guys.

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,833
I'm a level three.

66
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,416
Three? Already!

67
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,375
I'm six. Is that good?

68
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,583
-Six?
-Six?

69
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,541
Yeah, that's good.
It's the highest level.

70
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,708
Seriously, how perfect
can one girl get?

71
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,958
I'm even a prodigy
at video games.

72
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,250
I thought you said you didn't
spend that much time on it.

73
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,375
How much "messing
with it" did you do?

74
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,833
Not that much.
I was barely on it at all.

75
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,625
Let me see for
myself, Meat Sacks.

76
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,958
Hey, give that back!

77
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,166
I didn't say you
could look at it!

78
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,250
Are you kidding me?

79
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,541
You were on it for
fifty-three hours?

80
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,291
I have to admit it your
outfit's pretty cute.

81
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,208
Too cute for a lying
show off like you.

82
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,666
What the hell
are you doing?

83
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,666
Look at that.

84
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,500
You've got nasty
bags under your eyes.

85
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,416
I do not!
I don't get bags.

86
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,458
I know exactly what
you're up to Meat.

87
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,583
You played the game the
entire weekend didn't you?

88
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,666
A Tigress devotes herself
to anything she does,

89
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,833
even stupid games.

90
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,416
-Tigress?
-Tigress!

91
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,625
Okay.

92
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,000
That's right.

93
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,250
Now. Let's play
the damn thing.

94
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,791
I don't mind hosting.

95
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,125
I'll even help
you two out

96
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,166
by taking us on an easy
quest, so you're welcome.

97
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,416
She may be another
completely crazy chick,

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,416
but at least she's
serious about the club.

99
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,125
Are you guys ready?
Cause I'm ready.

100
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,416
Sorry that took so long!

101
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,291
What the hell
are you wearing?

102
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,791
Leave me alone;
I'm just a beginner.

103
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,208
I can't help it, okay!

104
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,166
That's no excuse for
your entire character.

105
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,083
It's pathetic he doesn't
even look like you.

106
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,375
Don't take it personal,

107
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,583
but everything we're
looking at is a disaster.

108
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,958
Even your name is cheesy.

109
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,750
When is "Hawk"
ever a good idea?

110
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,833
You guys, shut up!

111
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,166
This is just a game,

112
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,708
so it can be a little bit
different from reality.

113
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,958
A little?

114
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,958
Come on.
Let's go a-hunting!

115
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,833
Looks like we'll get
through this level quickly.

116
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,000
I wonder what I
should kill this time?

117
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,625
What the hell was that?

118
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,250
Oh, silly me.

119
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,416
I guess I just mixed up
all of those buttons.

120
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,916
Oh well. Now get it together
so we can go a-hunting.

121
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,375
Something tells me a
player with her rank

122
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,166
doesn't get the
"buttons mixed up".

123
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,833
She probably spent
all those hours

124
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,291
playing for that one moment.

125
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,333
It was a stupid mistake
I'm not surprised.

126
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,375
Shall we go?

127
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,208
Yay!

128
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,500
What the hell
was that about?

129
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,125
Oopsie. Got my
buttons mixed up.

130
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,458
Whatever? You so
did that on purpose!

131
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,791
I so did not.

132
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,083
You need to relax, Meat.

133
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,125
Paranoia does not
look good on you.

134
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,958
That's it!

135
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,625
Look out! Here it comes!

136
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,250
Oh! Don't worry;
I'll take care of this guy.

137
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,958
Ha. I'm not about to let some
dumb lizard take me down.

138
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:52,166
Get ready,
because I, oh...

139
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,291
Hey! That was a
sleeping potion!

140
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,416
Uh. What are you doing?

141
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,666
Guess.

142
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,833
Awesome! Totally killed it!

143
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,541
-And hit me!
-Yeah.

144
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,166
I was trying to give
you a little back up.

145
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,333
I guess I just don't
know my own strength.

146
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,625
Lie! You were trying
to hit me on purpose!

147
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,625
Hey! We're supposed to
cooperate on this game,

148
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,750
so maybe we should try that!

149
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,500
Yeah, Hooters.

150
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,208
But I'll make sure to
cooperate even more next time.

151
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,083
Well, in that case,
brace yourself.

152
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,083
I'm gonna cooperate
the hell out of this.

153
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,541
After that.
The real hunting began.

154
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,041
Those meat flaps of yours
are grossing me out.

155
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,750
I better turn 'em
into ground beef.

156
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,166
Shriek away little Harpy.

157
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,375
Shriek.

158
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,875
You won't be saying
much when I kill you.

159
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,625
-Silence, Meat.
-No.

160
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,416
Because I do what I want!

161
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,416
Cool! I found dogrite!

162
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,750
I rock!

163
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,625
Since you're
nothing but trash,

164
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,291
you won't mind
licking my boots!

165
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,208
That doesn't even
make sense, Meat!

166
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,791
Someone help me!

167
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,708
Sorry, guys.
I just died.

168
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,291
Uh.

169
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,000
It's like I only
really feel alive

170
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,708
when I'm really
killing something!

171
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,916
I'm gonna rip
out your guts

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,791
and shove 'em right
down your throat, Harpy!

173
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,375
How do you like that?
In your face!

174
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,708
Try this on for size!!

175
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,250
Maybe video games
aren't right for us.

176
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,125
Yeah, seems like a
waste of time, right?

177
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,166
For real.

178
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,041
And since when did
PSPs become like

179
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,541
all about the multiplayer
games anyway?

180
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,750
Why should I have
to play with people

181
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,416
who are just
gonna die on me?

182
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,833
I thought playing with
people was the whole point!

183
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,125
I completely agree.

184
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,958
I don't have
a lot of time.

185
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,250
Why should I
have to share it?

186
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,875
Ugh. And with a stranger.

187
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,166
Yeah. Totally.

188
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,875
Yeah, why would you think
of anyone else besides you?

189
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,541
Nothing; never mind.

190
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,500
What do you wanna do today?

191
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,041
Same thing we
do every day.

192
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,166
Try and take
over the world.

193
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,916
How far'd you get
in Monster Hunting?

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,750
I didn't bring forth
imperial wrath,

195
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,208
but I did kill Jinrou.

196
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,416
I also got a ton of tail.

197
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,291
Here goes!

198
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,541
Do you have anything extra
you can share with me?

199
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,750
Prob'ly.

200
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,250
Hey, uh, guys.

201
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,833
So I've been playing that
Monster Hunting game, too!

202
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,125
Do you by chance have
the Scarf of Dos- jagira.

203
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,875
And would you be
willing to trade for it?

204
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,416
Sure; whatever you want!

205
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,625
Yeah. Anything else
you need say the word.

206
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,291
It's yours it's no
big deal at all.

207
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,666
Thanks guys.

208
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,291
That's cool.

209
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,583
By the following day,

210
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,541
the rumor had spread
through the whole school.

211
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,375
I had pulled a shakedown in
homeroom in broad daylight.

212
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,875
Okay. What's that?

213
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,666
Your blonde is
showing again!

214
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,250
They're two modern
conveniences

215
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,333
known as a television
and a gaming console.

216
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,541
They use electricity.

217
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,833
Yeah, that's not
what I meant.

218
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,250
Why did you
bring them here;

219
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,666
What are they doing
in the clubroom?

220
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,083
Um. To play a game with?

221
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,583
How'd you even get
the TV in here?

222
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,958
Anyway.

223
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,208
Why would you want to
bring them to school to play

224
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,333
in the first place?

225
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,708
I found a game that's one:

226
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,291
not a piece of crap
like Monster Hunter,

227
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,041
and two: looked useful to us.

228
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,083
So, I figured
I'd bring it in.

229
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,958
Be grateful, you ingrates.

230
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,666
Shut up, Coconuts you're
ruining my coffee.

231
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,750
Hey! That's not coffee;
it's tea.

232
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,208
And it's also not yours!

233
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,541
Sparkling School Life.

234
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,791
Seven?

235
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,666
Sounds like one of
those chick games to me.

236
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,500
It's a game about making
new friends, stupid.

237
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,041
So it is.

238
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,625
This could be good for us to
practice casual conversations.

239
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,333
Yeah, it's for guys
to meet girls, though.

240
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,041
Didn't they have one
for you all to practice

241
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,750
meeting hot dudes
to be friends with?

242
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,166
Why?

243
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,375
What would be the point
of being friends with guys?

244
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,791
Right. Thank you.

245
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,083
Sparkling School
Life Seven!

246
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,250
All right. S-E-N-A.

247
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,583
Excuse me?

248
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:18,000
Why the crap do we have
to use your nasty name?

249
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,708
I mean, I'm the public
face of this club.

250
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,000
We should be
using my name.

251
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,625
You're the club's
public face?

252
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,625
Well that explains
why no one's joining.

253
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,458
Uh. The main
character is a guy,

254
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,000
so maybe we should
use my name?

255
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,333
Hell no.

256
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,083
Well, at least they're
agreeing on something.

257
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,125
Fine. Sena is the one who
brought the game here for us.

258
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,041
I think we should
just go ahead

259
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,583
and use her name this time.

260
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,375
Gah, whatever.

261
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,166
Way to use your
head, Kodaka.

262
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,541
Okay. Kashiwazaki.

263
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,291
Sena.

264
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,041
Sorry; changed my mind.

265
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,500
There.

266
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,875
Ugh. You're such a jerk ass.

267
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,000
Hi! I'm Semoponume Kashiwazaki.

268
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,000
What the hell
is Semoponume?

269
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,583
Come on, I think it's
a lovely random name.

270
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,916
You should change
your real name to that.

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,458
Seriously Sena
makes me want to puke

272
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,541
like every time I say it.

273
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,833
Dude! Semoponume!

274
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,916
This guy's name
is Masaru Suzuki.

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,583
We've been best friends
since middle school.

276
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,250
What? You're kidding me?

277
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,083
This douche already
has a best friend?

278
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,916
And that selfish son
of a bitch has the balls

279
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,500
to say he wants even more?

280
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,166
Stop making
that creepy face.

281
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,083
And move outta the way.

282
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,041
The best way to have the
best time in high school

283
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,250
is to cozy up next
to a pretty girl!

284
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,041
Go get one!

285
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,416
That guy's a player,
but he is so right.

286
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,125
I'd love to have a pretty
friend to cozy up to!

287
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,958
Hello. Nice to meet you.

288
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,166
My name is Akari
Fujibayashi.

289
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,958
I was nervous about
starting this new school,

290
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,416
but I am now happy

291
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,125
that I am sitting next to
such a nice looking guy.

292
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,833
Would you like to be my friend
at this time, Semo-ponume?

293
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,125
Oh. So you get to choose
how the guy answers.

294
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,666
Number three.

295
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,875
How come three?

296
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,125
Doesn't that seem rude?

297
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,875
No, not when some
hussy you don't know

298
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,041
tries to get all
up on your stuff

299
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,250
on the first day of school.

300
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,541
You can't trust
girls like that.

301
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,916
True.

302
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,791
I bet she probably says
the exact same thing

303
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,500
to every single guy
in the classroom.

304
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,750
Aw, come on. She doesn't
look that bad to me.

305
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,333
Of course she doesn't.

306
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,541
Bitches never look
like bitches at first.

307
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,083
But there's one of
her in every class.

308
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,708
She looks so innocent,

309
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,791
but all she's really doing
is playing every guy in school.

310
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,333
Is there one her
of in our class?

311
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,125
Totally.

312
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,416
Online it says practically
every high school girl

313
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,125
is a big bitch these days.

314
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,875
Surely she realizes she
qualifies as a high school girl.

315
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,416
Okay, number three it is.

316
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,583
What a pushy broad!

317
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,541
Get lost!

318
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,916
Oh my. I am so sorry.

319
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,166
As it is our
first time meeting,

320
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,916
I may have been too forward.

321
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,833
I will be more
careful from now on,

322
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,875
so I hope that you
are not mad at me.

323
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,583
Akari. I'm so sorry.

324
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,833
Hey ho, let's go!

325
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,958
Hey ho, let's go!

326
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,041
So basically, you get to
decide what you wanna do,

327
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,041
and if you make
the right choice,

328
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,000
you get to talk to girls.

329
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,583
This game is a rough
place for a guy

330
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,041
who can't gain
enough merit points

331
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,791
to get a girl to
go out with him.

332
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,750
It's just like reality.

333
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,958
He needs to
get good grades

334
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,500
so no one thinks he's stupid.

335
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,041
Let's start with
making him study.

336
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,250
Good idea.

337
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,541
I hate boys who are
cerebrally-challenged.

338
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,541
The more he studies
the smarter he gets.

339
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,833
Wow. How big of an idiot was
this dude to start out with?

340
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,875
Give the poor guy a break;
it's just a game.

341
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,166
Look! Someone's here!

342
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,083
Oh. I am sorry.

343
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,000
Another choice?

344
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,250
I bet they go with two.

345
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,958
So, which one is it?

346
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,708
Number one.

347
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,458
Seriously?

348
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,375
Instead of wasting time
reading random books

349
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,125
he needs to be
focused on studying.

350
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,875
I'm aiming for two
hundred academic points

351
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,208
by the next test.

352
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,583
So no screwing
around, loser.

353
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,833
Naturally.

354
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,166
No, I'm sorry.

355
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,875
You are kind.
Thank you.

356
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:20,166
May I have your name if
you don't mind too much?

357
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,041
Sure. I'm Semoponume Kashiwazaki
from Class D.

358
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,583
Semoponume Kashiwazaki.

359
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,583
That is a very nice name.

360
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,166
Jeez, talk about
having terrible taste.

361
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,208
It's scary.

362
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,583
For now, I'm thinking we oughta
be friends with this girl.

363
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,000
Are you okay with that?

364
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,041
Yeah. She's way better than
that Fujibayashi bitch.

365
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,166
Go ahead.

366
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,166
Yukiko.

367
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes?

368
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,083
She's so cute;
I can't stand it!

369
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,250
And she likes me?

370
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,625
Is there anything
better in the world

371
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,125
than having a girl like you?

372
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,791
Yeah. Plus she looks like
she's like a good person.

373
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,375
Yukiko. Let's walk
home together.

374
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,083
I. No.

375
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,291
I am sorry!

376
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,916
I don't understand.

377
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,500
What's wrong Yukikio?

378
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,750
I guess this
was the reason

379
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,500
Yukiko Nagata suddenly
became so cold.

380
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,083
What? Tell me!

381
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,416
You know how every time
you saw that Akari girl

382
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,125
you were really
mean to her?

383
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,083
Apparently that caused a
nasty rumor go through school.

384
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,791
A rumor saying that
you're mean to girls

385
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,333
and therefore not
to be trusted.

386
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,166
So basically, the reason
Yukiko doesn't like me

387
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,000
is because that
stupid bitch Akari

388
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,000
has been bad mouthing me all
over the whole damn school!

389
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,875
I hate her so
freaking much!

390
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,166
I think you might
be exaggerating.

391
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,625
It says here if
you get a bad rep,

392
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,833
you need to find out who
doesn't like you and apologize.

393
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:17,916
What?

394
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,541
Why the hell would
I ever apologize

395
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,958
to such an awful person?

396
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,041
This is ridiculous;

397
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,375
I don't even
want to be friends

398
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,083
with that disgusting
cow in the first place.

399
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,250
Totally agree.

400
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,958
How is this our fault that
we need to say we're sorry?

401
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,583
By no means am I about to
bow down to some idiotic female

402
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,833
who's just talking trash

403
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,625
because she got shot
down for acting slutty.

404
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,375
Yeah, like for
real, right?

405
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,500
I refuse to
give in on this.

406
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,708
And I have total faith that
Yukiko will understand anyway.

407
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,708
Yukiko. Please, I...

408
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,625
I am sorry.

409
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,208
Goodbye forever!

410
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,458
Wait, no!

411
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,291
I had faith in her.

412
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,291
But... But she
still let me down.

413
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,000
She's really crying.

414
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,708
Why do I only
get the crazies?

415
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,833
Hey. Where are you
off to, Yozora?

416
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,791
To find Akari Fujibayashi.

417
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,000
And kill her.

418
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,500
Are you okay?

419
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,458
Yukiko? Why?

420
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,250
Good morning!

421
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,208
-Hey, Kodaka!
-Hmm?

422
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,458
Over here!

423
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,791
Here!

424
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm letting
you borrow that,

425
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,500
so be sure and play it
as soon as you get home.

426
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,500
And definitely watch out
for the third year event

427
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,333
with Akari Fujibiyashi;
it's particularly moving.

428
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,833
Akari?

429
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,041
But isn't she
the poor girl

430
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,083
you kept calling a
stupid bitch yesterday?

431
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,541
Do not talk like
that about her!

432
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,875
I'm sorry?

433
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,250
Listen.

434
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,541
She's been through.

435
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,791
Well, a lot since her
parents were killed.

436
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,000
That girl's the
strongest girl I know.

437
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,875
She won't let
anything get her down.

438
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,875
The only thing in her
heart is a ball of love.

439
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,250
Is that so?

440
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh! You have to make
sure you capture Yukiko!

441
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,416
Actually Miho, Natsumi,
Mizuki and Karen.

442
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,250
They're all amazing girls.

443
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,250
Okay. So after going
home yesterday,

444
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,416
you conquered all of them?

445
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,166
Obviously.

446
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,833
Be sure you pay close attention
to how they all end, too.

447
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,458
You got that?

448
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,083
Sure. I'll give it a whirl
if I'm in the mood to play it.

449
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,500
No way.

450
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,625
You will play it whether
you're in the mood or not.

451
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,958
You have to.

452
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,208
It's an experience everyone
should be a part of.

453
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,625
It's not just a game,
it's a work of art!

454
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,458
Don't you understand?

455
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,916
It's life held
in your hand.

456
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,666
Oh no! I'm gonna be late!

457
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,708
And you better play it!

458
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,458
Oh crap!

459
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,791
Neighbors Club Record.

460
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,916
Sena became friends with
seven different girls.

461
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,833
All of whom are
two dimensional.

462
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:32,375
[Music]

463
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:58,541
Hey, boob face.

464
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,791
About those chick games.

465
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,375
Did you know people

466
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,791
who play them in the middle of
the night get brainwashed?

467
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,416
What? They do?

468
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,291
Yep. Their brainwaves end up
getting controlled by the game,

469
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,083
and they lose their
normal sense of judgment,

470
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,625
which means they never
make any friends.

471
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,166
That is not true!

472
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,500
On top of that, their hair
turns a gross blond color

473
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,833
and the fat on their chest
expands turning them into cows.

474
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,041
Is that for real?

475
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,750
Of course not.

476
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:19,875
You're stupid.

477
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,125
Says the idiot.

478
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,958
Next: There Are no Flags
at the Swimming Pool.

479
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,125
Why pool?
