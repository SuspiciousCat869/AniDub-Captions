1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,583
What? We're moving?

2
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,583
Two weeks from now?

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,291
Okay...

4
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,666
What's wrong, Taka...?

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,333
You've been acting
weird lately.

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,625
We need to talk.

7
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,125
About what?

8
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,500
It's big... But I wanna
tell you tomorrow.

9
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,333
We can meet back here
if that's cool with you.

10
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,208
Yeah, I'm totally
fine with that...

11
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,416
Honestly, There's something

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,166
I've been meaning
to tell you too.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,958
Tomorrow, then.

14
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,291
I wanted to tell
him in two days,

15
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,125
I was gonna be moving away.

16
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,666
But...

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,208
The next day I waited
until the sun went down...

18
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,166
He never showed up.

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,583
So I left...

20
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,250
I ended up leaving without
ever saying goodbye

21
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,083
to my only friend.

22
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,208
Crazy dream.

23
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,875
What's she doing in here?

24
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,333
Huh? What was I
dreaming about again?

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:40,708

There Aren't Many
Customers at the Karaoke Box

35
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,000
Has this semester gone by
crazy fast to you guys too,

36
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,458
or is that just me?

37
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:13,208
Yeah, summer vacation
starts tomorrow... Weird.

38
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,708
As you know, the
Neighbor's Club exists

39
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:15,916
for one reason only...

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,041
And that's to
make friends...

41
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,416
Now, has anyone here
made even one friend?

42
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,708
Anyone have fun-filled
summer plans

43
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,541
with said new friends?

44
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,708
Actually... For me...

45
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,083
I think my rep's worse
now than it was

46
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,333
before I joined.

47
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,583
Me too...

48
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,291
Earlier, I heard some
girls talking about me

49
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,083
and they said, "you know
Sena is totally dating

50
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,500
that blond thug!"

51
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,375
How they could even
believe that much less

52
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,958
repeat it is beyond me.

53
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,791
I should punch
their faces off.

54
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,583
Yeah, that sucks... sorry.

55
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,791
No... You don't have
to apologize

56
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,125
because they're stupid.

57
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,500
What kind of
club activities

58
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,041
have you all been
doing so far?

59
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,541
Have they helped you
make new friends?

60
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,916
Well, let me
think about it...

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,166
We played some
video games...

62
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,666
And that's all.

63
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,041
We practiced
role-playing...

64
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,208
With video games.

65
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,625
So... For the most part you've
just been fooling around.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,541
Hey... I have a question...

67
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,416
Have any of you ever
been to one of those...

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,875
Karaoke Box things?

69
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,625
Like where you can rent
your own private karaoke room?

70
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,833
Yeah. I've been, too.

71
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,416
What?!

72
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,333
Why are you both
so surprised?

73
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,291
It's hard to imagine you
singing karaoke, that's all.

74
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,833
Whatever! I may not look
like it to you freaks,

75
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,166
but I'll have you know,

76
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,541
I've been to all the
karaoke boxes in the city.

77
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,250
Wow... That seems excessive.

78
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,750
And sad.

79
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,541
Why would you go to every
single one by yourself?

80
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,666
Who said I was by
myself, Jackwagon?!

81
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,208
Karaoke boxes are
obviously places

82
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,250
you go with friends.

83
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,583
-Huh, what?
-Huh?!

84
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,250
Singing karaoke with
your friends is fun. Hello.

85
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,250
Not only does Tomo
have an amazing voice,

86
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,583
she is like beyond supportive
when you're singing.

87
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,791
Sometimes she'll
even sing back up.

88
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,625
Right... forgot about her...

89
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,916
Tomo, the air friend.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,916
Why are you looking
at me like that?

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,916
No reason...
No reason at all.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,375
So, both of them have
been karaoke-ing before...

93
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,166
Sena... Have you never
been to one?

94
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,625
Oh, yeah, no...

95
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,833
Who cares, though?!

96
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,375
I put the
class in classy,

97
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,500
so why would I do something
so unsophisticated?

98
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:12,083
Gimmie some credit. I would
never do that, like ever.

99
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,000
I may not have ever
been invited to go.

100
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,083
But I was fine because
I didn't want to.

101
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,916
Easy! No one
said you wanted to.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,916
Kodaka...! Rika has
never been to karaoke...

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,333
But Rika would very
much like to go along.

104
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,375
Rika imagines it would
be rather difficult

105
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,208
to go into a place
like that all alone.

106
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,875
Perhaps next time
you would consider

107
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,708
taking Rika to
karaoke with you.

108
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,458
Sure...! Sounds
good to me.

109
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,750
Really? Thank you!

110
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,291
Wait...! I'm here too!

111
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,791
Plus, if you wanna know
the best place to go,

112
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,458
you should stick with me.

113
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,708
That's nice of
you to offer...

114
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,125
Thanks, Yozora.

115
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,250
Excuse me...

116
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,208
I've never been to one of
those karaoke box places either.

117
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,958
All of this talking about
singing has put me

118
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,125
in the mood to perform
"Chaos Requiem".

119
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,791
Well, when do
you wanna go...?

120
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,833
No one has anything
to do tomorrow, do they

121
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,000
I suppose I could make
time to go after noonish.

122
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,625
Rika's available
all day long.

123
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,875
So is Yukimura.

124
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,250
Tomorrow it is, then...

125
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,291
When and where
should we meet up?

126
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,125
My favorite karaoke
box is a ten-minute walk

127
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,916
from the Tooya
Nishi station.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,833
Cool... Then let's meet
in front of the ticket gates

129
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:11,958
at the station?

130
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,708
Perfect. What time?

131
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,583
Wait! Hold on just a
second...! Cuz, I, um...

132
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,166
You um what, Meat...?

133
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,583
At the moment, we're
trying to make plans

134
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,875
to go to a karaoke
box together...

135
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,041
You know, that unsophisticated
disgusting place

136
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,125
your classy lady lumps
wouldn't be caught dead in.

137
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,375
Don't tell me
you've changed your mind

138
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,333
and want to go with us.

139
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,000
Look, Lumpy, unless you're
a wealth of karaoke info...

140
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,583
You're interrupting
a conversation

141
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,791
that has nothing
to do with you.

142
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,416
So why don't you take a
seat and shut up for once.

143
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
No, I'm not...

144
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,958
Uh...

145
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,500
The place I'm thinking of
has free play time tomorrow...

146
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,083
It starts at one, so why
don't we all meet up then?

147
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,500
Make sure you eat
lunch before you go.

148
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,833
Stop ignoring me!

149
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,208
Oh, I'm sorry...

150
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,458
I just assumed you
were telling the truth

151
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,208
when you said you
didn't want to go with us

152
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,000
but obviously
you were lying...

153
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,500
Way to put
the ass in class.

154
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,166
No... I wasn't lying!

155
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,125
Hey... We don't
care either way.

156
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,583
So, if you wanna go, go.

157
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,958
Come on.

158
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,500
Admit it; you want
to, don't you?

159
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,000
Um... Yes. I do...

160
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,666
I... I want to go.

161
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,666
I, can't hear you!

162
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,750
I... I want to go, too!

163
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,583
I'm sorry...? What was that?

164
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,666
I said I wanna go with
you guys to karaoke!

165
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,250
I see...

166
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,208
Well, I can certainly
understand that...

167
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,500
But the reality is,

168
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,375
I don't really want
you to go with us.

169
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,333
Although I suppose
I can make an exception...

170
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,000
All you have to do is beg.

171
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,541
What?? Beg??

172
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,750
Just say... "Please
take me with you."...

173
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,041
Put some heart into it.

174
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,833
Please. Take me with you...

175
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,041
Uh... I would appreciate it...

176
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,375
Please... Take me with you.

177
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,083
You know what... I
couldn't hear you like at all.

178
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,958
And don't forget the
most important part

179
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,708
is the begging part.

180
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,541
Oh, Yukimura...? Would you
get Rika another cup of coffee?

181
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,125
Louder, saggy bags!

182
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,000
You need to start
begging like you mean it!

183
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,041
Okay, fine! I'm
officially begging! .

184
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,083
Please let me go, too!

185
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,166
That wasn't
so hard, huh...?

186
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,583
But, still... No.

187
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,583
What do I have
to do you Harpy?!

188
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,875
I'm going whether
you like it or not! .

189
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,666
Plus, why would I need
your permission to go

190
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,166
anywhere in
the first place?!

191
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,000
Took you long enough
to realize that...

192
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,958
Gah you really are mentally
challenged, aren't you?

193
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,541
You're the worst!

194
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,833
You witch! .
I hope you die!

195
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,958
Now that she's gone,
you guys wanna go ahead

196
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,083
and decide on the real time
and place we should meet.

197
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,458
Are you like the devil?

198
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,833
It was just a joke.

199
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,833
I have an appointment
tomorrow at one.

200
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,041
So I will need to have
lunch prepared early.

201
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,291
Appointment...?

202
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,083
Would that be with
those friends of yours?

203
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,000
No, of course it's not.

204
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,916
It's with the
Neighbor's Club.

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,666
If I don't go,
they'll be lost without me.

206
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,875
It's tragic, really.

207
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,583
What is the club
planning to do?

208
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,166
Karaoke...

209
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,708
I'm going to ambush
Yozora and Kodaka

210
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,916
with my gorgeous,
gorgeous singing voice...

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,333
I also really want to
do a duet with Kobato! .

212
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,833
She's adorable!

213
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,666
Did you say Kodaka?

214
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,291
Tooya Nishi...

215
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,666
Please step away
from the doors.

216
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,000
Why are you wearing that
today-aren't you on fire?

217
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,541
A true heir of the
Night Tribe transcends

218
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,041
even the hottest of heat.

219
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,916
I doubt she even
knows what that means.

220
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,750
Look... They're all here.

221
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,583
Last but not least.
Are you ready?

222
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,208
Why are you
guys so early...?

223
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,333
We've still got ten
minutes before one.

224
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,125
I wasn't first; I got here
five minutes after Rika did.

225
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,916
Well, I only arrived
twenty minutes before you did

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,583
because I'm
your sidekick.

227
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,708
Rika managed to beat Sena
to our meeting place

228
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,333
by fifteen minutes.

229
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,166
But I was still here fifteen
minutes before Yukimura.

230
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,791
Why are you guys talking
like you're in the middle

231
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,375
of some math
word problem...

232
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,125
Okay... Try to figure out
who got here at what time

233
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,541
based upon what
they all just said.

234
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,250
Come on, it'll
be fun for you.

235
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,125
Now, we arrived at
exactly twelve fifty.

236
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,000
You have until we get to
the karaoke place to answer.

237
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,416
What?!

238
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,916
Um...

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You forget all I need to do
is access the Akashic Records,

240
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,375
and solving a
problem like this one

241
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,875
shall be a breeze...

242
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,416
Watch and learn,
mere mortal...

243
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,125
Why do you have to use
the powers of darkness

244
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,875
on everything?

245
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,000
Ohmigah, are
we almost there?

246
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,958
Shut up, Meat,
and yes we are...

247
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,000
So, what's the name
of this place anyway?

248
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,750
Oh, it's "Cry
from the Abyss".

249
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,416
That doesn't make
Rika feel safe.

250
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,041
Run, Taka!

251
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,041
What's taking so long?

252
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,166
Wait for me...!
How are you so fast?

253
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,083
Kodaka... What the hell?

254
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,375
You okay?

255
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,416
-I'll get it this time!
-Yeah.

256
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,916
Go get it!

257
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,833
Karaoke BoxCry
From the Abyss

258
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,458
Good afternoon.

259
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,791
Wow, we're actually
at a karaoke box.

260
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,291
Drink bar and... Free time!

261
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,958
One sec... There are six
of you total, is that right?

262
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,375
Oh... Yeah... Six total.

263
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,250
Well all righty then...

264
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,333
The total for free time
and drinks for six people

265
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,375
is fifty four hundred yen.

266
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,291
Yes...! I've got
it big brother!

267
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,750
Well, free time for one
person is six fifty,

268
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,708
and the drink
bar is two fifty,

269
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,791
so that's nine per person.

270
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,375
That's a lot...

271
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,083
Just so I'm
clear on this...

272
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,458
We got there at
twelve fifty...

273
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,750
Isn't that right...?
That's what you said, isn't it?

274
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,500
Hey, what's wrong?

275
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,833
The total doesn't
make sense.

276
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,208
Why? What do you mean?

277
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,625
The price for the drink
bar is pretty much

278
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,291
the only thing that
does make sense...

279
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,583
Get this...

280
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,958
We're only using one room
but they wanna charge

281
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,416
each of us to use it.

282
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,708
Is that not normal?

283
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,625
Meat... What do you go
to a karaoke box to do?

284
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,708
Well um to sing
some songs, right?

285
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,166
Exactly!

286
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,000
It's still one room,
whether one person sings

287
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,625
thirty songs, or
six people sing five.

288
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,833
It's thirty songs
total regardless.

289
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,875
So, why do we have to
pay six times as much

290
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,166
for what we could get
cheaper on our own?

291
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,041
So basically, it's a scam.

292
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,875
Yeah, I think
that's their game...

293
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,375
You know what's
like really weird;

294
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,541
they never charged me twice
when I came here with Tomo.

295
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,791
Are you insane...?

296
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,041
She's not real; why would
they charge her?!

297
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,375
Besides that, all karaoke
boxes charge per person.

298
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,708
It's perfectly normal.

299
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,833
No way. It's
definitely a scam.

300
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,916
I don't want to,
but I have to agree.

301
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,666
My daddy said
to me once...

302
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,791
People who know better
should never overlook

303
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,166
the unnatural movement
of money so...

304
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,125
I know... Exactly what
we should do about this.

305
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,708
Hey, not bad for a
flotation device. Thanks.

306
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,666
You can forget what
I said about six people.

307
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,333
The usual...

308
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,833
I'm going to want free time
and drinks in my own room.

309
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,166
I'm acquainted
with these people,

310
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,958
but I'm not actually
here with them.

311
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,750
We just walked in
at the same time.

312
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,958
Okay...

313
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,125
One person
it is, then.

314
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:59,000
Hey. Dude... This
is my first time.

315
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,833
I wanna get free time and
drinks for only me, thanks.

316
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,083
That's weird...
What are they doing?

317
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,791
Rika supposes they want
us to each have

318
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:07,875
our own singing room.

319
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,208
Aren't they kinda
missing the point

320
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,875
of us coming together?

321
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,000
Great. Same price
for you, then...

It's your turn.

324
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,750
We're gonna go on ahead.

325
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,958
So... Are you by
yourself as well?

326
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,041
No... Four, please.

327
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,583
Four people in just one
room? Are you sure?

328
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,166
Uhh... Yeah... Four.

329
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,333
Thank you so much, sir!

I'm in the same room

my rock star voice!

everything all right?

339
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,916
Yeah... Everything is perfect.

340
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,291
Will that be
cash or credit?

341
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,208
Oh... Cash please.

so low is driving
Rika wild...

It's super sadistic and
sexy all at the same time!

Rika's correct; it's
giving me chills as well.

Huh. Hey. What's
wrong with you guys?

Why don't you
ask Fog Lights?

Whatever. She so started it.

418
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,458
I'm guessing this had
something to do with singing?

You know how there's a
mode that scores you...?

I was using that
the whole time.

And it ranked
all of the rooms.

When I started singing,
the name "Night"

was disgustingly all
over the top rankings.

Since that
describes her soul,

00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,958
I figured it was Yozora.

what she does.

00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,583
Seriously? You were in separate
rooms and still fighting?

431
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,708
So then, who ended up
with the highest rank?

talking about?

Like that means
anything...

ranks two through eleven

on every one.

00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,416
I had more ninety-sevens
than you did.

be eating your brain

doesn't make it true.

Whatever! You wouldn't
know the truth if it hit you!

That was really
fun, wasn't it?

446

Oh yeah. I guess.

451
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,916

has to wait forty days

452
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,791
before she can fool
around with you again?

453
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,791
Stop doing that, Rika!

454
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,041
We haven't fooled
around at all,

455
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,583
so quit acting like we have!

Jeez, what the hell are
you all freaking out about? .

00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,875
The club's not gonna take
a break for the summer.

460
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,708
What? . We're not
taking a break...?

461
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,166
There a reason for that?

462
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,125
All of the other clubs
at school are still gonna

463
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,583
meet over the summer so why
would we be any different?

464
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,250
To start out, summer
is the normal kids'

465
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,666
most social time
of the entire year...

466
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,208
It wouldn't make sense
for us not to meet

467
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,000
since our goal is to make
friends with them.

468
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,041
We also need to keep
up with our training...

469
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,125
We don't want to forget
what we've already learned.

470
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,833
It's like the logic of
pouring boiling water

471
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,416
into a glass that isn't
used so it cracks, right?

472
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,750
Sure... Whatever you say.

473
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,541
Isn't that
thermal expansion?

Our next official meeting
will be on Monday...

475
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,583
Each of you needs to
be prepared to discuss

476
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,625
why you haven't been able
to make friends so far...

00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,875
The answer to your
question is you...

479
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,166
You're a terrible leader,
and that's why we've all failed.

480
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,625
You know now
that you bring it up

481
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,625
I have a couple
of answers myself...

482
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,083
First of all...

483
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,208
You are the most worthless
person I've ever met.

484
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,125
Not to mention lame
and beyond stupid.

485
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,000
Between your tiny brain
and your incompetence

486
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,708
when trying to
accomplish anything,

487
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,833
your existence to the club...

488
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,250
Technically
to the world...

489
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,416
is meaningless.

490
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,791
You are so rude!

491
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,458
You're right.
I said too much.

492
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,041
Which is funny when
you think about it,

493
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,708
because there aren't
enough words to describe

494
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,416
how much of a hazardous
waste of a person you are.

495
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,791
You really suck.

496
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:25,583
You're stupid;
you're annoying.

497
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,916
Should we leave them?

498
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We should. Yes.

499
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,250
Are you sure.

500
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,666
Don't stop walking.

501
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,625
I understand, sir.

502
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,000
Just stop it...

503
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,250
Everyone's... looking....

504
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,333
Shut up.

505
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,625
No more!

506
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,291
Yozora, you're
such an evil...

507
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,625
Ugh! I hate you
and I wish you'd die!

508
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,291
That dumb girl is so
dramatic it's disgusting.

509
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,458
It's been a month
since the club started...

510
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,416
And none of it would have
happened without her.

511
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Hey, Yozora?

512
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,250
This past month... It's
been a whole lot of fun.

513
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,208
Thank you.

514
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,541
Whatevs.

515
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,416
Hey Kodaka!

516
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,041
Wait!

517
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:14,958
What's up?

518
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,958
I forgot to tell
you something.

519
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,083
I was talking to
Daddy yesterday...

520
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,208
He said he had some free
time over the summer...

521
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,250
You can come over
and see him whenever.

522
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,000
I guess he's been
wanting to meet you, too.

523
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,583
No way, really? I'll
make sure to come by soon.

524
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,041
Just let me know
beforehand...

525
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,375
-Cool?
-Sure.

526
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,083
Wait. Slow your roll...

527
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,875
Why the hell would he
go over to your house...

528
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,166
And on top of that...

529
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,541
Why would he ever
need to meet your father?

530
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,833
Well, actually
it's because...

531
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,083
Kodaka!

532
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,916
I think you should
keep that a secret...

533
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,708
You don't want it
to cause any trouble.

534
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,875
Yeah, that's
a good point...

535
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,583
I'm sorry Sena.

536
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,750
She's right.

537
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,916
It's probably best
not to advertise

538
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,250
the president of the school

539
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,708
used his authority
to make sure

540
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,666
the new thug
got accepted.

541
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,333
So what kind of
secret is this?

542
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,666
The kind of secret
that has absolutely

543
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,125
nothing to do with you.

544
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,625
Whatever reason he has
to come over to my house...

545
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,666
And/or visit
with my father...

546
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, those
are his reasons,

547
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,000
and he doesn't have to
explain them to anyone.

548
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,291
Bye, kids! I'll
see you soon, Kodaka!

549
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,791
Kay.

550
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:36,625
[Music]

551
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:46,625
[Music]

552
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:56,666
[Music]

553
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:04,708
[Music]

554
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,250
Oh, Kodaka!

555
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,875
Rika is so happy
she gets to see you

556
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,125
over the summer break!

557
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,666
I'm really excited
I get to see you, too!

558
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,958
Don't you guys have anything
exciting planned, though?

559
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,500
Do you have
exciting plans?

560
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,833
No. Not exactly.

561
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:09,916
Rika knew it!

562
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,208
You know what we
should do, then...?

563
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,583
Pervy stuff...!
With each other.

564
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,000
Never fear Big Brother.

565
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,333
For the next forty days,
I'll be at your beck and call.

566
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,750
Come on!

567
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,333
Next! My Cell Phone
Doesn't Get Many Calls.

568
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,375
Hey, Where did he go?

569
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,541
And here we are with
no way of contacting him.
