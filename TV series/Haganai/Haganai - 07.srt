1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,708
Don't you think
it's a little too hot

2
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,041
to be wearing
all of that?

3
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,000
We've gone over
this before.

4
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,208
Heirs of the
Night Tribe

5
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,291
are not affected by heat
the way mortals are.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,750
Oh jeez...!

7
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,125
It's like walking
into a hair dryer!

8
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,958
O' detestable light
of the sun.

9
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,375
You have won
today's battle,

10
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,333
but there shall come a
time when the Night Tribe

11
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,166
will envelope the world
in darkness and then...

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,041
no more light.

13
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,000
Right now, I wouldn't
object to that.

14
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:06,250
[Music]

15
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,541
I'm still alive!

16
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,708
Big Brother.

17
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,833
You must be exhausted.

18
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,083
So nice of you
to join us today.

19
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,791
Yeah, just like I
always do at this time.

20
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,416
It's summer vacation.

21
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,333
Why would you wait until
school would normally be out?

22
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,041
What time did you
guys get here?

23
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,000
About one o' clock.

24
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,750
Meat was already here
being productive...

25
00:02:58,833 --> 00:02:59,958
playing a video game.

26
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,166
She wasn't that far in.

27
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,291
Yozora showed up just
a little after Sena.

28
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,625
So early.

29
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,458
And let me guess.
you were here, too?

30
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,375
I arrived here
at eight AM.

31
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,583
It was very important for
me to be here before you.

32
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,541
I'd rather take my own
life than have you wait.

33
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,791
Don't take this
the wrong way,

34
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,000
but it's not
that big a deal.

35
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,000
I've already
prepared your lunch.

36
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,041
That's sweet; but
I ate before I left.

37
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry. And there's
no reason to cook for me

38
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,666
now that school's out.

39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,833
Does this mean my services
are no longer needed

40
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,375
and you're letting me go?

41
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,083
Heaven help
my heart;

42
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,958
my Big Brother doesn't
need me anymore.

43
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,791
I'm worthless
in his eyes.

44
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,750
I have no choice
but to end it all!

45
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,125
I didn't mean
it like that!

46
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,916
I need you;
I'm just not hungry!

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,916
If you're not gonna eat
both of those, can I have one?

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,916
I'm starving!

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,541
Brilliant timing.

50
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,583
I bet she was expecting me
to bring her something.

51
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,291
Look, you saved the day!

52
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,541
Is it cool if I give
this to Maria instead?

53
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,083
Not that I
wouldn't want it!

54
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,375
I just mean it would help if you
made her lunch instead of me

55
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,500
during the summer
break to save time?

56
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,541
It would not be
appropriate for a samurai

57
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,750
to serve two masters.
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,458
What is she talking about?

59
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,875
Alright, listen.

60
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,458
It's not serving
two masters.

61
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,916
Maria's like a
sister to me.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,041
So you'd be doing a noble
service for your master

63
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,208
if you looked after
her, wouldn't you?

64
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,416
Yes I would.

65
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,958
You're right!

66
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,000
I would actually consider
it a great honor, Sir.

67
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,541
You mean it?

68
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,333
You see me as your
little sister?

69
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,500
Miss Maria.

70
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,875
My Big Brother
has requested

71
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,416
that I prepare
your meals for you.

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,375
And so, I will now
be at your service.

73
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,000
I know! Isn't it great?!

74
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,875
You got all this stuff
from the convenience store!

75
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,083
Oh! Look how much
sugar's in 'em!

76
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,125
-Yum!
-Yeah.

77
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,958
This isn't the healthiest
meal you could've brought me.

78
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,708
You're such a
strong, healthy man;

79
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,666
I knew you
could handle it.

80
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,041
Plus, you deserved a break.

81
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,791
Thank you. Let's say
from here on out

82
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,500
you prepare only nutritious
meals for Maria, okay?

83
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,208
I understand.
As you wish.

84
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,750
What's the point in
learning good behavior

85
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,333
if you're just going to
give the reward away?

86
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,916
See you later.
Have a good day.

87
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,625
Oh man. Made it.

88
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,875
Good to see you.

89
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,625
Looks like you've already
been working hard.

90
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,291
Hi, where is everyone?

91
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,958
I don't know.
They're not here, yet.

92
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,833
Miss Maria came by
for a little while

93
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,333
and then remembered she had
some sisterly duties to tend to.

94
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,666
So she went home.

95
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,916
Okay. Did you
bring her lunch?

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,708
Yes. I made sure
it was healthy

97
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,041
just as you instructed.

98
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,083
Very rich in vitamins
and calcium...

99
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,083
and protein.

100
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,000
How many protein
shakes did she drink?

101
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,666
It wasn't easy to
tell you the truth.

102
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,208
She resisted but
they were your orders,

103
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,750
so I had no choice
but to force them down.

104
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,125
Tell me you're joking.

105
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,791
It reminded me a
little of that story

106
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,125
we learned in history class

107
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,000
about the execution
of Manpukumaru.

108
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,625
Manpuku-who?

109
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,208
Maru. He was only ten
when his parents abandoned him,

110
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,958
thinking he'd be safe
from the evil rulers.

111
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,166
Instead, he was
found and beheaded.

112
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,791
I bet the way that
little boy screamed

113
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,833
when he met his
death sounded

114
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,500
just like poor Maria.

115
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,875
What do you
mean screamed.

116
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,375
Please, tell me
what happened.

117
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,875
She resisted;
but they were your orders,

118
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,833
so I had no choice but
to force them down.

119
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,500
Your orders...

120
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,708
your orders...

121
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,041
your orders.

122
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:18,791
Alright, starting tomorrow

123
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,000
see if you can make something

124
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,500
that's both nutritious
and tastes good

125
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,916
to a ten-year-old.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,541
I don't need any more
Man-puke-a-roo incidents here.

127
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,916
Right. Your wish
is my command.

128
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,500
They ever gonna show up?

129
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,500
You've had such a long
day, Big Brother.

130
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,041
You're all here,
of course.

131
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,333
Why didn't any of
you come yesterday?

132
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,458
Poor Kodaka!

133
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,125
Were you feeling lonely
by yourself without Rika?

134
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,666
'Lonely' is not exactly
the word I would use.

135
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,000
Sorry, Kodaka, something
suddenly came up.

136
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,291
Yeah and I was too busy
being jerked around.

137
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,750
How so?

138
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,333
I thought the game
was almost over,

139
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,583
so I was just going to
finish it and then leave.

140
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,916
But as it turns out, I actually
had four more hours to go!

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,625
Way longer than
I expected!

142
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,291
I didn't even notice
what time it was

143
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,958
because I was lost
on the journey!

144
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,916
When Mikane finally met
her prince at the end,

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,791
it was so beautiful
I couldn't move!

146
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,708
You were playing
a video game.

147
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,791
It's more than
just a game!

148
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,208
You can borrow it,
you'll see!

149
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,458
It's a life-changing
experience!

150
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,125
When you finish, you
have to start it over!

151
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,666
The ending changes the entire
meaning of the beginning

152
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,291
and the whole journey!

153
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,208
Just like real life! It's about
how we're all on a path...

154
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,416
I just thought
of something!

155
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,125
What?

156
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,125
Let's come up with a way
that we can let each other know

157
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,750
what time we're all
going to be here

158
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,083
and if we can
make it or not.

159
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,125
I think you may be on
to something there.

160
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,666
I'm surprised that came
out of you, Kodaka.

161
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,541
but, now that it has,
how do we do it?

162
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,291
I was thinking...

163
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,666
maybe like an internet
group or something?

164
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,708
You're crazy!

165
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,333
You won't even
consider it?

166
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,541
I try to use the internet
as little as possible.

167
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,625
Online shopping and research
are about it for me.

168
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,833
Okay, but why?

169
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,750
I did something
recently...

170
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,125
and I don't want
to be recognized.

171
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,958
I'm not even gonna ask
what that's about.

172
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,583
I appreciate it.

173
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,583
Yeah, I had a pretty crappy
experience with message boards

174
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,708
so I'm not interested
in being found online.

175
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,208
Ugh! Just thinking about
it pisses me off.

176
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,375
I could kill those ugly trolls
for the way they treated me!

177
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,208
They will never be forgiven
for the things they said!

178
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,125
What happened?
Did you get in a fight?

179
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,666
I was harassed!

180
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,708
They were calling Natsumi a
heartless, lobotomized hooker

181
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,958
just because of
the way she looks!

182
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,000
And I was not gonna
let that slide!

183
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,416
I told them looks
aren't everything

184
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,541
and she's actually very nice
once you get to know her.

185
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,083
And how well do
you 'know' her?

186
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,166
Well enough that talking
crap about her around me

187
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,458
is pretty much a
declaration of war!

188
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,666
They can either
admit they were wrong

189
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,166
and apologize to me...

190
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,041
or we can fight it out
and determine who's right

191
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,541
the old-fashioned way!

192
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,958
So what you're saying is

193
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,958
message boards aren't
gonna work for you, right?

194
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,541
Oh I know...

195
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,958
How about setting up a page
for a private group on Nixi?

196
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,875
What are you doing
on Nixi, Kodaka?

197
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,708
And why haven't
you added me?

198
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,875
'Cause I'm not on it,
that's why.

199
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,541
-You know it?
-Yeah.

200
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,833
You're a member,
aren't you?

201
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,791
Of course not! Why would
I put myself out there

202
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,708
for all those stalkers?

203
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,041
Yeah. I agree.

204
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,333
Rika's not a member
yet, either.

205
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,333
Turns out it's not the
easiest site to join.

206
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,666
You have to actually
know someone

207
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,125
and have them add you
to their contact list.

208
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,958
So since none
of us are members,

209
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,375
we couldn't join
if we wanted to.

210
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,083
Nixi isn't the only social
networking site though.

211
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,583
There must be
something private

212
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,208
that doesn't require
an invitation.

213
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,750
Rika has a suggestion.

214
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,666
Why don't we just
exchange phone numbers

215
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,041
and use text messaging?

216
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,000
Texting.

217
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,416
You mean send messages
with our cell phones?

218
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,083
Yeah... that's
what it is, right?

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,416
I guess. I mean,
I forget sometimes

220
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,708
I can text people
besides my sister.

221
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,625
Rika, you are a genius!

222
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,750
Text messaging.

223
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,458
I never even thought
about that.

224
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,000
The only other thing I used
on my phone was the GPS

225
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,416
and some karaoke
apps I downloaded.

226
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,291
That does it.

227
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,916
Rika, you leave me
no other option

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,625
but to agree that
you are a genius.

229
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,833
Rika is very thankful
for the compliments.

230
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,583
Okay, great,
let's do this!

231
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,041
Who's ready to exchange
numbers with Rika?

232
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,000
I am!

233
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,416
'Kay. Here it is.

234
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,250
I'll go get mine!

235
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,875
Come on...
here it is!

236
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,250
This is my cellular
telephone!

237
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,791
The numbers don't just jump
in there by themselves.

238
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,333
Oh yeah, that's
a good point.

239
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,958
Rika's never seen
one like this!

240
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,291
It's so pretty!

241
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,375
The color almost glows!

242
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,583
Thank you?

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,250
Rika sent a group text.

244
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,541
Did you all get it?

245
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,208
You messaged all of us?

246
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,291
I don't have anything.
You sure you sent it?

247
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,833
I didn't get
anything either.

248
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,500
Maybe my phone
doesn't get them?

249
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,625
Or maybe you have to send
it to me separately.

250
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,958
Where would
I look for it?

251
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,000
Which picture
do I click on?

252
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,125
I'm not seeing anything.

253
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,708
Rika you might have to
send it to me again.

254
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,500
This sucks... I must've
freaking deleted it or something

255
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,500
'cause it's not in here!

256
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,875
I got it.

257
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,166
How did you do that?

258
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,458
Just reply back and
we'll all have yours.

259
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,666
There it is!

260
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,416
Rika has your
address now.

261
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,458
And look, it comes
with a picture too!

262
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,750
What's happening?

263
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,625
Why am I having a hard
time figuring this out.

264
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,000
Why's it so easy for them?

265
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,833
Because... they're
from the future.

266
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,083
Kids these days.

267
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,291
They're much
more advanced.

268
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,708
It's true.

269
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,750
They're growing up in a
new virtual generation...

270
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,250
they live their
entire lives

271
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,583
just like video games
with digital controls.

272
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,083
Somehow a stupid
smart phone

273
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,833
made us 'generations'
ahead of them.

274
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,208
People like Big Brother

275
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,041
who are used to doing
things without technology

276
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,750
have a hard time
understanding why it's useful

277
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,625
and sometimes
feel threatened.

278
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,875
How is it that you're
so well versed

279
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,208
in the ways of
text messaging?

280
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,916
Why didn't you tell
me about this before?

281
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,625
This is dumb.
It doesn't make sense!

282
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,125
And it doesn't make
sense for someone

283
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,583
who doesn't have any friends
to use a feature like this!

284
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,750
Screw it! I'm just going to type
in your number the normal way

285
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,958
so tell me what it is!

286
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,666
I was just thinking
the exact same thing!

287
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,125
This is way
too much work!

288
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,208
Here, just copy
it off my screen.

289
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,291
I'm almost done.

290
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,666
Why is your stupid
number so freaking long?

291
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,750
Um. I don't think you
have to type in the dashes.

292
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,416
'Kay. Then how am I
supposed to type it?

293
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,458
There! I did it!

294
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,875
Great!

295
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,041
I think I'm
gonna try it.

296
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,791
You ready?

297
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,750
I'm about to send
a text message.

298
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,375
Yeah. Go.

299
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,416
I think I got it!

300
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,416
Are you sure?

301
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,583
I mean I did!

302
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,833
This is you, right?

303
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,458
Great. So now I just
have to save your number.

304
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:46,458
Y... O... Z-O... R... A... save.

305
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,708
Sweet! It worked!

306
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,166
Another contact in my
phone besides my family!

307
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,833
Hey, this actually
feels kinda cool

308
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,000
seeing your
name in there.

309
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,416
Are you serious?

310
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,708
You don't have numbers of
friends from other schools?

311
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,833
No, is that bad?

312
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,375
It's not like I
didn't have friends,

313
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,583
we just always said we'd
exchange numbers when I left

314
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,916
and then we never did.

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,041
I guess that makes me
kind of a crappy guy, huh?

316
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,375
Maybe.

317
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,583
But on the bright side

318
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,208
now I get to be your
very first phone-friend.

319
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,208
And you get to be my very
first phone-anything.

320
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,083
I don't even have my
family's numbers saved!

321
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,875
This is a big
deal Kodaka!

322
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,083
Wow, I'm so honored!

323
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,041
Rika was starting
to feel really guilty

324
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,625
about not giving better
instructions on texting.

325
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,916
But seeing
them so elated

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,250
after figuring it
out on their own

327
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,250
makes Rika think it
worked out for the best.

328
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,083
Whatever!

329
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,625
It's just a
stupid cell phone!

330
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,666
What's the big deal?

331
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,375
Why are you so angry?

332
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,250
What makes you
think I'm angry?

333
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,625
I don't know.
My mistake.

334
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,875
Hey, what's your number?

335
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,166
I'll type it in now
that I know how!

336
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,583
I don't have one.

337
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,041
What?

338
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,750
I don't have a stupid
cell phone, okay?!

339
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,166
And I don't
want one!

340
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,708
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.

341
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,041
Don't be sorry!
I said I don't want one.

342
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,666
They're just props for all the
stupid giggly bimbos in my class

343
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,375
who need to feel like
they're important.

344
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,583
I'm way too busy being
organically awesome

345
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,916
to worry about that!

346
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,791
Well, there are certainly
more people in this world

347
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,291
who don't have a cell
phone than those who do.

348
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,166
And we manage just
fine, thank you.

349
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,458
I'd even be okay if I
didn't have a home phone...

350
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,375
but then I'd be depriving
way too many people

351
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,208
of hearing this goddess's
voice in their ear,

352
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,041
and nobody should miss
out on that miracle.

353
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,250
We're all thankful
for your mercy.

354
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,083
-Hello?
-It's me.

355
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,291
Just wanted to double check
if you saved my number.

356
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,666
Yeah, it's still in there.

357
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,500
Come back! I mean, as long
as we're on the phone,

358
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,375
let's talk!

359
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,708
But, you're right there.

360
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,750
It's different
on the phone.

361
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,291
I can ask phone-call
questions.

362
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,375
So, what did you have
for dinner last night?

363
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,916
I don't know.
It was good, though.

364
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,208
Really?! That's
what you're going to

365
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,208
talk about on a cell phone?

366
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,708
Who cares what you
had for dinner?!

367
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,791
Keep your voice
down, Meat.

368
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,166
Can't you see
we're on the phone?

369
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,958
I don't want to have to talk
all over your squawking.

370
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,916
Now run along and do
something, Jiggly.

371
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,500
This is really
convenient, too.

372
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,708
Now we can talk to each
other about whatever we want

373
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,208
even if we're not
in the same room.

374
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,916
Then why don't you guys go
somewhere and demonstrate!

375
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,500
I'll give you a call
when I'm about to leave

376
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,958
so you'll know
when I'll be here.

377
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,333
We'll figure out how to group
text and use that to plan

378
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,000
and discuss all
the club activities.

379
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,958
I forgot to mention that I went
to a great restaurant last night

380
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,500
and ordered... meat...

381
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,583
I had a really amazing
curry with chicken... meat...

382
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,250
if you're wondering
how the... meat... was,

383
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,000
I'd say it was quite
tender and delicious.

384
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,833
What are you talking
about over there?

385
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,291
Meat, this has nothing
to do with you.

386
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,750
I'm talking about the
restaurant's... meat...

387
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:27,958
chicken... meat...

388
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,750
not the pig... meat...
but... meat...

389
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,833
that was marinated
perfectly in my curry...

390
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't know how they meet the
demand for their meat dishes.

391
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,791
Meat is usually
so expensive.

392
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,750
Stop talking
about "meat!"

393
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,583
Shut, up you
stupid idiot!

394
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,833
You're such
a jerk!

395
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,041
Meat has some lungs
in there doesn't she?

396
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,541
As if you weren't
expecting that.

397
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,166
Your talent for
pressing Sena's buttons

398
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,875
is both sick and impressive.

399
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:03,875
How's it going?

400
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,666
My friend, The Night
has brought you home.

401
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,333
Yup. I'm gonna make dinner.

402
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,375
You hungry?

403
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,041
In one click my
contacts have doubled.

404
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,625
Who could be calling
at this hour?

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,375
Who could be calling
at this hour?

406
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,291
Uh, hello?!

407
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,666
Someone just
trying to prank me?

408
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,083
Hello?

409
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,333
-Anyone there?
-Um hi.

410
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes, my name is Sena.

411
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,333
and uh, I'm looking
for Kodaka.

412
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,916
I mean, is Kodaka there?

413
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,541
-Sena, are you okay?
-Yeah.

414
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,125
-Um, is this Kodaka?
-Yes.

415
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,791
What's wrong with
you, Creepy Pants?!

416
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,125
That scared the
crap out of me!

417
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,666
Why'd you change your
voice like a Psycho-tron?!

418
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,916
Are you trying
to trick me?!

419
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,666
It's how I sound
when I'm half asleep.

420
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,458
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

421
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,833
I don't have time to discuss
your vocal acrobatics right now.

422
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,375
Which cell phone
do you have?

423
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,250
The one I've always had.

424
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,750
And which one is that?
What brand?

425
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,833
Style? Do you like it?

426
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,625
Why? Don't be a smarty!

427
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,958
Oh.

428
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,416
Well, the company
is Turn-AU.

429
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,291
I don't know what the
model is, though.

430
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,958
Well go look.
I'll wait.

431
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,625
-What?
-Hurry up!

432
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,916
Alright,
it's an M61B.

433
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,041
-Turn-AU M61B?
-That's right.

434
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,500
Okay, got it.
Talk to you later.

435
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,500
What the hell was
that all about?

436
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:17,125
Completely naked and
waiting for you, Kodaka.

437
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,375
You just imagined Rika
naked, didn't you?

438
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,125
You are such a
dirty pervie!

439
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,375
Guess that means
you'd want to know

440
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,666
that Yozora's wearing
a flesh suit, too!

441
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,541
Here's a picture of her
perfectly soft and round

442
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,541
patootie to prove it!

443
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,916
Hope you enjoy!

444
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,916
I'm wearing clothes,
and that was Rika's arm.

445
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,458
Oh yeah!

446
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,750
Yozora, stop!

447
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,000
Why are you pulling down
Rika's undies like that?!

448
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,541
No, Rika can't
pose like this!

449
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,083
It's too embarrassing!

450
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,541
Kodaka you need
to be careful.

451
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,625
That one's
a pervert.

452
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,458
Good to see you!

453
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,958
Rika just discovered how great
the girl-on-girl stories are!

454
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,291
Rika never thought
about it before,

455
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,333
but loves all
sexcapades!

456
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,041
They say it's good to
have passions in life.

457
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,375
You want some tea?

458
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,666
Sure, thanks.

459
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,000
Where is everyone?

460
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,458
Oh. They all had things
to do so they left.

461
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,541
It's kinda late.
We should get home, too.

462
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,583
Yeah.

463
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,250
The goddess has
descended upon you!

464
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,000
Great. Thanks.

465
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,833
-I'm going to sleep.
-What?!

466
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,708
Really?! That's all
you have to say?!

467
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,125
Fine, let's see how
apathetic you are

468
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,958
when you see
this sexy guy!

469
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,583
You're speechless,
aren't you?

470
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,958
I decided to go ahead and
ask Daddy for one yesterday

471
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,333
and he bought
it for me.

472
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,250
That's, the exact same
cell phone that I have.

473
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,416
Even the color!

474
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,750
Is it?

475
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,750
What a strange and
unplanned coincidence.

476
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,541
There's no way
that's a coincidence.

477
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,458
You are so pathetic
sometimes.

478
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,666
Now we can text each other
and have inside jokes, too!

479
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,000
Quick, get
your phone out!

480
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,375
'Kay. Do you know
how to send a text

481
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,666
so that I can
save your number?

482
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,208
Of course I do!

483
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,291
Don't act like you didn't
just learn how yesterday!

484
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,583
I wasn't!

485
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,375
Don't be jealous.
I'll let you text me, too.

486
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,583
Here's my number.

487
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,791
I have absolutely no
desire to text you.

488
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,458
What?! Not even for the club?!

489
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,791
Then why did I buy
this stupid thing?!

490
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,375
So that you can
stalk me, apparently.

491
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,916
Please, no one wants
to deal with you

492
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,125
more than
they have to.

493
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,000
I was just trying to
be a good club mate.

494
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,375
Not my fault if I
send something out

495
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,583
and you're
completely lost

496
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,041
because you were being
a Droopy McDrooper.

497
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,375
I wanted to save you
some embarrassment.

498
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,875
The least you can
do is thank me! Gah!

499
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:43,916
Thank you, but
I'm fine...

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,666
I'll find another
way to keep up.

501
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,916
We already tried other
ways to keep up!

502
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,041
Aww.

503
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,041
Are we throwing
a temper tantrum?

504
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,791
That's not the way to get
what you want from me.

505
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,541
Try being a little more
grown-up and sincere.

506
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,208
What are you saying?

507
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,458
If you think I'm going to
beg you, you're crazy!

508
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,083
You know what?!
Forget it!

509
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,833
I don't want your
smelly number!

510
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,916
She's way too
soft for real.

511
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,708
It's Sena.

512
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,791
I need you to give me that
Horned Beast's number.

513
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,750
She's gone too far.
I need to get her back.

514
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,750
This is what she says in
her first text message?

515
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,958
I'm not surprised.

516
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,416
If she wants my number that
badly, I'll give it to her.

517
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,541
But I need hers first.

518
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,166
What is it, Kodaka?

519
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,375
Tell me so I can give
her what she wants.

520
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,041
Um. Okay.

521
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,166
Help! I don't
know what to do!

522
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,291
This is so awful!

523
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,375
Please! Can you tell
me what happened?!

524
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,041
It won't stop!
I've tried everything!

525
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,375
Whoa... what is that?

526
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,541
So weird!

527
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,416
I think
it's broken!

528
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,041
I think I'm gonna
call it a night.

529
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,583
Kodaka, do something!

530
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,958
Well, let me see it.

531
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,208
What am I going to do
if it can't be fixed?

532
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,416
It was my first
cell phone!

533
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,958
It'll be okay.
We'll fix it.

534
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,791
See! It's already
looking better!

535
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,333
I bet if you smile, it'll
heal the rest of the way.

536
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,250
Maybe?

537
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:32,333
[Music]

538
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:59,166
Meat, I think everyone these
days has a smart phone.

539
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,416
Smart phone...?

540
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,041
Oh! I've heard of those!

541
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,791
Yeah. They're super
efficient and easy to use,

542
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,291
but only under one condition:

543
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,875
You have to be
smart to own one.

544
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:09,041
So I guess you're out of
luck there, Fatty Cakes.

545
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,750
-Really?!
-No, not 'really'.

546
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,458
But my god, you're dense!

547
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,916
What?! I believed you there
for a second, you turd!

548
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,041
But now that I think about it,

549
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,833
it really doesn't
make any sense at all.

550
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,000
There's nothing this
Goddess can't use!

551
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,916
Next time--School
Swimsuits Don't Appear!

552
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,500
What?! Swimsuit episode?!

553
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,250
Why do guys love
swimsuits so much?

554
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,541
It just looks
like wet underwear!
