1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,250
-So last weekend...
-Yeah?

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,458
We went swimming
together,

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,375
and that was fun,
but like...

4
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,791
I just don't know
what it meant, you know?

5
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:24,500
Yeah.

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,166
I'm sorry I'm late!

7
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,166
Do you wanna go
there together?

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,916
Yeah. Next Sunday
sound good to you?

9
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,541
The season of happy kids.

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,375
Awesome.

11
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,625
I'm back.

12
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,041
It's so hot outside.

13
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,291
What's wrong,
Guernica?

14
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,375
-Fight back!
-Raysis, why?!

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,791
Um... Why don't you have
the air conditioner on?

16
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,041
I think it broke.

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,375
Of course you don't!

18
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,541
You've never been anything
more than a fool!

19
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:11,375
[Music]

20
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,541
Okay, I'm back yet again.

21
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,208
Did you get us a new AC?

22
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,791
Yeah, but they won't
be able to install it

23
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,000
for three more days.

24
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh no... Three whole days...

25
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,375
Is there anything more
worthless than, humans...

26
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,791
Fascinating...

27
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,125
All right then, for the
time being at least...

28
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,833
Let us go forth
and make merry

29
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,625
with our usual
purgatorial feast.

30
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,250
I am still Rasis Vi
Felicity Sumeragi, right?

31
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,041
Even if I were to be
surrounded with flames

32
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,250
measuring twenty
million degrees...

33
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,333
I would remain the great and
mighty King of all the night.

34
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,458
Why don't you change in
a shorts or something?

35
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,625
This dress embodies my powers
of darkness, stupid head!

36
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,250
I can't just take it
off because I'm hot!

37
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,291
Yeah, right...

38
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,500
You want some tea?

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,333
Is this episode new?

40
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,375
Oh, it's the one you
recorded yesterday.

41
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,875
Here you go.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,666
You've backed
me into a corner.

43
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,375
Who would believe it?

44
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,208
Now... Gaze upon
my true form!

45
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,500
Releasing binding spell!

46
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,708
Unleashing magic power!

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,750
Yes... This is my true form.

48
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:01,916
True form...

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,416
But it's so beautiful!

50
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,333
I guess the finale
must be next week.

51
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,750
Brother!

52
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,958
I'm releasing the...

53
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,791
Binding Spell!

54
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,125
I mean, releasing...

55
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,416
Binding spell!!

56
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,541
Why aren't you
watching me?!

57
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,625
Put everything you just
took off into the washer.

58
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,083
Okay.

59
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,750
Unleashing Magic Power!

60
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,375
Now, you may gaze
upon my true form.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,708
-Ripoff?
-It's not a ripoff!

62
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,125
I did not desire for
it to be necessary

63
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,875
to unleash my true
power onto you.

64
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,708
Blame it on a particularly
annoying season of hell.

65
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,583
I do only what I must.

66
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,208
Sure thing,
whatever you say.

67
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,583
Hey... So listen...

68
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,958
I'm about to head
out to the club.

69
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,125
You wanna go with?

70
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,291
I mean, if you're allowed
to go out wearing that...

71
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,500
They do have a working
air conditioner.

72
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,750
I'll go.

73
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,666
-Hey Kobato...
-Yeah?

74
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,125
Those are clothes you wore in
elementary school, aren't they?

75
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,875
I can't believe you
still fit into them

76
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,041
even though you're in your
second year of middle school.

77
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,916
I wonder if you've
stopped growing already.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,916
So what do
I do about it?

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,833
I don't wanna be
this little forever!

80
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,583
Wait, now that I'm
thinking about it...

81
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,125
As a member of
the Night Tribe,

82
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,125
I'm supposed
to be eternal...

83
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,875
Which means, of course...

84
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,625
My body will never get
discrepant or ugly with age.

85
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,666
That's a good point.

86
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,708
I'm glad you're not
gonna get discrepant.

87
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,625
You know...
Or decrepit...

88
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,750
It's whatever.

89
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,125
-Hey, we're here.
-You're late.

90
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,041
We're glad you made it
nonetheless, Big Brother...

91
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,500
-Hey! Big Brother!
-Come on in.

92
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,083
Long time no see, huh?

93
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,458
Long like forever, right?

94
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,208
Yukimura got me
sushi for lunch today.

95
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,458
How great is that?

96
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,875
And yesterday he
gave me steak.

97
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,583
He's the best, isn't
he, big brother?

98
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,333
Sushi... Steak?

99
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,750
Since you ordered
me to make sure

100
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,708
I only gave Miss Maria
food that tasted good.

101
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,083
Whatever I made for her,

102
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,250
I prepared with every bit
of my heart and soul.

103
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,291
Yeah, I know I said
that, but I mean...

104
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,041
Aren't you going
a bit overboard?

105
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,750
When you force fed me
that nasty medicine,

106
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,583
I swore I was gonna chop
something important

107
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,916
off of that she-male,

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,791
but now that you're not
crazy, it's different!

109
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,208
Thanks so much, Yukimura!

110
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,916
You should thank
Big Brother, not me.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,541
Thank you, Big Brother.

112
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,416
I love you so, much!

113
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,875
You stupid!
Who do you think you are?

114
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,958
I hope you turn into a pig
from everything you eat,

115
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,750
so then my brother will hate
you and your nasty, fat guts!

116
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,833
Hey! What was that?!

117
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,791
Who the hell are you?

118
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,958
I'm my big brother's
little sister, thank you!

119
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,958
Cute! Hey Kobato!

120
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,375
You're that dummy vampire?!

121
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,666
The one that tricked me?

122
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,625
Incarnation of darkness!

123
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,583
Begone! Begone!
Begone! Begone!

124
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:30,958
She bit me!

125
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,250
Why would you do that!

126
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,000
Dummy stupid-headed
dummy-head!

127
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,208
Of course she bit you...

128
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,000
That's what vampires do.

129
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,833
That's what you get,
Tool of God!

130
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,875
And now that you've been
bitten by a real vampire,

131
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,833
your cursed fate shall be to
become a vampire as well!

132
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,583
Is that true, Big Brother?

133
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,666
That is normally how
these things work, yeah.

134
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,166
Nooooo...!

135
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,875
I'm gonna turn
into a vampire.

136
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,583
I don't wanna turn
into a vampire.

137
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,958
Maria... I've heard if you
bathe in the suns rays

138
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,375
immediately after
getting bitten...

139
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,083
It kills the curse and you
won't turn into a vampire.

140
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,375
-What, are you serious?
-Of course I am.

141
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,833
Although it won't work
if you wear clothes.

142
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,458
You have to be completely
and utterly naked.

143
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,333
Okay, got it!
Thank you, Yozora!

144
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,208
You are really evil.

145
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,416
She's just so stupid;
I can't help myself.

146
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,333
What do you want?

147
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,000
And please stop staring
at me; it's weird.

148
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,250
Kobato, you are just
the cutest thing...

149
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,666
But... what happened
to your goth-lolli look?

150
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,875
I liked it!

151
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,083
I just unleashed my true
power; no big deal.

152
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,333
I have no idea
what that means,

153
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,166
but I cannot stand
how adorable you are!

154
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,750
I wanna eat you alive
whenever I see you!

155
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,166
Please... Don't do that.

156
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,375
Tell Rika something.

157
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,000
What kind of panties
are you wearing?

158
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,166
You guys need
to cut it out.

159
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,500
Just take them off
so we can see them.

160
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,750
As God as my witness,

161
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,208
I'm gonna conquer
that cutey Kobato, too!

162
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,750
Behave yourself,
perverts.

163
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,000
You're freaking her out.

164
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,833
Shine on me!

165
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,000
The suns rays!

166
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,375
God's light
will save me!

167
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,041
The sucky thing about summer
is there's nothing to do.

168
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,208
Yeah.

169
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,416
At this point,
I would be okay

170
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,000
with ten times the amount
of summer homework

171
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,416
they forced on us.

172
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Well, speak for yourself.

173
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,416
While we're sitting here
being bored to death,

174
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,958
I wonder what other
people have decided

175
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,583
to do with their free time.

176
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,041
They're having fun with
their friends, obviously.

177
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,541
I wish all the happy
people would just die.

178
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,583
I wish they'd die, too.

179
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,625
What'd video game
characters ever do to you?

180
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,875
In this scene, if I were
the writer of this game.

181
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,791
I'd so put in a killer shark.

182
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,916
A shark?

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,291
What're you being
all nasty for?

184
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,458
Come on, Meat.

185
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,000
If a shark appeared
out of nowhere

186
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,708
and tore apart all
those lame bimbos,

187
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,208
that would be an awesome
god game, and you know it.

188
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,333
Except that doesn't
make sense here,

189
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,958
so it would never happen...

190
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,083
They're at a public pool,
not in the freaking ocean.

191
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,958
A shark!

192
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,541
Ha... There's no way that's
a real shark, you guys.

193
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,625
Like, yeah...

194
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,166
It's gotta be a
radio controlled one

195
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,000
or something normal
like that...

196
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,541
Watch... no way this game
pulls something that cliché.

197
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,541
What is a real shark
doing in a public pool?

198
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,791
This is so lame!

199
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:15,916
Breathe...

200
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,666
Now, it's a comedy

201
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,916
so we should wait for the
punch line of the joke.

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,875
I can totally see how a
shark in a public pool

203
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
would set up
a good laugh...

204
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,833
I predict the lead character

205
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,916
ends up killing the shark
in some hilarious way...

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,583
I bet that'll make
my score go up!

207
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,041
No!! Mizuki!!!!!

208
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,166
You're right;
that was hilarious.

209
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,000
I've had enough of
this shitty game!

210
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,333
The name of that
game is called

211
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,333
Saint Jaws Academy
Tale, right?

212
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,916
Yeah, what of it?

213
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,250
Rika heard the ending of it was
supposed to be really bad...

214
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,458
Troll bad...

215
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,416
If you don't set up
flags on Saint Jaws...

216
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,125
It not only throws you
into a crappy ending...

217
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,250
But then it finishes
with a nasty gore scene

218
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,833
that practically
comes out of nowhere.

219
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,541
It's like, so random...

220
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,833
Actually, the game is kind
of famous for being stupid.

221
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,375
I had no idea chick
games could be so deep.

222
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,958
It's funny because I'd kill
to go to a pool right now.

223
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,916
What? You're saying
this immediately

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,833
after seeing a bunch
of oversexed heroines

225
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,125
devoured by a shark
at a public pool?

226
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,958
Does this mean you have a
death wish-please say yes.

227
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,083
Are you trying
to make sense?

228
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,750
Going swimming has nothing
to do with that game...

229
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,375
I'd just really like
to go to a pool, okay?

230
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,958
Oh, good.
I was getting worried.

231
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,208
Just know if you
ever decide

232
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,916
your fate is to be ripped
to shreds by a shark

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,958
I'll think about saving
you for at least a second...

234
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,875
So, you're welcome.

235
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,625
Uh... Okay, thank you?

236
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,333
Me too...
I wanna go to a pool.

237
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,375
Kobato! You can go
with me if you want!

238
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,125
We'll have the most
amazing time together!

239
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,708
Creepy Meat returns.

240
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,541
A pool, huh...?

241
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,000
Isn't that where
happy people go?

242
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,458
If I'd made some
friends yet...

243
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,666
I bet I'd wanna
go to a pool too.

244
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,250
It shouldn't be that hard
of a decision for you.

245
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,166
I've been to Sea God's Palace
Land before with Ko...

246
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,916
h... Hey! Why don't we
all go there together...

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,375
You know as a club
activity or something...

248
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,416
Call it a rehearsal
for the real thing.

249
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,375
That doesn't
suck too hard.

250
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,500
I mean it's not like we
have anything better to do.

251
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,791
-Let's go!
-Hey, Kodaka...

252
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,625
Try not to get too excited when
you see Rika in her swimsuit.

253
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,125
I bet you wear
a dress thing...

254
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,500
You know, like
those cover ups

255
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,250
that keep people from
seeing you in a suit.

256
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,500
What? No, I don't...

257
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,791
To prove it...

258
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,541
Rika will purchase
a sexy new suit,

259
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,416
which is bound to make
you drool all over her.

260
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,375
Low cut leg...
String bikini...

261
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,708
A barely there number...

262
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,875
a Band-Aid Piece...

263
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,000
Or nude!

264
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,208
For the win!

265
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,583
I have no idea what
half of those are...

266
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,708
Guess she's excited.

267
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,791
Hey sexy!

268
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,333
We're all over here!

269
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,708
You guys're
always early.

270
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,166
No we're not;
you're just late.

271
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,166
What's the deal; we weren't
supposed to meet here.

272
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,833
Holy crap!

273
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,083
It was like this
when we got here.

274
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,916
I bet they're all headed
to the pool, too.

275
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,500
I can't believe how
awful this crowd is.

276
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,791
Hey, Yozora, are you
feeling okay...?

277
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,125
You look kinda sick.

278
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,666
I am...

279
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,083
It's not from
the bus...

280
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,875
It's from all the people.

281
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,041
I feel real bad...

282
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,125
-Here.
-I'm good...

283
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,958
I'm not gonna
throw up.

284
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,791
Definitely not
gonna throw up...

285
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,041
Definitely.

286
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,958
Rika's not gonna
hurl, either.

287
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,875
-You feel sick, too?
-Yep...

288
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,375
Rika's no good
in crowds.

289
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,916
They make her
real anxious...

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,875
But don't worry...
Rika's fine...

291
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,291
If she must...

292
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,625
she can easily find
energy from you...

293
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,750
As in from
below the belt!

294
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,250
Wow... That's great.

295
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,541
By the way...

296
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,833
When Yozora says,
"Definitely not gonna throw up."

297
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,166
Is it kind of a turn on,
or is that just Rika?

298
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,125
No, it's absolutely
just Rika...

299
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,916
Are you only
sick mentally?

300
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,291
So, Kobato...

301
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,041
Whatcha wanna do when
we get to the pool?

302
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,416
Go swim.

303
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,000
I guess that's obvious.

304
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,041
Would you like for me to
teach you how to swim?

305
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,791
No... I know how.

306
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,041
Of course you do...

307
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,541
What are you good at?

308
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,166
-Long distance.
-Cool...

309
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,500
Why don't we do
that together?!!

310
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,583
No.

311
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,291
She's even adorable
when she's being rude!

312
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,416
I know she's sweet
on the inside, though!

313
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,041
Oh no...
Are you okay?

314
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,625
Bro, a little
help here, please!

315
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,125
-I don't like this at all.
-Did you hurt yourself?

316
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,875
Oh... I'm so sorry.

317
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,250
I wonder if
they're sisters;

318
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,291
they're a lot alike.

319
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,458
We finally made it.

320
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,791
Yeah.

321
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,666
Hooray.

322
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,000
You see, I told
you I was fine.

323
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,375
I so did not throw up.

324
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,208
Yeah. Way to go.

325
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,333
Yozora definitely
did not hurl.

326
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,166
Wow, there are so
many people here.

327
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,166
It wasn't like this
last time, at all.

328
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,250
I guess it's so hot

329
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,958
even commoners will cough up
some money to go to the pool.

330
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,208
Curse this damn
infertile sun!

331
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,333
Luckily, I exist
in my true form now,

332
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,333
so its rays can no
longer destroy me.

333
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,166
Can we go in...
I'm so hot.

334
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,250
Look at that...

335
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,250
No wonder it's so
freakin' crowded.

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,958
We're risking our
lives being here.

337
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,958
Why did we not
do this in July?

338
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,208
Look on the bright side;
at least it's cheaper.

339
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,458
Who cares?! I'd rather pay
twice as much than be forced

340
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,833
to deal with
these people.

341
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,250
I think their half-price
sale can totally suck it.

342
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,250
Well, speak for
yourself again...

343
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,541
Come on, let's go.

344
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,666
That took forever...

345
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,083
-Here.
-Thanks!

346
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,125
Shall we change and meet
in front of the showers?

347
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,041
Yeah.

348
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,500
A girl!

349
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,625
Look at that...

350
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,000
I guess I'm just
one of those girls

351
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,041
who's instantly
hated by all guys

352
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,125
even though
I'm really a boy.

353
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,333
No... You're wrong.

354
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,416
That's not true.

355
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,875
Hey... He might
not look like it,

356
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,541
but this dude
is totally a...

357
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,958
guuyyy!

358
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,083
Wait... I Um...

359
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,541
Yeah you tell 'em, bro!

360
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,208
This should be fine.

361
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,875
I guess we should
get changed.

362
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,208
Yes, that sounds good.

363
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,500
Why the hell did you bring
a girl's swimsuit with you?

364
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
Because Yozora told me to;

365
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,750
she said that I should
wear one today.

366
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,500
And why would you ever
ask Yozora for advice?

367
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,708
Because Yozora has become
my trusted advisor.

368
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,125
She had a good point.

369
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,083
I want my inner masculinity
to shine through

370
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,125
even when wearing
women's clothing...

371
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,541
I thought this would be
a good challenge for me.

372
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,833
Way too intense.

373
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,791
Well, I did bring along
a man's swimsuit too,

374
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,916
just in case.

375
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,166
Dude... What's that?

376
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,333
Oh... It's a loincloth.

377
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,958
By all means, challenge yourself
with the women's swimsuit.

378
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,250
I'll let you borrow the
loincloth if you want to.

379
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,041
I don't; thanks, though.

380
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,666
Are you doing okay...?

381
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,416
Do you need me to help
you get into your suit?

382
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,541
No!

383
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,083
All right...

384
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,083
You need some help?

385
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:49,875
Yes.

386
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,250
I'd appreciate it.

387
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,583
Calm down, Kodaka...

388
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,750
He's a dude.

389
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,875
All set.

390
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,208
That was very nice...

391
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,166
Thank you.

392
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,416
Yeah...

393
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,125
How do girls put
stuff like that on

394
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,500
and take it off
all by themselves?

395
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,000
-Hey!
-Is anything wrong?

396
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,291
Are you okay?

397
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,625
Why... are you
hiding your chest?

398
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,375
Because it's not
very muscular,

399
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,875
and I'm embarrassed by it.

400
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,250
But if ...

401
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,041
If you really want to
see it, I'll let you.

402
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,083
I don't wanna see...!

403
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,000
Just put your top
back on already.

404
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,416
Understood, sir.

405
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,000
It's about time; what
took you guys so long?!

406
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,416
Nothing... More importantly,

407
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,416
I'd rather not
talk about it.

408
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,583
Why is Yukimura wearing
a girl's swimsuit?

409
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,250
I said I'd rather
not talk about it...

410
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,333
Hey, wait...

411
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,083
Where are Yozora and Rika?

412
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,250
They told me they'd be out
after they rested a bit.

413
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,583
Yeah, it looked like

414
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,416
that ride was pretty
rough on both of them.

415
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm gonna go swim now.

416
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,125
Yay! You guys it's so cold!

417
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,416
Hurry up, bro!

418
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,625
Coming!

419
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,291
Crazy.

420
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,125
Having this many people
cannot be legal.

421
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,583
Long distance is out.

422
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,041
Yeah, I can imagine
that would be difficult.

423
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,375
This is gross...

424
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,583
And annoying.

425
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,208
I wish that shark
would show up.

426
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,000
But I thought sharks
were too cliché for you.

427
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,625
When the girls
finally get out.

428
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,500
How about we head
down to the lazy river

429
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,833
and maybe the
water slide?

430
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,750
Fine... This is awful.

431
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,416
That it is.

432
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
It wasn't this bad
last time we came.

433
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,791
No...

434
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,750
It was way better.

435
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,875
Yeah, way better until
you got all mad at me.

436
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:45,958
What are you
talking about?

437
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,333
-You got mad at me!
-No.

438
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,166
You were pissed.

439
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,333
But then, when we
were leaving...

440
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,041
What did you say
"thank you" for?

441
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,208
What's going on?!

442
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,333
Those girls are taking
for freaking ever!

443
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,666
Guess so.

444
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,291
I'll be right back...

445
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,875
I'm gonna go
check on them.

446
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,166
I wonder what she's
upset about now.

447
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,125
I get it...

448
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,416
At the time, there
were only three of us

449
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,625
in the Neighbors Club...

450
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,333
We've got more
members now...

451
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,125
Show me.

452
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,750
I guess we haven't exactly
made any friends yet, either.

453
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,541
But, depending on
how you look at it,

454
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,500
I think we've all at
least changed a lot.

455
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:37,958
Kodaka!

456
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,000
Yozora just sent
me this message.

457
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:44,958
They went home?!

458
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,708
Kodaka!

459
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,041
Where'd he go?

460
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,208
Yozora! Rika!

461
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:06,833
You guys...

462
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,041
Don't go!
Come on!

463
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,291
Wait!

464
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,708
She's so stupid.

465
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,958
Why'd they have to leave;

466
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,208
I had planned to show off

467
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,291
my ultra elegant
swimming form to her.

468
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,750
Or maybe we haven't
changed after all.

469
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,458
What'd you say?

470
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,000
What? Nothing.

471
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,083
Should we go home, too?

472
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,083
Yeah.

473
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,083
The Neighbors Club
activity report...

474
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,416
Today's activity...

475
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,416
Nothing.

476
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:32,583
[Music]

477
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,958
-Here's some shabushabu.
-Meat! Meat! Meat!.

478
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,833
-Also some sushi...
-Raw meat! Raw meat! Raw meat!

479
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:02,833
I made you steak, too.

480
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,541
It's marbled and delicious!

481
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,458
-Broiled eel over rice.
-I can't even see the rice;

482
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:07,666
there's so much meat!

483
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,500
This is too yummy;
I can't stop eating!

484
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,708
Thank you!

485
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,083
I can't move anymore.

486
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,958
Oh no... I just had the
worstest most scariestest dream

487
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,708
I've ever had in
my whole life.

488
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,083
Next... The President's
Recollections are painful.

489
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,208
I'm never gonna eat again!
