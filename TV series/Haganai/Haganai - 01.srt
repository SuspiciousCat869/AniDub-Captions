1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,750
Shut up! There's no way;

2
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,541
she so did not do that.

3
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,375
Oh yes she did,
and, girl...

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,250
Yeah!

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,625
Hurry up! We're
gonna get in trouble

6
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,833
if we're late again!

7
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,125
I know, I'm trying!

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,916
So you went ahead
and bought 'em?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,416
Yep! Brand new shoes!

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,166
I'm gonna be
super fast today!

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,833
Just you wait!

12
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,041
You'll be eating my dust!

13
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,458
Oh, whatever!

14
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,875
Miss Takayama,

15
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,250
please return to the faculty
room as soon as possible.

16
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,375
Yeah, that one made
me cry a lot, too.

17
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,708
Why is he in the library?

18
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,416
You girls are late again!

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,750
We're sorry.

20
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,791
Get changed immediately
and start running laps!

21
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,083
Okay.

22
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,333
-And get a better attitude!
-Okay!

23
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,625
So Sena.

24
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:03,958
Where are you going now?

25
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,750
I did bring that movie
I was talking about

26
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:06,875
if you wanted to see it.

27
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,083
What's wrong, Sena?

28
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,625
I forgot my gym clothes.

29
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,833
Do you wanna go back to
that same store again?

30
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,791
I was just about to ask
you the same question!

31
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,250
I... I'm so sorry!

32
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,750
-Oh my God, we almost died!
-He is totally the worst!

33
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:53,416
[Music]

34
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,708
Kyou, you're so exaggerating.

35
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,041
I am totally not!

36
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,458
I'm telling you;
they both almost died

37
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,125
like right there
in the hallway!

38
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,375
Um, no it's not,
like at all!

39
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,958
Who's in there talking?

40
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,541
She must be on a cell
phone or something.

41
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,458
Come on you
always say that.

42
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,166
I know that girl.

43
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,791
She's in my class.

44
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,375
Yozora something.

45
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,291
Mikazuki, I think.

46
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,208
But I've never heard her
laugh like that in class

47
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,583
or, well, ever.

48
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,666
She always looks
pissed as hell.

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,791
Kind of like she's
about to murder someone.

50
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,375
I've never really seen
her talk to anybody.

51
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,000
Crazy.

52
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,041
Hold on this is
officially weird.

53
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,708
She's not talking
on the phone at all!

54
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,833
What the hell?

55
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,750
Who's she talking to?

56
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,250
Is there somebody
hiding in there?

57
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,000
A girl talking to
an invisible thing

58
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,875
in an empty classroom at dusk.

59
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,750
You know, this
sounds exactly

60
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,125
like the beginning of a
book I just started reading.

61
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,833
Next, after
various obstacles,

62
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,083
I discover her secret
and ultimately defend her

63
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:40,166
by fighting and killing
"a thing not of this World".

64
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,416
Then we would, naturally,
uh, Fall in, uh, love.

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,333
I guess.

66
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,500
You know what Tomo I think
I do remember that...

67
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,500
Huh?

68
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,000
That's what she
usually looks like.

69
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,583
But she was so cute
when she was laughing.

70
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,375
What do you want?

71
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,958
I... I was just wondering.

72
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,500
Do you, like, see
ghosts and stuff?

73
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,916
What?

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,541
Uh, no. cause
ghosts don't exist.

75
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,375
Well then, who have
you been talking to?

76
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,666
You were watching me?

77
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,875
Look. I was having
a conversation

78
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,625
with my best friend ever.

79
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,208
She's made of air okay!

80
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,625
You have an air friend?

81
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,625
What the crap is that?

82
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,666
It's exactly what
I said it was.

83
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,958
You've heard of an "air
guitar" before, haven't you?

84
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,666
She's like that
but cooler.

85
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,916
So let's see.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,916
You pretend someone is
there and talk to them

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,208
like they're
talking back to you?

88
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,791
I'm not pretending.

89
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,500
Tomo exists you big jerk.

90
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,000
See she's right
here next to me!

91
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,583
For example Tomo and I were just
talking about this one time

92
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,875
when we went
to a theme park

93
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,333
back when we were
in middle school.

94
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,000
This group of guys was
totally hitting on us

95
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:24,916
while we were there.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,166
I mean it was ridiculous

97
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,791
so I decided to
pretend one of them

98
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,958
was going to be our hot
new homeroom teacher.

99
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,166
You just said you
were pretending!

100
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,625
Shut up! The point is
it really happened!

101
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,541
Oh really?

102
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,166
How much of it
really happened?

103
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,791
The part where I was
in middle school.

104
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,250
So only ninety--nine percent
of it was a complete lie?

105
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,625
I was hoping the
amusement park

106
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,250
would at least
turn out to be real.

107
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,041
Seriously who
would want to go

108
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,250
to an amusement
park by themself?

109
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,750
You just admitted
you were alone!

110
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,416
Stop! Go ahead
and get over it

111
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,958
because Tomo is
unbelievably adorable.

112
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,416
That chick is
off her rocker.

113
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,916
This cannot end well.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,958
So this is really about
self-- preservation.

115
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,541
What is that look for?

116
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,791
I dunno.

117
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,750
Wouldn't it be a lot
easier for you to just,

118
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,250
you know, make a
real friend instead.

119
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,500
Not an "air" friend
like adorable Tomo.

120
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,208
But an actual
living person.

121
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,041
Yeah well I would
if I could thank you.

122
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,791
Shocking that you can't.

123
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,708
And just who
are you to talk?

124
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,541
You're that new kid
everyone's afraid of,

125
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,875
isn't that right?

126
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,041
I've been at this school
for well over a month now.

127
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,625
I'm hardly a new kid.

128
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,541
What's your name?

129
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,750
It's Kodaka Hasegawa.

130
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,958
It seems to me you have
no right to say anything

131
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,541
about having friends Kodaka.

132
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,125
First name basis already?

133
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,750
So an entire
month has passed

134
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,916
and you still haven't
made a single friend yet.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,458
Wouldn't you say
that's a little pathetic?

136
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,375
Hey! You only
have an air friend!

137
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,875
Where the hell
do you get off?

138
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,166
There's no reason
to be rude to her.

139
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,458
My friend Tomo is
adorable and crazy smart.

140
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,166
And she's also
an amazing athlete

141
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,458
and the absolute
best friend a girl

142
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,416
like me could
ever hope to have!

143
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,416
What's more.

144
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,541
She would never even dream
about stabbing me in the back.

145
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,041
It's not a mystery.

146
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,250
There's nothing else I can do.

147
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,875
I don't know how
to make friends.

148
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,458
Yeah, I'm not really
that great at it either.

149
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,500
Did you not have any
friends at your old school?

150
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,916
Of course I did.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,125
Don't you still
talk to them?

152
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,541
He said he would text me,
but I haven't heard from him.

153
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,041
Maybe you misunderstood
and just like,

154
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,541
thought you were friends.

155
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,833
Maybe shut up.

156
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,875
Fine, then.

157
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,416
You know, if you wanted,

158
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
you could try to pay someone
to be friends with you.

159
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,166
No. That's so lame, gah.

160
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,208
Come on. A small
stipend every week

161
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,458
for spending time
together at school.

162
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,583
Like a prostitute?

163
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,500
What is that, a
friend--stitute?

164
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,291
No, it's a basic contract.

165
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,541
Yeah. There's nothing
wrong with a contract!

166
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,208
Or you could just ask
someone to be your friend.

167
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,583
I've seen people do that
on after school specials,

168
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,875
but I don't really get it.

169
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,375
You ask someone
to be friends,

170
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,791
and the moment they agree,
a friendship is suddenly formed.

171
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,791
Even if you'd never spoken
to each other before then.

172
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,541
What if you never even
talk after getting approval?

173
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,416
Can you still consider that
person to be your friend?

174
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, well I guess
I can't really blame you.

175
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,000
It's not my thing either.

176
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,416
Besides I'm
pretty independent

177
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,541
so it's not like I need
to have any friends.

178
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,583
Right.

179
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,291
Not having friends must be
so hard on that poor girl.

180
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,416
Condescension has to be
my least favorite thing

181
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,875
in the whole world.

182
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,916
Well.

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,750
I can understand.

184
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,041
For whatever reason,

185
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,875
people think if you don't
have a lot of friends

186
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,000
there's something
wrong with you.

187
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,750
I don't think
that's true, though.

188
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,041
At least I hope it's not.

189
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,083
I'm perfectly
fine being alone.

190
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,250
Having a few general
acquaintances at school.

191
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,250
Those types of superficial
friends are enough for me.

192
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,416
Yeah, but still.

193
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,791
I have to admit.

194
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,625
It would be nice to
have a real friend.

195
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,500
-What about school clubs?
-No way.

196
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,000
Why's that a bad idea?

197
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,500
Because we're in
our second year.

198
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,875
Club--based friendships
have already been established.

199
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,250
It'd be too embarrassing
to join one now.

200
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,125
Not to mention
completely obvious.

201
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,333
I guess that's true.

202
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,333
If you're only joining
a club to make friends

203
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,208
and not because you
share an interest,

204
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,208
you're only going to
screw with their dynamic.

205
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,833
You'll end up being
the one loser member

206
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,291
with nothing to offer.

207
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,125
Why would they even
want you to join?

208
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,625
She's got a point.

209
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,583
I'd only join a club
to meet people;

210
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,708
I don't really have
any other reason.

211
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,833
And I would hate to bug them
if they were already friends.

212
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,041
That would suck.

213
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,958
That's perfect.

214
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,000
A club!

215
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,083
See you later, Kodaka!

216
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,750
Why my hair looks like this?

217
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,791
Oh, well, my late
mother was English,

218
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,958
so I get it from her.

219
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,125
I, mean. Hey.

220
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,541
It's not really PC,
but have at it.

221
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,625
Thank you.

222
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,916
It was pretty difficult,

223
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,750
but I guess time heals
all wounds, right?

224
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,291
My father decided to
go abroad for work.

225
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,041
I started going to Saint
Chronica's Academy

226
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,583
in Tooyashi then,

227
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,791
but my first day of school,

228
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,041
I took the wrong bus

229
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,625
and ended up getting
there really late.

230
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,291
When I finally arrived
at the academy.

231
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,083
I was on the verge of tears.

232
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,625
Compared to crusading
armies, Saladin's army.

233
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,333
Hello.

234
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,541
I'm, uh.

235
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,833
The transfer student.

236
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,708
Okay. Great!

237
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,708
My name is Kodaka.

238
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,208
Nice to be here!

239
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,666
Oh no, Miss Osada!

240
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,791
Did he just attack her?

241
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,041
Delinquent, much?

242
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,125
-He's new here?

243
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,083
-What's up with his hair?

244
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,500
I forgot my book.

245
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,041
Uh. Here!
Take mine!

246
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,750
Oh, thanks?

247
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,208
By the evening
of my first day.

248
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,541
The whole school
had heard the rumor.

249
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,208
I was a thug who
stole the book

250
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,083
of the poor girl
sitting next to me.

251
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,375
It's been a
month since then.

252
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,500
And I still haven't been
able to redeem myself

253
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,833
for that first day fail.

254
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,250
See you later, Kodaka!

255
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,916
What a weird girl.

256
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,625
I did like that she
said my first name;

257
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,041
I haven't heard
that at school, yet.

258
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,166
Nice!

259
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,458
In equations of
the nth degree.

260
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,125
There will
always be a root.

261
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:20,083
As a result, the root of n
in this problem would be.

262
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,791
The usual.

263
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,250
What's wrong with her now?

264
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,958
Kodaka. Follow me, please.

265
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,250
Holy crap, she
talked to him.

266
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,125
To that Hasegawa creep?

267
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,166
Oh. Well, give me a second.

268
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,166
Okay, what's going on?

269
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,333
I've gone through all
the formalities and crap.

270
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,708
What are you
talking about?

271
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,041
I created a new club.

272
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,666
Since we can't join a
club that already exists.

273
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,750
Well. It seemed
only logical for me

274
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,125
to go make a new one.

275
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,458
Yeah, I get it.

276
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,250
In a new club, you don't
have to stress out about

277
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,250
making things
awkward for anybody.

278
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,250
So, what kind of club
did you end up making?

279
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,166
The Neighbors Club.

280
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,500
The Neighbors Club?

281
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,916
That's right.

282
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,000
In compliance with
God's instructions

283
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,583
we embrace everyone
as neighbors,

284
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,291
deepen friendships
on a spiritual level,

285
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,083
yada yada yada, work together

286
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,791
and treat everyone
with the kindness

287
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,208
that God would want,
or what not.

288
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,583
Will a club like that
actually get approved, though?

289
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,791
Are you kidding me?

290
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,416
This school is
full of suckers.

291
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,166
Throw in God or
working hard.

292
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,958
They cannot get
enough of that stuff.

293
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,250
Religion is always
an easy sell.

294
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,458
All right, so then what's
this Neighbors Club

295
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,125
actually going to do?

296
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,333
It's gonna help us
make some damn friends.

297
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,875
And, we can avoid getting
a bunch of pity face

298
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,666
from the other students
while we're at it.

299
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,083
We'll load up on as many
shallow acquaintances as we can.

300
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,375
And then keep our
eye out for people

301
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,000
we could tolerate
as real friends.

302
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,166
Interesting plan
of attack, I guess.

303
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,625
Well, good luck.

304
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,416
Why are you wishing
me good luck.

305
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,625
-You're a member too.
-Huh?

306
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,291
You left before I could get the
paperwork to you yesterday,

307
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,166
so I just went ahead and
filled out your registration.

308
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,041
Say "thank you".

309
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,250
You did what?

310
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,375
You are very welcome.

311
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,416
Now, let the club
activities begin!

312
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,750
You know you want to.

313
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,625
Wait. Where are we going?

314
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,208
This is the chapel's
common room.

315
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,791
You sure this is okay
for the club to use?

316
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,375
The club advisor okayed
it that makes it okay.

317
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,666
Okay. And do they
plan on advising us

318
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,416
on how to make some
new friends, too?

319
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,458
Probably not.

320
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,250
The club advisor in
question is Sister Maria.

321
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,041
She doesn't have a lot
of friends herself.

322
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,875
Then why did she
become our advisor?

323
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,125
I get intimidated by people

324
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,958
who look like they
have a lot of friends,

325
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,000
so I decided
to go with her.

326
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,833
You are something else.

327
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,041
I know. We need to
get more members.

328
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,541
What is this?

329
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,250
It's our poster.

330
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,666
We're gonna put 'em up on
bulletin boards all over school.

331
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,125
We are?

332
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,291
But it doesn't
describe anything

333
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,666
about what the club does.

334
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,041
Shows how much you know.

335
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,291
Try looking at it
diagonally, genius.

336
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,375
Diagonally?

337
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,125
Oh, I see.

338
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,416
Friends wanted?

339
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,625
Get it now?

340
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,666
What did you put a
lame joke in there for?

341
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,291
It's not a joke.

342
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,833
Come on; think about it.

343
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,708
Anyone who is always on
the lookout for friends

344
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,833
is bound to see that
message hidden in the poster.

345
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,958
But that's not all.

346
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,375
I tried to draw a scene
from that famous song,

347
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,416
you know the one about
making one hundred friends

348
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,916
and eating rice balls
at the top of Mt. Fuji.

349
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,916
Even if they don't catch
the diagonal sentence,

350
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,625
the drawing should
totally clue them in on

351
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,083
what we're about.

352
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,375
And you're sure
it's not a joke?

353
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,416
Positive.

354
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,750
Let's hang these
bad boys up.

355
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,125
On to the next one.

356
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,041
Hey.

357
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,250
Are you positive you really
wanna be friends with someone

358
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,875
who's desperate enough to
understand this poster?

359
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,375
So your desperation is
fine, but theirs isn't.

360
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,416
Uh, double
standard dot com.

361
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
You know that's
not what I meant.

362
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,416
And you know that I
have an actual name.

363
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,833
But you keep calling me
you all the damn time.

364
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:08,958
It's really starting
to piss me off.

365
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,791
Oh. I'm sorry.

366
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,666
So, is Mikazuki, alright?

367
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,958
Yozora.

368
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,291
You can use my first name.

369
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,666
Fine. I'll call you that.

370
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,041
Yo... Yozor. uh.

371
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,625
C'mon! Don't you
have a nickname

372
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,458
or something easier
for me to say?

373
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,708
I do.

374
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,333
Did.

375
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,958
Look, I'm not going to
tell you what it was Kodaka.

376
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,458
Why not?

377
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,833
Because only.

378
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,166
Only real friends use
nicknames with each other.

379
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,750
I know! I'm late! I'm sorry!

380
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,500
Man, I'm exhausted.

381
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,708
So. I think we should start
regular activities tomorrow.

382
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,500
Yeah, I seriously
doubt anyone's

383
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,333
going to want to join our club
after looking at that poster.

384
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,833
Oh really? Because that sounds
like a new member to me.

385
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,083
What? We just got back
from putting them up!

386
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,833
This is the Neighbors
Club, right?

387
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,666
I'd like to join, please.

388
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,791
Wrong number.

389
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,125
Hey! What? Yozora!

390
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,791
You're right.
We should start now.

391
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,000
That's not it!

392
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,333
She wants to join.

393
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,458
And she's a girl, who
could be your best friend,

394
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,166
which is kind of what you're
looking for, isn't it?

395
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,791
Don't be ridiculous!

396
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,375
Ohmigah, that
blonde in your hair

397
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,000
is totally
showing right now.

398
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,416
You've already met
my best friend,

399
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,166
and her name is
Tomo; remember?

400
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,166
Okay.

401
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,000
Why did you slam
the door in my face?

402
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,375
I said I want to
join your group!

403
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,208
Die Princess! No!

404
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,500
So, you guys know
each other already?

405
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,958
No, we do not.

406
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,333
Her name is Sena Kashiwazaki.

407
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,541
And she is the daughter
of the Academy president.

408
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,750
She's in Class two--three,

409
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,375
and all the boys worship her.

410
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,791
We do not need to be friends
with princess wannabes.

411
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:02,875
Oh.

412
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,208
Yeah, I've
heard about her.

413
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,375
Of course.

414
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,958
Why is it ya give
a girl blond hair

415
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,083
and huge knockers and guys
fawn all over them?

416
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,375
-It's disgusting.
-What?

417
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,416
I'm not fawning
all over anybody!

418
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,833
Ooh, she's glamorous and
can play sports really well

419
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,583
and makes straight A's.

420
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,208
Sena has been at
the top of the class

421
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,000
since last year in every
freakin' subject.

422
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,208
She can't be that perfect.

423
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,583
There has to be
something wrong with her!

424
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,166
This chick needs
serious therapy.

425
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,541
She is not giving up!

426
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,500
Why are you being
so mean to me?

427
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,833
The only thing
I'm trying to do

428
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,041
is join your
stupid ass club!

429
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,500
If you're here to
spy on us, go away.

430
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,125
I'm not spying on you!

431
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,083
I saw your poster that said you
were looking for some friends.

432
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,583
I want to join because
I want friends too, okay!

433
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,750
Yeah, everybody knows
how perfect I am.

434
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,750
I'm super smart,
really good at sports,

435
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,708
and, obviously,
I'm totes gorgeous.

436
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,958
Only if cow udders
are gorgeous.

437
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,125
Life must be hard for you
having that flat chest.

438
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,625
Oh please it's not
like I'm that flat.

439
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,708
Well, you know what they say
about a pair of tangerines.

440
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,333
You might as well
have nothing.

441
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,791
If I murdered all the women
who had larger breasts than me,

442
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,916
then I would have a relatively
large rack in comparison,

443
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,291
now wouldn't I?

444
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,791
I don't suppose you
would like to become

445
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,625
the glorious first sacrifice
in my lofty plan?

446
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,958
Please stop.

447
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,625
You came here because
you wanted friends, right?

448
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,833
That's right.

449
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,333
What are you
talking about?

450
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,250
You've got guys around
you all the time!

451
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,833
Those are just servants.

452
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,375
I want more than that.

453
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,041
It'd be nice to have
girlfriends for once in my life!

454
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,791
That way, when teams
are formed in class

455
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,458
or when we leave school
for a field trip.

456
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,208
I'll have friends
I can hang out with.

457
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,416
"Oh, come on, you're surrounded
by boys all the time.

458
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,875
Why don't you hang
out with them?"

459
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,208
I don't want to hear anyone
say that to me ever again.

460
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,458
I just want to have
some real friends!

461
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,875
Now that you mention it.

462
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,125
I have heard girls can be
pretty mean to other girls,

463
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,625
especially if they're pretty,
and popular, and intelligent.

464
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,833
Considering you're a thug,

465
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,500
you're a lot smarter
than I thought you'd be.

466
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,916
I don't mind stepping
on you if you want me to.

467
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,916
What the hell's
wrong with you?

468
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,125
Why would I want
you to do that?

469
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,833
I dunno; the boys in
my class usually love it.

470
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,958
Don't tell me you're looking
for something more than that?

471
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,500
What a pervie creep!

472
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,375
I am not a stupid thug
or a pervie creep!

473
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,250
What the crap
are you looking at?

474
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,000
You. This situation is
perfect for you guys.

475
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,333
With both of you here,

476
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,541
you can make friends
with each other, yeah?

477
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,666
What?

478
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,541
Whatever; why would
I ever, like ever,

479
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,250
want to be friends
with somebody like her.

480
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,916
And why would
I ever, like ever

481
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,541
wanna be friends
with someone like her?

482
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,500
What do you mean
by that, boob face?

483
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,041
They just met?

484
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,041
How can they hate each
other so much already?

485
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,958
So, you wanna
stop and get food?

486
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,541
You know I do;
the usual!!

487
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,833
Please go die.

488
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,458
No, you please go die!

489
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,458
Actually, just get
out of here, like now.

490
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,791
No. I'm joining this club.

491
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:58,916
You'll just have
to deal with it.

492
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,875
No you're not!
Get out!

493
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,416
No, you get out!
So there!

494
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,666
This is the first day
of the Neighbors Club.

495
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,000
One person joined
bringing us

496
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,208
to a grand total
of three members.

497
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,791
I guess most people would
consider that a smooth start.

498
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,458
Most people
would be wrong.

499
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,041
Hey, I rented this
awesome movie yesterday.

500
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,708
Ohmigah, it was
so hilarious!

501
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:18,750
Which one was it?

502
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,166
I can't remember the name.

503
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,041
You know the one
where the girl thinks

504
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,166
these people are her friends,

505
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,708
but they're like,
totally the opposite.

506
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:32,250
[Music]

507
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,083
And these two continued.

508
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,333
You know, you are
a terrible person.

509
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,333
Well, that's better
than being an idiot.

510
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,958
Hello, I'm at the
top of our class!

511
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,708
Oh, someone give
her a trophy.

512
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,041
Lady Meat actually
knows how to study.

513
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,541
You bitch! I can have
my Daddy expel you!

514
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:12,833
Aren't you a
little embarrassed

515
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:16,083
to still be using the
word Daddy at your age?

516
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:16,958
You need to
quit this club.

517
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,875
I can't quit my own club.

518
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,833
Since when was it
just your club?

519
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,500
Next. There's No God
in the Electric World!

520
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,541
Look. They agreed on something.
