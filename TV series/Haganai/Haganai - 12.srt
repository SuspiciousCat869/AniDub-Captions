[Music]

2
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,500
Mikazuki.

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,125
Here.

4
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,500
If I were you
I'd take a seat.

5
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,583
Yes, sir.

6
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,083
Sora?

7
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,125
It's been a while...

8
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,125
Taka.

9
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,958
This is the first time

10
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,291
we've really seen each
other in ten long years.

11
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,583
Which included France and
the Holy Roman Empire.

12
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,875
The Third Crusade was
the European attempt to

13
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,916
I remember that day he
first transferred here.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,166
It was right around our
seasonal uniform change.

15
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,166
Hello...

16
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,416
I'm, uh...

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,083
The transfer student.

18
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,458
Okay... Great!

19
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,666
My name is Kodaka...

20
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,208
Nice to be... here!

21
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,125
Oh no, Miss Osada!

22
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,791
-Did he just attack her?
-Delinquent, much?

23
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,625
-He's new here?!
-What's up with his hair?

24
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,708
Taka...

25
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,791
It's Taka!

26
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,208
I'd recognize that hair
and expression anywhere.

27
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,708
It's definitely him!

28
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,541
He hasn't changed a bit
in the last ten years.

29
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,875
He always did
suck at smiling...

30
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,250
And the harder he tried to be
nice and friendly to people,

31
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,208
the more it would
just backfire on him.

32
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,666
I can't believe it.

33
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,250
I forgot my book.

34
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,791
Here! Take mine!

35
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,583
Oh, thanks...?

36
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,583
Yeah, that's him...

37
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,750
It's Taka.

38
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,083
My one and only friend
when I was a kid.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,250
He didn't even notice me!

40
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,875
Well... Tell me what
you think, Tomo.

41
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,791
Yeah... Taka...

42
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,208
Or Kodaka Hasegawa...

43
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,958
My best friend from
back when I was a kid

44
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,958
who doesn't even remember
who I am now...

45
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,416
Isn't that the worst?!

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,125
Yeah...

47
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,291
My best guess is that

48
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,916
it's because I used
to dress like a boy

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,625
whenever we hung
out together...

50
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,833
And yeah I get that,
but still...

51
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,125
No way!

52
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,250
Why should I have be
the one to talk to him?

53
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,791
I mean, think about it...

54
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,333
I have no idea how to start a
conversation with somebody.

55
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,541
I don't know.

56
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,041
I thought maybe I could get
him to talk to me, first.

57
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,916
When I get to school.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,666
When I leave the
class after school.

59
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,791
When I put things
in my locker.

60
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,708
Or take them back out.

61
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,250
I always have
to walk by him.

62
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,291
But he never says a
single word to me.

63
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,125
It's not like that at all!

64
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,000
Whaddaya mean
it's my fault?!

65
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,375
Right... Yeah...

66
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,625
and you know what, Tomo...

67
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,083
You make a really
good point.

68
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,708
Do you wanna go shopping
after school...?

69
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,291
I need some eyeliner.

70
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,791
Sure... Let's try that makeup
place across from the station.

71
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,500
I think I do remember...

72
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,583
No, I can't believe this...!

73
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,875
Crap... Kodaka saw me...!

74
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,541
Could he hear me talking?

75
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,250
I'm gonna die.

76
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,500
Please don't tell me he
heard what I was saying!

77
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,666
This is bad!
This is really bad!

78
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,833
What do I do?

79
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,333
What do you want?

80
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,125
I... I was just wondering.

81
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,666
Do you like, see
ghosts and stuff?

82
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,083
What...?

83
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,083
Uh, no...
'Cause ghosts don't exist.

84
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,458
Well then, who've
you been talking to?

85
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,541
You were watching me?

86
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,833
Look... I was having
a conversation

87
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,500
with my best friend ever...

88
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,083
She's made of air, okay!

89
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,041
And that was the
first conversation

90
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,375
I'd had with Taka
in ten years...

91
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,666
Also, I'm an idiot.

92
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,916
That's perfect...

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,041
A club!

94
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,041
See you later, Kodaka!

95
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,250
That's it...!
I'll start a club!

96
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,583
Here's a new club
application for ya'.

97
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,166
Thank you so much, sir.

98
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,208
If I'm not in a club...

99
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,416
I can make one!

100
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,416
A club just for
me and Kodaka!

101
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,583
Sometimes I
use this chapel

102
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,708
when I need a quiet
place to read...

103
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,125
or when the library's too
crowded for me to focus...

104
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,500
It's always
really comforting.

105
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,750
Sister Maria Takayama

106
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,041
is supposed to be in
charge of this room.

107
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,208
Apparently,
she's still a child.

108
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,041
I guess it's good
I don't hate kids.

109
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,083
Excuse me...

110
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,000
Hey! You!

111
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,041
Why the hell
are you in here?

112
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,333
This is my holy room for
napping, so get out...

113
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,041
It's not a place for
scummy sinners like you!

114
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,375
Hi, my name is
Yozora Mikazuki,

115
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,250
and I'm from
class two-five...

116
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,083
If you're Sister Maria,
I'm supposed to ask you...

117
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,791
Forget it.

118
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,958
What a little brat!

119
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,375
Okay...

120
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,833
I think if you just heard
me out, you'd see that...

121
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,333
I don't listen
to poopy heads.

122
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,458
Oh, you're gonna listen.

123
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,708
I'm applying to start a
new after school club.

124
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,041
And I was hoping
I could use this room.

125
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,375
No means no!

126
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,541
Now get out of here,
you grody plop of poop!

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,958
It's time!

128
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,916
Kodaka... Follow me, please.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Holy crap, she
talked to him.

130
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,041
To that Hasegawa creep?

131
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,125
Now... Let the clubbing begin!

132
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,583
Our purpose can be to
help us make friends...

133
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,500
Perfect, a club
for me and Kodaka...

134
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,208
Taka and Sora...

135
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,500
This way...

136
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,125
We'll be able to
become friends again

137
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,083
like we used to be.

138
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,083
Hey, Hasegawa!

139
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,541
Why is he staring
at Yozora like that?

140
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,208
They're still
standing-hello, awkward.

141
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,916
All right, moving on
with attendance.

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,500
-Miyajima.
-Here.

143
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,708
-Butou.
-Here.

144
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,500
Yaegashi.

145
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,666
Yaegashi?

146
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,208
Sorry. Yeah, I'm here.

147
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:28,875
Good...

148
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,291
-Yamazaki.
-Here.

149
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,083
That's when I said...

150
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,375
So... um... Hey.

151
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,541
Hey what?

152
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,833
I was just...

153
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,250
What happened
to your hair?

154
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,250
Got it cut.

155
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,500
Yeah, well, I can
kinda see that...

156
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,083
But like...
why did you cut it?

157
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,500
Blame that summer
festival night.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,791
But that was just
the tip, right?

159
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,875
It's not like the whole
thing got destroyed.

160
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,416
You didn't have
to cut off so much.

161
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,833
I did have to
cut this much off

162
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,541
because you totally
soaked my head.

163
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,625
No matter how many
times I washed my hair.

164
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,750
That freaking stench
would not come out!

165
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,541
Oh... I'm really sorry...
Please, I...

166
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,291
He soaked her head?

167
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,416
He said 'just the tip",
but did he force her?!

168
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,833
Yeah, that is not cool.

169
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,500
She washed and washed

170
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,375
but couldn't get the gross stink
of his stuff out of her hair.

171
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,625
You're wrong!

172
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,750
I was only doing
what had to be done!

173
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,458
Shut up and come on!

174
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,458
Wait! What?

175
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,291
Yozora!

176
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,958
Okay...

177
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,208
I, uh...

178
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,250
What I'm trying
to say is...

179
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,833
You're right, okay;
I was Sora...!

180
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,125
So what are you thinking?

181
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,416
I'm, uh...

182
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,708
Pretty surprised.

183
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,041
And anything else?

184
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,125
Like what?

185
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,833
You know, like else.

186
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,666
Like... Are you happy...?

187
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,666
Maybe honored...

188
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,666
Or are you moved at all?

189
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,166
How do I put it...

190
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,833
I'm bewildered by
the whole thing...

191
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,291
Surprised. Yeah,

192
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,750
that's definitely the
strongest feeling right now.

193
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,125
Oh.

194
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,166
That haircut does look
really good on you.

195
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,208
Thanks. You don't
think it's weird?

196
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,208
No... It's nice.

197
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,500
Oh...

198
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,416
Thank you.

199
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,291
I actually went
to a hair salon.

200
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,583
Wow... That must
have been fun...

201
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,125
Was it what you expected?

202
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,250
I was nervous.

203
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,083
Yeah, I can imagine
that you were.

204
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,708
Hold on a sec...

205
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,000
You knew who I was the
day I transferred here?

206
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,875
Yep... I knew from
the very beginning.

207
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,375
And I'm surprised
yet again.

208
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,625
Don't be. I'd recognize
your pudding head anywhere.

209
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,791
Thank you...

210
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,500
Well, you certainly
could've fooled me.

211
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,500
Wait...

212
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,833
But don't you
remember that day

213
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,458
when we met in the classroom?

214
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,083
I swear you said something
about not remembering

215
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,666
what my name was.

216
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,250
I was pretty irritated that
I recognized who you were,

217
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,166
even though you didn't
have a clue about me.

218
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,208
So you pretended you
didn't know me instead?

219
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,708
That's right.

220
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,333
Crap, we're at a dead end.

221
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,625
I'm sorry if I seemed rude.

222
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:10,833
But, I mean...

223
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,333
How can you blame
me for that?

224
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,583
It's not like...

225
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,041
I'd ever seen you wearing
a skirt... Right...?

226
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,375
You were only ever
dressed like a boy.

227
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,833
Who cares what I wore...

228
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,625
I never once told you I
was a boy when we were kids.

229
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,083
Sorry, it's just you don't
normally see girls

230
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,500
wearing boys clothes and
picking fights with other boys

231
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,916
whenever they could.

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,500
I was going to tell
you I was a girl,

233
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,666
but you up and disappeared
before I got the chance to.

234
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,291
Are you serious...?

235
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,875
That was the important thing
you said you were gonna tell me?

236
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,458
But you never showed
up that day...

237
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,166
And I waited...
A long time!

238
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,250
You're wrong...

239
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,958
Because I did
show up then...

240
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,625
But I got too embarrassed!

241
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,250
I was in a skirt...

242
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,083
and... and I was afraid
you would laugh at me.

243
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,083
You what?

244
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,125
I wore a skirt because
I wanted to confess to you

245
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,500
I was a girl.

246
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,166
I figured that was the
best way to let you know.

247
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,666
But, I'd never worn
a skirt before...

248
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,416
so I didn't know if it
looked good on me or not.

249
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,333
I thought maybe you
would laugh at me.

250
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,708
I just...

251
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,125
I couldn't make
myself do it...

252
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,625
It was way too
embarrassing...

253
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,500
But if I'd known
you were moving...

254
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,291
I might have gotten up the
courage to actually go for it.

255
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,541
You see! This whole
thing is all your fault!

256
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,000
There's no way!

257
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,416
Because, first
of all... weirdo...

258
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,541
you didn't have to wear
a skirt to tell me.

259
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,958
Whatever... You know for a
fact if I had just told you,

260
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,875
you never would've
believed me.

261
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,750
Yeah. You're probably right.

262
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,250
I think... Well...

263
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,916
The fact we
were friends...

264
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,541
I mean I think the fact
we were acquaintances

265
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,458
should remain a secret
from the rest of the club.

266
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,708
How come?

267
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,791
There's no reason
for them to know.

268
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,916
Uhh... Sure, that's fine.

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,166
Good, then that's that.

270
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,291
Okay, let's go.

271
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,708
One sec...

272
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,333
I don't know what
to call you now...

273
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,708
What do you
want me to use?

274
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,583
Yozora...

275
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,500
You can use my first name.

276
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,208
Don't you have a nickname or
something easier for me to say?

277
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,416
I do...

278
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,208
Did...

279
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,541
Look, I'm not going to
tell you what it was, Kodaka.

280
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,291
Why not?

281
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,625
Because only...

282
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,958
Only real friends use
nicknames with each other.

283
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,291
Hey, guys.

284
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,458
Oh, hello, Kodoka,
what's going on...

285
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,208
A double dose of
hotness with Kodaka

286
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,458
and a mystery stud muffin!

287
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,708
Ohmigah-ohmigah-ohmigah-te
ll Rika who this hot boy is,

288
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,916
tell her- tell her-tell her!

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Tell you who this
hot boy is...

290
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,541
-Do you not see the skirt?
-No, wait.

291
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,208
Before you tell her who
this hottie boy delight is.

292
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,833
Rika will try to
deduce the answer.

293
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,125
Here she goes... He must be
your first younger friend!

294
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,083
Wrong.

295
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,458
So then your first older friend?

296
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,791
No.

297
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,000
Is he your
younger brother?

298
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,000
Don't have one.

299
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,416
Then he's your
older brother.

300
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,666
I don't have any brothers.

301
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,000
Huh...

302
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,166
He must be looking
at your soccer rival!

303
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,583
I have not and nor
will I ever play soccer.

304
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,541
Is he the president
of your student body?

305
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,875
I don't know
what that means.

306
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,791
Then tell me he's
your fiancée!

307
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,291
How do you come
up with these?

308
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,916
Alas... My Big Bro Kodaka
has left me for a stud muffin.

309
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,625
What the hell are you
talking about, Yukimura?!

310
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,875
This is hot...

311
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,166
Rika wonders which
one's the dominant

312
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,541
and which one's
the submissive...

313
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,083
Ooh... Does Kodaka like
to be the aggressive dom?

314
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,250
Or is he masochistically
submissive...?

315
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,458
Reluctant dom
or reluctant sub?

316
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,583
Rika bets it's hardcore
no matter what they do!

317
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,875
Oh just imagining
it makes Rika all...

318
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,166
She's such a freak job.

319
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,416
Get it together...

320
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
This is just...

321
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,875
Hey! Yozora...

322
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,708
You got your hair cut.

323
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,041
Well... Yeah...

324
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,625
Thank you,
Captain Obvious.

325
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,541
Oh... Yozora...
What's up?

326
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,791
Who?

327
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,750
Yozora... It's you.

328
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,125
That's right...
I am still me.

329
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,166
You chopped a ton of
your hair off, lady.

330
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,416
So... What'd you do it for?

331
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,333
It doesn't have anything
to do with you Meat.

332
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,375
Oh, come on.
Why not just tell me?

333
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,791
It won't cost
you anything.

334
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,666
Nothing except
for my precious time.

335
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,000
What? Are you saying

336
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,791
that talking to me
is a waste of time?!

337
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,083
-You said it, sister, not me.
-And things are back to normal.

338
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,541
You! Stay right here
until Rika's back!

339
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,916
What's she up to, now?

340
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,208
Now then... Did you cut it
because of a broken heart?

341
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,208
-Shut up.
-Yes...! That's it, right...?

342
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,333
You totally just
lost a lover!

343
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,375
Awesome!

344
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,791
I said shut up!

345
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,583
Poor mean old Yozora had
love ripped away from her...!

346
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,000
I wonder why?!

347
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,625
So, spill it, who is
this lucky fella anyway?

348
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,666
Whoever it is deserves
a medal for realizing

349
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,000
what a massive tool you are
and kicking you to the curb.

350
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,333
How could you hit my face?
That's sacred!

351
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,458
I do not have a broken
heart, you idiot...

352
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,583
However...

353
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,833
Now I know how
you would react

354
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,041
if I did get my heart broken

355
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,041
which helps to prove
how awful you truly are.

356
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,541
Well, that sucks...

357
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,333
I thought I'd finally get
the chance to bully her,

358
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,541
but I guess not...

359
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,166
If your heart hasn't
been stomped on,

360
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,416
then why did you cut it.

361
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,791
You don't get
to know that.

362
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,250
Oh, come on...! Tell me!

363
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,541
Okay, Yozora!

364
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,625
Will you please
try this on?

365
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,083
What is that...?

366
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,916
Is it like a dance
uniform from somewhere?

367
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,916
You're exactly right! Yeah!

368
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,500
This is an original,
legitimate white uniform coat

369
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,333
officially worn by the
student council president...

370
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,041
Of the one and only
Galford Academy!

371
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,625
Of Galford... Academy?

372
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,333
Yes, and for
real, Yozora...

373
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,875
Rika knows this is gonna
look amazing on you!

374
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,291
But... isn't this...

375
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,833
just like a cosplay
uniform thing?

376
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,458
Why would I want to
dress up in costume

377
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,708
in the middle of the day?

378
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,500
'Cause... It'll look amazing.

379
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,000
Rika already said so!

380
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,000
Hey, Big Brother!

381
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,333
It's so good to see you!

382
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,250
Wow, someone's sure
in a good mood today.

383
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,333
Why are you standing
out in the hallway...

384
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,708
Oh... You were caught being
naughty again weren't you?

385
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,625
Uh, just what do
you mean by again?

386
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,916
Okay guys, come in!

387
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,875
What did Rika say?
Amazing, right?

388
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,916
Yeah... She looks...

389
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,708
Agh...!
There's a hot guy...!

390
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,041
There's a really
hot guy in here!

391
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,208
Why are you so
scared, Maria?

392
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,708
Because, everyone knows
hot guys chew up and spit out

393
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,250
cute little girls like me!

394
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,958
That's what all the
other sisters say,

395
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,083
and I don't want
to be gnawed on

396
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,583
just because I'm
this adorable!

397
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,833
Hey... Cutey...

398
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,541
I'm gonna munch on you.

399
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,333
I don't taste good at all,
so please leave me alone!

400
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,875
Go away!

401
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,875
I'm going to munch you...
'kay...

402
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,083
And then I'm
going to crunch.

403
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,458
Didn't we go through this
exact same thing already?

404
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,666
Kodaka...

405
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,375
About my summer homework, I...

406
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,208
Take her...!

407
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,750
If you're gonna eat anybody,
it should be a vampire!

408
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,958
She'll taste better
than me, I swear it!

409
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,625
-You're gonna eat me?
-No...

410
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,416
Um... No one's eating you.

411
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,208
I will...!

412
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,875
I'll eat Kobato into little
pieces; let me have at her!

413
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,291
Hey! What was that for?!

414
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,833
You should be ashamed
of yourself, meatwad...

415
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,500
You have serious issues.

416
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,750
Oh great...

417
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,208
She shows up after
disappearing for a week...

418
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,875
And even though she
has a whole new look,

419
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,500
Yozora is still just Yozora.

420
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,833
You better believe it...

421
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,250
Why would I ever
want to change...?

422
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,916
I'm perfect the way I am.

423
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,916
I don't know what
to call you now.

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,333
What do you
want me to use?

425
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,750
Sora?

426
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,750
Call me by my name... Yozora.

427
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,833
Like you've been doing.

428
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:39,666
That sound good...

429
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,833
Kodaka?

430
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,583
Sounds good...

431
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,666
Yozora.

432
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,791
Great.

433
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,458
Yozora and I...

434
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:01,000
Well, No, I guess Sora and
Taka used to be best friends.

435
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:07,958
But now... Yozora Mikazuki
and Kodaka Hasegawa aren't.

436
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,791
I know that
Yozora was Sora...

437
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,250
But we can't
just pick up

438
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,083
where we left off ten
years ago, can we?

439
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,000
I wonder...

440
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,833
What will happen
to us after this?

441
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,666
Okay, at least tell
me why so short!

442
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,500
I don't have to tell you
why I do what I do to my hair!

443
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,875
I don't really
know the answer...

444
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,416
I hope to someday...

445
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,375
I think, though...

446
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,666
That's why I should stick
around here for a while.

447
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,041
You're a poopy vampire,
what do you know?

448
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,333
Horrid disciple of God!

449
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,708
Here in this club,

450
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,041
where all we're trying
to do is make some friends.

451

[Music]

452
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,666
Now... It's time to begin
the Neighbors Club activities

453
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,833
for the new term!

454

HYou let your guard a
previdown too easily...sode?

457
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,916
We're having an
extra episode.

458
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,833
Why? So what's it
gonna be about?

459
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:05,875
That's a secret!

460
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,666
-Tell me!
-Okie-dokie!

461
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,583
So! It's not a secret!!

462
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,000
It's legendary...

463
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,458
An episode banned
from television

464
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,250
and never before
revealed to anyone!

465
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,041
I didn't realize we
had one of those.

466
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,291
And the epic title is...

467
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,791
A Round Robin Story's
Ending Is Way Extreme!

468
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,208
There she goes.

469
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,125
The round-robin story: the
door to a forbidden world!
