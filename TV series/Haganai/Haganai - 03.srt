1
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,041
Oh, hey.

2
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,166
Sena.

3
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,541
Damn meat.

4
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,500
She has some nerve
ignoring me like that.

5
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,458
I'm pretty sure I'm the
one she was ignoring.

6
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,083
Oh, yes!

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,541
Conquer me, oh
naughty knight!

8
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,916
I want more in my hand
than just my scepter;

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,708
Hey, just what the hell do you
think you're doing, Yozora?

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,708
Get your claws off!

11
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:43,958
What is this?

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,708
You heard what I said!
Hands off, you harpy!

13
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,041
Subjugate me!

14
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,291
Grant me your legendary
rigid blade, I beg you!

15
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,500
Ohhh! Good sir, you are truly
a "knight" to remember!

16
00:00:55,583 --> 00:01:01,291
[Music]

17
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,041
Geez! What the hell
are you doing?

18
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,291
I should be the one
asking you that, Jugsy!

19
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,583
What kind of pervert
watches smut in a church?

20
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,708
It is not smut, you idiot!

21
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,458
It's "Blackstar,
the Sacred Sword,"

22
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,833
and it's one of the
hottest video games

23
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,375
on the market right now!

24
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,083
An epic, romantic fantasy
adventure for the ages!

25
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,375
It's loaded with
action and romance.

26
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,291
The brave knight Lucas
has to defeat Varnibal,

27
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,625
the god of destruction.

28
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,458
In the scene you so
rudely interrupted.

29
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,750
Princess Cecilia was proclaiming
her true love for Lucas.

30
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,166
She was opening her
castle gates to him!

31
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,916
Didn't you know it was one
of those adults only games?

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,166
No, how was I supposed to?

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,208
After "Sparkling
School Life Seven,"

34
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,250
I wanted a new game so I checked
out some online forums.

35
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,416
They all said this was
the hottest game right now.

36
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,416
And then when I asked
this guy in class about it

37
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,916
he gave me a copy and said
it would be perfect for me.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,291
It sure was, pervert!

39
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,583
Are you jealous or
just drinking haterade?

40
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,708
As if, you freak!

41
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,666
Perv--bag!

42
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,916
Sicko! Kink--meister!

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,916
Porn addict!

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Double--D deviant!

45
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,250
Pneumatic--knockered
nympho!

46
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,375
Get away before I catch
porn--itis from you!

47
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,875
Why do I have to put up
with abuse like this

48
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,416
just for playing a videogame?

49
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,250
Okay, fine,
I'll admit the game

50
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,500
does have a couple
of steamy scenes in it.

51
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,000
But that isn't anything
out of the ordinary.

52
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,666
Go to the library
once in a while

53
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,875
and you'll see
the same thing

54
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,625
you're giving me crap
for in the classics,

55
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,458
so slow your roll!

56
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,083
This game's a work of art,
just like they are!

57
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,875
I've never seen your
eyes glued to art

58
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,458
the way they were
to that game.

59
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,875
Just be honest and admit

60
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,083
you're addicted
to the pervy stuff!

61
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,666
No, I'm not!

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,541
I just wanted to help
Lucas and Cecilia

63
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,875
consummate their
relationship!

64
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,250
To help them
do what happens

65
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,416
when a man and woman fall
in love with each other!

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,000
What you're seeing
here is love not sex!

67
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,708
Put your nasty porn away!

68
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,916
There's nothing nasty
about it at all!

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,500
You could have fooled me.

70
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,291
I'm sorry that you're
such a freaking prude

71
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,458
you can't appreciate the
artistic merits of this scene!

72
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,083
Well if it is art.

73
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,458
Then please read what they're
saying out loud Jiggles.

74
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,000
Uh.

75
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,041
If it truly is an
inoffensive work of art

76
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,333
then you should have no
problem doing what I asked.

77
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,666
Right?

78
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,958
Of course not!

79
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,541
It's just that.

80
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,583
I get a little nervous reading
out loud in front of people.

81
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,875
In that case,
I'll do it, too.

82
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,750
-Huh?
-Say what?

83
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,541
I'll also read
from an artistic work,

84
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,166
but Boobs has to go first.

85
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,833
It's just art right?

86
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,958
She shouldn't have a problem
if that game isn't smut

87
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,375
and the heroine isn't
some promiscuous princess,

88
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,708
hoping to get ahold
of Lucas' "mighty sword"

89
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,291
or his fabled
family jewels.

90
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,750
Hey, don't turn
their pure love

91
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,416
into something that's dirty!

92
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,291
Okay! If you want me
to read it out loud,

93
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,375
then I'll do it!

94
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,625
"Um, my dear Lucas.

95
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,250
Please cleave
my, um, heaving

96
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,833
bosom with your rigid blade.

97
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,500
"Louder I can't hear you!

98
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,000
"And. Let me hold the sword
that makes maidens coo.

99
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,041
I want to see it and
the masterful strokes

100
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,541
that you so deftly
employ in its use.

101
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,666
Show me your big weapon.

102
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,041
"Oh, so you want
me to unsheathe

103
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,166
my sacred sword, do you?

104
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,958
My, what a randy
and demanding tart

105
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,000
you've revealed
yourself to be, Cecilia.

106
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,416
"No. You speak coarse
things that are not true.

107
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,666
"Nonsense, I can see
that lusting expression

108
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,125
in your eyes.

109
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,750
"Look, if you
want something.

110
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,541
Don't deny it;
ask for it.

111
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,208
Or to be more specific,
beg for it, tart!"

112
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,875
"Please, I beg of thee,
my carnal cavalier!

113
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:50,708
This randy--minded
royal wants- nay, needs.

114
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,041
Your sacred sword!"

115
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,083
"Don't say 'sacred sword.

116
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,250
Say the name of
what you really want.

117
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,416
"Don't stop now.

118
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,041
Go on and finish it off.

119
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,416
"Lucas, please.

120
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,291
I want it, all of it.

121
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:14,833
Your throbbing, gigantic,
mighty, ravishing-"

122
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,166
I can't say that!

123
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,166
You suck, Yozora!
You're the worst!

124
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,541
That was a bit overboard,
even for you.

125
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,375
I hope the audio
came out okay.

126
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,166
I was recording Meat the
whole time she was reading.

127
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,708
I think I'll play her
little smut recital

128
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,125
over the PA system.

129
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,583
Are you the devil?

130
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,791
Now my turn.

131
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,791
For what?

132
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,458
I said I would do it
and I'm keeping my word.

133
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,875
So I'm going to read from a
work of art like I promised.

134
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,416
"Why does my heart
feel so ashamed.

135
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,083
Autumn mountain shadow
on a day of white wind.

136
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,416
Uncannily mature
tree trunks stood.

137
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,875
In hollows thick with
the fallen leaves.

138
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,833
Wow, that's pretty deep.

139
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:02,666
Feel my dark wrath
light--bearer!

140
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,166
Hey, Sis, I'm home.

141
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:10,250
Ah, my mortal servant
has finally returned!

142
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,208
Your vampiric master
is quite famished,

143
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,041
so I do hope you've
brought me a sacrifice.

144
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,250
I'll get dinner
started, Kobato.

145
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,708
That name is only
my human alias.

146
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,625
My proper name is Rasis
Vi Felicity Sumeragi.

147
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,916
Child of Darkness and True
Heir to the great Night Tribe.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,291
I must quench my
thirst and feed, worm!

149
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,125
Bring forth my
sustenance now,

150
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,708
or grave disaster
will befall you!

151
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,000
Whatever, nightspawn.

152
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,750
You'll never
defeat the light!

153
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,000
-Dinner's ready, Sis.
-Oh, yeah?

154
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,375
Your "sacrifice".

155
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,166
Well done, slave.

156
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,791
A human's lifeblood is
incredibly delicious.

157
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,000
It's tomato juice, dork.

158
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,208
And now, here's a tale
of two furry felons.

159
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,416
Remember Chim--Chim,

160
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
the young monkey at
the Takayama Zoo who,

161
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,250
Hey, eat your onions,
too, Kobato!

162
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,750
Here.

163
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,625
Attagirl.

164
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,666
By the way,
my human brother.

165
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,166
I've noticed that
you've been late

166
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,083
providing my
sacrifices recently.

167
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,708
Oh, right, I haven't been
getting home as early as usual

168
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,041
because of the club.

169
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,500
You better get used to it.

170
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,083
What's more important to you;
me or that club of yours?

171
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,250
The club, of course.

172
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,291
If you want dinner early,
make it yourself.

173
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,666
We're out of tomato juice.

174
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,958
I mean we're out of the
precious lifeblood of humans.

175
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,583
I'll get some tomorrow.

176
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,166
Thanks, Kodaka.

177
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,750
I mean, you better get it.

178
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,541
You human wretch.

179
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,125
This should brighten
your day, thy dark fiend!

180
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,916
About a year ago,
my kid sister Kobato

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,541
got addicted to
this anime series

182
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,666
called "Full Metal Necromancer."

183
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,625
Since then, she's been
acting and talking like

184
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,125
she's this character on
the show who's a vampire.

185
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,916
I spent my first couple
of years in this house

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,250
when I was a little kid.

187
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,791
We left it ten years ago
when my Dad had to move

188
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,875
because of work and it's
been sitting empty ever since.

189
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,208
When Dad found out

190
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,458
he was getting transferred
to America recently.

191
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,583
He decided Kobato and
I would stay in Japan.

192
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:32,791
So "her vampiric majesty"
and I moved back here.

193
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,125
But it's been so long,

194
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,375
I barely remember anything
about this place at all.

195
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,333
Kobato, your bath's ready!

196
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,083
After this show, mortal!

197
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,000
I guess the club really
is important to me.

198
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,916
Hey. Why aren't you
playing "Porn Star" today?

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,083
That's "Black Star,"
you idiot!

200
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,416
I didn't want
any more crap

201
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,041
so I brought "Sparkling
School Life Seven,"

202
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,875
but it appears the
harpy isn't here.

203
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,291
She said some book she
wants goes on sale today.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,833
Hey, tell me something.

205
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,333
Um. Can you swim?

206
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,375
Yeah. Kinda--sorta.

207
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,666
Really? Well, in that case.

208
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,166
Do you think maybe you
can teach me how to do it?

209
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,291
You mean.

210
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,541
You don't know how to?

211
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,083
No, 'cause none of the
schools I've attended

212
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,291
ever offered
swimming lessons.

213
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,791
Um, okay sure.

214
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,333
I don't mind teaching you,

215
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,208
but why do you want to
learn all of a sudden?

216
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,333
Geez, you really are a
dumb blonde, aren't you?

217
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,541
Now that I'm friends
with Natsumi,

218
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,041
how awkward is it gonna be
if we go to a pool or a beach

219
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,208
and I don't know
how to swim?

220
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,666
But she's not real.

221
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,666
You can teach me at Sea God's
Palace Land this Sunday.

222
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,125
Sure. All right then.

223
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,041
Let's get one
thing straight.

224
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,625
Don't you dare tell Yozora
I don't know how to swim.

225
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,708
You understand me?

226
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,583
Isn't Udders coming
to the club today?

227
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,166
No, she said she had
some shopping to do.

228
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,666
For what? Some kind
of milking device?

229
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,875
Don't you dare tell Yozora
I don't know how to swim.

230
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,375
-Hey is something on your mind?
-No.

231
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,541
Is that the new book
you were talking about?

232
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,125
It sure is.

233
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,541
Any good?

234
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,541
So far.

235
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,625
You're ten minutes late!

236
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,791
Uh. Sorry!

237
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,500
Sorry for the wait.

238
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,916
What's wrong?

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,916
Nothing.

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,875
I just need a cold shower.

241
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,750
Here.

242
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,250
I don't need
help getting in.

243
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,333
Okay, first you're gonna try
to open your eyes underwater.

244
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,791
Hey, gimme some credit!

245
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,083
I can't swim, but I
can at least do that!

246
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,416
-See?
-I gotcha.

247
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,458
Then let's move onto
the harder stuff, okay?

248
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,708
Too bad.

249
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,833
I almost had you that time.

250
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,791
I've gotta admit, swimming is
a lot easier than I thought!

251
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,708
Man, she sure
learns quick!

252
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,583
Here ya go.

253
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,375
Thanks a lot.

254
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,916
And thanks so much for giving
me swimming lessons today!

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,541
If Natsumi and I
ever go swimming,

256
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,333
now I'll know what to do.

257
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,500
Yeah, like that'll
happen in the real world.

258
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,875
This place sure is swanky
for a water park, isn't it?

259
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,791
Yeah, but it's on the
verge of bankruptcy.

260
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,375
Are you serious?

261
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,083
Look around -- there's
hardly anybody here.

262
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,333
The last time the
mayor came over,

263
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,416
he and Daddy
were wondering

264
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
how much longer this
place could last.

265
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,875
"Daddy?"

266
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,666
Oh, you mean the president
of Saint Chronica's.

267
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,000
Yep.

268
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,250
Speaking of your Dad,

269
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,000
I haven't had a chance
to meet the guy.

270
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,416
I need to stop by some
time and pay my respects.

271
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,375
Wait! Why on Earth

272
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,333
would you want to pay your
respects to my father?

273
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,958
Do you mean to tell me
you think that today

274
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,250
is an actual date
you and I are on?

275
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,916
And you want to meet Daddy

276
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,208
to get his permission to
officially start dating me?

277
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,583
I'm sorry to
burst your bubble,

278
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,375
but I want to meet him
'cause he did me a favor

279
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,666
since he and my
dad are old friends.

280
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,250
I'd like to drop
by to thank him

281
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,541
for helping me with
the admission process

282
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,708
to get into the academy.

283
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,291
Huh?

284
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,333
Well. You should have said so
in the first place, you jackass!

285
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,125
Hey, you're the one whose
imagination ran wild.

286
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,583
Come on, admit it.

287
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,166
What you said was
really suggestive.

288
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,166
Geez, Meat.

289
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,208
'Scuse me?

290
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,375
Um, well.

291
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,291
What I meant to
say was "Geez,

292
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,500
the meat in these fried
noodles is so tender.

293
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,541
"I don't think that
is what you meant.

294
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,250
You're just a little
hyper--sensitive

295
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,916
whenever the word
"meat" is mentioned.

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,208
Can you blame me?

297
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,416
I have been since Hozora
started calling me that!

298
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,958
If it bugs you so much,

299
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,625
then why do you answer
whenever anybody says the word?

300
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,291
'Cause it's the first time
anyone gave me a nickname.

301
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,750
Oh?

302
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,541
So getting one actually
made me a little happy.

303
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,458
-Whoa, for real?
-Yes.

304
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,291
But don't ever tell
Yozora I said that!

305
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,083
Now if you're finally
done stuffing your face,

306
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,791
let's get back to my
swimming lessons, okay?

307
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,000
Just give me a minute.

308
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,958
If I was her, I'd be pissed
if someone called me "Meat,"

309
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,000
but a nickname does
make you feel special.

310
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,083
Taka! Hey, Taka!

311
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,125
With you?
No way!

312
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,166
Stuck--up bitch!

313
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,833
Yeah, right!

314
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,125
I won't go out with you
so I'm a bitch, huh?

315
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,375
Well, I'd much
rather be a bitch

316
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,125
than date the three
of you losers!

317
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,750
-You slut!
-Aw, crap, here we go.

318
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,666
Oh, so I'm a
bitch and a slut!

319
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,875
If that's how
you closet cases

320
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,875
talk to all the girls
who turn you down.

321
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,833
Then maybe you dorks
should just date each other!

322
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,375
Watch your mouth,
slut face!

323
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,250
Hey. Check it out, bros!

324
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,208
This chick's shakin'
like a leaf!

325
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,666
Yeah, totally!

326
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,291
Aw, you're scared
of us, ain't ya?

327
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,333
No! I'm not shaking
'cause I'm afraid.

328
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,958
I'm shaking 'cause
I'm angry, jerk!

329
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,541
Sena!

330
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,208
Kodaka!

331
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,083
What do you want, brah?

332
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,833
The girl you're messing
with is with me.

333
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh. We had no idea, dude.

334
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,250
She never mentioned
a boyfriend. Tease.

335
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,500
Hey, wait a minute!

336
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,583
You creeps
aren't getting away

337
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,666
with calling me bitch,
slut, and tease!

338
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,541
So get down on your
knees and beg and grovel

339
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,333
for my forgiveness now!

340
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,541
You heard me,
pissants; do it!

341
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,666
Like hell we will!

342
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,708
Violence is
never the answer.

343
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,625
Let go of my hand!

344
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,708
Yeah, douche!

345
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,208
Ow--ow--ow--ow--ow!

346
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,416
Take my advice and just
walk away from this, guys.

347
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,250
Okay?

348
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,583
Uh. Sure thing.

349
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,791
Good choice, boys;
I'm glad we could agree.

350
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,458
-You okay?
-That dude was psycho.

351
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,125
Nice work badass.

352
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,791
You can lick my feet as
a reward if you'd like to.

353
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,083
You sure showed
those guys.

354
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,458
Sheesh, what a bunch
of morons, right?

355
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,458
There was only one moron
here and that was you!

356
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,000
Me? How do you mean?

357
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,458
Why did you have to keep
pushing it with those guys?

358
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,833
They were leaving, but you
just couldn't shut the hell up!

359
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,166
What? Like they
didn't have it coming?

360
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,083
Why are you giving me a
lecture anyway? Rude much?

361
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,958
Because you need a
lecture right now!

362
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,166
There are lots
of guys out there

363
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,250
who're even nastier
than they were!

364
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,583
You could have gotten
hurt just then!

365
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,833
I'm not always gonna be
around to protect you, y'know!

366
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,708
Yeah, well, who cares?

367
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,166
I'll protect myself!

368
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,208
You don't have to
worry about me dude!

369
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,458
The way you're acting,
I sure as hell do!

370
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,625
Wow.

371
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,041
You really are
worried about me.

372
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,208
All right then,
I apologize, okay?

373
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,541
From now on, I promise
I'll be more careful.

374
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,458
Great. Thanks.

375
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,041
I think I'm
done for today.

376
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,625
That's the first
time a boy my age

377
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,166
has ever admitted he
was worried about me.

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,666
Well. I'll see ya.

379
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,041
Right.

380
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,750
Um, as for today.

381
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,000
Thanks for everything.

382
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,416
We should go again soon.

383
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,500
I'd like to try out that
wave pool next time.

384
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,208
Uh. Yeah, sure.

385
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,166
I wonder what put her
in such a good mood?

386
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,166
Time to take
you down, punk!

387
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,041
Teach the weakling
a lesson, boss!

388
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,958
Talk about déjà vu.

389
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,416
This reminds me of some of
the fights I got in as a kid.

390
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,208
Mortal brother, help me!

391
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,541
Kobato! What's the matter, huh?

392
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,708
It's the bath!

393
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,458
I almost perished in
that infernal thing!

394
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,625
What? How?

395
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,875
The water turned cold!

396
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:12,958
This wouldn't
have happened

397
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,041
if it had been filled
with warm blood!

398
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:14,750
Would you put
something on at least?

399
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,041
Oh, the horror!

400
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,875
Why don't you pick on
someone who's not so weak?

401
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,041
Why don't you make me?

402
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,541
Hey! What was that for?

403
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,583
I was trying to
help you, butthole!

404
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,000
You're wrong.

405
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,583
I'll prove I'm not weak!

406
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,416
Then bring it on, blondie!

407
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,333
Don't ignore me!

408
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,333
Jerk!

409
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,458
Get 'em, guys!

410
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,958
Eat this!

411
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,250
After the fight broke up,

412
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,375
me and that kid
actually became friends.

413
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,291
-Taka.
-Huh?

414
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,708
Do you know what my
mom told me one time?

415
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,250
She said that
in first grade.

416
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,333
It's okay if you can't
make one hundred friends.

417
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,375
What matters is if you
can make real friends,

418
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,833
and ones who
mean more to you

419
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,166
than a hundred
different others would.

420
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,458
Even if you only
make one real friend,

421
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:27,041
that's better than having a
hundred who are just okay.

422
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,500
I feel the same
way your Mom does.

423
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,958
So how 'bout we agree to be
each other's one real friend

424
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,375
for the rest of our lives?

425
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,541
Even if you never
make any others.

426
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,083
I promise I'll be your
real friend forever.

427
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,041
Hey. Why are you getting
so mushy all of a sudden?

428
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,291
You're the one who started
all that real friend stuff.

429
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,916
Sorry, guess I sounded
kinda girly, huh?

430
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,041
I must have dozed off.

431
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,916
"What matters is if you
can make real friends,

432
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,458
and ones who
mean more to you

433
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,166
than a hundred
different others would."

434
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,333
Right.

435
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,500
What?

436
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,916
Kodaka.

437
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,041
You remember?

438
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,458
Wait, what did you say?

439
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,583
Oh, it was nothing!

440
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,791
You were asleep and
just started muttering.

441
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,166
It surprised me.

442
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,666
Sorry about that.

443
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,083
I didn't mean
to scare you.

444
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,833
Hey, where'd Sena go?

445
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,708
Meat already went home.

446
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,625
-And you're still here?
-Yes.

447
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,375
I was reading my book
and lost track of time.

448
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, well.

449
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,583
I've gotta get going.

450
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,083
That kid.

451
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,416
I wonder whatever
happened to him?

452
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,541
Does he still live here?

453
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,583
And his nickname.

454
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,291
What did I call him again?

455
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,500
For the life of me, I
can't seem to remember.

456
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,041
Maybe he's in
the same boat.

457
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,333
After ten years, I'm sure

458
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,416
he doesn't remember me
or what I said, either.

459
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,250
I was just a kid
when I said it,

460
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,833
but is there
even such a thing?

461
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,708
Real friends who
last forever?

462
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:32,375
[Music]

463
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,000
Hey, Yozora, tell me,
do you know how to swim?

464
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,666
That's a stupid
question, Fun Bags,

465
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,791
'cause I can do everything!

466
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,250
That sucks big--time.

467
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,375
If you said no, I was gonna
offer to teach you how.

468
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,958
Well, as long as you got
down on your knees

469
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,458
and begged me, of course.

470
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:09,541
Ever since someone gave me

471
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,458
private swimming
lessons recently,

472
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,333
I've really wanted to pass
on what I had learned.

473
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,916
Wait someone
gave you lessons?

474
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,791
Who taught you and your
pontoons how to swim?

475
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,625
Uh! No one; never
mind what I said!

476
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,916
Next. "Underclassmen
Don't Hold Back!"

477
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,291
Underclassmen?

478
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,625
Is the club getting a
