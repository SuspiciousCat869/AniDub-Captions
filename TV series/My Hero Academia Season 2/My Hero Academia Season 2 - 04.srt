00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,041
[IZUKU]
This is a superhuman society,

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:15,250
with 80 percent of us
possessing some uncanny ability.

3
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,791
Cities swirled with chaos
and confusion following

4
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:22,583
the appearance of these powers,
and a new profession emerged.

5
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,125
We call those who
fight for justice

6
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,625
and help others
in need "heroes."

7
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,291
Oh, by the way,

8
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,958
this is the story
of how I became

9
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,333
the world's greatest hero!

10
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:10,041
[AIZAWA] The UA Sports Festival
is about to start.

11
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,500
It's true that joining
a famous hero agency

12
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,583
can garner you greater
experience and popularity.

13
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,708
It's something that the pros--

14
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:22,666
no--the entire country will
be watching very closely.

15
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,666
Think of the sports
festival as your debut.

16
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,000
You are the fledgling
Symbol of Peace.

17
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,833
The next All Might!

18
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,833
Izuku Midoriya.

19
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:38,291
You must introduce yourself,
and proudly say, "I am here!"

20
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,083
[PRESENT MIC] The first-year
students are rocketing through

21
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:44,041
this obstacle course in hopes
of moving on in the festival!

22
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,625
Who would have imagined
at the beginning

23
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,291
of this race that
the climax would be

24
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,833
a non-stop mega-mix
of surprises?

25
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,333
The first competitor
to make it back

26
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,708
into the stadium will be
the first-place winner!

27
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,458
Izuku Midoriya is our champion!

28
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,041
[CROWD cheers]

29
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,333
[MIDNIGHT] Forty-two of you
qualified to move on

30
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,750
to the next round.

31
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,041
Gird your loins and prepare
for your next test.

32
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,916
A Cavalry Battle!

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,541
Those of you at the top
will suffer the most.

34
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,666
Of course, that's something

35
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,625
you'll hear over and
over again at UA.

36
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:21,250
Show us what "Plus Ultra" means!

37
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,416
Izuku Midoriya placed
first in the qualifier.

38
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
He'll be worth ten million!

39
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,125
[heartbeats]

40
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,625
[KATSUKI]
You'd never be able to hang

41
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,041
with the best of the best.
You're just a Quirkless wannabe!

42
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,375
[IZUKU] Things have changed
so much since junior high,

43
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,083
but I'm still a target.

44
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,416
I'm only in first
place right now

45
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,291
because of some good luck.

46
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,833
Not that that matters, I guess.

47
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,666
[ALL MIGHT] Now you know
the burden of being the best.

48
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,333
[IZUKU]
What they say is true.

49
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,958
It's hard being at the top.
Right, All Might?

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,458
First years!

51
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,583
These are the rules
that you'll abide by.

52
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,083
The game itself
will last 15 minutes.

53
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,500
Individual point values
will be added together

54
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,083
to reach your team total.

55
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,833
Everyone will know
how much you're worth

56
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,166
thanks to your headbands.

57
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,583
Swipe as many headbands
as you can to raise

58
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,708
your team's score.

59
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,708
Stolen headbands must be
worn from the neck up.

60
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,500
So the more you steal, the
harder it'll be to manage them.

61
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,000
And another thing.

62
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,208
Even if your headband gets
stolen or your team falls down,

63
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,750
you can keep playing
until time's up.

64
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,375
It's anyone's game, then.

65
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,250
[SATO] And since there
are 42 contestants,

66
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,250
there'll be ten or 12 teams
fighting on the field

67
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,875
the entire time.

68
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,208
[AOYAMA]
Sounds hard.

69
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,208
So, if you lose your
headband at the beginning,

70
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,958
you have more time
to make up a plan.

71
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,250
I dunno, Mina. Maybe we
should wait and see

72
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,458
how the teams turn out
before we start strategizing.

73
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,958
This is going to be rough.

74
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,500
You may use your Quirks
as much as you like.

75
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,000
But there are still rules!

76
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,416
Make a team fall on
purpose and I'll slap you

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,375
with a red card.
You'll be disqualified!

78
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,625
Tch.

79
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,500
[MIDNIGHT] Now, you've got
15 minutes to build your teams.

80
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,833
I recommend you get started.

81
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,041
[IZUKU] It doesn't
matter how many points

82
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,541
my teammates have
since I've got so many.

83
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,000
I just need to make sure
I pick the right people.

84
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,708
Okay, I know who I want!

85
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,208
[DEATH ARMS] The sports festival
isn't really about seeing

86
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,541
how prepared they are
at being heroes.

87
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,458
It's more about
simulating the competition

88
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,041
they'll face if they go pro.

89
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,791
[MT. LADY]
Huh? What are you talking about?

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,666
We both know this
country's overrun

91
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,125
with agencies right now.

92
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,583
If you wanna put
food on the table,

93
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,583
you've gotta be willing to
step on top of other heroes.

94
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,500
That was the whole point
of the first round.

95
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,208
[MT. LADY] That's such a sad
way of looking at our jobs.

96
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,541
[KAMUI WOODS]
Seriously?

97
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,083
You've never had a problem
stealing the spotlight.

98
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,666
But, on the other hand--

99
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,833
even if you're battling
each other for popularity,

100
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,916
there are plenty a' cases where
you have to work together.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Huh. You're right, it's just
like this cavalry battle!

102
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,958
Every point you score
is not just for you,

103
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,541
but for your teammates as well.

104
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,166
Plus, you have to
think about how Quirks

105
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,916
work together and who
you're compatible with.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,458
[KAMUI WOODS] It's kind of
like coordinating with

107
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:20,166
your sidekick or doing Quirk
training with other agencies.

108
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,583
I'm sure at least
some of the kids

109
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,125
are thinking about all this.

110
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,708
If they become pros,
it'll be their way of life.

111
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,250
[MT. LADY] They've still got
a long road ahead of 'em.

112
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,541
You should team with me!

113
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,708
No, you definitely
want me by your side.

114
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,666
I don't wanna beg, but please.

115
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,541
Wait, remind me what
your Quirks are again.

116
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,625
And your names.

117
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,041
You're kidding!
We're your classmates.

118
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,416
Can you really be
that self-centered?

[ALL MIGHT]
He's a hot head,

120
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,416
but he came in third
and he has 200 points.

121
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,916
And considering how
versatile his Quirk is,

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,666
I'm not surprised people are
trying to join up with him.

[KIRISHIMA]
Bakugo!

I was gonna try Todoroki,
but he already picked a group.

125
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,291
So, hey! We should team up.

126
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,166
Hey, Dumb Hair.

127
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,166
My name is Kirishima!

And my hair's not that
different from yours.

129
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,541
Come on. You wanna
be the rider, right?

130
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,250
So you're gonna need
a strong front horse

131
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,500
who won't be hurt
by your blasts.

00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,875
That'd be me.

[KATSUKI]
Hm...

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,291
I need someone with guts.

135
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:22,291
My Quirk was made for this!
I got you covered, man!

136
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,250
Let's go charging
into battle together.

137

[KATSUKI]
Ah--

139
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,083

[growls]

[MINETA]
Shoji! Shoji!

142
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,125
[SHOJI]
Hm?

143
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,500
None of the girls
wanna team up with me!

144
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,541
Please, be my partner!

145
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,666
I'm super tiny,
so I can't be a horse,

146
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,500
but for some reason
no one wants me to climb

147
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,333
on top of them
so I can be a rider!

148
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,250
With your huge body
and those tentacles,

149
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,666
you could cover me completely,
so no one'll take my headband!

150
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,458
Right? Please?

151
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,833
Good idea. Let's go.

152
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,333
[IZUKU]
Just like I expected.

153
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,041
Everyone's sticking to the
people in their homeroom class.

154
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,750
It's too much of a gamble
to partner with someone

155
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,875
if you don't know what
their Quirk can do.

156
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,083
I need to find a team
of my own and fast.

157
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,458
But everyone's
totally avoiding me

158
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,291
since I'm worth so much!

159
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,375
Oh, hey. What's up, Ojiro?

160
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,083
Sorry.

161
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,458
[yelps]

162
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,833
[IZUKU]
It makes sense.

163
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,458
No one's worried about
keeping their own headbands

164
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,583
the whole game. It's a
better strategy to steal

165
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,833
as many points as
you can at the end.

166
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,375
And unlike Todoroki or Kacchan,

167
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,041
I didn't use my Quirk
in the first round,

168
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,333
so no one has any
confidence in me!

169
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,000
[OCHACO]
Hey, Deku!

170
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,500
Let's team up!

171
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,458
Uraraka! Are you sure?

172
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,791
Everyone'll be after me and
my ten million stupid points!

173
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,208
Tell me you're not kidding!

174
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,916
If we run away the whole time,
then we'll win, right?

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,791
Um, you're either
overestimating me

176
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,750
or underestimating
everyone else here.

177
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,916
Phooey!

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,583
Anyway, it's better to
team up with people you like!

179
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,250
[OCHACO] Is something wrong?
You look so gross.

180
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,208
No, I just thought my chest
was gonna explode for a second.

181
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,875
Actually, I wanted to
team up with you, too.

182
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,125
Thanks a lot.

183
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,750
You're right. For a
game that requires

184
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,541
so much teamwork,
it's smart to find people

185
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,000
you communicate smoothly with.

186
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,583
In fact, if we had your
Quirk and one other person...

187
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,916
You know what--I think
I might have a solid plan.

188
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,291
Huh?

189
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,291
[IZUKU]
Iida.

190
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,708
[TENYA]
Hm?

191
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,958
[BOTH]
Ha!

192
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,208
[IZUKU]
The three of us would be horses,

193
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,958
with Iida in the front.
Using Uraraka's Quirk,

194
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,333
Iida and I would be way lighter,

195
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,750
so we'd be able to maneuver
around really easily.

196
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,166
No one could catch us.

197
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,416
Good idea!

198
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,666
[IZUKU]
The only thing is...

199
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,833
We'd still have to find
a pretty strong rider.

200
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,666
I don't know who could do it.
I know it's not much,

201
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,750
but it's the only evasive plan
I could think of this fast.

202
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,166
[TENYA]
A good strategy, but I'm sorry.

203
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,875
Uh...

204
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,208
[TENYA] I'm afraid I must
refuse your offer.

205
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,875
--[IZUKU gasps]
--[OCHACO] Huh?

206
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,583
Since this all started,
I've been losing to you.

207
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,291
Please don't take
this as an insult.

208
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,041
You're a great friend, but if
I continue to follow you,

209
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,958
I'll never get stronger.

210
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,291
Bakugo and Todoroki have
challenged you already,

211
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,166
but they aren't the only ones
who see you as a rival.

212
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,250
[TENYA] Midoriya, I'll try
my best to defeat you.

213
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,750
Whoa, Iida...

214
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,958
[IZUKU]
So, it's already begun.

215
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,208
Everyone's an enemy.

216
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:26,041
I'm at the top, and they'll
all be coming for me.

217
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,666
I can't rely on anyone.
Not this time.

218
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,166
[HATSUME giggles]
Oh, perfect, you're still alone.

219
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,166
And you're the star.

220
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,083
Team up with me,
person in first place!

221
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,500
So close! Who are you?

222
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:42,541
[HATSUME chuckles] I'm a
student in the support course.

223
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,000
Name's Mei Hatsume!

224
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,541
Oh! You're that weirdo
from the obstacle course.

225
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,000
We haven't met,
but I'd like to use

226
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,958
your current fame to
my personal advantage.

227
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,375
[IZUKU]
That's straightforward!

228
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,625
If I team up with you,
then I'll be in the spotlight!

229
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,083
Part of the team that everyone
is keeping their eyes on.

230
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,875
That means my
super-cute little babies

231
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,166
will inevitably be seen
by the big company CEOs

232
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,166
who're tuning into
the Sports Festival.

233
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,750
And following that
line of reasoning,

234
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,041
this is the best way for me
and my marvelous gadgets

235
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:07,916
to get recruited.

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,458
Could you slow down a minute?

237
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,958
Did you bring babies
here, or... I mean...

238
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,375
[HATSUME] Plus, you two
will definitely benefit...

239
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,625
[OCHACO]
Oh, she doesn't care about me.

240
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,416
[HATSUME] The support course
specializes in creating

241
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,916
equipment that helps heroes deal

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,875
with their Quirks and
enhance their skills.

243
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,708
[HATSUME cackles] I packed
a ton of powerful babies

244
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,875
to bring with me,

245
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,125
so I'm sure you'll find
something you like

246
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,083
floating around my arsenal!

247
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,708
Oh, I see one's caught your eye.

248
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,875
Uh--

249
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,041
I based this on a
certain hero's backpack.

250
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,125
Though, of course,
I added my own twist.

251
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,958
Wait, I recognize that!

252
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,041
Air Jet, the Buster Hero
has one of those.

253
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,458
[HATSUME laughs]

254
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,416
I love that guy!

255
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,541
Isn't he awesome?

256
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,041
[IZUKU]
Mm-hm! His agency's close by...

257
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,791
[OCHACO]
Huh. They sure get along well.

258
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,833
[IZUKU] Not being able
to team up with Iida

259
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,416
was a definite blow. I've got
Hatsume and Uraraka now.

260
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,291
But...

261
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,958
I still need one more.

262
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,458
[IZUKU]
Looks like pretty much everyone

263
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,291
is on a team already.

264
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,458
That's fine. We can
work with that.

265
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,541
In fact, I know exactly what
power our team is missing.

266
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,375
[IZUKU] And the person
who can fill that spot is...

267
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,375
Where're you going?

268
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,583
Join me!

269
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,291
[MONOMA]
Almost everyone in the audience

270
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:31,208
is foaming at the mouth
for Class 1-A. Why is that?

271
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,875
They're so full of themselves.

272
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,041
Just like Tetsutetsu said
earlier. Why are <i>they</i> stars?

273
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,958
The only difference
between us and them

274
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,166
is that they fought
a couple of villains.

275
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,583
Just because we're
Class 1-B doesn't mean

276
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,083
we're second rate or
can't win this whole thing.

277
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,208
So, let's step it up
and show those jerks

278
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,125
what we can do. Are ya with me?

279
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,250
Oh, goody. It's time to
get this party started.

280
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,083
[PRESENT MIC]
Hey, hey, look alive!

[AIZAWA]
Mm?

282
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,333
After 15 minutes
to pick teammates

283
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,250
and talk strategy, 12 cavalry
teams are preparing

284
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,416
to go head-to-head!

285
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,750
[AIZAWA] I see some unexpected
student combinations.

286
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,750
[PRESENT MIC] Come on, everyone
get your hands in the air!

287
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,041
It's time for an arena-thumping
UA battle royale!

288
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,291
Let me hear ya scream!

289
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,958
[DARK SHADOW growls]

290
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:22,708
[IZUKU]
You ready?

291
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,666
Yeah!

292
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,375

Yes.

296
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,541
Let's do this.

[CROWD cheers]

298
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,750
[TODOROKI] I chose the three
of you because I believe

299
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,333
we'll make for the most
stable formation possible.

300
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,875
Kaminari's our left wing.

301
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,291
He can use his Quirk
to keep enemies at bay.

302
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,291
Yaoyorozu, you'll take
the right wing.

303
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,083
Focus on insulation and defense.

304
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,000
Iida, you'll take the front.

305
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,958
We'll rely on you for mobility
and physical defense.

306
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,916
[TENYA] And you'll be attacking
and creating diversions

307
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,708
of ice and fire. Is that right?

308
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,333
Not quite.

309
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,833
When I'm in battle...

310
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,625
[TODOROKI]
I never use my left side.

311
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,583
[CROWD cheers]

312
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,166
[PRESENT MIC]

that sludge villain.

473
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,125
You'll have to tell me
about it sometime.

474
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,416
It must be strange
to always find yourself

475
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,916
in the role of the victim.

476
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,166
Kirishima, we have
a change of plans.

477
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:44,791
Uh--

478
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,333
[gasps]

479
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,375
[MONOMA]
Hm?

480
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,083
[ASHIDO, KIRISHIMA,
SERO whimper]

481
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,750
Before we take down Deku,

482
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,250
we're gonna kill every last
one of these B-list idiots!

483
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,958
[IZUKU] Holy, whoa. Class 1-B
had a long-term strategy

484
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,166
that involved throwing
the qualifier.

485
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,916
I guess that could help them
leave a bigger impression

486
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,833
with the audience. Everyone
does kinda love an underdog.

487
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:09,958
But...

488
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,833
If they're playing
the long game here,

489
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,500
they might not even bother
coming after my headband at all!

490
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,916
Everyone, don't worry,
I think we're okay.

491
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,125
[pants]

492
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,208
[PRESENT MIC]
And now we've reached

493
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,666
the halfway point of the game!

494
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,708
Whew.

495
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,625
I thought we had it made.
Guess I was wrong.

496
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,375
[PRESENT MIC] As the cavalry
battle enters its second half,

497
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:45,500
it's anyone's game! Class 1-B
has made an unexpected showing,

498
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,125
but who will wear the ten
million points in the end?

499
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,000
That's the real
question, sports fans!

500
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,916
I'll be taking that, now.

501
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,750
[TENYA]
Attention!

502
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,875
I'm Tenya Iida, the
representative for Class 1-A.

503
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,625
I'll be responsible
for this preview!

504
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,041
[IZUKU] Yeah, sure, let's
talk about the next episode.

505
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,791
[TENYA]
I'm to challenge you, Midoriya!

506
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,250
[IZUKU]
Please don't!

507
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,666
[TENYA] I will defeat your
team in the cavalry battle,

508
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,791
and the result will bring
honor to the Tenya family.

509
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,916
My older brother,
Tensei, will be proud!

510
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,333
[IZUKU]
What about everybody else?

511
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,625
[TENYA] Next time:
"Cavalry Battle Finale"!

512
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,125
[IZUKU] Iida's calves
flip into overdrive

513
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,875
and get super revved up!

514
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,416
[TENYA]
I'll go beyond!

515
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,583
[TENYA, IZUKU]
Plus Ultra!
