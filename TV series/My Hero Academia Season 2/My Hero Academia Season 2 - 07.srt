1
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,041
[IZUKU]
This is a superhuman society,

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:15,208
with 80 percent of us possessing
some uncanny ability.

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,291
Cities swirled with
chaos and confusion

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,208
following the appearance
of these powers,

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,541
and a new profession emerged.

6
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,166
We call those who
fight for justice

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,625
and help other
in need, "heroes."

8
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,333
Oh, by the way,

9
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,916
this is the story
of how I became

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,291
the world's greatest hero!

11
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,333
[PRESENT MIC]
Welcome to the first match

12
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,416
of the finals tournament.

13
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,416
It's Izuku Midoriya from
the hero course, versus,

14
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,166
Hitoshi Shinso from
general studies!

15
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,666
The rules are simple:

16
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,166
Immobilize your opponent
or force them outta the ring!

17
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,666
You can also win by getting
the other person to cry uncle.

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,000
[sighs]

19
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,250
[SHINSO]
So you can just give up, huh?

20
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,333
[gasps]

21
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,583
[SHINSO]
In a way, this is a test

22
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,333
of how strong your spirit is.

23
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,833
If you know what you want
your future to hold,

24
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,791
you can't worry about
what other people think.

25
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,083
[PRESENT MIC]
Ready?

26
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,583
That monkey was going on
about his pride earlier.

27
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,666
[PRESENT MIC]
Begin!

28
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,958
[SHINSO]
But I just think he's an idiot

29
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,875
for throwing away
his chance like that.

30
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,500
[gasps]

31
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,833
[growls]

32
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,958
Don't you talk about Ojiro
that way, you hear me?

33
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,125
[SHINSO]
That's it. I win.

34
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,958
[groans] I warned him
not to say anything!

35
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:06,958
[ALL MIGHT gasps]

36
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,416
[PRESENT MIC]
Huh?! Hey, hey...

37
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,625
Come on, Deku!

38
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,666
Why in the world
isn't he moving?

39
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,916
[PRESENT MIC] It should
start out with a bang!

40
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,416
[PRESENT MIC]
The fight has just begun

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,625
and Izuku Midoriya is...
completely frozen?

42
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,458
He's not moving a muscle!

43
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,458
And what's with that
look on his face?

44
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,583
Could this be a Quirk at work?

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,583
Hitoshi Shinso seems
to have Izuku Midoriya

46
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,333
completely stunned!

47
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,250
[PRESENT MIC] He didn't stand
out in the first rounds at all,

48
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,250
but it's possible
Shinso's crazy powerful!

49
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,666
Who could've imagined
this turn of events?

50
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,750
That's the Festival
for ya! [laughs]

51
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,333
[AIZAWA]
This is a perfect example of why

52
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,291
the entrance exam
isn't rational.

53
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,041
[PRESENT MIC]
Huh? Why's that?

54
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,250
[AIZAWA] Since we're on
to the individual matches,

55
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,208
I had some information compiled
about our final competitors.

56
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,000
Shinso failed the practical exam
to get into the hero course.

57
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,166
Since he also applied
for general studies,

58
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,500
he probably figured
that would happen.

59
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,750
His Quirk is incredibly strong,

60
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,708
but that entrance test consisted
of fighting faux villains.

61
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,958
Robots.

62
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,583
It gave a huge
advantage to those

63
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,583
who had physical superpowers
they could show off.

64
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,083
[AIZAWA] Despite his
abilities, Shinso never

65
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,833
stood a chance at passing.

66
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,541
[SHINSO]
So here we are.

67
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:32,500
You're lucky to have been
so blessed, Izuku Midoriya.

68
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,166
Now turn around and
walk out of bounds

69
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,125
like a good little hero.

70
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:50,708
[PRESENT MIC] Uh-- What?!
Ah! Midoriya's obeying him!

71
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,541
Oh, no, Deku,
what are you doing?

72
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,958
He can't walk out of the ring!
He'll lose the match if he does!

73
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,583
[ALL MIGHT]
What is this power?

74
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,916
[PRESENT MIC] Hitoshi Shinso!
His Quirk: Brainwashing!

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,708
When an opponent
answers his question,

76
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,375
it flips a switch
in their minds,

77
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,750
forcing them to do
whatever he says.

78
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,416
Not every question
does it, though.

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,041
He only brainwashes
when he wants to.

80
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,541
Not very flashy...

81
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,041
[AIZAWA] In the fitness test
on the first day of school,

82
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,125
Midoriya scored pretty
low for a student

83
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,750
who'd been accepted
into the hero course.

84
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,875
Still, even in tests where
he didn't use his Quirk,

85
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,333
he outperformed Shinso.

86
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,916
If they fought without powers,

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,041
Midoriya would almost
certainly win.

88
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,291
But he'd have to overcome
Shinso's Brainwashing

89
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,791
to do that.

90
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:40,125
Either way, this match
will be over quickly.

91
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,583
[ALL MIGHT gasps, yelps]
What are you doing, kid?

92
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,666
Get back in there and show
'im what you're made of!

93
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,708
[IZUKU]
What's happening?

94
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:59,041
My body's moving on its own.

95
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,291
I feel like my brain
is full of fog.

96
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,250
I can't concentrate.

97
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,375
No! Not like this.

98
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,875
Gotta stop! Dammit!

99
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,083
I fell for it,
even after Ojiro warned me

100
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:17,041
about his power. I'm an idiot.

101
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,500
This is all my fault!

102
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,166
[gulps] So his Quirk is that
he can control other people?

103
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,958
Can I beat something like that?

104
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes. By not giving him
a chance to use it.

105
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,708
He didn't get into
my head until I answered

106
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,166
a question he asked me
before the second round.

107
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,708
I think that's the
secret behind his power.

108
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,625
So I have to be careful
not to say anything

109
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,041
or I'll lose for sure.

110
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,250
[OJIRO]
Not exactly.

111
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,708
Even if he gets you,
there's still a chance.

112
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,250
For round two,

113
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,666
I don't remember anything at all

114
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,916
except the very end
of the battle.

115
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,083
[OJIRO] I think we were
running away after Shinso

116
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,791
took Tetsutetsu's headband.

117
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,375
I bumped into another person,
and it was like I woke up.

118
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,958
[gasps]

119
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,916
[OJIRO]
I was me again.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,666
And suddenly I was
able to think clearly.

121
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,583
So that bump broke his hold?

122
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,500
[OJIRO]
Maybe. It's only a guess.

123
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,750
Still...

124
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,250
I don't know how much
of a shock it would take

125
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,583
to break his spell.

126
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,291
And in a one-on-one
match, you can't count

127
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,541
on an outside force
intervening to help you.

128
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,458
Anyway, man, I hope
that's helpful,

129
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,500
'cause it's all I know.

130
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,583
Thank you so much.

131
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,291
You're a good guy, Ojiro!

132
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,208
I know this sounds selfish,
but I'll say it anyway.

133
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,583
Beat this guy for
you and me, all right?

134
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,208
I'll do my best!

135
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,291
[IZUKU]
I can't stop it.

136
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,833
[IZUKU] I'm going to lose.
It's all over.

137
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,833
[IZUKU]
Even though...

138
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,750
...so many people
are counting on me...

139
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,208

What... is... that?

142
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,125
[IZUKU]
Wait.

143
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,791
[SHINSO]
Even with a Quirk like this,

144
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,208
I have my own dreams
of becoming a great hero.

145
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,125
[SHINSO]
So, lose for me.

That's the way to do it!

150
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,875
Whoa. I was about to freak out!

151
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,708
[AIZAWA gasps]
His fingers.

152
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,625
He broke them in order
to stop Shinso.

153
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,208
Whew, that just
about killed me.

154
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,541
No. Impossible.

155

You're not supposed to
be able to fight back!

What did you do?

157

[IZUKU] I'm the one
who used One For All.

But I'm not the one who
moved my fingers just now.

00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,208
It was like people I didn't
know came into my mind.

160
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,791
And for a second,

161
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,750
it was clear.

162
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,583
Could it be--

163
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,083
[ALL MIGHT]
One For All.

164
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,541
A sacred torch that's been
passed on from person to person.

165
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,125
[IZUKU]
Those people.

166
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,500
Were they the ones
who cultivated this power?

167
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:38,500
Did they save me?
Is that even possible?

168
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,833
How'd you do that?

169
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,166
[IZUKU]
Later.

170
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,958
I don't have time to
figure things out right now.

171
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,583
I have to focus.

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,750
[SHINSO]
He won't answer.

173
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,583
Did he figure it out?

174
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,958
No. He's known.

175
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,750
That monkey must have told him.

176
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,500
I have to get him to talk again.

177
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,250
Come on, say something.

178
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,333
I didn't know you
had so much power

179
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,291
in your fingers. I'm
kind of jealous of you.

180
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,583
[IZUKU] I know what
that jealousy feels like.

181
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,583
I've been there.

182
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,916
Thanks to the way
my Quirk works,

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,291
I've always been at
a big disadvantage.

184
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,916
But someone as blessed as you
wouldn't understand that.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,250
[IZUKU]
I get it.

186
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,875
Even though he's right.

187
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,125
I have been blessed.

188
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,333
You're lucky enough
to have a heroic Quirk!

189
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,041
It'll be so easy for you
to reach your goal!

190
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,083
[IZUKU]
I've been blessed by others.

191
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,208
That's why I'm here!

192
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,833
Say something, dammit!

193
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,458
[IZUKU]
I can't lose this.

194
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,791
[gasps]

195
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,833
[IZUKU]
I'll do it for them!

196
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,000
[SHINSO]
He's pushing me out.

197
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,333
[groans]

198
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,708
[SHINSO]
You've gotta be kidding me!

199
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,250
Get out of this ring,
you lucky brat!

200
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,500
[yells]

201
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,958
[IZUKU] No. I refuse
to let this be the end!

202
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,833
[MIDNIGHT]
Shinso is out of bounds!

203
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,708
Midoriya advances
to the next match!

204
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:22,500
[CROWD cheers]

205
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,833
Whoa!

206
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,458
Your Quirk is brainwashing?

207
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,416
That's so cool!

208
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,666
[STUDENT 20B]
Seriously!

209
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,500
I can't think of anyone
who's had that power!

210
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,458
I'm so jealous, Shinso.

211
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,416
Imagine all the cool stuff
you could do controlling people.

212
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,083
Yeah, you can do any
bad thing you want.

213
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,958
And no one would
ever know it was you.

214
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,875
Just promise you won't
make us your slaves, okay?

215
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,458
[SHINSO] Heh... Everyone
always says that.

216
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,583
[SHINSO]
Of course.

217
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,416
I'd probably think
anyone with my power

218
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,000
would use it for evil, too.

219
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,250
"Sounds criminal, Shinso."

220
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:15,083
"It's the perfect power
for a villain to have."

221
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,416
I'm used to people looking
at me like I'm the bad guy.

222
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,708
But you know what?

223
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,875
[SHINSO]
I'm not.

224
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,333
[PRESENT MIC] And with that
expertly performed throw,

225
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,625
we have our first
victor of the finals!

226
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,708
Class 1-A's Izuku Midoriya!

227
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,875
[CROWD cheers]

228
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,041
[sighs] Ugh, that was
so nerve-wracking!

229
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,166
[TENYA] Turning the tables
at the last moment--

230
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,500
a classic Midoriya maneuver!

231
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,708
He's pulled that shoulder
throw on you before, huh?

232
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,125
Shut your damn face, Sparky.

233
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,083
[KATSUKI]
That jerkwad.

234
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,583
He's definitely
aiming for the top.

235
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,958
And that purple-haired
guy fell for his trap!

236
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,791
[AIZAWA]
He focused his power like he did

237
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,708
in the fitness test, and used
the throw from combat training.

238
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,291
It's not just that he's
learning from his experiences:

239
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,833
he's using every trick he's
picked up to improve his odds.

240
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,333
[PRESENT MIC]
Oh, yeah!

241
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,708
That was actually kind of
a boring first match, kids.

242
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,625
But both of you fought bravely.

243
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,291
Let's show them
some love, everyone!

[SHINSO]
Someone as blessed as you

00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,166
could never understand!

247
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,416
It'll be so easy for you
to reach your goal!

248
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,166
Why do you wanna be a hero?

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,125
What's driving you?

00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,500
[SHINSO grunts]

251
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,625
I'll be a hero.

00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,708
[SHINSO] You can't help the
things your heart longs for.

[gasps]

254
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,583
[IZUKU]
I felt the same way.

255
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,416
Before I inherited One For All,
I was just like him.

256
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:03,583
[IZUKU] But, nothing I say is
going to make him feel better.

257
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,166
[STUDENT 15A] You were
awesome out there, Shinso!

We're proud a' you!

You didn't tell us
you were that good!

Yeah, you're the star
of our program!

262
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,916
I can't believe you
put up such a great fight

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,791
against the dude who was
in first place earlier!

264

[STUDENT 15A]
Listen to them!

265
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,958
With a Quirk like that,

266
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,583
it would be very simple
to capture dangerous villains.

267
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,791
Wish I had it.

268
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,041
[HERO 20B]
I can't believe they stuck him

269
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,208
in General Studies.
Those idiots.

270
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,000
Well, there are a ton
of applicants each year.

271
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,875
Guess sometimes people
slip through the cracks.

272
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,208
[HERO 20E] If only he had
more combat experience.

273
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,458
[HERO 20D] Yeah, I bet
he would've dominated.

274
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,833
[HERO 20E]
What a waste.

275
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,125
Shinso, you hear that?

276
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,541
It's great! They think
you're incredible!

277
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,333
[SHINSO]
Depending on the results,

278
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,500
they might transfer people
into the hero course.

279
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,125
Remember that.

Even if it didn't
work out this time,

I'm not giving up.

282
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:15,958
I'll get onto the hero track,
get certified, and then,

283
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,916
I'll become a better
pro than any of you.

But why? The match is over!

whenever they talk to me.

290
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,416
If you're not on guard,
someone's going to defeat you.

Mmmmwah! That should do it.

[IZUKU]
That match with Shinso--

299
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,208
I couldn't smile
through it like you would.

300
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,916
[sighs] I heard some of
the things he said to you.

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,083
It must've been painful,

302
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,166
knowing how much you
could relate to him.

303
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,458
Yeah. But I still
couldn't go easy on him.

I have to keep
my eye on the prize.

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,208
There were... people.

Maybe eight or nine
of them? I'm not sure.

When I was under
Shinso's control,

316
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,375
it felt like my brain was
full of fog or something.

317
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,416
But when the vision appeared,

318
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,875
it completely drove
the fog away.

319
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,166
That's when I was finally
able to move for a second.

320
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,875
Just my fingertips.

321
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,583
[IZUKU]
One of the figures had eyes

322
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,208
just like yours, All Might.

323
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,625
Do you think all
the people who've used

324
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,458
One For All in the past
were there, pushing me on?

325
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,041
Like spirits?

326
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,833
Spooky. I'm a ghost?

327
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,041
Huh?! I thought
you'd have answers!

328
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,916
[ALL MIGHT] Actually, I saw
something like that, too.

329
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,125
In my younger days.

330
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,250
Uh?

331
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,500
It's a clear sign
that you're getting

332
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,625
closer to making One For All
your own power.

333
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,000
What was it?

334
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,041
I think it's like a trace
of the user's spirit

335
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,875
that's left behind in One For
All when it's passed on.

336
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,041
Don't worry.

337
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,583
Whatever you saw,
it won't be interfering

338
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,625
with you or your progress
in the future, I'm sure.

339
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,958
In other words, that vision

340
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,125
wasn't what got rid of
the brainwashing effects.

341
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,041
Regardless of what
you saw out there,

342
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,000
it was your passion that
allowed you to overcome

343
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,791
Shinso's power, even if
it was only long enough

344
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,333
for you to wiggle
your fingertips

345
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,416
and expel some energy.

346
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,625
Man, that explanation
is so not satisfying.

347
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,958
Forget about it!

348
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,583
More importantly,
shouldn't you be worrying

349
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,083
about who you're fighting next?

350
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,625
Huh?

351
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,416
You're right.

352
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,041
Thank you both very much!

353
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:56,875
[RECOVERY GIRL]
You're welcome.

354
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,125
[IZUKU]
Goodbye!

355
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,416
[RECOVERY GIRL]
So, he saw you there, too.

356
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,375
That's a good thing.

357
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,458
[TODOROKI]
Of course Midoriya won.

358
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,416
What do you want?

359
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,083
You're acting
disgracefully, Shoto.

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,958
[ENDEAVOR] If you simply used
the power in your left side,

361
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,833
you would've had an
overwhelming victory

362
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,083
in both of the first rounds.

363
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,291
It's time to stop
this childish rebellion

364
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,875
of yours. You have
a duty to surpass

365
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:44,083
that imbecile All Might.

366
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,500
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

367
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,583
You're different
from your siblings.

368
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,083
You're my greatest masterpiece.

369
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,708
[TODOROKI] Is that all you have
to say to me, you bastard?

370
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,083
I'll win this match and advance
using only Mom's Quirk.

371
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,250
I won't give you the pleasure
of seeing me use yours.

372
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,208
Even if that works for
you in this tournament,

373
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,083
you'll soon find the
limits of that power.

374
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,375
[OCHACO]
Ah! There you are, Deku!

375
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,583
You did good!

376
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,791
Come on down here--
we saved a seat for you!

377
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,375
Ha! Thanks, guys!

378
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,250
[PRESENT MIC]
Enough standing around.

379
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,958
Now welcome to the ring,
our next players.

380
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,875
[PRESENT MIC]
He's got skills!

381
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,458
But at the expense of some
really creepy-looking elbows.

382
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,916
From the hero course,
it's Hanta Sero!

383
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,166
That was uncalled for.

384
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,625
[PRESENT MIC]
Versus, an early frontrunner

385
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,666
in the competition
who's way too strong

386
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,916
for his own good!

387
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Someone who rightfully
got into the hero course

388
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,583
based on recommendations!

389
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,375
It's Shoto Todoroki!

390
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,291
[PRESENT MIC]
And now, for the second match

391
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,791
of the finals.

392
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,666
--[PRESENT MIC] Ready?
--Well, I don't really feel

393
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,666
--Begin!
--like I can win this fight.

394
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,666
But, man--

395
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,708
I don't feel like
losing, either!

396
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,583
[PRESENT MIC] That attack
could throw his opponent

397
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,000
out of bounds!

398
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,583
A brilliant, surprise
opening from the underdog!

399
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,750
Way to start off strong, Sero!

400
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,500
Apologies.

401
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,375
[SERO gasps]

402
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,416
[RECOVERY GIRL]
Is that... an earthquake?

403
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,875
What the heck is goin' on?

404
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:32,875
Was that--?

405
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,541
[ALL gasping]

406
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,291
[DEATH ARMS]
Holy crap.

407
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,875
[pants]

408
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,458
[ENDEAVOR]
Hmph.

409
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,250
[SERO]
Um...

410
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,750
Don't you think
you went overboard?

411
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,875
Tell the truth, Sero.

412
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,541
Can you move at all?

413
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,625
Are you kidding? Obviously not.

414
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,041
My body is freezing!

415
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,208
[MIDNIGHT]
Sero has been immobilized!

416
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,375
Todoroki advances
to the second round!

417
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,958
Um. Well, nice try!

418
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,708
Nice try!

419
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,333
[AUDIENCE]
Nice try!

420
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,000
[HERO 20H]
Nice try!

421
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,541
[AUDIENCE]
Nice try!

422
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,875
Sorry about that.
It was a bit much.

423
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,416
I was angry, is all.

424
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,458
[IZUKU] As the crowd
shouted, trying to make

425
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,208
Sero feel better,

426
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,333
Todoroki took a moment
to melt his opponent

427
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,708
from the ice prison
he'd created.

428
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,583
[IZUKU] For some reason,
in that moment,

429
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,916
he looked very sad to me.

430
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,166
[ALL MIGHT]
Surprise! The preview is here!

431
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,333
[IZUKU] It's the UA Sports
Festival finals tournament,

432
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,833
where 16 players will clash
in a battle of wits,

433
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,208
Quirks, and pride!

434
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,625
[ALL MIGHT] It's still anyone's
game at this point.

435
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,750
[IZUKU]
Even so--

436
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,916
[ALL MIGHT]
The only ones who can win

437
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,416
are those who train
diligently every day

438
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,958
and cling to their dreams
of becoming heroes!

439
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,250
Come on, kiddoes, show us
what you're made of!

440
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,291
Do your best and act
like real pros!

441
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,375
[IZUKU] Next time:
"Battle on, Challengers!"

442
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,250
[ALL MIGHT] Young Iida
is manipulated by a girl

443
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,416
and ends up humiliated!

444
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,458
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

445
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,458
