watching that ice guy,

I realized I couldn't beat
him in a head-to-head fight.

Enjoy that win, Deku.

I'm just getting
started! Got that?

Bakugo is the winner
of this match!

00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,333
[PRESENT MIC] That means
our final fight will be

21
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,333
between Todoroki and Bakugo!

That child's left side sometimes
looks unbearable to me.

All I can see is his father.

How did this happen?

30
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,208
I pushed her out of my mind.

31
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,333
I tried not to think about her.

32
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,958

[KATSUKI] All right, fine,
so I may have walked

into the wrong room.

Instead of trying to win
the match himself,

he focused on breaking my walls.

friends, right?

been completely buried!

Is it possible we've already
got a winner down there?

This isn't like when
he attacked Sero.

The ice just now
was more controlled.

He's being cautious.

[AIZAWA] Bakugo timed his
explosions and grabbed

105
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,041
Todoroki's left side on purpose.
He's done his research.

His aptitude for this
becomes more apparent

Who-ho-ho-hoa!

Bakugo combined
speed and rotation

139
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,708
with a huge blast like
he used against Uraraka!

He turned himself
into a human missile!

141
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,541
Todoroki didn't fire
off the flame attack

142
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,958
that wowed us in his
match with Midoriya!

So what has become of
our two top competitors?

not to use your fire?

This isn't a real win for me
unless you try harder!

way. Now get up!

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,041
Katsuki Bakugo from Class 1-A!

161
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,375
[CROWD cheers]

162
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,458
[MIDNIGHT] The first-year
students have completed

163
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,416
all of the events for
the UA Sports Festival.

164
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,833
Now it's time to relax and
enjoy the awards ceremony.

165
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:16,291
[CROWD cheers]

[KATSUKI muffled grunting]

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,166
Whoa...

168
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,791
What the heck?

169
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,833
[KIRISHIMA] He's been goin'
nuts ever since he woke up.

170
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,208
[KIRISHIMA] Man, Bakugo.
Pull yourself together.

171
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,208
He's acting like a feral animal.

172
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,708
[KATSUKI muffled screaming]

173
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,375
[MIDNIGHT]
Tenya Iida actually shares

174
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,750
the third-place
award with Tokoyami.

175
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,875
But, unfortunately, he had
to leave for family reasons.

176
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,083
Gotta love those familial bonds.

177
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,500
Must you really?

178
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,708
Too bad Iida couldn't be
here. He was so excited.

179
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,750
Yeah.

180
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,833
[TENYA]
Uraraka. Midoriya.

181
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,833
I know that this is sudden,
but I have to leave now.

182
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,208
A villain got my older brother.

183
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,333
[IZUKU, OCHACO gasp]

184
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,041
Wait, you're saying
Ingenium is hurt?

185
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,041
[TENYA]
Yes.

186
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,458
Do they think he's
gonna be okay?

187
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,541
I don't know many details yet.

188
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,250
That's why I have
to go right away.

189
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,166
[IZUKU gasps]

190
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,958
[TENYA] Ingenium is
an unmatched commander

191
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,000
who honors the hero code.

192
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,125
As the second oldest Iida son,

193
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,041
I strive to be just like him.

194
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,708
[IZUKU]
Ingenium... Please be all right.

195
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,916
For Iida's sake. You have to be!

196
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,916
Now, let's break
out the hardware.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,625
Of course, there's
only one person

198
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,458
worthy of distributing
the awards.

199
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,916
[ALL MIGHT laughing]

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,208
All Might's up there!

201
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,666
[ALL MIGHT]

--I am here with the medals!
--[MIDNIGHT] All Might is

203

--I am here with the medals!
--the number one hero!

204
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,125
Ruined that, didn't I?

205
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,583
[ALL MIGHT]
Tch.

206
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,333
[AUDIENCE 25B] This group
of first-years is so lucky!

207
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,416
[AUDIENCE 25C]
I can't believe they've got

208
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,750
the best hero teaching them.

209
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,375
So, now that you're
here, All Might,

210
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,791
why don't you start
the presentation?

211
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,708
[ALL MIGHT laughs]
Young Tokoyami. Congratulations.

212
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,708
You showed great
strength out there.

213
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,000
Your words humble me, sir.

214
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,416
[ALL MIGHT]
However.

215
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,666
You've more training to do
if you're going to be able

216
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,083
to fight against different
kinds of villains.

217
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,708
You're not going to be able
to rely on your Quirk

218
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,750
in every battle you face.

219
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,500
Yes, sir.

220
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,666
Young Todoroki. Congratulations!

221
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,583
I'm assuming there's a reason

222
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,958
you didn't use your left side.
Though it cost you the final.

223
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,291
Midoriya opened my eyes
during our match,

224
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,083
but then I started
to doubt myself.

225
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,916
I think I now understand
a little about

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,958
why you're so interested in him.

227
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,041
[TODOROKI] I want to be
the kind of hero you are,

228
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,125
but my path isn't as clear
as I thought it was.

229
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,416
I have a lot to think about.

230
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,583
And I still need to
settle things with someone.

231
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,125
Very soon.

232
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,375
I've never seen
this sort of look

233
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,000
on your face before.

234
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,041
I won't ask for details,
but trust yourself.

235
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,583
I'm sure you'll work things out.

236
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,291
[TODOROKI]
Right.

237
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,583
[ALL MIGHT]
And now, Young Bakugo.

238
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,666
This is a little much.

239
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,041
Well, you did what
you said you'd do

240
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,375
in the pledge. You're
true to your word.

241
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,000
[KATSUKI growling]
All Might.

242
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,791
Winning first place
this way doesn't prove

243
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,375
that I'm the best one here!

244
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,166
Even if the world
considers me the winner,

245
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,291
I refuse to accept it like this!

246
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,208
[ALL MIGHT]
Look at that face!

247
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,500
[clears throat] In a world
where we're constantly

248
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,416
being compared to one another.

249
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,083
There are very few
who can keep their eyes

250
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,208
focused on the top spot.
You're one of them.

[ALL MIGHT]
Please accept this medal.

254
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,208
Even if you have to
think of it as a scar.

255
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,625
Something you'll never forget.

256

I don't want that
piece of garbage!

Here they are!

The winners of this
year's sports festival!

263
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,208
But listen closely.

264
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,916
[ALL MIGHT] Any of you first
years could have ended up

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,291
standing on these podiums.

266
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,833
Think about what
you've done today.

267
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,333
You've challenged
each other, learned,

268
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,875
and climbed even closer toward
your goals of being pros.

269
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,416
I think the next generation
of heroes is proving to be

270
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,958
our most promising one yet!

271
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,458
So I have one more thing to say.

272
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,125
I want to hear everyone
yell it with me.

273

00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,583
That was the perfect time to
say "Plus Ultra," All Might!

278
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,750
[ALL MIGHT] Well, yeah,
I guess, but everyone

279
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,666
did such a good job!

[IZUKU] Your friend can
also be a worthy opponent.

281
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,166
The sports festival
showed us that.

282
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,958
We learned a lot about
each other and ourselves.

283
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,666
[AIZAWA]
Nice work.

284
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,291
You have the next two days
of school off to recuperate.

285
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,333
I'm sure the pros
who watched the festival

286
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,166
will wanna recruit some of you.

287
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,916
We'll look over the draft
forms and update you

when you return.

289

Get some rest.

290
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,500
You still have
a lot of training.

Yes, sir!

After that,

293
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,750
the atmosphere around the
school started to change.

294

Even though it was
gradual at first.

happened any later,

00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,083
What? Hold on, why?

318
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,458
You can't just visit. Not
without telling Dad, right?

319
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,041
[TODOROKI]
Whatever.

320
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,291
But why go now?

321
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,791
Why see her after all this time?

322
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,416
I'll be back.

323
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,416
[BOY 25A]
It went "bam" and blew him away!

324
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,416
[MOTHER 25A]
Hm? That's amazing!

325
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,125
[BOY 25A]
It was so cool, Mom!

326
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,416
Bam! Crash!

327
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,625
[MOTHER 25A]
Sounds like you had a good time.

328
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,000
[BOY 25A]
Yeah!

329
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,708
[TODOROKI'S MOTHER] Mom,
I feel like I'm going crazy.

330
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,875
I can't take it anymore.

331
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,916
Every day, the children
seem more like him.

332
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,333
And Shoto--

333
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:28,125
That child's left side sometimes
looks unbearable to me.

334
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,416
All I can see is his father.

335
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I can't raise him anymore.

336
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,041
I want to run away
from this life.

337
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,708
[TODOROKI]
Ever since that day,

338
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,625
I thought the sight of me
would cause my mother

339
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:45,166
nothing but pain.
So I never visited.

340
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,458
But we will always be
bound to each other.

341
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:51,958
By blood. By our
history with my father.

342
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,125
That's why...

343
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,583
If I'm ever going to use
this body and these powers

344
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,000
to become a hero...

345
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,916
If I'm going to give it
everything I have...

346
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,291
[sighs]

347
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,625
[TODOROKI'S MOTHER]
It's okay to use your power

348
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,208
to become who you want to be.

349
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,708
[TODOROKI] If I'm going to
become the hero I want to be,

350
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,375
I need to see her.

351
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,791
There's so much we
need to talk about.

352
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,583
Hello, Mom.

353
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,500
[TODOROKI]
I'll rescue her from this place.

354
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,000
No matter what.

355
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:52,041
[TODOROKI] That's my first step
to getting back on track.

356
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,458
It's what I have to do.

357
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,666
[OCHACO] What am I gonna
have for lunch today?

358
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,375
Something cheap. Uh...

359
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,875
Oh. Mochi sounds good.

360
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,583
[OCHACO]
Hm.

361
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,250
[OCHACO]
That's weird. It's not locked.

362
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,708
[OCHACO'S PARENTS]
Ochaco!

363
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,458
[screams]

364
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,458
There you are!

365
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,291
[OCHACO]
Dad? Mom?

366
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,208
What are you guys doing here?

367
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,125
We came to throw you a party.

368
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,000
[OCHACO'S DAD] We had to come
after watching our daughter

369
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,791
make such an awesome
effort on tv!

370
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,250
Wait, what?

371
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,000
But what about work--did you
come on the bullet train?

372
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,708
When? How?

373
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,416
I can't believe you're here!

374
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,583
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Seven! Isn't that crazy?

375
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,500
[IZUKU]
Well. Yeah...

376
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,000
That's how many
times I passed out

377
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,500
after the cavalry battle.

378
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,250
I'm pretty sure the last two
were because of dehydration.

379
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,125
Kinda sounds like you
were way more heroic

380
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,416
than I was out there.

381
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,916
Don't mock your mother.

382
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,125
Suddenly finding out you
had a power like that--

383
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,250
I'm glad you have a Quirk,

384
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,166
but did it have
to be so dangerous?

385
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,375
Yeah, it's the weirdest thing!

386
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,833
Apparently it's not
medically impossible

387
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,541
or anything like that,
I'm just a late bloomer,

388
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,208
and, anyway, now I have
a Quirk of my own...

389
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:37,291
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Baby, I'm so happy for you!

390
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,083
Of course I'll
keep supporting you.

391
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:44,000
But I am still your mother,
so I'm going to worry, too.

392
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,500
[IZUKU]
Mm-hm.

393
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,333
[IZUKU] I keep putting
everything I have into

394
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,041
achieving my dreams.

395
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,500
But I can't forget
that there are people

396
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,958
who are concerned about me.

397
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,750
If I want to be
a hero who smiles

398
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,541
while living up to
everyone's expectations,

399
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,166
I can't give up.

400
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,500
I need to figure out
how to use One For All

401
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,041
and make it my own.

402
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,625
[IZUKU]
And then...

403
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,125
...maybe I'll finally
be able to say it.

404
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,250
"I am here!"

405
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,416
[IZUKU'S MOM]
So!

406
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,666
Do you wanna watch
the festival recording?

407
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,958
It's in HD!

408
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,250
[IZUKU] How about I watch
it by myself later.

409
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:22,875
[KATSUKI] Die! Stupid
weakling mouth germs!

410
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,500
[KATSUKI'S MOM] Katsuki,
you can't wake up at noon

411
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,083
and start yelling!

412
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,041
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

413
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,708
[AIZAWA] At the next
hero informatics class,

414
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,375
we'll be coming up
with code names.

415
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,208
They'll be used in your
upcoming internships.

416
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,125
[IZUKU]
This is gonna be so exciting!

417
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,500
[AIZAWA] Your name should
show who you are

418
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,458
and what kind of hero you
wanna be in the future.

419
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,458
[IZUKU] It's obvious what
mine should be, but at

420
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,833
my current level, I don't have
the right to call myself that.

421
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,250
[AIZAWA]
Hurry it up, kid.

422
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,583
[IZUKU]
Ah, yes, sir!

423
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,916
Next time: "Time to
Pick Some Names"!

424
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,958
[AIZAWA] After this, most of
the students in your class

425
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,291
will have code names.

426
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,291
[IZUKU]
Most?

427
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,458
[AIZAWA]
Go beyond!

428
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,375
[AIZAWA, IZUKU]
Plus Ultra!
