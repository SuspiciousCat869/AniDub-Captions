that would give Uraraka
an advantage against Bakugo?

Honestly, it wasn't
really much of a plan.

Kacchan's so strong.

00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,750
When it comes to close combat,

he almost never
has any openings.

50
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,750
And the more he moves,
the more he sweats,

51
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:52,041
which just makes his
Quirk more powerful.

52
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,083
He's gotten really good
at using his explosions

to move around in the air.

54
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,833
But, if Uraraka is
able to touch him,

55
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,791
she can use her Quirk
to make him float.

She could send
him out of bounds.

what Uraraka needs to do

00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,291
I'll win and be just like Deku!

162
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,083
[OCHACO grunts]

[CROWD yelping]

164
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:32,791
[OCHACO grunting]

165
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,041
[KATSUKI] I figured you'd have
some sorta stupid plan

166
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:40,625
to beat me. You are friends
with that damn nerd, after all.

167
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,958
It took him one shot.

168
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,416
[gasps] Bakugo bangs out
a huge demonstration of power!

169
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,875
He blasted apart
Uraraka's finishing move

170
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,958
and remains untouched!

171
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:58,500
[pants] That was close.

172
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,000
[OCHACO] I put everything
I could into that,

173
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,166
but I wasn't good enough.

174
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,416
[IZUKU]
Oh, man.

175
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,750
[gasps]

176
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,791
[OCHACO]
I can still stand, though.

177
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,291
All right, then.

178
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,458
Time for us to get serious.

179
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,250
Uraraka!

180
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:25,166
[OCHACO] If Deku were in the
ring, he wouldn't give up yet!

181
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,791
[grunts]

182
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,625
[PRESENT MIC]
Uraraka is down!

183
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,125
[OCHACO]
No.

184
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,041
Come on. Get up.

185
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,083
I want to keep going.

186
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,208
It's too much.

187
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:52,916
Yeah. She's way past her limit.

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,666
[OCHACO] I can do this.
I can still fight.

189
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,708
I can!

190
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,708
[OCHACO] When I grow up
all big and strong,

191
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,916
I'll help you and Mommy
out any way that I can.

192
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,375
I appreciate you wanting
to help us, Ochaco.

193
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,375
But, as your father,
I'd be happier if you achieved

194
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,375
your own dreams. That'd make
us perfectly happy!

195
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,250
And, well, if you do make money,
just take us on a vacation.

196
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,916
[OCHACO]
I'll become a hero!

197
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,333
[OCHACO]
Daddy...

198
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,041
Uraraka is KO'd.

199
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,291
Bakugo advances
to the second round!

200
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:45,583
[CROWD cheers]

201
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,916
[CROWD cheering]

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,208
[MIDNIGHT]
Take her to Recovery Girl.

203
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,083
[PRESENT MIC] And, that's it
for the first round.

204
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,833
[sighs] I was really
pullin' for her.

205
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,041
Oh, yeah, I guess
Bakugo's moving on.

206
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,166
[AIZAWA] You're supposed
to be unbiased, you know.

207
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,666
[PRESENT MIC] Let's try to
forget that depressing outcome.

208
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,083
[AIZAWA]
Or not.

209
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,166
[PRESENT MIC] With that,
the first round is complete!

210
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,458
We're taking a quick break

211
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,333
and then we're back
with more matches!

212
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,083
[CROWD cheers]

213
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,333
Guess I'll see you
in the finals.

214
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,125
[IZUKU]
I'm so sorry.

215
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:39,666
[grunts]

216
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,083
[yelps] Hey, Kacchan!

217
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,083
What the hell are
you doing here?

218
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,416
Oh, well. I'm up next,
so, you know.

219
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,291
I was gonna hang
in the waiting room.

220
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,125
Um, also congrats
on winning your match.

221
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,250
See you 'round.

222
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,541
[KATSUKI]
It was your idea, wasn't it?

223
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,375
That stupid,
desperate plan of hers.

224
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,000
You would come up with something
that annoying. If we end up--

225
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,208
[IZUKU]
You're wrong.

226
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,666
That plan.

227
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,541
Uraraka came up with it
all on her own,

228
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,708
I didn't know anything about it.

229
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,083
If that battle was harder
than you thought it would be,

230
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,708
then it's because of
her strategy, not mine.

231
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,666
[growls]

232
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,958
[SERO] Hey, Bakugo!
Playin' the villain, huh?

233
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,375
Musta been tough.

234
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,875
Even if it was just because of
who you were up against,

235
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,291
you did make a pretty
convincing bad guy.

236
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,666
Shut up, you idiots. Or else!

237
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,125
For real, dude.

238
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,208
I don't know how you were
able to aim a powerful blast

239
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,000
at a frail girl like that.

240
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,416
I couldn't help but hold
back against Shiozaki.

241
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,625
She completely
overpowered you, Kaminari.

242
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,500
Can't you just let me have this?

243
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:48,416
[KATSUKI] Hmph. I definitely
wouldn't call that girl "frail."

244
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,833
[door clicks]

245
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,625
Man, I lost. Too bad.

246
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,208
Uh-- Huh?

247
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,000
Guess I got a little
carried away at the end

248
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,291
thinking I had it
in the bag. Dang it!

249
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,458
[IZUKU] You seem fine.
But weren't you injured?

250
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,791
Yeah! Recovery Girl
took care of me.

251
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,166
She was really
careful not to drain

252
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,458
my stamina too much, though.

253
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,500
So, I've still got a few
scrapes and scratches.

254
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,708
Jeez, I didn't realize how
powerful that Bakugo was!

255
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,416
He wiped the ring with me.

256
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Now I realize how much
more training I have to do!

257
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,500
Eh?

258
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,791
You sure you're good?

259
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,500
Oh, yeah, totally.
I'm better than I expected!

260
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,708
[phone vibrates]

261
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,291
Even if you've lost,
you always keep

262
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,333
looking ahead to
what's next, Deku.

263
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,708
This just means that I
have to work harder now.

264
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,833
That's true...

265
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,125
[PRESENT MIC]
Wa-hoo!

266
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,541
We're finally about to learn

267
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,708
who the true winner is
from the seventh match!

268
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,958
Kirishima or Tetsutetsu!

269
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,291
Whoever prevails in this
arm wrestling match

270
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,958
will advance to the
second round! Let's go!

271
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:56,625
[TETSUTETSU groans]

272
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,416
[yells]

273
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,791
Kirishima is the winner!
Add him to the bracket.

274
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,375
[KIRISHIMA]
Yeah!

275
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,750
[PRESENT MIC] Kirishima earns
a spot in the second round!

276
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,208
Ah, damn my metal deficiency!

277
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,625
Shoulda eaten more
iron this morning!

278
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,041
Hey, man. You put
up a good fight.

279
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,791
Ha!

280
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,250
Oh! So chivalrous!

281
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,541
[PRESENT MIC] Now we've got
a full roster for the next round

282
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:28,166
of the tournament. Let's get
the party started now, ya dig?

283
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,541
[sighs] Already?

284
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,416
Later.

285
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,833
[OCHACO]
Oh, I'm sorry, Deku!

286
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,500
You weren't able to
prepare since I was here!

287
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:39,125
Nah. This was perfect.

288
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,416
I'll be watching.
Good luck out there.

289
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,708
Thanks.

290
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,541
[phone ringing]

291
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,500
[OCHACO] Sorry for not
picking up earlier, Daddy.

292
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,083
[OCHACO'S DAD]
No, no, it's fine.

293
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,708
Sorry for calling
when you're busy.

294
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,583
Your mom and I
watched you on TV.

295
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:08,458
You almost won!
You were amazing!

296
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:12,083
[OCHACO] It wasn't that close.
And I wasn't very good.

297
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,541
I rushed it too much at the end.

298
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,416
I didn't have a backup
plan for what I'd do

299
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,000
if that big move
didn't work out.

300
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,000
[OCHACO]
I failed.

301
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,791
[OCHACO'S DAD]
You lost.

302
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,541
But that doesn't mean you
can't still be a pro hero.

303
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,458
I know I don't have
the best understanding

304
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,333
of how all this works, but
there's always next year, right?

305
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,666
This isn't the end.

306
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,833
[OCHACO] I know, but I
wish I coulda gone further

307
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,333
in the festival so I would
have had more chances

308
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,041
to show what I'm made of.

309
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,666
The scouts barely saw me do
anything this time around.

310
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,208
[OCHACO'S DAD] What're you
in such a hurry for, huh?

311
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,125
[OCHACO]
It's just...

312
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,291
I want to help you guys
out as soon as I can.

313
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,083
[OCHACO sniffling]

314
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,458
[OCHACO'S DAD] Ochaco, there's
no need for you to rush.

315
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,625
[OCHACO'S DAD] The very fact
that you feel that way

316
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:04,250
shows me that you'll make
a kind, caring hero one day.

317
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,583
I am so proud of you.

318
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,500
[IZUKU]
Uraraka must be so upset.

319
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,000
I thought I could
help her in some way.

320
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,000
But in the end, I didn't
do anything for her.

321
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,083
Instead, she's cheering me on.

322
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,000
She's got my back.

323
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,875
I'll be watching.
Good luck out there.

324
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:35,125
[IZUKU] She's the one
encouraging me. Again.

325
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,875
[yelps] Endeavor?

326
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,000
Ah. I was looking for you.

327
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,125
Oh, yeah, hi.

328
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,458
So, uh, what are you
doing back here?

329
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,250
I watched your fight against
the brainwashing guy.

330
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,416
Your power is pretty impressive.

331
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,166
To create so much wind pressure
just by flicking your fingers.

332
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,666
It reminds me of another Quirk.

333
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,333
You seem to have much
in common with All Might.

334
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,333
Oh. Well, I--

335
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,833
I guess I never thought
about it that way.

336
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,541
Sorry, but I should get going.

337
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,125
[IZUKU] Is it possible
that Endeavor knows

338
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,666
about One For All?

339
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,250
No, he probably would
have mentioned it.

340
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,041
He's one person I can't let find
out about All Might's secret.

341
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,541
[ENDEAVOR] It's my Shoto's
duty to surpass All Might

342
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,375
as the number one hero.

343
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,083
[ENDEAVOR] And his match
with you will be a good

344
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,791
testing ground for how
much training he has left.

345
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,625
So hit him hard.

346
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,958
Don't disgrace yourself
or him by holding back.

347
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,833
[TODOROKI] I refuse to rely
on my old man's fire Quirk.

348
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,500
You see, I'm going
to show him that

349
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:53,875
I reject his power and take
first place without using it.

350
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,625
[ENDEAVOR]
That's all I wanted to say.

351
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,041
I apologize for bothering you.

352
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,375
[IZUKU]
Endeavor. I am not All Might.

353
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,541
What? What are
you talking about?

354
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:08,041
And the same goes for Todoroki.

355
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,125
He may be your son,
but he isn't you.

356
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,458
[TODOROKI] Midoriya, you've got
All Might in your corner,

357
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,916
helping you out.

358
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,083
[IZUKU]
Todoroki...

359
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,125
[ENDEAVOR] It's my Shoto's
duty to surpass All Might

360
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,250
as the number one hero.

361
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,833
[TODOROKI]
Midoriya.

362
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,125
[ENDEAVOR] Let me assure you
of one thing, All Might.

363
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:45,416
I will mold that child into a
hero that surpasses you one day.

364
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,166
[OCHACO]
So the match hasn't started yet?

365
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,916
Ura--!

366
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,291
Oh, good!

367
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,625
[TENYA] Something horrible's
happened to your eyes!

368
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,500
You need to go
see Recovery Girl!

369
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,791
[OCHACO] I already did.
This is from...

370
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:03,750
...something else.

371
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,416
Ah, of course!

372
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,291
If I were you,
I'd be frustrated, too.

373
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,875
It's no time to wallow.

374
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,666
Use this next fight as
a source of encouragement.

375
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,750
Will do.

376
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,208
You're so wise.

377
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,625
[PRESENT MIC] I can feel the
anticipation in the stadium!

378
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,666
And that's because the
second round's first match

379
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,416
is gonna be epic!

380
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,041
It's the guy who
won his last fight

381
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,291
by a landslide and literally
left half the audience frozen.

382
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,208
The hero course's,
Shoto Todoroki!

383
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,791
And this kid almost walked out

384
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,083
of his first matchup,
but made a stunning comeback

385
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,333
by showing off
some impressive moves!

386
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:42,208
Also from the hero course,
Izuku Midoriya!

387
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,000
So here we are.

388
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,958
And only one of us can win.

389
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,708
Tokoyami. How do you think
this match will go?

390
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,583
It depends on whether
or not Midoriya

391
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,208
is able to get in close to him.

392
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,375
Yeah. That's the problem.

393
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,625
How will Deku avoid the ice?

394
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,583
[MASTER] Pay close attention
to them, Tomura Shigaraki.

395
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,916
These two could prove to
be formidable obstacles

396
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,208
to you one day.

397
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:19,000
Ha. I'm not worried
about a coupla kids.

398
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,500
[IZUKU'S MOM sobs]

399
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,791
[THIRTEEN]
Oh, right.

400
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,458
Those two students tried to save
you at the USJ, didn't they?

401
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,625
Yeah.

402
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,708
[ALL MIGHT] They may have more
in common than they realize.

403
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,625
They both have such an
intense vibe about them.

404
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,541
[PRESENT MIC] Both of the
heroes-in-training have been

405
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,333
frontrunners in
the Sports Festival!

406
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:49,791
But which one of these rivals
will advance to the next round?

407
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,083
Prepare for...

408
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,333
...Midoriya versus Todoroki!

409
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,583
[PRESENT MIC]
Begin!

410
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,333
[IZUKU]
Here it is.

411
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,375
Todoroki and I are
finally being pitted

412
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,041
against each other one-on-one.

413
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,791
[TODOROKI]
This will be over quickly.

414
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,958
[IZUKU] Your ice is so
powerful, if you would just

415
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,125
use your left side, too, then...

416
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,333
[TODOROKI]
I told you.

417
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,166
I will win without
using that man's Quirk.

418
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,583
I will completely
reject his wishes.

419
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,791
[IZUKU] Hey, I'm your
opponent here, not him!

420
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,041
[TODOROKI]
What?

421
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:52,291
[IZUKU] Next time:
"Shoto Todoroki. Origin."

422
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,375
Todoroki will remember
words he hasn't thought of

423
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,291
in many years.

424
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,250
[TODOROKI]
Go Beyond!

425
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,583
[TODOROKI, IZUKU]
Plus Ultra!
