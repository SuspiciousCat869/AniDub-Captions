my day, but only for one year.

He was All Might's teacher,
so I knew he had

00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:50,083
to be pretty old, but I didn't
expect him to be bonkers.

I just need to
make a phone call.

00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,000
[IZUKU] I should probably
let All Might know

I'm also here

if All Might has much time left.

[IZUKU] I'm sorry. But I
can't waste my whole week

The way you used your power

He's not training you well.

He may be the symbol of peace
and the number one hero,

68
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,708
but All Might's a total novice
when it comes to teaching.

69
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,666
I can only imagine what a
blunder he is in the classroom.

Now. Shall we get started,
you buncha newbies?

71

[IZUKU] Hey, All Might
called us newbies, too.

This really is his teacher!

I can't stand to watch you
use your Quirk that way,

00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,041
so I suppose I'll
have to teach you.

76
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,666
Now, hurry and get
your costume on.

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,208
I know that I might not
find him. But still...

160
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,791
[TENYA] I have to try
to track the villain down.

161
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:42,250
Because I can't forgive him
for what he's done.

162
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,416
[STAIN]
Now I get it.

163
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,000
You must be the ones
who attacked UA.

164
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,666
And you wanna
recruit me to build up

165
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,291
your little group again.

166
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,541
[SHIGARAKI]
Yeah.

167
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,166
It'll be great, you've
got so much experience.

168
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,375
And what's your mission?

169
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,708
[SHIGARAKI]
For now?

170
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,291
I really just wanna
kill All Might.

171
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,541
I like to destroy anything
that pisses me off.

172
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,291
Like this little brat here.

173
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,541
Game over.

174
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,958
I was a fool to think
you could offer me anything.

175
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,000
It turns out, you're
the type of person

176
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,875
I hate most in this world.

177
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,208
[SHIGARAKI]
Hm?

178
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,458
The goals of your "league"
are those of a child.

179
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,166
What meaning is there to killing

180
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,458
if you don't have
real convictions?

181
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,291
[KUROGIRI]
The Hero Killer Stain.

182
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,833
Tomura Shigaraki cares
only about wanton violence,

183
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,500
so we brought this man
in to guide him.

184
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,291
Perhaps we made a mistake.

185
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,875
[KUROGIRI]
Master. Should I step in?

186
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,375
[MASTER]
Let it happen.

187
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,041
It's possible this is the only
way he'll learn anything.

188
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,083
He needs to think about
the ways he must grow.

189
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,750
How he can mature.

190
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,083
Only then will he
reach his potential.

191
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,375
[IZUKU] My admiration for
All Might is a shackle.

192
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:09,708
I understand the fundamentals,
but there's discord in my mind.

193
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,041
I believe One For All
is more special than it is.

194
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,375
Is that what's making
my movements stiff?

195
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,583
What does "stiff" even mean?

196
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,958
Okay, look at all this
in a different way.

197
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,208
What makes a movement flexible?

198
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,000
[gasps] I know!

199
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,208
How I think about it,
One For All--

200
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,750
Those big smashes are
like my special moves.

201
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,666
But I saw him use it up close.

202
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,833
Why didn't I notice then?

203
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,250
Now I see.

204
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,000
Quirks are just extensions
of our bodies. So then...

205
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,166
I need to start thinking of
One For All as being part of me.

206
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,541
That's it! I get it!

207
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,625
[GRAN TORINO] Well, at least
he's mentally adept

208
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,791
and forward-thinking. For a kid.

209
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,791
But I already knew that
from the festival.

210
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,875
You found a good one,
huh, Toshinori?

211
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,375
Or should I say, All Might?

212
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,625
[BEST JEANIST]
To be perfectly frank,

213
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,583
I don't like you very much.

214
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,875
Huh?

215
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,000
[BEST JEANIST] I know full well
why you chose my agency.

216
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,416
Because I'm one of the top
five most popular heroes.

217
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,083
Hey, look, you're the one
who made an offer for me.

218
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,625
[BEST JEANIST]
Yes.

219
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,166
Recently, all my recruits have
been perfect little angels,

220
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,541
so you certainly stood out.

221
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,583
I watched the way you fought
at the sports festival.

222
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,916
You have a good handle
on your powerful Quirk,

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and a decent grasp of
its application as well.

224
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,041
[BEST JEANIST]
You're an outstanding talent.

225
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,375
I'd say you're already good
enough to take on as a sidekick.

226
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,125
However, you do
have a fatal flaw.

227
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,083
You believe you're the best,
and you display that belief

228
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,750
without regard for how it
reflects on you or your image.

229
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,375
You have a ferocious nature.

230
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,708
Don't tell me you
brought me here

231
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,333
just to give me a lecture!

232
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,083
Ah--

233
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,375
[BEST JEANIST] I have to
correct people like you.

234
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,041
It's part of my duty to society.

235
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,125
Heroes and villains are
cut from the same cloth.

236
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,875
So your job here is to watch me.

237
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,375
I'll show you what
makes someone a hero.

238
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,125
What in the hell are you doing?

239
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,583
[BEST JEANIST]
Isn't it obvious?

240
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,041
I'm educating you on
becoming an exemplary pro.

241
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,416
That includes being aware
of the way you speak,

242
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,958
your appearance, controlling
your emotions, your morals.

243
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,333
There are countless things
you need to learn,

244
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,875
but in the brief
period of one week,

245
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,000
I will stitch these things
into the fabric of your being.

246
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,875
[TETSUTETSU, KIRISHIMA]
Whoa!

247
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:40,750
Tetsutetsu?

248
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,000
Kirishima!

249
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,916
[BOTH] Hey, man, what
are you doin' here?

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,625
We were able to put in
two offers this year.

251
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,958
Let's begin right away.

252
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,083
[BOTH] I look forward
to working with you.

253
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,875
I was impressed by
the guts both of you

254
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,208
showed at the sports
festival. I like you two.

255
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,375
However, being a
hero isn't easy,

256
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,125
and you can't rely
on brute force alone.

257
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,750
So this week, you'll learn
from my experience.

258
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,250
That's the chivalrous hero.

259
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,041
He's so manly!

260
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,958
Wait for me to finish speaking.

261
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,791
[BOTH]
Yes, sir! Apologies!

262
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,041
[FOURTH KIND]
Seems I'll have to teach you

263
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,333
proper manners, too.

264
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,208
[BOTH]
Thank you very much, sir!

265
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,750
First, let's talk about
why we're even here.

266
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,666
Pros receive wages
from the government,

267
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,375
so we're civil servants.

268
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,333
But, there's more
to it than that.

269
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,500
With the Quirks we offer, our
responsibilities are different

270
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,416
from regular workers.

271
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,791
Now, regarding
our actual duties.

272
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,583
[GUNHEAD] Basic hero goal:
control crime. Right?

273
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,166
When a crime occurs,
the police will contact us.

274
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,041
These requests come in all
at once, filtered by district.

275
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,458
We file reports on the
services we provided.

276
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,291
Assisting with arrests,
rescuing people, et cetera.

277
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,375
Then a special agency looks
at our work and decides

278
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,666
how much we should be paid.

279
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,375
You'll catch on quick, kiddo.

280
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,625
[OCHACO] I didn't expect
him to be so friendly.

281
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,958
[UWABAMI]
Additionally, heroes are allowed

282
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,000
to have side jobs.

283
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,583
There were a lot of
arguments about this

284
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,375
when the world of pros was
first being established,

285
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,416
but the heroes ended up
being so popular

286
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,250
that the public demanded it.

287
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,625
For example:

288
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,125
I'm about to film a commercial.
Stick around, okay?

289
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,250
Um, well.

290
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,916
I was kinda hoping
I'd see something

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,333
a little more action-y.

292
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,750
[YAOYOROZU]
No.

293
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,041
This sort of attention is
something you can't avoid

294
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,083
if you're a pro.

295
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,250
Besides,

296
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,708
she was kind enough
to offer her wisdom

297
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,875
to an unworthy, student.

298
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,166
So I'll take every
lesson she has to give!

299
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,916
[KENDO]
She's really into this.

300
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay.

301
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,333
But isn't there
anything else we can do

302
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,791
while you film this
commercial, or whatever?

303
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,208
[UWABAMI] Do you know why
I chose to recruit you two?

304
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,291
Any thoughts?

305
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,500
[KENDO]
Well, I guess...

306
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,916
[YAOYOROZU] It must be
because you saw such

307
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,083
heroic potential in us!

308
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,250
[UWABAMI]
Of course I did.

309
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,208
But there's another reason.

310
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,375
You're both very
cute young ladies.

311
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,458
[BOTH]
Huh?

312
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,083
[DEATH ARMS] Heroes must
practice and train constantly.

313
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,666
You can't take a break,
even when you're on patrol.

314
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,166
Right! Kay!

[JIRO]
Aw, man.

316
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,625
This is so much
harder than class.

317
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,250
You know what's a useful skill?

318
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,041
Knowing how to pass the
time while you're waiting

319
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,125
to be called out to
rescue someone. Got that?

320
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,958
[MINETA]
Uh, sure.

321
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,875
[MINETA] This is not the kind of
role play I was hoping for.

322
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,291
[whistle blowing]

323
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,708
[ENDEAVOR] I've been
waiting for you, Shoto.

324
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,958
You're finally ready to walk
down the path of the mighty.

325
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,458
[TODOROKI] I have no
intention of following

326
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:25,916
any path you've created.
Only I can decide my future.

327
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,625
Heh. Is that so?
You should go get ready.

328
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,333
We're going out.

329
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,791
Where to?

330
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,208
It's time I show you
what it means to be a hero.

331
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,666
[GRAN TORINO snoring]

332
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,708
I'm snoring! I'm snoring!

333
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,541
[IZUKU]
He can't be serious.

334
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,541
The first day of training down,

335
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,583
and all he did was test me once.

336
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,291
No actual hero work
or field training.

337
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,875
He just passed out after
coming back with food.

338
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,708
Gran Torino...

339
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,000
I didn't get any hits when
I searched for that name.

340
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,666
A UA teacher for just one year.

341
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,541
He's one big mystery.

342
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,291
[IZUKU] I need to change
the way that I think

343
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,125
about One For All.
It's part of me.

344
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,458
My classmates use their Quirks
as if it's completely natural.

345
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,541
But I still think of mine as
something I have to call upon.

346
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,833
If I could use even
five percent of my power

347
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,291
like it was nothing.

348
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,125
I'd be able to
move like Kacchan.

349
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,083
Mr. Aizawa and Kirishima
said the same thing.

350
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,375
If I can just master my Quirk,

351
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,708
I'll be able to do
so many things!

352
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,750
But first, I need to be
able to use it instantly.

353
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,125
All right! I'll try this out.

354
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,875
Five percent should
be enough here.

355
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,041
One, two, three, the roof.

356
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,666
That shouldn't be
too hard, right?

357
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:51,541
[IZUKU] Imagine the egg not
exploding in the microwave!

358

[IZUKU grunts]

359
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,333
[IZUKU]
I was afraid that would happen.

360
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,958
[IZUKU grunts]

361
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,500
[IZUKU] I need to brace
myself, and use my arms

362
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,250
to cushion the impact.

363
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,875
Which means,
for the second jump,

364
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,958
I need to put power into
both my arms and my legs.

365
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,750
But if I don't do it quickly
enough, then I'll end up

366
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,833
breaking my bones in the fall!

367
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,000
I can't take the time
to visualize the result

368
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:22,458
like I normally do.
But I have to try it.

369
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,708
[IZUKU grunts]

00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,708

This time I'll switch faster!

00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,000
[IZUKU yelps]
Faster, stupid! Do it faster!

374
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,208
Is it a villain?

Let's go, it's not
our problem, honey!

00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,500
[IZUKU]
Faster!

378
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,291
Good morning.

379
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,541
What's wrong? You look beat.

380
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,916
Well...

381
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,666
I was training on my own
yesterday and went too far.

382
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,416
I tried to take
everything you said to me

383
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,958
and put it into practice,
but it was just no good.

384
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,916
Heh. Obviously I still
have a long way to go.

385
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,333
It's your first time trying,

386
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,375
so it's to be expected.
That is how training works.

387
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,875
Of course, I suppose All Might
can't wrap his mind around that.

388
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,833
He was pretty much able to use
One For All right off the bat,

389
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,500
so I taught him in a
very different manner.

390
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,375
'Course he had the
body going for him,

391
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,375
so there's that.

392
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,500
Whoa, All Might
as a student, huh?

393
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,750
Come on, what was
he like back then?

394
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,666
[GRAN TORINO]
Hm? Huh...

395
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,750
It was all combat
training for him.

[IZUKU] No wonder All Might
was so scared of this guy!

400
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,083
The training was difficult,
but I couldn't hold back on him.

401
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,208
He was entrusted to me
by a sworn friend

402
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,875
who had just passed away.

403

Oh, All Might's predecessor?

404
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,375
So, can you tell me
anything about the guy?

405
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,041

Got it. Thanks!

00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,125
Yeah, for some reason,
mine broke yesterday.

414
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,875
Heh. So I bought a new one.

415
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,125
[IZUKU] I can't tell if
he's being serious or not.

So whaddaya think,
how 'bout we eat

417

some of that frozen food
I bought? It'll be good!

418
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,041
But the only thing you
bought was dessert.

What can I say, I like
the finer things in life.

[IZUKU] Using my Quirk needs to
be as easy as taking a breath.

421
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,916
Thinking about it
objectively, everyone else

422
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,250
has had 15 years to get
into that kind of mindset.

423
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,916
But not me, and time
waits for no one.

424
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,625
At this rate,
in order to draw out

425
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,666
more than five percent
of my power,

426
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,083
I'll need to put in
the kind of commitment

427
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,250
I did on the beach.

Why the long face, boy?

00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,625
Just focus on these pipin'

Ah-- No way!

436
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm positive that I microwaved
them like it said to.

437
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,750
What're you an idiot?

438
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,000
You stuck a huge plate
in there, didn't you?

439
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,041
If you do that, there's
no room for it to turn.

440
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,250
So only one part of it gets hot.

441

Have you never done this before?

[IZUKU]
Oh, ours isn't the turning type,

I've got it!

Whoa. Gran Torino!

447
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:41,666
I see now! The frozen pastry
in my hand is me!

448
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,458
No, it's not. Are you okay?

449
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:48,000
Uh, I don't mean literally.
I'm not really a dessert.

450
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,416
But I get it.

451
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Up until now, I've just been
summoning One For All.

452
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,083
Only when I really need it.
In the places I need it.

453
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,291
Like flipping on
some kind of switch.

454
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,500
But if I do that that,
my reaction time gets

455
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,833
slower and slower
with every move.

456
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,291
Which means...

457
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,416
I shouldn't be flipping
the switch off.

458
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,791
I just have to leave the
power on the whole time.

459
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,958
Imagining the energy
that used to be focused

460
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,958
in one place spreading
throughout my entire body!

461
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,833
[GRAN TORINO] Didn't take
him long to figure that out.

462
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,875
Good.

The five percent that I can use!

465
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,083
Visualizing a pastry
in the microwave

466
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,416
is pretty boring, kid, you
sure you're okay with that?

467
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,000
[IZUKU] All Might said that
about my egg already,

468
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,708
and it was fine with me.

469
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,250
So tell me, can you
move in this state?

470
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,708
I don't know for sure.

471
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,958
Wanna give it a try?

472
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,125
Yes. Let's do this!

473
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,125
[SHIGARAKI] So you finally
called me in for a preview, huh?

474
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,166
[IZUKU]
Whoa. Tomura Shigaraki?

475
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,125
[SHIGARAKI]
It took you long enough,

476
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,541
don't you think, Midoriya?

477
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,416
[IZUKU] But I don't have
anything to do with this--

478
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,750
[SHIGARAKI]
Oh, really?

479
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,750
Then starting this week,
I think I'll be in charge

480
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,125
of all these stupid previews.

481
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,083
[IZUKU screams] Somebody help!
Where's All Might?

482
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,583
[SHIGARAKI] Next time:
"Midoriya and Shigaraki."

483
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,958
The League of Villains
is going wild.

484
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,666
I'll destroy every
last one of you,

485
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,958
whether you're a hero
or a hero killer.

486
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:54,875
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

487
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:55,833
[SHIGARAKI]
Not this time.

488
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:56,666
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

489
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,291
[SHIGARAKI]
I said no!
