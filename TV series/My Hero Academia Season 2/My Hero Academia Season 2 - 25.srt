Kurogiri, get rid of these two.

00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:14,583
I can already tell

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,208
they're exactly the
kind of trash I hate.

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,416
A brat and a guy
with no manners.

[KUROGIRI]
Now, now, Tomura Shigaraki.

6
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,375
They came all this way,
the least we can do

7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,125
is hear them out.
Give them a chance.

8
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:30,833
Besides, this broker is
respected in the underworld.

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,583
They're bound to be
valuable assets.

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,250
Like 'em or not, you still
owe me a finder's fee.

In cash.

12
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,958
I suppose I could
introduce the two of 'em

13
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,458
before I go.

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,375
This one looks like an adorable
high school girl, right?

15
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,916
She's actually the suspect
in a series of deaths

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,833
where the victims all bled out.

17
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,708
So far, her name and face have
been kept out of the media.

Toga, here. Himiko Toga!

Life is too hard.

I just wanna make it easier
to live in this dumb world.

I wanna be Mr. Stainy!

You gotta be kidding me.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,250
Is she crazy?

27
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,416
Well, she can
hold a conversation.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,250
For the most part, at least.

29
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,625
C'mon, she could be useful.

30
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,916
And this guy--

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,583
Hasn't committed
any flashy crimes,

32
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,250
but he's taken Stain's
ideology to heart.

33
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,833
I don't like this.

Is your group really dedicated
to the Hero Killer's mission?

Grow up.

She may be a psycho,
but at least she knows

00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,291
how to introduce
herself to people.

41

Don't just stare.
What's your name?

Right now I'm goin' by Dabi.

[SHIGARAKI] No, I want
to know your real name.

I'll tell you when
you need to know it.

In any case,

my new purpose is to carry
out the Hero Killer's will.

[SHIGARAKI] That wasn't what
I asked you, patchwork.

Jeez. Why is everyone
so hung up on Stain?

You two are done.

[KUROGIRI] Please calm
yourself, Tomura Shigaraki.

If your desire
is to be realized,

then we must
increase our numbers.

Now that we're in the spotlight,
our chance is at hand.

I advise you to be
more accepting.

That's why he left as he did.

He understands
his circumstances.

He's been humbled

bring you an answer.

twist or somethin'.

Stop, Midoriya.

Ease up, Kaminari.

Our team only passed
thanks to Mineta.

I got knocked out,
and since we don't know

00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,125
how they're scoring stuff,
I might have flunked.

At least bring us back lots
of camp souvenirs, please?

your final exams.

[AIZAWA]
Yeah.

The good news is that no one
bombed the written exam.

105
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,416
Five failed the practical badly.

106
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,416
Two teams, of course,
and then Sero failed as well.

Aw! Crap, I knew it.

108

Mineta made it to the gate, but
I didn't do near enough to pass.

Allow me to explain.

110
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,458
For the practical battles,
the teachers made sure

111
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,625
to leave a way for
the students to win.

112
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,041
Otherwise, you never would
have stood a chance.

113
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,708
We were interested in
observing how you each

worked together and
approached the task at hand.

But didn't you promise
that the teachers

wouldn't be holding back?

117
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,583
[AIZAWA] That was just
to get you on edge.

00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,541
Besides, the training camp
will focus on building

need those lessons the most.

to separate you.

Uh, a little blunt there, Tenya.

That's a good point.

everyone from teens to seniors.

158
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,791
You're going to scare
the children. Stop.

159
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,750
[GUY 38A]
Whoa! Aren't those UA students?!

160
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,625
1-A!

161
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,916
I saw 'em on TV!

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,666
[GUYS]
The sports festival was so good!

163
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,791
[laughs] I can't believe
they still remember that.

164
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,458
I wanna track down
a new duffel bag

165
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,041
to bring to summer training.

166
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,250
Oh, yeah?

167
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,916
Maybe the two of us
should browse together.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,708
Let's see, where can
I get a lockpicking kit

169
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,291
and a small drill.

170
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,958
Guess I should probably buy some
outdoorsy shoes for this thing.

171
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,583
[HAGAKURE]
Oh, that's smart, me, too!

172
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,666
The guide said your shoes

173
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,125
should already be
broken in, though.

174
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,208
But, wait.

175
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,750
Perhaps it's a
mistake not to factor

176
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,958
utility into the equation.

177
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,875
[KIRISHIMA] So, then, why don't
we split up and look around?

178
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,583
We can meet here again
when we're done.

179
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,875
Great idea!

180
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,000
[KIRISHIMA]
Perfect.

181
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,125
Let's say we're all
back around three?

182
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,541
[STUDENTS]
Sounds good!

183
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,083
Looks like it's just
you and me left.

184
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,333
Yeah.

185
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,916
So, what are you
gonna shop for today?

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,708
I wanna find a few
heavier wrist weights

187
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,083
so I can up my training.

188
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,416
I mostly just need bug spray.

189
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,708
[AOYAMA]
Is it... because you like him?

190
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,458
Yep. Gotta keep
those pests away!

191
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,791
Do you mean, me?

192
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,791
[OCHACO]
You're so stupid, Aoyama.

193
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,000
That's not it at all!

194
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,541
I don't think...

195
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:04,791
We came here as a class,
but here I am... by myself.

196
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,375
[SHIGARAKI]
Oh, it's someone from UA, nice.

197
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,833
I want an autograph.

198
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,875
Uh--

199
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,333
You were the one
who got beat to hell

200
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,875
at the sports festival, right?

201
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,708
Uh, yeah.

202
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,541
[IZUKU]
Wow, UA's so amazing.

203
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,791
I can't believe how many people

204
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,083
watched the matches
and still remember us.

205
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,750
[SHIGARAKI] Aren't you one
of the students who ran

206
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,625
into the Hero Killer in
the Hosu incident, too?

207
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,083
You're practically famous.

208
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,958
You sure do know a lot.

209
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,833
What can I say--I'm just
a big fan of yours.

210
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,333
I can't believe I'm
running into you again.

211
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,500
[gasps]

212
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,583
[SHIGARAKI]
It makes me think

213
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,416
that it might not
be a coincidence.

214
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,750
No, no. This feels
like it's destiny.

215
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,291
[SHIGARAKI] Oh, right.
From your point of view,

216
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,875
we haven't met since
the attack on UA.

217
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,333
[growls]

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,208
Why don't we spend
some time catching up?

219
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,083
Izuku Midoriya.

220
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,458
[IZUKU]
Tomura Shigaraki!

221
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,250
[STAIN]
What meaning is there to killing

222
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,375
if you don't have
real convictions?

223
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,875
[SHIGARAKI]
Just wait, Hero Killer.

224
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,500
These people think they're safe,
like nothing can harm them.

225
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,416
I don't know if they're
naive or just ignorant.

226
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,833
People are getting
killed somewhere

227
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,625
at this very moment, but
these idiots keep smiling.

228
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,083
Like they don't have
a care in the world.

229
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,083
[GUY 38D]
Hero Killer gear!

230
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,625
Are they really selling this?

231
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,500
[GUY 38E] You'll get into so
much trouble if you buy that.

232
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,125
Sure, but how does it look?

233
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,916
[GUY 38E]
Oh, cool.

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,500
[camera shutter clicks]

235
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,875
[SHIGARAKI]
But, on the other hand,

236
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,375
you've got sympathizers

237
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,875
who couldn't care less
about your ideals.

238
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,916
And yet, they still follow you.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,708
What's up with that?

240
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,541
Aren't we doing the
same thing? You and me?

241
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,458
In the end, you destroy things
you hate, just like I do.

242
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,166
[VOICE screaming]

243
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,166
[SHIGARAKI] So what gives?
What's the difference?

244
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,791
[SHIGARAKI]
Act natural. Don't make a scene.

245
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,291
I'm just an old friend who
ran into you at the mall.

246
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,333
Calm down and wipe
that look off your face.

247
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,500
I think we should have
a conversation, is all.

248
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,416
A friendly chat.

249
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,208
Oh, and of course, if you try
to run or fight me in any way...

250
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,041
Well, it'll be fast.

251
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,500
Soon as all five of my
fingers touch your neck,

252
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,041
your throat'll be
the first thing

253
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,375
that disintegrates.

254
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,416
In a matter of seconds,
you'll be nothing more

255
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,875
than dust and powdered bone.

256
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,666
[IZUKU] If you do that here
where there are so many people,

257
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,666
a hero will come and
catch you in no time.

258
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,041
You couldn't escape.

259
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,208
I don't doubt that.

260
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,208
But just look at these sheep.

261
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,041
Any one of them could
use their Quirks

262
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,625
and start a massacre
whenever they wanted.

263
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,416
And yet they're
all here, smiling.

264
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,083
They think laws and
rules will protect them,

265
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,250
because they assume everyone
has their same morals.

266
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,291
They're convinced nothing bad
could ever happen to them.

267
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,875
After you I could kill 20...

268
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:14,958
...30...

269
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,666
Maybe even more
before a pro showed up

270
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,833
and managed to stop me.

271
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,708
[IZUKU]
I get it. Let's talk.

272
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,791
[SHIGARAKI chuckles]
This is nice. A real moment.

273
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,250
Let's go grab a seat and get
comfortable, why don't we?

274
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,291
[SHIGARAKI]
When it comes down to it,

275
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,291
I hate basically everything.

276
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,125
But the Hero Killer pisses
me off the most right now.

277
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,250
Isn't he one of your guys?

278
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,166
[SHIGARAKI] Not technically,
but that's what the media

279
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,958
made it look like. And
that's what my problem is.

280
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,916
It's like suddenly,
everyone is obsessed

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,333
with that stupid Hero Killer.

282
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,750
The attack on UA, the Nomus

283
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:59,458
I released on Hosu--
he upstaged all of it.

284
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,041
No one's even giving
me a second thought.

285
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,791
Why is that?

286
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,208
Despite what he
claims to believe,

287
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,875
all he really did was try to
get rid of whatever things

288
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,666
he didn't like.

289
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,708
What do you think the
difference is between us?

290
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,291
Midoriya?

291
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,958
[OCHACO sighs]

292
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,791
Ugh, I can't just run away
every time I get flustered.

293
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,291
[OCHACO] I bet Deku was
really confused by that.

294
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,625
I feel bad leaving him behind.

295
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,708
So...

296
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,250
I should go back
and apologize. Right?

297
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:41,416
Just go talk to him.
All alone. No big deal.

298
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,291
Yeah! No problem.

299
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,541
It's not like I
wanna spend all day

300
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,375
shopping with him
or anything weird.

301
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,041
I mean, sure,
I think he's amazing

302
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,041
'cause he tries so
hard to be a hero.

303
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,208
But it's not like I
like him. He's my friend!

304
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,708
What Aoyama said was ridiculous!

305
00:13:55,791 --> 00:14:01,125
[IZUKU] What's the difference?
I don't understand <i>you</i> .

306
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,666
Your goals and your villains...

307
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,541
I don't agree with
anything you do.

308
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,125
I don't agree with
the Hero Killer either.

309
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,833
But I can understand him.
At least, sort of.

310
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,166
Because the Hero Killer and I
have something in common.

311
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,416
We're inspired by All Might.

312
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,416
[STAIN] Everything that I do
is to create a stronger society.

313
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
[IZUKU]
That night,

314
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,125
he even saved me
from the flying Nomu.

315
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,583
He's a maniac, but he
doesn't destroy things

316
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,083
just because it sounds fun.

317
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,625
[SHIGARAKI] It's game over
for real this time.

318
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,708
Let's go home.

319
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,000
[IZUKU] And when things
were looking bad for him,

320
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,666
he didn't abandon his
mission like you did.

321
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,166
Even if the way he
acted was wrong,

322
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,958
he held true to his beliefs.
That's the difference.

323
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:55,375
[SHIGARAKI] Ah... That's like
a weight off my chest.

324
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:59,000
I see it now...
All the dots connected.

325
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:03,916
Why he makes me so angry,
why you irritate me so much--

326
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,208
Everything makes sense.

327
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,500
It's him. The problem
is All Might.

328
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,541
[IZUKU gasps]

329
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,291
[SHIGARAKI]
Yeah, yeah. That's it.

330
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,375
That's the most
rational explanation.

331
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,083
[laughs] I didn't see it,

332
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,000
even though it was right in
front of me the whole time.

333
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,916
What was I worrying
about so much?

334
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,375
It's simple.

335
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,333
He's why these morons are
able to smile thoughtlessly!

336
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,083
[SHIGARAKI] They feel so safe
because that garbage pro

337
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,916
is smiling thoughtlessly,
too, as if there's no one

338
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,541
in the whole world
he can't save.

339
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,791
Oh, I'm glad we had this chat.

340
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,833
I feel better. I can't
thank you enough, Midoriya.

341
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,708
I don't need to change
my ways after all.

342
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,458
Whoops, don't struggle, now.
Unless you want to die.

343
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,041
You want all these people
here to crumble as well?

344
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,166
[SHIGARAKI] You know, it's
really ironic, Hero Killer.

345
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,083
I'm your opposite,
but you let me live.

346
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,958
And now your ideals
and convictions

347
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:07,041
will become a stepping
stone for me.

348
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,875
[OCHACO]
Uh, Deku?

349
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,333
Is this a friend of yours?

350
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,666
Or, no, wait a minute--

351
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,375
Uh, hey. Let go of him.

352
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,750
[gasps] This is nothing,
everything's fine!

353
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,250
Stay back! No closer!

354
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,250
[IZUKU gasps]

355
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,625
Oh, you were here
with a friend?

356
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,458
I didn't know. Sorry about that.

357
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,291
If you try following me,
I'll get angry.

358
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:40,208
[IZUKU coughing]

359
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,750
Deku!

360
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,750
Hold on, Shigaraki.

361
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,458
[gasps] Shigaraki?

362
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:52,125
I have a question, too.
What is All For One after?

363
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,958
Who knows, really.

364
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,958
But here's a little
word of advice, friend.

365
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,083
Be careful. The
next time we meet,

366
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,166
I'll likely have to kill you.

367
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,541
[gasps]

368
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,875
[STAIN]
What meaning is there to killing

369
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,458
if you don't have
real convictions?

370
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,166
[SHIGARAKI]
I had convictions and ideals

371
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,250
from the beginning, Hero Killer.

372
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:22,291
I just didn't know.
Nothing has changed.

373
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,458
The only real difference is

374
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,125
now I know what
I'm working toward.

375
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,500
[SHIGARAKI] To create a
world without All Might

376
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,333
and to prove how
fragile society's

377
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,458
sense of safety really is.

378
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,250
That's what drives me.

379
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,791
From this day forward,

380
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,083
I will call it my conviction.

381
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,833
There is only one man
I'll let kill me.

382
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,583
The true hero among you fakes.

383
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,541
All Might is worthy!

384
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,375
[SHIGARAKI]
Everything is All Might's fault.

385
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,458
[IZUKU]
Uraraka reported the incident

386
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,083
and the shopping mall
was temporarily closed.

387
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:05,291
The heroes and police in the
area conducted a massive sweep.

388
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,166
But they couldn't
find Shigaraki.

389
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,958
Later that day, I was taken
to the police station.

390
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,000
Mr. Tsukauchi,
who is investigating

391
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,125
the League of Villains,
interviewed me.

392
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,041
I told him everything
I could about Shigaraki's

393
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,833
appearance and the
conversation we had.

394
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,625
Huh. From what I'm
hearing, it sounds like

395
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,208
they're not a
monolithic organization.

396
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,333
And it sounds like his
desire to defeat All Might

397
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,166
hasn't changed a bit.

398
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,833
Anyway, thanks for
the report, Midoriya.

399
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,666
This helps.

400
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,916
Oh, sure.

401
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,500
I just wish there was some way
I could've detained him.

402
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,625
Don't worry. You did a great job

403
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,291
holding it together when so
many lives were on the line.

404
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,458
Most people would've panicked

405
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,625
and lost their cool
in that situation.

406
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,166
No one got hurt today because
you were able to remain calm.

407
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,000
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya! Tsukauchi!

408
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,750
[gasps]

409
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,833
[IZUKU]
All Might? But, how?

410
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,250
I needed to talk to him anyway.

411
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,958
[ALL MIGHT] What a relief.
I'm so glad you're okay.

412
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,083
I'm sorry I couldn't be there
to protect you and the others.

413
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,375
It's fine.

414
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,625
[IZUKU]
Um, All Might.

415
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,958
Yeah, what is it?

416
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,041
Do you ever have times
when you can't save

417
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,125
all the people that you want to?

418
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,208
Yes, I do. And often.

419
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,250
Someone could be
injured and calling out

420
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,125
for my help anywhere
in the world right now,

421
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,416
and I would never know about it.

422
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
I know it's frustrating,
but we're only human.

423
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,291
There will always be
people beyond our reach

424
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,000
that we can't protect.

425
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:52,083
But that's all the more reason
to stand tall and smile.

426
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,958
So that the "Symbol of
Justice" is always there.

427
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,416
Even when I can't be,
a flicker in people's hearts,

428
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,000
whether they be
a hero or a villain.

429
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,166
[TSUKAUCHI] The kid's worried
about what Shigaraki said.

430
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,375
But that was likely the
villain's resentment talking.

431
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,791
All Might here has never failed

432
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,791
to save someone after
arriving at an emergency.

433
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,083
Think we've got
everything we need,

434
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,541
so you're good.
We're all done here.

435
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,208
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Izuku?

436
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,166
[IZUKU]
Mom?

437
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,583
Izuku! Baby!

438
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,416
I can't do this anymore.

439
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,791
I don't think my heart
can handle another scare.

440
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,500
I'm sorry. Everything's fine.

441
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,250
I'm okay, Mom.
There's no need to cry.

442
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,791
The heroes and the
police have been taking

443
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,458
really good care
of me all night.

444
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,583
[TSUKAUCHI] Sansa. Make sure
they get home safe.

445
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,625
Sir.

446
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,958
This time, at least,
it appears to have been

447
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,000
a coincidental meeting.

448
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,958
But there's still
a pretty big possibility

449
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,666
that he or another student will
be targeted in the future.

450
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,458
Of course, we'll continue
to be on high alert here,

451
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,291
but the school should be ready
to take drastic measures.

452
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:07,291
The stronger the light shines,
the greater the darkness.

453
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,083
I think that, for the
good of the students,

454
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,916
you should consider
leaving UA, All Might.

455
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,333
I've just gotten started.

456
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,666
I mean, it's only been
three months of teaching.

457
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,750
[TSUKAUCHI]
Heh. I told you before

458
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,333
that you weren't cut out for it.

459
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,833
[ALL MIGHT grumbles]

460
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,208
All For One again.

461
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,458
This time we have
to capture him.

462
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,708
One more fight.

463
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,458
I'm counting on
you again, Tsukauchi.

464
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,791
[TSUKAUCHI]
Yeah.

465
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,875
[IZUKU] From the entrance
exam to the fitness test,

466
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,916
combat training, the
League of Villains' attack,

467
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,541
the sports festival.

468
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,000
our internships and
the Hosu incident,

469
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,291
and finally, our exams.

470
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,416
A lot has happened,

471
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,958
but my first semester
at UA is over.

472
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,958
Summer is about to begin.

473
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,333
Though, that doesn't
mean we can just

474
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,583
ignore our training.

475
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,375
All of us need to be
prepared for the evil

476
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,500
lurking around the corner.

477
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:13,333
Because that's how we'll
become true heroes.

478
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,583
We don't have time
to stand around.

479
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,208
We have to keep running
toward our goals.

480
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:51,166
[DOCTOR] Hm, you seem
oddly happy today, Master.

481
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,333
Is it because the
League of Villains' roster

482
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,250
continues to grow steadily?

483
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,333
[MASTER coughs]
That's not why, Doctor.

484
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,250
It's because Tomura Shigaraki

485
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,875
has finally found
his conviction.

486
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,791
The League of Villains
needs people

487
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,250
who will get behind
his principles.

488
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,916
I'll leave all of the
decisions to him for now.

489
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,708
If he asks for help,
then of course,

490
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,583
I'll step in and guide him.

491
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,500
That's not a problem,
as I see it.

492
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,291
In fact, I've been
waiting for the day

493
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,500
when he seeks my aid.

494
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,791
I'm preparing for him
to become the next me.

495
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,500
My successor.
