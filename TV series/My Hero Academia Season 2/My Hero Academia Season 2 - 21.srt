1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,541
Welcome back to our live show.

2
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,125
For our next topic--
is it really necessary

3
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,875
for heroes to dress sexily?

4
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,916
Let's ask our very special
studio guests what they think.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,875
She's the rookie hero
who debuted just this year.

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,416
It's Mt. Lady!

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,583
And she's a pro who's currently
teaching at UA High School;

8
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,875
the incomparable Midnight!

9
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,958
Thank you so much
for joining us!

10
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,625
Please, have a seat.

11
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,416
Let's start with you, Midnight.
When you first debuted,

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,916
your revealing outfit
caused quite a stir.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,416
In fact, it eventually led to

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,333
the "Regulations for Exposed
Skin in Costumes" bill being

15
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,625
taken before the legislature.

16
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,250
You're a hero whose
sexiness changed

17
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,750
the very laws of the country.

18
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,708
Her costume's still pretty racy.

19
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,375
Now I rely on
ultra-thin fabrics.

20
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,416
Because of the nature
of some people's Quirks,

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,625
clothing can restrict
their abilities.

22
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,750
Sexiness isn't just
an aesthetic--

23
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,250
it's sometimes needed
so we can do our jobs well.

24
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,125
Besides, what's more
attractive than a hero

25
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,250
who can get the
job done quickly?

26
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,333
I think you just
like the attention.

27
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,375
What's with you, Lady?
Are you trying to start a fight?

28
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,125
[MT. LADY] Of course not!
I look up to you!

29
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,458
I think you're amazing!

30
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,916
For someone of your age.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,125
You can act like the
blushing ingénue all you want,

32
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,750
but you're not that
young yourself, you know.

33
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,208
All I'm saying is if the
older pros try too hard,

34
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,291
then the rest of us
have to go even further!

35
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,375
[MIDNIGHT]
You little--!

36
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,625
[MT. LADY]
Hey, watch your hands!

37
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,708
[MIDNIGHT] Watch yourself!
That almost hurt!

38
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,666
[MT. LADY]
You're ripping my suit!

39
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,458
Ah! Thank you!

40
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,375
[school bell rings]

41
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,125
[AIZAWA] All right.
That's it for class today.

42
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,375
There's only one week left
before your final exams begin.

43
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,291
I'm sure you're all
studying constantly, right?

44
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't forget to keep training.

45
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,958
The written exam
is only one element.

46
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,041
There's also the practical
portion to worry about.

47
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,166
Good luck.

48
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,500
[BOTH] I've barely even
taken notes this semester!

49
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,500
[KAMINARI] And with the
sports festival and internship,

50
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,625
I didn't have time
to read the textbook.

51
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,916
It's true that we haven't had
very much free time lately.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,500
We'd barely learned anything
when we took our midterms

53
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,833
so they didn't seem
all that hard,

54
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,625
but I'm kinda worried
about these.

55
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,458
We've been through a lot,
and they probably won't pull

56
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,416
any punches when it
comes to testing us.

57
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,791
As someone ranked in the
top ten, I'm not that concerned.

58
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,291
[KAMINARI, ASHIDO] What?!
You were ninth in the midterms?!

59
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,750
Aw, man, and here I thought
you were one of us!

60
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,625
Don't you know weirdo
little creeps like you

61
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,333
are only likable if
they're kind of stupid?!

62
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,333
Who's going to love you now?!

63
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,208
Everyone. Trust me.

64
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,666
[IZUKU] Ashido, Kaminari!
We've still got time to study!

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,333
That way, we'll all get to go
to the training camp together.

66
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,000
Right?

67
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,500
Yes!

68
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,166
As class rep, I have high hopes
that we'll make UA proud.

69
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,250
It's pretty hard to fail
if you just pay attention

70
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,333
in class, isn't it?

71
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,833
Why you gotta cut
me down like that?

72
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,416
Hey, don't worry
about it, you two,

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,541
I can catch you up to speed

74
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,333
on the important
topics, if you want.

75
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,958
[BOTH]
You're the best, Yao-momo!

76
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,916
I'm afraid I won't be
any help when it comes

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,166
to the practical, though.

78
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,625
[TODOROKI]
Hm?

79
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,041
I've been studying, but...
could you help me out, too?

80
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,916
I'm having some
trouble understanding

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,041
quadratic functions.

82
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,416
Really?

83
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,333
Tutor me, please! Classical
Japanese is killin' me!

84
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,416
--[YAOYOROZU] Ah...
--Is there room for one more?

85
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,875
I'm afraid I'm falling
behind a little.

86
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,083
[JIRO, SERO, OJIRO]
Pretty please!

87
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,583
[gasps]

88
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,375
Wonderful!

89
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,833
Yes, let's do it!

90
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,375
[GROUP]
All right!

91
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,458
Okay, then. We can hold a
study session at my residence

92
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,958
over the weekend.

93
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,000
[ASHIDO] Seriously?! I can't
wait to see your fancy digs!

94
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,250
Oh! I must call Mother
and have her prepare

95
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,208
the great hall for us to set up;
it'll be the perfect spot.

96
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,500
[JIRO, KAMINARI]
"Great hall"?

97
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,041
What kind of tea
does everyone like?

98
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,833
I'll have her make
sure we're stocked.

99
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,375
[OJIRO, SERO]
That's overkill.

100
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,416
[YAOYOROZU]
In my family,

101
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,958
we always drink
Harrods or Wedgwood,

102
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,291
so if you have any other
preference, let me know!

103
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,875
When we're finished,
you'll all be model students!

104
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,750
I'll make it my personal duty
to push you forward.

105
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,583
[KAMINARI]
Is she humble bragging?

106
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,458
Or does she not even
realize what she's saying?

107
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,583
[JIRO] She's so excited and
bouncy that I don't even care.

108
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,625
About that tea--I'm not
so sure about the hairy one.

109
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,875
[YAOYOROZU]
No, it's from Harrods.

110
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,833
Sounds like I should
be studying with her.

111
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,166
You think I don't know enough?!

112
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,541
Maybe I should beat
the lessons into your skull!

113
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,666
[KIRISHIMA]
I'm counting on it.

114
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,125
Hah. Everyone's
panicking right now,

115
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,041
but it won't do them any good
to cram this late in the game.

116
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,416
[SHOJI]
Shouldn't you be more concerned?

117
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,166
You didn't do very well
in the midterms.

118
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,458
Are you talking about <i>moi</i> ?
I did just fine, thank you.

119
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,833
[IZUKU] I'm kinda scared
about the practical.

120
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,916
I have no idea
what it's gonna be.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,291
Hard to believe they'd
give us anything too crazy.

122
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,875
The written exam questions will
all be stuff from class so...

123
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,333
...I should at least
be able to do those.

124
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,791
Do you really think
it's going to be that simple?

125
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,083
It's driving me nuts.

126
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,041
I just wanna know
what they'll have us doing.

127
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,000
[HAGAKURE] It's a comprehensive
test of everything

128
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,541
we learned this year.

129
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,916
Yup, and that's about all we
could get Mr. Aizawa to tell us.

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,791
Okay, so then it'll cover combat
training and rescue training.

131
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,375
Oh, and basic training.

132
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,916
We can't just study--we have to
stay in great physical shape--

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,083
[yelps]

134
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,291
[MONOMA]
Oh, sorry.

135
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,458
You're head's so big
that it's hard to miss.

136
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,958
[IZUKU]
You're from Class 1-B.

137
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,250
Um... Monoma, right?
That really hur--

138
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,291
[MONOMA] I heard you guys
stumbled across the Hero Killer.

139
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,708
[gasps]

140
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,125
Just like in the sports
festival, Class 1-A isn't happy

141
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,125
unless they're the
center of attention.

142
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,625
But you do realize you're not
in the spotlight because

143
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,875
people think you're
good heroes, right?

144
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,250
It's just that you keep
getting into so much trouble.

145
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,791
Here's food for thought:

146
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,541
Someday, the rest of us might
get caught up in your mess,

147
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,958
and then we'll all become
unwitting victims as well.

148
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,833
What kind of horrible villains
will you bring down upon us?

149
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,250
What demon--

150
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,333
[MONOMA grunts]

151
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,208
[KENDO]
That's not funny, Monoma.

152
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,166
You heard what happened
to Iida! Chill out!

153
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,125
[TENYA]
Kendo.

154
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,708
I apologize for him.

155
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm pretty sure there's a hole
where his heart should be.

156
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,708
[IZUKU]
I think he's out!

157
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,416
[KENDO]
Mm. So I was listening...

158
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,250
I know you're all worried
about what's going to be

159
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,250
on the big final practical.

160
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,458
I heard it's gonna be
combat against robots,

161
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,666
like the entrance exam.

162
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,083
--[OCHACO] Huh?
--What? Really?

163
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,500
How do you know that?

164
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,708
One of my friends who's
a few grades up filled me in.

165
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,166
I know. Cheating. But oh, well.

166
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,750
[IZUKU]
No, I don't think so.

167
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,458
I'm sure gathering
information ahead of time

168
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,833
is also part of the test.

169
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,666
I definitely should've found
an upperclassman to ask.

170
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,916
Darn it, why didn't
I think about that before?

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,041
What kind of idiot
are you, Kendo?

172
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,791
You just gave away our
whole strategic advantage!

173
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,583
This was our chance
to finally pull ahead

174
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,166
of that class full of idiots.

175
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,083
[grunts]

176
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,416
[KENDO]
They're not the idiots!

177
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,041
[IZUKU] She's like their
class's big sister, huh?

178
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,750
[KAMINARI, ASHIDO]
All right!

179
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,916
This'll be super easy
if it's just robots!

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,375
Such awesome news!

181
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,833
Why do you sound so happy?

182
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,375
You both have a hard time
controlling your Quirks.

183
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,750
Yeah! But I can
let loose with robots!

184
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,916
And melting them'll
be a cinch for me!

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,125
Now you just need Yaoyorozu
to help you study

186
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,208
and you'll be all
set for finals.

187
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,458
[ASHIDO, KAMINARI]
We'll definitely be able

188
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,500
to go to the training camp now!

189
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,166
[ALL MIGHT]
As its holder, you may one day

190
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,083
have to fight against
this great evil yourself.

191
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,000
[IZUKU] In order
to be prepared for that,

192
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,500
I have to make everything
count from now on.

193
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,750
[KATSUKI] It shouldn't matter
if it's robots or actual people.

194
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,458
Why are you morons so excited?

195
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,875
Hey, who are you
calling a moron?!

196
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,208
Shut up! You need to learn
how to control your Quirk!

197
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,875
Ya got it?!

198
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,041
Hey! Deku!

[gasps]

200
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,375
I don't know what's
goin' on with your power,

201
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:07,375
but I saw the way you're using
it now, and I want you to know--

202
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,833
it's seriously pissing me off.

203
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,416
Uh-oh.

204
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,125
He must mean how Deku was flying
around like him the other day.

205
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,375
Oh, yeah, totally.

206
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,250
I won't have another half-assed
win like the festival.

207
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,500
We'll be getting individual
scores in the upcoming finals--

208
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,583
New rankings.

209
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,250
So we'll all know exactly
where we're standing!

210
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,958
I'll show you how
much better I am.

00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,583
And, Todoroki?
I'll kill you, too.

212

It's been a while since
I've seen him that worked up.

213
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,291
Think it's impatience?
Or hatred?

getting worse than I thought.

I didn't know she was this rich!

[YAOYOROZU] I've been
waiting for you, everyone!

Please, come in!

00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,958
I could not feel any more
out of place right now.

221
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,625
[SERO]
Yeah, me, too.

222
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,500
Is something wrong?

No, everything's perfect!

bring the answer sheets to me.

for all your help!

blank at least!

228
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,208
[IZUKU]
Just like that,

229
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,958
our three days of
written exams were over.

230
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,833
Now it was time
for the practical.

231
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,125
Now then. Let's begin
the last test.

232
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,958
Remember, it's possible
to fail this final.

233
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,708
If you wanna go to camp, then
don't make any stupid mistakes.

Uh. Why are all
the teachers here?

235
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,416
[AIZAWA] I expect many of you
have gathered information

236
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,875
and believe you have some idea

237
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,833
of what you'll be
faced with today.

238

We're fightin' those
big ol' metal robots!

[NEZU]
Actually, this year's tests...

241
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,625
...will be completely different,
for various reasons.

242
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,125
[JIRO, OJIRO, SERO]
Principal Nezu!

243
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,625
You're changing things?

244
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,750
The tests now have a new focus.

245
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,833
There will be Hero
work, of course.

246
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,166
But also teamwork and
combat between actual people.

247
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,958
So what does that mean for you?

248
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,333
You students will be
working together in pairs

249
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,208
and your opponents will be one
of our esteemed UA teachers!

250
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,375
Isn't that fabulous?!

00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,916
We're... fighting the teachers?

[AIZAWA] Additionally, your
partners and your opponents

have already been chosen.

254
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,250
They were determined
at my discretion

255
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,250
based on various factors,
including fighting style,

256
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,333
grades, and interpersonal
relationships.

257
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:22,250
First, Yaoyorozu and
Todoroki are a team.

00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,000
Against me.

259
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,875

paired with Bakugo.

We're up against All Might?!

You're going to have
to work together, boys,

266
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,833
if you want to win.

00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,125
[KATSUKI growls]

268
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,458
[ALL MIGHT chuckles]

269
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,625
[NEZU] With the connection
between the Hero Killer Stain

270
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,875
and the League of Villains, it's
possible criminals everywhere

271
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,958
will become much bolder.

272
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,083
[SNIPE] It'd be best if we could
start preparin' for that

273
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,416
before it happens.

274
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,666
As a school, we should be
takin' every precaution.

275
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,708
If fights against villains
are gonna continue

276
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,875
to intensify in the future,
then havin' the kids train

277
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,791
against robots
ain't practical.

278
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,375
Originally, we used 'em
to avoid complaints about

279
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,875
people gettin' injured
in the entrance exams,

280
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,333
but they're just not
challengin' enough.

281
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,333
[AIZAWA]
We can ignore the complaints.

282
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,333
Let people say
whatever they want.

283
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,416
This sounds like it
could be problematic.

284
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,208
I understand why you
want to change the exam,

285
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,916
but having students fight us?

286
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,041
Even if they're in teams of two,
is that a good idea?

287
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,416
[THIRTEEN]
Yeah. I think it's a bit unfair.

288
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,583
If we win too easily,
we won't be able to give them

289
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,791
actual grades, yo.

290
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,166
[SNIPE] Of course, we could
take that into consideration

291
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,375
and give the students
an advantage.

292
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,333
Principal, what are
you thinking?

293
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,041
I believe I agree.

294
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,458
We need to change the
practical exam to reflect

295
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,958
the current times.

296
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,875
How do we ensure the
students aren't put in

297
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,333
life-threatening situations?
The answer is simple.

298
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,125
We must push them.

299
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,166
We make sure that they're
as strong as possible.

300
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,291
[MIDNIGHT]
That makes sense.

301
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,708
[THIRTEEN]
I agree.

302
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,291
[AIZAWA] Right, then let's
talk about the teams.

303
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:18,541
First, Todoroki. He's doing
quite well, generally speaking,

304
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,833
but relies too much
on brute force.

305
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,791
[AIZAWA] And Yaoyorozu
is an all-arounder,

306
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,166
but lacks the ability to make
spur-of-the-moment decisions

307
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,791
and apply them.

308
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,833
Therefore, I'll erase their
Quirks and take advantage

309
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,083
of their weaknesses.

310
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,625
[TEACHERS]
Sounds good.

311
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,166
[AIZAWA]
Next, for Midoriya and Bakugo,

312
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,791
I'm leaving them
to you, All Might.

313
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,041
[ALL MIGHT grunts]

314
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,750
In this case, I didn't
pair the two of them up

315
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:46,250
based on ability or class work.
I went with relationships.

316
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,958
I know you've got a
soft spot for Midoriya.

317
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,875
Please ensure that
they learn something.

318
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,166
[ALL MIGHT] You're paying
close attention, huh, Aizawa?

319
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,791
And now, let's announce
the teams and the teachers

320
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,541
they'll be fighting in order!

321
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,916
To complete the exam,
you'll have 30 minutes.

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,791
In order to win, your objective
is to put these handcuffs

323
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,083
on your teacher.

324
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,166
Or you can win if one of you
manages to escape

325
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,916
from the combat stage.

326
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,958
So we've either got to capture
the teacher or run away.

327
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,916
It's basically like
the combat training.

328
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,458
Yeah, but is it really
okay to just jet?

329
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,916
Yup.

330
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,583
It's gonna be much different
than that combat training

331
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,083
y'all went through earlier.

332
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:44,333
After all, you're up against
people way better than you!

333
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,291
"Better"? Really?

334
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,166
Wait, aren't you
just the announcer?

335
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,375
Hey, watch your mouth,
girl--have some respect!

336
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,583
[THIRTEEN] This time,
your exam will be very similar

337
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,958
to a real battle.

338
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,916
As strange as it is,
please think of us as villains.

339
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,333
[SNIPE] Assumin' you
come across your enemy.

340
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,958
If you think you can win
against them, then fight.

341
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,208
However...

342
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,250
[AIZAWA] ...in instances
where you're outmatched,

343
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,791
it would be smarter to
run away and find help.

344
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,500
Todoroki. Iida. Midoriya.

345
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sure the three
of you understand.

346
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,583
[NATIVE]
Idiots!

347
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,375
The Hero Killer is only after me
and that kid in the white armor!

348
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,833
Stop fighting back--
just get out of here!

349
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,041
[TENYA] I won't make
that mistake again.

350
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:29,125
I will pass this test and
prove that I'm a hero!

351
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,916
So we fight to win...
or run to win.

352
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,125
That's right!

353
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,416
It's a test of your
decision-making skills.

354
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
But with these rules,
you're probably thinking

355
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,666
your only real
choice is to flee.

356
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,875
That's why the support
course made these

357
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,833
super-clever accessories for us.

358
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:48,500
[PRESENT MIC] Behold!
Ultra-compressed weights!

359
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,958
[ALL MIGHT] These babies will
add about half our body weight

360
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,416
to our physiques.

361
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,291
It's not much, but they
will eat up our stamina

362
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,166
and make it harder
for us to move around.

363
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,666
[grunts] Oh, shoot... These
are heavier than I thought.

364
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,666
We had a contest to come up
with these designs,

365
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,666
and Young Hatsume
ended up winning it.

366
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,625
Wow, good for Hatsume!

367
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,583
You think we need a handicap
to win against you?

368
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,833
Well think again.

369
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,666
[ALL MIGHT laughs]

370
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,333
This'll be fun.

371
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,708
[AIZAWA]
Let's begin.

372
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,375
The teams will take the
practical exam in the order

373
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,000
you were called. We have
a stage prepared for you.

374
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,041
Sato, Kirishima. You're up.

375
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,583
[BOTH]
Yes, sir!

376
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,791
Those waiting their turn to
fight can either watch the exams

377
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,125
or try to strategize together
as a team. It's your choice.

378
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,625
That's all.

379
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,083
[TENYA]
Ojiro.

380
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,833
I'd like to discuss how we
might be able to coordinate

381
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,083
the use of our Quirks.

382
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,208
Great.

383
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,500
Tokoyami? Let's go
come up with a plan.

384
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,083
Agreed.

385
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,791
We've got to figure out a way to
destroy Ms. Midnight's costume!

[SERO]
You are such a little scumbag.

Well, looks like I have

388
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,750
my work cut out for me today.

--[door hisses open]

You're watching, too? Hi.

391
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,375
Yeah. It's not like
we get many chances

392
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,708
to watch students in combat
with teachers, right?

393
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,291
And besides...

394
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,250
...I don't think Kacchan really
wants to talk strategy with me.

00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,250
[OCHACO]
I can see that.

And, uh, my partner is a
little preoccupied with himself.

You don't say...

398

[OCHACO] That's why I thought
I'd try and get inspiration

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,625
from everyone else's battles.

400

[IZUKU]
Smart.

401

[IZUKU] I have to pass this
test, no matter what it takes.

Go.

405

[KIRISHIMA]
So what do ya think?

406
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,583
We'll definitely get a
higher score for capturing

407
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,208
instead of running, you agree?

408
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,458
Yeah, that'd make sense.

409
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,291
Mr. Cementoss can't
move around very fast.

410
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,666
Let's break through
from the front

411
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,083
and shoot for a high score!

[PRESENT MIC] Rikido Sato.
His Quirk: Sugar Rush!

414
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,250
For every ten grams of sugar,

415
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,041
he's five times as strong
for three minutes.

416
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,041
However, the more sugar
he uses for power,

417
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,583
the more his cognitive
functions suffer.

418
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,708
So you've decided on
a direct frontal assault.

[IZUKU]
Their Quirks are amazing,

432
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,250
but there's a limit to
how long they can use them.

They won't last forever.

I don't think Mr. Cementoss
has that kind of limit, though.

The more time that passes by,

the more of a

00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,375
That fast?

466
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,500
Kirishima went down?

467
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,041
[RECOVERY GIRL]
It's only the first match

468
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,833
and I'm already needed.

469
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,208
[OCHACO]
No way... It was that one-sided?

470
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,083
Their Quirks were
too ineffective against his.

471
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,333
[IZUKU]
Crap...

472
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,291
Looks like this exam
is going to be a lot harder

473
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,833
than I thought it would be.

474
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:18,166
On top of that, we're up
against the number-one hero.

475
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,875
[TOKOYAMI]
I see.

476
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,666
They're starting us in
the middle of the stage.

477
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,791
[TSUYU] In order to escape,
we have to pass through

478
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,000
the designated gate, right?

479
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,541
Which means the teacher's
probably there waiting for us.

480
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,125
[buzzer blares]

481
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,291
[ANNOUNCER A]
Team Asui and Tokoyami.

482
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,208
Practical Exam. Ready? Go!

483
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,333
[ECTOPLASM]
Maybe you didn't understand,

484
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,333
but we teachers are
trying to crush you

485
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,916
with everything we've got.
No holding back.

486
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,583
--[TOKOYAMI gasps]
--[TSUYU] Ribbit!

487
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,458
[ECTOPLASM] Steel your nerves
and show me your resolve.

488
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,250
[IZUKU]
Now, the preview!

489
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,208
Asui and Tokoyami
are up against Ectoplasm!

490
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:37,291
And Todoroki and Yaoyorozu have
to fight against... Mr. Aizawa?

491
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,375
[AOYAMA] A-ha! This match
is going to end up

492
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,750
being <i>très tragique</i> .

493
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,500
Now hurry up so I can
finally take the stage.

494
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,083
[IZUKU] Aoyama, there's still
Iida and Ojiro's exam...

495
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,625
[AOYAMA] Like that'll last
more than a minute.

496
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,208
[IZUKU]
Why are you sparkling?

497
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,833
[AOYAMA]
Next time, "Yaoyorozu Rising."

498
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,958
I'm going to say something
shocking in the last scene,

499
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:54,958
so don't miss it.

500
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:55,875
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

501
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,458
[AOYAMA]
Plus Ultra!

502
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:58,458
[IZUKU groans]
