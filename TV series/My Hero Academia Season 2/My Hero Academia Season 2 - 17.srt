1
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,291
Say whatever you
want to about me!

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:14,708
You're still just a criminal
who hurt my brother!

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:19,125
[STAIN sighs] And that's
why you'll die tonight.

4
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,125
[TENYA grunts]

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,333
[TENYA]
My body... won't move!

6
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,666
[STAIN]
Goodbye, child.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,250
May your death bring
about a better world.

8
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,791
I won't forgive you!

9
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,708
I'm going to kill you!

10
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,500
[IZUKU]
Smash!

11
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,958
Don't worry, Iida.
I'm gonna save you.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,708
I was almost too late
to stop this guy.

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,750
Midoriya? Todoroki?

14
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,958
[TODOROKI]
We can protect them!

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,041
[TENYA] Just stop it!
Why are you doing this?

16
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,625
His fight is with me!

17
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,708
[IZUKU yelps]

18
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,291
[TENYA]
I inherited my brother's name.

19
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,333
I'm the one that
should stop him.

20
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,250
The Hero Killer is mine!

21
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,708
I'm sorry, Todoroki.

22
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,666
[TENYA]
You have to run.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,458
I can't... watch this.

24
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,208
You wanna make
your brother proud?!

25
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,125
[gasps]

26
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,666
[TENYA]
Are the two of you familiar

27
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,458
with the Turbo Hero, Ingenium?

28
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,791
I know all about him!

29
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,416
He's a super-popular pro
with 65 sidekicks

30
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,000
working alongside him
at his Tokyo agency!

31
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,541
He's my elder brother!

32
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,375
Ingenium is an
unmatched commander

33
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,750
who honors the hero code.

34
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,916
As the second
oldest Iida son,

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,083
I strive to be just like him.

36
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,625
[TODOROKI]
Iida...

37
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,541
[TODOROKI]
Stand up and be Ingenium!

38
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,791
[STAIN growls]

39
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,666
Become the hero
he wanted you to be!

40
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,708
[TENYA] I am Ingenium,
and I will defeat you.

41
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,708
That, I promise!

42
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,541
Can I call myself a hero?

43
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:41,208
My friends are protecting me.
They're bleeding for me.

44
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,458
[STAIN] Shouldn't you be
worried about saving that guy?

45
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,916
[TENYA]
Stain The Hero Killer.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,291
I took my brother's name

47
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,625
so that I could teach
this villain a lesson.

48
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,208
But I was so
consumed with revenge,

49
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,791
that I forgot about
what really mattered.

50
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,166
I was too focused on myself
to help anyone else.

51
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,750
[TENSEI]
You wanna be a hero, too, Tenya?

52
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,125
Yes! Like you! A cool one!

53
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,083
With robot arms?

54
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,583
There's something I wanted
to ask you, big brother.

55
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,125
What drives you?
Why did you choose

56
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,625
to become a pro hero
in the first place?

57
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,958
[TENSEI]
Hm.

58
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,916
Well, our grandfather and
parents were all heroes.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,166
So everyone kind of expected
I would be one, too.

60
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,708
Staying in the family
business and all that.

61
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,416
Plus, it made sense to me.

62
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,000
I think the coolest
people in the world

63
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,666
are those who do
things for others.

64
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,625
I wanted to be the kind of guy
who helps people in trouble.

65
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,166
Then why not work as a
police officer or something?

66
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,666
Aren't you listening to me?

67
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,375
Think of what I'm saying.

68
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,833
[TENSEI] You take things at
face value a little too much.

69
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,708
But you're a hard
worker, and definitely

70
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,916
smarter and more athletic
than me back when I was a kid.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,958
Wait a second.
That's my secret!

72
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,208
Knowing you look up
to me makes me better.

73
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,166
I have to be sure
I make you proud.

74
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,041
[laughs]

75
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,541
[STAIN] Both of you are
nothing but fakes.

76
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:13,000
[TENYA whimpering]

77
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,416
[TENYA] You spoke
the truth, Hero Killer.

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,583
Watch your right!

79
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,708
[TENYA]
These two are different from me.

80
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,666
[TENYA]
I'm immature.

81
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,500
I can't hold a candle to them.

82
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,708
But still...

83
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,458
[STAIN]
Ice and fire.

84
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,250
[TODOROKI] Just try and
dodge this, villain!

85
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,833
[STAIN]
Hasn't anyone ever told you

86
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,791
you rely on your Quirk too much?

87
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,041
Makes you a careless fighter.

88
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,875
[TODOROKI]
He's a monster.

89
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,500
Todoroki!

90
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,041
[TENYA]
If I don't stand up right now,

91
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,541
I'll never be able
to be as good as them.

92
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:59,000
[TENYA] I'll never live up
to my brother's name!

93
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,166
[STAIN]
Damn it.

94
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,666
My Quirk timed out.

95
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,458
[TENYA]
Recipro burst!

96
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,375
[STAIN]
He's fast!

97
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,875
Iida!

98
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,208
You're free, too?

99
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,500
Guess his Quirk isn't as
great as I thought it was.

100
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,916
[TENYA]
Todoroki... Midoriya...

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,666
This has nothing to do with you.

102
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,208
I apologize.

103
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,958
Come on. Not this again.

104
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,875
I'm okay.

105
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,541
And I won't let
the two of you shed

106
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,500
any more blood for me!

107
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,833
[STAIN] It's no use trying
to pretend you're a hero now.

108
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,916
A person's true nature doesn't
change in just a few minutes.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,666
You'll never be
anything but a fraud

110
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,125
who prioritizes his own desires.

111
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,375
You're the sickness
that's infected society

112
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,375
and ruined the name "hero."

113
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,291
Someone must teach you a lesson.

114
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,750
You're a fundamentalist lunatic.

115
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,458
Iida, don't listen to
this murderer's nonsense.

116
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,666
[TENYA]
No. He's completely correct.

117
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,625
I have no right to call
myself a hero... at all.

118
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,791
[gasps]

119
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,208
[TENYA]
Even so...

120
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,125
There's no way I can back down.

121
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:21,958
If I give up now, then the
name "Ingenium" will die!

122
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,250
Pathetic.

123
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,666
[TENYA grunts]

124
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,291
[NATIVE]
Idiots!

125
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,125
The hero killer is only after me
and that kid in the white armor.

126
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,458
Stop fighting back--
just get out of here!

127
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,375
I don't think he'd let me
run even if I wanted to.

128
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,708
Something clearly changed
in him just now.

129
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,041
He seems rattled.

130
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,916
[TODOROKI grunts]

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,708
[TODOROKI] His Quirk alone
isn't especially powerful.

132
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,833
The issue of blood type
makes it unpredictable

133
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,583
and it doesn't last long.

134
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,666
Plus, he has to get in close
if he wants to use it.

135
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,208
It must be difficult
for him to take on

136
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,291
multiple opponents at once.

137
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,208
[TODOROKI] He's desperate,
trying to kill Iida

138
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,250
and this other hero
before the pros show up.

139
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,583
Such tenacity.

140
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,416
[STAIN growls]

141
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,791
[TENYA]
Crap. My engines are shot.

142
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,416
Did I break the radiator
with that kick?

143
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,708
[gasps] Hey, Todoroki.

144
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,666
Can you regulate
your temperatures?

145
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,958
Not well with my left,

146
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:18,916
but, yes, I can.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,916
You gotta freeze my leg for me,

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,125
without plugging the exhaust!

149
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,708
[STAIN]
You're in the way.

150

[TENYA grunts]

151
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,833
No, Iida!

152
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,541
Why won't you stay down?

I can move!

156
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,750
[IZUKU] My leg's no good.
But... that's okay.

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,583

It's done.

Thank you, Todoroki.

00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,375
Those injuries look bad.

320
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,208
I'll call an
ambulance right away.

321
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,416
[HERO 30D gasps]
Hey, look.

322
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,041
[gasps] Is that...
the Hero Killer?

323
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,208
[GRAN TORINO]
What?

324
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,875
[HERO 30B]
I'll get the police on the line.

325
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,791
[HERO 30D]
Can you walk?

326
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,416
[IZUKU] If you prop me up,
then I think so.

327
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,625
[HERO 30D]
Okay, and you?

328
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,291
[TODOROKI]
Only minor injuries.

329
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,708
But, Iida...

330
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,166
[HERO 30C]
You're bleeding badly.

331
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,166
The ambulance will be
here soon, but until then...

332
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,625
[TENYA]
You guys...

333
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,500
You were both hurt
because of me.

334
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,291
I'm truly sorry.

335
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,416
I was just so angry.

336
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,666
I couldn't see anything else.

337
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,333
I'm sorry, too, Iida.

338
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,041
You were going through
so much by yourself.

339
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,333
But I couldn't tell
anything was wrong.

340
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,208
Even though I'm your friend.

341
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,666
[whimpers]

342
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,875
Hey, pull yourself together.

343
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,666
You're the class rep.

344
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,916
[TENYA sniffs]
Right.

345
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,791
[IZUKU]
All things considered,

346
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,250
our fight against
the Hero Killer

347
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,708
probably only took
about ten minutes.

348
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,541
But for the three of us,

349
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,166
it felt like we were
in that alley forever.

350
00:17:58,916 --> 00:17:59,791
Get down!

--[TODOROKI, TENYA] Midoriya!

354
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,208
It's bleeding.

355
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,250
It must be trying to escape!

356
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,208
[GRAN TORINO]
Shoot. If he takes him too high,

357
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,708
I won't be able to reach
him with my Quirk.

358
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,208
[yelps]

359
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:29,208
[STAIN] The word "hero" has lost
all meaning in this society.

360
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,166
The world is overrun by fakes
and criminals like you

361
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,375
who chase pretty dreams.

362
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,000

You must all be purged.

[STAIN]
That idiot's making a move.

366
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,750
And he's so noisy.

367
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,166
I'll dispose of him later.

Everything that I do...

00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,375
...is to create
a stronger society.

372
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,291
[SHIGARAKI]
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell?

373
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,583
This is no fair!

374
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,291
Why'd he have to
go and kill that Nomu?

375
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,000
And why is that brat here?

376
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,625
I'm so mad, I don't
even know what to say.

This is a mess!

Why do things never go
the way I want them to?

Did he just save that kid?

380
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,791
[HERO 30D]
He took him hostage, idiot.

He killed that guy
with no hesitation.

382

Everyone be on your guard,
we've got a fight on our hands.

[ENDEAVOR] Why are you
all standing like fools?

384
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,500
The villain must have
flown this way, right?

[HERO 30C]
You took care of the rest?

Mostly, things got a
little rough at the end.

Hold on. Don't tell
me that man is--

with the blood of hypocrites.

and stop me, you fakes!

There is only one man
I'll let kill me.

[IZUKU] It wasn't until later
that I heard what happened.

411
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,375
A Quirk didn't stop
the Hero Killer.

412
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,208
One of his broken ribs
pierced his lung.

413
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,125
He hadn't managed
to lick anyone's blood.

414
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:50,583
But still, in that moment,
none of us could

415
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,375
bring ourselves to
stand against him.

416
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,500
Only the Hero Killer
had any fight left.
