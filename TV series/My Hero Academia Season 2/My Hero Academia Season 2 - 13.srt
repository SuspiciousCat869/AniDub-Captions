1
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,625
[IZUKU] In the days after
the sports festival ended,

2
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,541
we recovered from our injuries,

3
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,166
and then, our normal classes
started right back up again.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,708
Well, some things
were different.

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,083
[PASSENGER 26A whispers]
Hey, you. Excuse me.

6
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,708
You're Midoriya from Class 1-A!

7
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,583
Great job in the
sports festival.

8
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,333
I rooted for you!

9
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,583
[gasps]

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,750
[PASSENGER 26B] You were
in the top eight, right?

11
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,625
That's so impressive!

12
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,916
--[PASSENGERS murmuring]
--[IZUKU] Uh... Uh!

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,166
[PASSENGER 26E]
Yeah, I can tell you really

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,791
wanna be a pro one day!

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,833
[PASSENGERS]
Keep trying for it, hero!

16
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,875
I will! Thanks!

17
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,625
[IZUKU sighs]
I feel like I'm barely awake.

18
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,041
[TENYA]
Good morning, Midoriya!

19
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,875
Ah-- Whoa, Iida?

20
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,833
You really went all out
with the rain gear.

21
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,291
Why on earth are you
walking so slowly?

22
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,166
You'll be late.

23
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,500
Late? But...

24
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,250
There's still five minutes
until the first bell.

25
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,750
UA students should
always arrive

26
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,625
ten minutes early,
don't you think?

27
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,166
Uh...

28
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,583
So, Iida. Um...

29
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,625
[TENYA] If it's about my
brother, don't be concerned.

30
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,750
I'm sorry if I made you worry.
Everything'll be fine.

31
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,833
[ASHIDO] It's so weird that
people recognize us from TV.

32
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,083
Everyone wanted to talk
to me on my way here.

33
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,500
Yeah, me, too!

34
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,583
[HAGAKURE] People on the
street were staring at me!

35
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,083
It was kind of embarrassing.

36
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,083
Sure, but isn't that
pretty normal for you?

37
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,333
You won't believe
what a bunch of

38
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,833
elementary school
brats yelled at me.

39
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,083
[TSUYU]
"Nice try?"

40
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,875
[groans]

41
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,625
All it took was
one sports festival

42
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,625
and suddenly we're
like celebrities.

43
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,666
[MINETA]
This school really is amazing.

44
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,750
Morning.

45
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,041
[STUDENTS]
Good morning, Mr. Aizawa!

46
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,291
Ribbit?

47
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,708
Mr. Aizawa, you don't
have bandages anymore.

48
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,958
That's good news.

49
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,583
The old lady went
a little overboard

50
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,958
in her treatment. Anyway.

51
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,750
We have a big class today
on Hero Informatics.

52
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,875
[STUDENTS]
Oh, no!

53
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,083
[KAMINARI]
Informatics?

54
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,375
Please don't tell me
it's a pop quiz.

55
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,583
[KIRISHIMA] Crap, I bet
it's about hero laws.

56
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,833
I'm so bad at stuff like that.

57
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,458
You need codenames.

58
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,791
Time to pick your
hero identities.

59
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,000
[STUDENTS] This is gonna
be totally awesome!

60
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,000
[AIZAWA growls]

61
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,625
[STUDENTS]
Shh.

62
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,083
[AIZAWA] This is related
to the pro hero draft picks

63
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,750
that I mentioned the last time
we were in class together.

64
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,625
Normally, students don't have
to worry about the draft yet.

65
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,583
Not until their second
or third year actually,

66
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,291
but your class is different.

67
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,541
In fact,

68
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,625
by extending offers to
first-years like you,

69
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,458
pros are essentially
investing in your potential.

70
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,041
Any offers can be rescinded
if their interest in you

71
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,041
dies down before
graduation, though.

72
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,958
Stupid, selfish adults.

73
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,416
[HAGAKURE] So, what you're
saying is, we'll still

74
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,958
have to prove ourselves
after we've gotten recruited.

75
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,791
Correct. Now.

76
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,708
Here are the totals for
those of you who got offers.

77
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,125
In past years, it's
been more spread out.

78
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,250
But there's a pretty
big gap this time.

79
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,375
Gah! That's no fair.

80
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,291
What about the real star? Moi?

81
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,791
Todoroki got the most,
ahead of Bakugo?

82
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,833
Yeah, it's the opposite

83
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,291
of how they placed
in the festival.

84
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,000
They probably weren't
excited about working

85
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,000
with the guy who had to be
chained up at the end.

86
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,583
If I scared a pro,
they're just weak!

87
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,791
[sighs]

88
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,083
That's amazing.
You must be proud.

89
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,500
These offers are probably
because of my father.

90
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,833
[gasps] People want us!

91
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,250
[giggles]

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,166
Midoriya. You got none!

93
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,833
I bet everyone was
really grossed out

94
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,041
by the crazy way
you were fighting.

95
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,125
Despite these results,

96
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,166
you'll all be interning
with pros. Got it?

97
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,291
Even those of you who
didn't get any offers.

98
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,958
Oh, so, we're all interning?

99
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,458
[AIZAWA]
Yes.

100
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,750
You already got to experience
combat with real villains

101
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,958
during the attack
on the USJ facility.

102
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,750
But it'll still be helpful
to see pros at work.

103
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,750
Up close and personal,
in the field. Firsthand.

104
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,625
And for that,
we need hero names!

105
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,375
Things are suddenly
getting a lot more fun!

106
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,833
[AIZAWA] These hero names
will likely be temporary,

107
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,000
but take them seriously or...

108
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,208
[MIDNIGHT] ...you'll have
hell to pay later!

109
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,041
[ALL gasp]

110
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,416
[MIDNIGHT]
What you pick today could be

111
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,250
your codename for life.

112
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,333
You better be careful,
or you'll be stuck

113
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,583
with something utterly indecent.

114
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,416
[STUDENTS]
It's Midnight!

115
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah. She's got a good point.

116
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,458
Midnight is going to have final
approval over your names.

117
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,458
It's not my forte.

118
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,875
Hm? So you haven't decided
on a codename yet?

119
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,583
It doesn't matter what I choose.

120
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,041
I don't wanna be in
the spotlight anyway.

121
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,958
Bro. I got it!

122
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,125
How about Eraser Head?!

123
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,541
Sure, whatever.

124
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,166
The name you give
yourself is important.

125
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,916
It helps reinforce your image
and shows what kind of hero

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,416
you wanna be in the future.

127
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,958
A codename tells people
exactly what you represent.

128
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,750
Take "All Might" for example.

129
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,125
[IZUKU]
All Might...

130
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,458
Ah.

131
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,291
[IZUKU]
My hero name...

132
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,625
I need something that
embodies the kind of hero

133
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,458
I wanna be one day.

134
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,958
[MIDNIGHT]
Now, students, who among you

135
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,208
is ready to share?

136
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,083
[KIRISHIMA]
We're presenting these?

137
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,125
[SERO] Oh, great! Who's got
the balls to go first?

138
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,166
Hold your breath.

139
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,291
The Shining Hero.

140
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,625
My name is "I can not
stop twinkling!"

141
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,958
Mon amis. You can't
deny my sparkle.

142
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,583
[STUDENTS]
Come on!

143
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,958
It'll be better this way.

144
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,333
Take out the "I" and shorten
the "cannot" to "can't."

145
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,500
It's stunning, mademoiselle.

146
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,833
[STUDENTS]
She likes it?

147
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,750
Also, you're not really
French, are you?

148
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,750
That's just an act.

149
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,208
[ASHIDO]
Okie dokie, lemme go next!

150
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,916
My code name: Alien Queen!

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,250
[MIDNIGHT]
Hold on.

152
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,250
Like that horrible monster
with the acidic blood?

153
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,750
I don't think so.

154
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:49,833
[ASHIDO]
Dang it.

155
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,041
[STUDENTS]
That one wasn't okay?

156
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,958
Since the first two
were so weird,

157
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,333
I feel like I
have to come up with

158
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,458
something really clever now.

159
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,625
[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

160
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,833
I think I've got one.
Okay if I go next?

161
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,583
Come on up!

162
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,875
I've had this name in mind
since grade school.

163
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,750
Rainy Season Hero: Froppy!

164
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,041
That's delightful!

165
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,750
It makes you sound approachable.

166
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:15,083
What a great example of
a name everyone will love!

167
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,291
[STUDENTS chanting]
Froppy! Froppy! Froppy! Froppy!

168
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,416
[STUDENTS] Thanks, Froppy!
Finally, a normal one!

169
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,833
I've got mine, too.
The Sturdy Hero.

170
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,291
My name is Red Riot!

171
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,833
[MIDNIGHT]
"Red Riot"? Interesting.

172
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,958
You're paying homage
to the Chivalrous Hero,

173
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,416
Crimson Riot, yes?

174
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,166
That's right. He may be
kind of old school,

175
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,166
but someday, I wanna
be just like he was.

176
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,125
Crimson is my idol.

177
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,458
[MIDNIGHT]
Hm. If you're bearing the name

178
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,916
of someone you admire,

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,083
you have that much
more to live up to.

180
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,083
I accept the challenge.

181
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,458
[IZUKU]
Wow, that's so cool.

182
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,541
Before I met All Might,

183
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,125
I had a couple of
names picked out.

184
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,083
Ah. You want me
to help you pick out

185
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,166
your hero name?

186
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,208
[IZUKU]
Yeah!

187
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,666
I can't decide which
one I like most!

188
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,958
Let's see here.

189
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,333
There's "Mighty All Man"
and "Mighty Boy."

190
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,750
Oh, "All Might, Junior"?

191
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,291
That's me!

192
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,458
"Mighty Man" or
"Captain All Might."

193
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,250
Ooh I like "Super All Might"!

194
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,875
Super!

195
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,125
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Super!

196
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,458
[IZUKU] I loved coming up
with all those names.

197
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,458
They never failed to
put a smile on my face

198
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,333
back in those days.

199
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,291
But...

200
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,708
Now that I've been
given his power

201
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,458
and I'm training under him,

202
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,625
I see just how far
I still have to go.

203
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,916
There's no way
I can choose a name

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,458
that riffs off of his yet.

205
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,750
Man.

206
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,958
I still haven't been able
to think of anything

207
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,375
that's cool enough.

208
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,875
Hey, I've got one.

209
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,875
How does "Jamming-yay"
sound to you?

210
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,708
Ha! Oh, it's like "Hemingway,"

211
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,666
who wrote <i>A Farewell</i>
<i>to Arms</i> , right?

212
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,041
Real clever. I like it.

213
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,125
[JIRO]
No.

214
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,833
It's because even though
you're powerful,

215
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,500
you always...

216
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,625
Yay.

217
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,041
[JIRO]
...jam your brain.

218
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,416
Oh, come on, Jiro.
Quit messing with me!

219
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,291
The Hearing Hero.
I'm Earphone Jack.

220
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,166
Now that's a good one!

221
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,291
The Tentacle Hero, Tentacole.

222
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,166
Oh, I like what you're
doing with that.

223
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,166
A nice portmanteau.

224
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,583
The Taping Hero, Cellophane!

225
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,041
That's on the nose. Good work!

226
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,958
Martial Arts Hero: Tailman.

227
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,333
No surprise with
that one, I guess!

228
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,208
I'm the Sweets Hero, Sugarman!

229
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,458
Perfect!

230
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,583
Pinky!

231
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,791
Make those looks
work for you, girl!

232
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,708
[KAMINARI]
Stun Gun Hero: I am Chargebolt.

233
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,000
Electric, doncha think?

234
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,833
Makes me all tingly!

235
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,625
[HAGAKURE] The Stealth
Hero: Invisible Girl!

236
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,500
[MIDNIGHT]
That really suits you!

237
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,416
Now come on, who's
gonna step up next?

238
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,916
I hope that I can
live up to this name.

239
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,041
The Everything Hero: I'm Creati!

240
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,541
Creative!

241
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,666
Shoto.

242
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,916
Just your name? Is that it?

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,541
Uh-huh.

244
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,708
Jet-Black Hero: Tsukuyomi.

245

Ah, God of the night!

Fresh-Picked Hero: Grape Juice!

[MIDNIGHT]
Very kitschy!

248
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,250
Yep. All about it!

249
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,958
King Explosion Murder.

250

I'm gonna say that one's
a little too violent.

Huh, whaddaya mean?!

Why don't you be Explosion Boy?

[OCHACO]
Okay. My turn.

Whew!

259

[MIDNIGHT] To be honest,
choosing names is going faster

260
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,250
than I thought it would.

261
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,958
All we have left
is young Bakugo,

262

who needs to rethink
his, and Iida.

263

Oh, yes, and Midoriya, too.

Tenya.

[INGENIUM]
I wasn't sure if I wanted

266
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:47,458
to say anything yesterday.

00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,458
But, I... I can't feel my legs.

268
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,500
They're useless.

What? No way!

00:11:55,416 --> 00:12:00,500
Yeah. I think the hero
Ingenium is finished.

At least for me.

[TENYA]
No!

You still have so many people
to help and inspire, brother.

274

This can't be true.

[INGENIUM]
I'm sorry. I'm afraid it is.

00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,833
That's why...

277
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,791
I want you to take the name.

278
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,250
Will you do that? For me, Tenya.

279
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,625
[TENYA]
No. I'm still...

280
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,041
[MIDNIGHT] You're using
your real name, too?

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,625
[MIDNIGHT]
Well, Midoriya, are you ready?

282
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,416
Oh. Yes!

283
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,041
[IZUKU]
This is it. It has to be.

00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,000
[STUDENTS gasp]

285
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,750
Really, Midoriya?

286
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,125
You sure about that?

287
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,166
Yeah, man, remember,
that could be your name forever.

288
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,708
Right. I used to hate it.

289
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:00,083
But, then, something
changed. I guess...

290
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,833
Someone taught me that it could
have a different meaning.

291
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,625
And that had a huge
impact on how I felt.

292
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,458
So, now I really like it.

293

You can call me Deku,

but I'm not helpless anymore!

295

From now on, Deku is
the name of a hero!

Deku. That has
to be my codename!

[CEMENTOSS]
Huh.

That's basically the same thing.

[AIZAWA] Now that everyone's
decided on their hero names,

They'll last for one week.

As for who you'll
be working with.

00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,916
Those of you who were
on the board will choose

You have a lot to think about.

There are around 40

who've agreed to take on

a different specialty

that its heroes focus on.

Keep that in mind.

a place that focuses on

321
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,666
rescuing people, not fighting
villains. Understand?

322
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,666
Think carefully
before you decide.

323
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,125
--[STUDENTS] Yes, sir!
--[school bell rings]

324
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,250
I want to fight crime
and bad guys in a big city.

325
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,875
I just hope I can
intern someplace

326
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,333
where there's a lot of
flooding. Or maybe a lake.

327
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,958
[AIZAWA] Turn in your
choices before the weekend.

328
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,708
[SERO]
We've only got two days?

329
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,916
[AIZAWA]
Yeah, so you should start now.

330
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,416
You're dismissed.

331
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,458
[gasps]

332
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,208
[ASHIDO]
So, guys,

333
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,416
have you decided what
pro agency you wanna go for?

334
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,416
Mt. Lady's my top choice!

335
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,458
Mineta.

336
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,541
Are you thinking
something perverted?

337
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,708
Possibly...

338
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,333
You made it pretty far
in the tournament.

339
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,916
It's weird you didn't
get any offers.

340
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,208
I know.

341
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,041
Hey, Deku, who's on your list?

342
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,750
There are only 40
heroes who'll take us,

343
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,416
so after looking up their
specialties and splitting them

344
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,791
into groups, I can
start narrowing...

345
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:21,916
[OJIRO, MINETA, OCHACO, ASHIDO]
There he goes again.

346
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,375
Huh? Oh. Sorry,
what'd you guys say?

347
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,208
You're really thinking hard
about this, aren't you?

348
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,333
It'll all work out.

349
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,583
I've settled on my pick.

350
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,708
Already?

351
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:31,916
What agency?

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,083
The one that the Battle
Hero, Gunhead, runs.

353
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,166
[IZUKU] Huh? Gunhead's
a big brawler, though.

354
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,875
Are you sure that's where
you wanna intern, Uraraka?

355
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,750
Yup! He sent me an offer.

356
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,958
Whoa, really?

357
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,500
But, I thought you were
trying to be a hero

358
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,500
kinda like Thirteen, more
into rescuing than fighting.

359
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,666
Ultimately, that's the plan.

360
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,875
But I've been thinking
ever since the festival--

361
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,708
Well, at least since I
faced off against Bakugo.

362
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,083
The stronger I am, the more
possibilities I'll have.

363
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,000
Plus, learning from
a battle hero will give me

364
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,083
a different perspective. Right?

365
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,833
Yeah, totally.

366
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,291
More importantly,
there's something

367
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,333
I've been meaning
to ask you all day.

368
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,833
Why are you trembling?

369
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,916
Oh. This? It's exercise.

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,291
[OCHACO]
Exercise?

371
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,125
Were you doing that
during the whole class?

372
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,375
There's no way!

373
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,375
That's such an
old-fashioned way to train.

374
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,791
A smart one, though.

375
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,125
The isometric muscle contraction
that's needed to hold

376
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,041
your body above your seat
makes it an easy way

377
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,833
to work out without moving.

378
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,125
Idiots.

379
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,125
[IZUKU]
I have to keep on improving.

380
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,583
It's the only way
I'll have any hope

381
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,416
of finally controlling
One For All.

382
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,333
Tis skill not strength
that governs a ship.

383
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,833
[OCHACO]
Hey, Deku! Wanna walk together?

384
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,625
[IZUKU]
Mm-hm.

385
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,666
Iida, come with u--

386
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,916
Huh...

387
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,916
[IZUKU] I bet he already
decided where he wants

388
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,291
to do his internship.

389
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,625
My guess is he's off turning
his forms in right now.

390
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,625
[laughs] I am here
in a bizarre position!

391
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,041
Um--

392
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah, what's that about,
and why are you in such a hurry?

393
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,500
Hi, come with me a sec.

394
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,708
Uh, sure. Okay.

395
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,625
[ALL MIGHT]
I'll get straight to the point.

396
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,166
You've received
an offer from a hero

397
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,208
who'd like to take you on.

398
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,708
[gasps] Wait, seriously, who?

399
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:25,125
[ALL MIGHT] Yes. The hero's
name is Gran Torino.

400
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,041
He taught at this
school back in my day,

401
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,833
but only for one year.

402
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,250
In fact, the man was
my homeroom teacher.

403
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,583
[gasps]

404
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,125
[ALL MIGHT] He knows about
One For All, as well.

405
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,125
Actually, I suspect that's
the reason he asked for you.

406
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,250
This guy sounds
totally awesome!

407
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,333
Wait.

408
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,291
So, he knows how
your Quirk works, too?

409
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,500
But how?

410
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,958
[ALL MIGHT]
Gran Torino was the sworn friend

411
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,416
of my predecessor.

412
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,666
He retired a long time ago,
so I forget to count him

413
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,000
among the people who know.

414
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,833
[ALL MIGHT grunting]

415
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,250
[ALL MIGHT] Is this because
I wrote about you

416
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,666
in the letter I sent him?

417
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,166
Or did he watch the
festival and think

418
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,125
that my teaching was inadequate?

419
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,083
If he went so far as to
use his old hero name

420
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,166
when making the offer...

421
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,500
It's scary. Too scary.

422
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,041
Dammit, legs, stop shaking!

423
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,333
[IZUKU] All Might is seriously
freaking out right now.

424
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,833
[ALL MIGHT growls] Anyway,
it is my duty to train you.

425
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,916
But, since you got an offer,
you should work with him

426
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,125
this week if that's
what your heart says.

427
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,458
Anyway, h-h-here's
the-the-the-the address.

428
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,750
[IZUKU]
Just how scary is this guy?

429
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,458
[SNIPE]
Internships, huh?

430
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,125
[AIZAWA] Yeah. A few students
already chose theirs.

431
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,041
[SNIPE]
It's an important time for them.

432
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,791
Make sure they do it right.

433
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,125
Plenty a' third years around
here still regret their picks.

434
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,625
[AIZAWA]
Of course.

435
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,833
[AIZAWA] Iida only listed
one place. That's strange.

436
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,458
He must have gotten better
offers than this one.

437
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:55,291
[AIZAWA]
A hero agency in Hosu.

438
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,041
Don't tell me...

439
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,500
[OCHACO]
What? You got an offer?

440
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,500
Go, Deku! That's awesome!

441
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah. Thanks.

442
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,708
[OCHACO] Aw, man. Did Iida
go home without us?

443
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,375
[IZUKU]
After the Sports Festival,

444
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,750
Iida's big brother
was all over the news.

445
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,458
It turns out he'd been
attacked in Hosu City, Tokyo.

446
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,125
The person responsible
had apparently

447
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:32,750
already killed 17 heroes in
the past, and hurt 23 so badly

448
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,791
that they were beyond recovery.

449
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,750
He's a scourge on
the pro community.

450
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,208
The elusive Hero Killer.
His villain name?

451
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,916
Stain.

452
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,291
[TENYA] If it's about my
brother, don't be concerned.

453
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,291
I'm sorry if I made you worry.
Everything'll be fine.

454
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,916
[IZUKU] Iida didn't say
anything else about

455
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,833
what was going on with Ingenium.

456
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,208
Later,

457
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,208
I was surprised to hear that
he'd taken an internship

458
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,000
in Hosu City, the same place
where his big brother

459
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,958
had been left for dead.

460
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,791
But I felt like I couldn't
ask him anything about it,

461
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,791
since he'd never come
to me wanting to talk.

462
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,291
That's just how things were
between us as we approached

463
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,791
the first day of
our internships.

464
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,916
[AIZAWA] Everyone has
their costumes, right?

465
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,375
Remember, you don't
have permission

466
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,291
to wear them out in public yet,

467
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,125
and don't lose them or anything.

468
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,375
Gotcha!

469
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,166
[AIZAWA] Speak properly!
It's "Yes, sir," Ashido.

470
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,583
[ASHIDO]
Yes, sir.

471
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,875
Make sure you mind your manners

472
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,458
with the other heroes
during your internships.

473
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,708
Now get to it.

474
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,916
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

475
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,041
[IZUKU]
Iida, wait!

476
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,541
Hey, if you ever wanna
talk or anything,

477
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,625
just let us know.

478
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,166
[OCHACO]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

479
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,791
[IZUKU]
We're friends, right?

480
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,791
Yes.

481
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,541
[IZUKU]
In that moment,

482
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,541
I should have tried harder to
find out how he was feeling.

483
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,125
In the days to come,

484
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,666
I would regret not
being there for him.

485
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:47,416
[IZUKU] Wow. A hero even
All Might is afraid of.

486
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,458
[IZUKU]
Gran Torino.

487
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,333
I've never heard
of this guy before.

488
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,500
But he must be incredible!

489
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,666
Yup. Probably super amazing.

490
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,083
[IZUKU] Well, this is
the right address, but...

491
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,791
[knocking]

492
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,750
Hello, I'm here from UA High.

493
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,833
It's Izuku Midoriya. I'm
really looking forward to--

494
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,875
[IZUKU gasping]

495
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,125
[screams]

496
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,750
Holy whoa, he's dead!

497
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,083
I'm alive!

498
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:26,750
[screams] He's alive!

499
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,791
[sighs]

500
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,000
[IZUKU]
Now, the preview!

501
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,958
For my internship,
I'm going to be studying

502
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,250
under the man who was once
All Might's teacher.

503
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,833
His name is Gran Torino,
and he's, uh, well...

504
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,875
[GRAN TORINO]
Who are you, kid?

505
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,833
[IZUKU]
I'm Izuku Midoriya from UA!

506
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,833
I know we'll have a
great week together.

507
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:42,666
[GRAN TORINO]
Who are you?

508
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,666
[IZUKU]
Like I said--

509
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,458
[GRAN TORINO]
Toshinori!

510
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,541
[IZUKU]
No!

511
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,916
[GRAN TORINO]
So, who are you?

512
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,291
[IZUKU] Ah! This conversation's
not going anywhere.

513
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,791
But there's no time to waste,
so I have to keep going at it.

514
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:55,041
Next time: "Bizarre!
Gran Torino Appears"!

515
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,208
Go beyond!

516
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,416
[GRAN TORINO]
Plus Ultra!

517
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,375
[IZUKU gasps]
