1
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,041
[REPORTER A] Okay. Can you
hear me in the studio?

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,875
I'm reporting to you live
from skies over Hosu City.

3
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,833
It's unclear what's happening
below, but take a look!

4
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,875
Large clouds of smoke
and fire are rising

5
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,416
from different
locations in the area.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Is this due to a
series of accidents?

7
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,375
Or have villains
taken the streets?

8
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:31,333
Currently we have no info
on the situation here,

9
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,083
but our station will
continue reporting

10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,750
as this breaking story unfolds.

11
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,333
[CAMERAMAN A]
And cut!

12
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,750
Don't you dare stop filming.

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,041
Wait... What in
the world? Look.

14
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,541
Uh? At what?

15
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,916
Right there.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,666
Check out the building with
the water tower on top.

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,916
Zoom in.

18
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,958
[CAMERAMAN A]
There's people--two of them!

19
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:00,083
Bystanders? How did
they get up there?

20
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,125
[SHIGARAKI]
We're leaving.

21
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,291
[KUROGIRI] Are you satisfied
with the results,

22
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,708
Tomura Shigaraki?

23
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:24,125
[SHIGARAKI] Depends on
tomorrow's headlines, moron.

24
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,458
[TODOROKI]
Did you sleep, Midoriya?

25
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,333
[IZUKU]
No, not really.

26
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,458
[TODOROKI]
I figured. Me neither.

27
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,541
Thinking about that fight now,

28
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,458
we did something pretty amazing.

29
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,125
Yeah, I agree.

30
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,458
After everything that
happened back there,

31
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,916
it kinda feels like a
miracle we're even alive.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,666
With my leg messed up,
I was an easy target.

33
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,791
He probably could've killed me
if he really wanted to.

34
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,041
Yeah.

35
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,333
Seems to me he let us
both live on purpose.

36
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,416
I'm impressed by
you though, Iida.

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,083
He was actually trying to
murder you, but you stood tall.

38
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,000
That's not true.

39
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,208
I was--

40
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,333
[door opens]

41
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,041
Oh, so the injured
youngins are awake.

42
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,750
Gran Torino!

43
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,166
And Manual, too.

44
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,333
Idiot.

45
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,500
I could yell at you
for hours right now.

46
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,916
Yeah. I'm sorry.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,541
[GRAN TORINO] But before I do,
you've got a visitor.

48
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,708
[gasps]

49
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,125
[GRAN TORINO]
This is Hosu's chief of police.

50
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,541
Kenji Tsuragamae.

51
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,625
[IZUKU]
Tsuragamae? The-The Chief?

52
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,625
[TSURAGAMAE]
No, please, stay seated, woof.

53
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,208
[IZUKU]
"Woof"?

54
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,791
[TSURAGAMAE]
So, you're the UA students

55
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,958
who brought down
the Hero Killer, huh?

56
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,416
We are.

57
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,333
[TODOROKI] The police chief
came all this way. Why?

58
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,875
Stain has some serious injuries.

59
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,041
Severe burns and
several broken bones.

60
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:32,083
Right now he's in the hospital
under strict guard, woof.

61
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,750
Here's a lesson you should
have already learned.

62
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,833
When Quirks became the norm,

63
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,125
the police force sought to
maintain the status quo.

64
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,041
They decided we wouldn't
use Quirks as weapons.

65
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,666
That's when heroes came in.

66
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,125
They could do what we couldn't,

67
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,000
if they were licensed,
of course, woof.

68
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,750
It would be impossible
for the police

69
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,833
to condone the use
of deadly Quirks.

70
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,875
After all, we're here to stop
such harm from being done.

71
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,291
The only reason pros can
use their powers now

72
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,250
is because of the
strict code of ethics

73
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,708
that the early heroes
chose to abide by.

74
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,291
That's why it's against the law
for uncertified people

75
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,333
to use their Quirks
to cause injury.

76
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,291
Whether you were up against
the Hero Killer or not,

77
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,583
none of you had the authority
to harm the villain.

78
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,166
That means the three of you,
and your supervisors--

79
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,958
Endeavor, Manual,
and Gran Torino--

80
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,916
should receive harsh punishments
for this gross abuse

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,583
of your powers.

82
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,208
Now wait a minute.

83
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,291
If Iida had not stepped in,
Native would've been murdered.

84
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,875
--And if not for Midoriya,
--[TENYA] Todoroki--

85
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,666
--both of them would be dead.
--[TENYA] Todoroki--

86
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,125
[TODOROKI]
No one else even realized

87
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,291
that the Hero Killer
was in Hosu.

88
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,916
Are you saying we
should've just stood by

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,041
and watched people die?

90
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,250
[IZUKU]
Calm down.

91
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,500
[TSURAGAMAE]
So it's okay to break the law

92
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,291
as long as it goes your way?

93
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,125
[gasps]

94
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:51,375
But, sir, isn't it a hero's
job to save people?

95
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,000
This is why you're not
a full-fledged pro yet.

96
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,416
It's obvious UA and
Endeavor haven't been

97
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,000
teaching you near enough.

98
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,291
What a shame.

99
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,416
You damned mutt.

100
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,458
Todoroki. Listen, he's right.

101
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,958
Stop there, kid.

102
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,291
You'll wanna hear him
out till the end.

103
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,250
[TSURAGAMAE] What I've said
is the official stance

104
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,166
of the police department.

105
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,541
But any punishment
would only be necessary

106
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,333
if this went public.

107
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,458
If it did, you'd
probably be applauded

108
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,958
by citizens everywhere.

109
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,500
But there's no way
you could escape

110
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,833
from being reprimanded.

111
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,166
On the other hand,

112
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,416
we could say Endeavor
saved the day.

113
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,916
Stain's burns would support
this story completely,

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,875
and we could pretend you
weren't involved, woof.

115
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,958
Thankfully, there were
very few witnesses.

116
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,333
This could be the last you
heard of any punishments.

117
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,083
It would mean no one would
know about you, though.

118
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,375
You'd receive no acclaim at all.

119
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,833
The choice is yours.

120
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,250
Personally, I know
where I stand.

121
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,208
I don't wanna damage any
promising young careers.

122
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,791
Not for a mistake like this.

123
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,875
Either way, we'll need
to take responsibility

124
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,500
for being negligent
as supervisors.

125
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,041
I'm sorry. I should've listened.

126
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,625
Yeah! You caused us
a lot of trouble.

127
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,666
Remember that,
and don't do it again.

128
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,750
[TENYA]
Sir!

129
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,416
And... I apologize as well.

130
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,750
Me, too. We'll leave it to you.

131
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,666
[TSURAGAMAE]
I know it's not fair.

132
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,666
You won't enjoy any
of the fame and praise

133
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,125
you probably would've
received otherwise.

134
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:28,375
But at least... allow me,
as the chief of police,

135
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,208
to thank you.

136
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,250
You know. You could've
started with that.

137
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,041
Todoroki.

138
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,708
[IZUKU] None of us knew
we'd end up fighting

139
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,375
in that back alley.

140
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,541
And in the end, no one
else would find out.

141
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,125
But the implications
of that battle

142
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,166
would continue to eat at us.

143
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,458
Even after our
wounds had healed.

144
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,000
[STUDENT A] Whoa, they arrested
the Hero Killer! Awesome.

145
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,916
[STUDENT B]
Seriously? Who took him down?

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,250
[STUDENT A]
Endeavor!

147
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,583
Just what you'd expect
from the number two hero.

148
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,000
[WORKER A] His spree was
exciting in a weird way.

149
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,666
[WORKER B]
Yeah, I know what you mean.

150
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,666
Now, our continuing coverage.

151
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,083
Three villains were captured
in the Hosu riots.

152
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,291
Their identities and
motives are yet unknown.

153
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,500
Based on their distinctive
appearance, however,

154
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,458
and the presence of two people
our reporters filmed nearby,

155
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,000
many are speculating
they're connected

156
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,833
to the League of Villains that
attacked UA High last month.

157
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,416
The Hero Killer Stain
claimed many lives.

158
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,083
In fact, he has more victims
than any other criminal

159
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,125
since All Might burst
into the scene.

160
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,875
With his arrest,
everyone in the country

161
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,000
can rest a little
easier tonight.

162
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,875
[REPORTER A] The seriously
wounded Hero Killer

163
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,041
is currently receiving
treatment at a hospital

164
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,958
under heavy police guard.

165
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,958
Officials are awaiting
the recovery of several

166
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,125
of his victims before
further investigating

167
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,083
the villain's motives.

168
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,500
[DJ A] We're back talkin'
about the criminal

169
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,458
who has surely left
his mark on Japan,

170
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,750
if not the world.

171
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,000
The Hero Killer Stain!

172
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,791
Why did he do it?
What did he hope to gain?

173
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,375
Don't be shy, we're taking calls
and wanna hear your thoughts.

[REPORTER B]
I'm coming to you live

175
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,250
from Ekou Street in Hosu City.

176
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,125
Last night, just after 8pm,
the Hero Killer Stain

177
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,500
was arrested by Endeavor
on this very blo--

178
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,333
[SHIGARAKI]
He's all they're talking about.

179
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,416
What about my Nomus?

180
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,708
[SHIGARAKI laughing]

181
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,416
[SHIGARAKI]
Once this night is over,

182
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
the world will've forgotten
you ever existed.

183
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,750
[SHIGARAKI] Not only
have they not forgotten,

184
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,458
but we didn't even
make the front page.

185
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,916
[BEST JEANIST] Let's take
a moment to talk about

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the incident last night in Hosu.

187
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,041
The Hero Killer Stain
was arrested.

188
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,541
There were also
incidents with villains

189
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,875
who resembled Nomu
from the UA attack.

190
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,791
You're likely worried how
this all stitches together.

191
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,833
Well, I, too, am concerned.

192
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,041
People tend to come apart at
the seams in times like this.

193
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,500
That's why we heroes must
remain calm despite our fears.

194
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,333
Don't let chaos tempt you
into thoughtless overreaction.

195
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:02,833
Remember, we're here to protect
others, not seek out vengeance.

196
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,583
It'll be business
as usual today.

197
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,166
Standard material.

198
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,083
May your minds and bodies
be as sharp as your jeans.

199
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,250
[SIDEKICKS]
Thank you, Best Jeanist!

200
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,541
[KATSUKI] Dammit. I'm so ready
to get out of this place.

201
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,083
[KIRISHIMA]
Uh! Midoriya wrote me back!

202
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,625
That location he sent
was in the middle

203
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,083
of the action in Hosu.

204
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,458
That's why he messaged us.
Man am I glad I reported it.

205
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,666
[TETSUTETSU]
Hey!

206
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,750
Put that down before
Fourth Kind sees you.

207
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,083
We're gonna be late.

208
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,166
[KIRISHIMA]
One sec. I wanna reply.

209

[thud]

210
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,750
What did I say
about punctuality?

211
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,791
[BOTH]
Right. Sorry, sir!

212
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,416
[FOURTH KIND]
Come on. Time to patrol.

213
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,875
[KIRISHIMA, TETSUTETSU]
Yes, sir!

00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,166
[UWABAMI] No matter how
damaged your hair is,

our new formula is sure to
deeply penetrate each strand.

216
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:51,250
Such shine! Such volume!
Such luxury.

217
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,125
Easy curls with just one spritz!

Uneri hair spray.

219
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:00,000
Come on, ladies. Ride the waves.

220
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,708
They sure put that
together fast.

221
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,958
This is just the first cut,

222
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,083
so it'll be another
month before it airs.

223
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,541
It needs lots of CGI.

224
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,708
So weird. We'll be on TV.

225
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,166
We're heroes. This is just
what it takes to be a pro.

226
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,833
So, how 'bout we go patrol.

227
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,000
[BOTH gasp]

228
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,625
[BOTH]
Yes!

229
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,000
[OCHACO]
Oh my gosh! That's so scary!

230
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,291
Well, I'm just glad
you guys are okay.

231
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,333
I got really nervous when
the only thing you sent

232
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,708
was your location.

233
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,166
[IZUKU]
Yeah, sorry about that.

234
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,666
But it's all I really
had time to send.

235
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,958
Don't worry, sounds like
you went through a lot.

236
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,041
You get some rest.
I wanna hear everything later.

237
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,208
[IZUKU]
Thanks.

238
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,625
[GUNHEAD]
Uravity. We're about to start.

239
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,000
[OCHACO]
Oh! Sorry.

240
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,666
I'll see you back at school.

241
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,666
I hope I didn't bother
you much. Bye!

242
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,791
[GUNHEAD]
Was that a boy?

243
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,416
Um, yeah, but it's
not like that.

244
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,291
[IZUKU] I can't believe I talked
to a girl on the phone!

245
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,916
It's like she was
whispering in my ear!

246
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,041
[IZUKU]
Oh, hey, Iida.

247
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,875
I just talked to Uraraka.

248
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,375
Midoriya.

249
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,833
Iida just got his
test results back.

250
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,750
[TENYA]
My left hand

251
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,208
might have damage
that's permanent.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,041
[IZUKU]
What? Permanent?

253
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,416
[IZUKU]
Permanenet damage?

254
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,666
[TENYA] Both my arms
were pretty torn up.

255
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,208
But the injury to my left arm
was especially severe.

256
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,833
There was damage to
my brachial plexus.

257
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,416
Which just means... I'll have
trouble moving my fingers.

258
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,625
And my hand might
have some numbness.

259
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,500
Apparently, there's a
chance it could be healed

260
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,666
with nerve transplant surgery.

261
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,833
When I came across
the Hero Killer,

262
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,416
I stopped thinking rationally.

263
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,625
The first thing I should've
done was call Manual.

264
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,416
But I got lost in my own anger.

265
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,750
[STAIN]
You're completely blinded

266
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,083
by a selfish desire for revenge.

267
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,875
You're about as far away from
being a hero as I can imagine.

268
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,666
I hate him so much,

269
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,291
but I can't deny
he spoke the truth.

270
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,291
That's why, until I'm able
to call myself a real hero,

271
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,625
I'll leave my left
hand as it is.

272
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,208
Are you sure?

273
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:36,458
[IZUKU] Maybe... if I'd been
a better friend back then...

274
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,583
No. Stop it.

275
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,916
He's already accepted
what happened.

276
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,541
It would be selfish
to make this about me.

277
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,375
[IZUKU]
Iida, I feel the same way.

278
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,583
[IZUKU]
My hand is a reminder, too.

279
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,916
Let's get stronger. Together.

280
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,458
I feel kind of bad.

281
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,083
About what?

282
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,916
Whenever I'm involved, someone's
hand gets all messed up.

283
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,833
Is something wrong with me?

284
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,958
Am I cursed?

285
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,791
[IZUKU, TENYA chuckling]

286
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,125
[IZUKU] Todoroki, I didn't know
you had a sense of humor!

287
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,541
[TODOROKI]
This isn't a joke.

288
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,416
I'm like "The Hand
Crusher" or something.

289
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,333
[IZUKU, TENYA laughing]

290
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,250
[IZUKU]
"The Hand Crusher"!

291
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,041
[ALL MIGHT]
A phone call is here!

292
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,625
A phone call is here!
A phone call--

293
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,166
Yes, hello?

294
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,250
[AIZAWA] He can't possibly be
serious with that ringtone.

295
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,958
Wha--? Hi, sir!

296
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,833
[GRAN TORINO] You coulda warned
me about Izuku Midoriya.

297
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,375
I know it probably
couldn't be helped,

298
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,416
but thanks to him,
I'm getting a pay cut

299
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,666
and my teaching license is being
suspended for six months.

300
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,083
His tendency to jump into
situations without thinking

301
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,333
is just like yours, Toshinori.

302
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,291
I humbly apologize, sir.

303
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,791
It's because of my
insufficient teaching.

304
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,041
I can't believe my protegé
caused you so much trouble.

305
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,166
Oh, man, this is bad.

306
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,250
[GRAN TORINO]
Well, I don't care about

307
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,416
my teaching license anymore.

308
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,416
You're the only reason I got it.

309
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,166
And that was so I could
keep my promise

310
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,250
to your predecessor, Shimura.

311
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,875
[ALL MIGHT] And I truly
appreciate all you did for me.

312
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,833
It's only because of
your wisdom and guidance

313
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,666
that I'm the number

[GRAN TORINO]
If that's true,

315
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,875
then why don't
you ever visit me?

316
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,041
[ALL MIGHT]
Well, it's just that

317
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,708
my new life as a teacher
keeps me so busy.

318
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,583
[GRAN TORINO] I actually called
to talk about the Hero Killer.

319
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,375
I saw him only
briefly in person,

320
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,708
but in that short
amount of time,

321
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,958
he shook me to my very core.

322
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,125
There is such hatred
inside of that man.

323
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,375
[ALL MIGHT]
I can't believe he was able

324
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,125
to frighten someone
like you, Gran Torino.

325
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,000
He must have already been
tied up, so what scared you?

326
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,250
It probably stemmed
from his fanatic ideology.

327
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,916
There was something
very intimidating

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,458
about his obsession.

329
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,625
I'm not trying to
praise him or anything,

330
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,541
but he's got the same
determination as you

331
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,833
when it comes to your
"Symbol of Peace" thing.

332
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,166
There're similarities.

333
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,666
What do you mean?

334
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,208
[GRAN TORINO] To put it simply,
you've both got charisma.

335
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,166
As the investigation continues,

336
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,666
his ideology and opinions
will be all over the media.

337
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,875
Everyone will wanna
know his motives.

338
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,958
The age we live in,
for better or for worse,

339
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,458
is one of suppression.

340
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,083
There will be people
across the globe

341
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,458
who are influenced
by these new ideas.

342
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,583
[ALL MIGHT] If that's true, and
he inspires copycat villains,

343
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,166
they'll probably strike
out on their own.

344
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,458
Heroes will be able
to stop 'em,

345
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,291
just like they did this time.

346
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,375
That's where the League
of Villains comes in.

347
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,958
The Hosu incident suggests
that Stain and the League

348
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,291
are connected somehow.

349
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,750
That means... the League will
go from being thought of

350
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,833
as a bunch of juvenile
delinquents that attacked UA

351
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,875
to being recognized as
a group with an ideology.

352
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,208
In other words, these new
converts will seek them out.

353
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,208
Even if each individual
is insignificant,

354
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,416
if that evil gathers
under one banner,

355
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,708
it'll swell to
unstoppable proportions.

356
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,958
If the villain in charge
knew this would happen

357
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:15,083
from the beginning, then he
is a brilliant strategist.

358
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,291
He's steadily getting rid of
any obstacles one by one,

359
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:22,375
trying to create conditions that
will favor his own purpose.

360
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,750
[ALL MIGHT]
When I heard from Tsukauchi

361
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,875
that Nomu had multiple Quirks,
I had a bad feeling.

362
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,750
What if he's back?

363
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,583
[GRAN TORINO] You're concerned
it could be the man

364
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,791
who killed Shimura,
my sworn friend, your master,

365
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,083
and the previous holder
of One For All.

The man who opened that
hole in your stomach.

You're afraid the villain
named All For One

368

is on the rise again.

369
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,750
For him to've survived
such injuries, though...

370
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,333
I don't wanna
imagine it's possible.

That child admires you
so wholly and fiercely.

373
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,250
You should find the time
to tell him everything

374
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,541
concerning you and One For All.

to know the truth.

the Hosu incident,

the Hero Killer's
identity and motives

378

started being dissected
from various angles.

379

[BROKER A] Y'know, lately,
it's been hard finding people

not being able to sell stuff.

It's a real pain.

383
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,291
[INTERMEDIARY A] That's
'cause it's a serious crime

384
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,708
to develop or sell support
items and costumes

385

if you don't have a license.

386
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,916
On top of that,
there've been rumors

387
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,291
that legit support companies
have actually been selling

extra gear on the
black market to people

who aren't certified heroes.

Ugh! Man, I miss the
days before All Might.

391
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,458
And I was still
small-time back then.

392
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,416
Remember when villains
were wild and impulsive?

393
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,666
Everyone thought they
could take over the world.

394
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,625
It was a real good time.

got so damn boring.

pillar of justice is around.

Maybe it's time for me
to finally call it quits.

[VIDEO NARRATOR]
The Hero Killer Stain.

409
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,375
Real name, Chizome Akaguro.

410
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:51,250
As a child, he was greatly
inspired by All Might's debut.

411
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,541
He enrolled in a private
hero high school,

412
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,083
but was dismayed
by what he viewed

413
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,625
as the educational system's
skewed understanding

414
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,000
of what it meant to be a hero.

415
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,541
Throughout his teenage years,

416
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,500
Chizome advocated for a return
to the early days of heroes,

417
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,458
but quickly realized that
words had no power.

418
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,375
For the next ten years, he
trained in killing techniques

419
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,166
in order to fulfill his
self-appointed duty.

420
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,125
During this time his
parents passed away,

421
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:19,625
in what police eventually
ruled as a tragic accident.

422
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,500
His focus was on a
return to the old days.

423
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,666
He believed heroes should
not seek compensation.

424
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,291
That one should epitomize
the idea of self-sacrifice.

425
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,958
He believed that present-day
pros were frauds.

426
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,500
Through his violent purges,

427
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:38,750
he hoped society would
eventually side with him.
