[IZUKU]
Uraraka's judgment was great!

34
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,250
I can't believe she
thought to use

her opponent's power
to get in close!

It looked to me like

Uh-huh.

41
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,541
The two of them were talking.

42
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,333
I wonder what Aoyama said
that shocked her so much.

Uraraka won. Not surprising.

the field next?

They're going to have to
fight against Principal Nezu.

Ah, let's just run.

Even if he does
find us, he's tiny.

I can take care of him
with my electricity.

Maybe you shouldn't
even use your power.

I don't know, he's too far away.

He must have
predicted their moves.

Yes.

through sophisticated
calculations.

There's no way we can
get close to him.

And even if we could,
he'd probably see us coming.

I bet he's just standing
at the gate waiting for us!

320

Every one of them
embodies what it means

to be a UA student!

322
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, um...

00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,166
Mostly.

324
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,500

our peers is giving up.

00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,541
[MINETA]
Damn it!

00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,083
How am I supposed to
pass this stupid final?

329
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,083
This is crap.

330
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,541
Totally unfair!

There's no way we ever stood
a chance at winning here!

332
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,166
[IZUKU]
But he was looking forward

333
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,125
to the training camp so much.

Why is he ready to give up now?

bounce back from this.

As far as the practical exams
go, All Might, Present Mic,

337
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,166

are especially

you kids to best.

339

no possible way to win.

341
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,250
[PRESENT MIC] Midnight.
Her Quirk: Somnambulist.

342
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,458
She can put people to sleep

343
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,458
with the fragrance
coming off of her body!

344
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,791
It usually does better
on guys than girls.

345
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,125
I see it's working.

346
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,458
Ye-hah!

347
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,416
[MIDNIGHT chuckles] Where are
you going, Grape Juice?

348

The gate's the other way.

00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,000
Sero, you bastard!

I'll never forgive you for
getting to be in her lap!

Is he crying blood?

352
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,791
[IZUKU]
He's that jealous of Sero?

353
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,916
It coulda been me!

354
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,875
[MIDNIGHT chuckles]

355
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,791
[SERO] Look out! You can't
get too close to her!

356
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,666
[MINETA screams]

357
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,083
Oh!

358
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,291
[MINETA]
Boobies! And legs!

359
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,166
He's all over her!

360
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,125
If Sero hadn't saved me.

361
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,750
I'd be the one curled up
with her right now!

362
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,416
Mineta...

363
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
[RECOVERY GIRL] It might
be hard for a kid like that

364
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,708
to make it out of this school.

365
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,541
[IZUKU]
Wait, what do you mean?

366
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,875
[RECOVERY GIRL] UA is constantly
creating new obstacles

367
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,666
that our students
have to overcome.

368
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,625
In order to keep moving
forward successfully,

369
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:16,041
students need to have
a concrete goal to focus on.

370
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,291
If your desire is
just to be a hero

371
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:22,500
for no reason, your path
isn't going to be easy.

372
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,166
If someone who's only wish

373
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,958
is to become a hero
reaches their goal,

374
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,166
then they have no real future.

375
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,833
[RECOVERY GIRL]
I wonder...

376
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:36,041
Is there a goal in that child's
heart he can focus on to win?

377
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:42,375
[panting]

378
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,875
I want girls to love me,
so I can touch them.

379
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,625
Well, that's straightforward.

380
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,583
What's their problem?
Why is my exam

381
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,375
the only one this hard?

382
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,125
Just one sniff and
I'll fall asleep

383
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,250
and our team will be failures!

384
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,458
It's impossible!

385
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,708
[TSUYU]
So, Mineta.

386
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,916
Are you really sure you
came to UA to be a hero?

387
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,125
[MINETA growls] That stupid
frog, of course I did!

388
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,458
[STUDENT 36A]
What? No way!

389
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,125
Are you being serious?

390
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,416
You wanna see it?

391
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,750
You'll have to go with me, then.

392
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,708
[STUDENT 36A]
Okay. That sounds great!

393
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,458
[MINETA] I wanted to be a pro so
I'd be popular with the girls.

394
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,916
I thought they'd
fall in love with me

395
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,125
once I became a real hero.

396
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,125
[MINETA] Dammit. I thought
it'd make me cool!

397
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,375
[gasps]

398
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,416
[MIDNIGHT] I figured I'd stay
posted at the escape gate

399
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,208
until time ran out.

400
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,666
But on second thought,
I have a deeper itch

401
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,666
that needs to be scratched.

402
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,083
If I see someone running away
from me and screaming...

403
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,083
...my sadistic side aches so bad
that I can't sit still.

404
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,500
Look at her.

405
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,500
She's got the eyes of a predator
who's cornered her prey!

406
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,375
It's like something out
of my best-worst nightmare!

407
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,250
[MIDNIGHT]
Give in. You know it's over.

408
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,416
One tiny breath and
you'll submit to me.

409
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,958
Then I'll have absolute
control of you.

410
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,958
Oh, perfect!
I do love the chase.

411
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,250
[MINETA]
I'm not just running this time.

412
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,250
When I first came to UA,
I had a brush with death.

413
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,291
And after that,
I realized something.

414
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,916
Being a hero doesn't
make you cool.

415
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,458
People become heroes
because they're cool!

416
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,416
Right, Midoriya?

417
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,416
[MIDNIGHT] How long do
you suppose you can evade

418
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,041
my scent by holding your breath?

419
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,833
[MINETA]
You think I don't have a plan?

420
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,375
[MIDNIGHT]
Hm?

421
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,041
[MINETA] I'm obviously a fan
of heroes that are kinda pervy.

422
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,541
And that means I know all
about you, Ms. Midnight.

423
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,458
I ran away from
the gate and cried

424
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,625
just to fan your sadistic side.

425
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:59,333
I lured you this far out here
so I'd have a shot at escaping.

426
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,208
This was all a part
of my plan to win

427
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,458
and prove that
I'm actually cool!

428

You sweet little boy.

429
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,625
Why don't you come out and play?

[MINETA] Your fragrance
won't work like this!

Will it, lady?

He used Sero's Tape!

433
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,791
[MIDNIGHT] But do you really
think you can fight me

434
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,166
in a state of suffocation?

[MINETA grunts]

436
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,041
[MINETA] I don't have
to fight you. This is it.

[MINETA]
You're right where I want you.

00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,791

He managed to trap her
far away from the gate!

443
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,333
There's no way her
Quirk can stop him now!

444
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,750
Oh, so, he's pretty clever.

445
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:52,250
I think that kid pulled
one over on all of us.

At the end of the day,

447
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:58,458
wanting to be popular with girls

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,708
[KATSUKI]
I'll win.

477
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,958
Because that's what
it means to be a hero!

478
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,666
[IZUKU] Next time:
"Katsuki Bakugo: Origin"!

479
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,041
[KATSUKI] Victory is the only
thing that matters to me.

480
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,000
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

481
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,291
[KATSUKI]
Watch me go beyond!

482
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,000
[IZUKU, KATSUKI]
Plus Ultra!
