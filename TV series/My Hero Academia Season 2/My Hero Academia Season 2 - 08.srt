00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,458
[IZUKU]
This is a superhuman society,

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:15,833
with 80 percent of us possessing
some uncanny ability.

3
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,958
Cities swirled with
chaos and confusion

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,791
following the appearance
of these powers,

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,208
and a new profession emerged.

6
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,791
We called those
who fight for justice

7
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:28,250
and help others
in need, "heroes."

8
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,833
Oh, by the way,

9
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,583
this is the story
of how I became

10
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,750
the world's greatest hero!

11
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,916
[CROWD cheering]

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,958
[PRESENT MIC] Welcome back
to the finals, everyone!

13
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,916
Sorry for that long wait.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,125
The insane amount of ice
from the second match

15
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,416
has finally been
cleared, though,

16
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,083
so it's time to
welcome new competitors!

17
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,333
Even beautiful flowers
have thorns.

18
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,500
It's the assassin
from Class 1-B.

19
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,500
Ibara Shiozaki from
the hero course!

20
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,791
Versus the boy with
the electric personality!

21
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:33,083
Another hero in the
making, Denki Kaminari!

22
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,500
[CROWD cheering]

23
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,666
Keep those eyes peeled.

24
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,000
I wanna see a super-flashy
battle this time!

25
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,666
[SHIOZAKI]
Excuse me!

26
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,833
Please pardon the interruption.

27
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,208
I'm not sure why you
called me an assassin.

28
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,333
I've come to the festival
in search of victory,

29
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,083
not to take my opponent's life.
That wouldn't be in line

30
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,666
with the values of
a hero at all, sir.

31
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,208
Right. I'm sorry.

32
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,791
Gentlemen, I didn't
enter UA for wicked

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:04,583
or selfish reasons, but to
deliver salvation to others!

34
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,666
It is my humble quest to spread
true good across this world.

35
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,458
[PRESENT MIC]
Listen, I said I was sorry!

36
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,083
That was my bad, okay?

37
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,958
I thank you for your
kind understanding.

38
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:20,166
I thought everyone in
Class 1-B was a jerk.

39
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,708
[KAMINARI] Look at those
big beautiful eyes.

40
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,375
And it looks like she
might be strong, too.

41
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,250
Come on, you idiot--remember,
this is a competition.

42
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,708
But, oh, man,
she's so cute, though.

43
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:37,250
This is terrible. I'm gonna have
to ask this girl out sometime.

44
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,583
[KAMINARI]
Once I win this!

45
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,208
[PRESENT MIC]
So, anyway. Begin!

46
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,625
What do ya say me and
you go out after this?

47
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,750
I'd be happy to
treat you to a bite.

48
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,916
Hm?

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,500
[KAMINARI]
And comfort you after your loss.

50
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,541
'Cause this is all gonna be
over in two seconds, honey.

One point three million volts!

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,041
[KAMINARI]
Uh?

54
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,625
Uh, what?

55
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,833
[yelps]

[PRESENT MIC] He's immobilized!
That's all, folks!

57
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,000
It was over in an instant!

58
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,583
The winner is Shiozaki!
She advances on!

[CROWD cheers]

60
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,041
[SHIOZAKI] I'm just so thankful
that I was able to make

61
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,166
the most of the opportunity
I was given today.

62
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:39,000
[PRESENT MIC] Ibara Shiozaki.
Her Quirk: Vines!

63
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,625
The vines on her head can
extend to great lengths.

64
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,000
Plus, they're detachable!

65
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,041
As long as she gets plenty
of water and sunlight,

66
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,500
they can grow instantly!
It's one killer head a' hair.

67
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,291
Oh, yeah! Way to
represent Class 1-B!

68
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,333
Man, she's good.

69
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,666
[MONOMA]
Guess he was right.

70
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,666
That match really was
over in just two seconds.

71
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,833
I wonder if his real
Quirk is the ability

72
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,416
to tell the future.

73
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,000
Hey! Wasn't Class 1-A supposed
to be so much better than us?

74
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:04,958
[laughing]

75
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,125
[KENDO grumbles]

[MONOMA grunts]

77
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,208
Sorry 'bout him.

78
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,666
[YAOYOROZU, JIRO, ASHIDO, TSUYU]
I hate that guy.

79
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,291
[MT. LADY]
Kamui, did you watch that?

80
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,375
[KAMUI WOODS]
Hm?

81
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,416
[MT. LADY]
Wouldn't she make, like,

82
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,250
the perfect sidekick for you?

83
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,916
[KAMUI WOODS]
Yeah, wish I coulda seen more.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She's great for your brand.
You need someone cute!

85
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,916
[KAMUI WOODS]
Just get back to work.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,458
[HERO 20D] As soon as she
detached her vines, it was over.

87
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,375
No way was he going
to avoid those.

88
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,041
[HERO 20A] Yeah, and his
electric current couldn't

89
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,791
travel through them,
so he couldn't hurt her.

90
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,583
Excellent offense and defense.

91
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,708
[HERO 20B] That binding hold
was really impressive.

92
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,875
Smart girl. Kaminari never
stood a chance against her.

93
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,333
[HERO 20A]
It's tough when someone's Quirk

94
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,666
cancels yours out, but he still
could've put up a fight.

95
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,958
[IZUKU] I've seen Kaminari
in action--he's super strong.

96
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,375
But Shiozaki placed fourth
in the entrance exam.

97
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,666
And those vines.

98
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,708
I wonder if she's studied
Kamui Woods' moves.

99
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,208
Binding attacks can
be really powerful.

100
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,416
I hardly ever see anyone
break out when they're used.

101
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,916
It would be impossible
to get close to her

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,666
while avoiding all
those thorns and vines.

103
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,250
You'd have to find
some way to tear them off

104
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,333
or just hack your way
through using brute force.

105
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,875
Oh, but in order to keep
you from doing that,

106
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,250
she'd probably go after
your hands first,

107
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,291
so then what do you do?

108
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,875
Maybe you should
take a sec to relax

109
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,583
before planning too
many matches ahead.

110
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,291
[IZUKU yelps]
Oh, sorry!

111
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,833
Sometimes I don't realize
I'm talking out loud

112
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,291
when I'm taking notes.

113
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,375
t's not every day I get
to see incredible Quirks

114
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,208
from people outside our class!

115
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,250
[OCHACO chuckles]

116
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,083
Uh, actually...

117
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,166
I've been taking notes on
everybody in our class, too!

118
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,083
Here's what I've got
on your Zero Gravity!

119
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,791
Uh--

120
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,250
[chuckles] Y'know, Deku,

121
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,916
I've always know
that you're amazing.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,208
You've got so much drive
and focus in you.

123
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,166
And the sports festival's
reminding me of that.

124
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,750
Uh?

125
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,250
[PRESENT MIC] Let's keep pumpin'
out these hits and move on!

126
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,291
Time for the fourth match!

127
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,708
Get ready to watch two
new players duke it out!

128
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,000
[CROWD cheers]

129
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,166
[PRESENT MIC] He's the kid
with engines in his legs.

130
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,416
Tenya Iida from the
hero course! Versus...

131
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,833
...a fully-equipped
gadget dynamo.

132
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,583
The support course's
Mei Hatsume!

133
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,625
So it's hero class
versus support.

134
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,041
I have no idea what this
fight will look like.

135
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,750
Uh, what's up with Iida?

136
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,083
[SATO] Where the heck did he
get all that weird gear from?

137
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,291
Hero course students
can't use support gear

138
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,875
unless they have to.

139
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,958
And you didn't fill out any of
the proper paperwork for that.

140
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,083
[gasps] I didn't know
that was the rule!

141
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,250
Aoyama got to wear his belt,
so I thought it was fine.

142
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,958
[MIDNIGHT]
<i>He</i> turned in the proper forms.

143
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,458
I apologize, ma'am.

144
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,916
It's just that,
my heart was moved

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,500
by my opponent's sportsmanship.

146
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,125
Even though she's from
the support course,

147
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,291
she wanted this to be as
even a match as possible

148
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,291
since she made it this far.
To have a fair fight!

149
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,708
So, she offered to
give me this equipment.

150
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,875
I respect her integrity.

151
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,041
That's why, to honor her,
I would like to wear this gear!

152
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,583
Such youthful vigor!

153
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,583
[giggles]

154
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll allow it.

155
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,583
[PRESENT MIC]
Really?

156
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,666
[AIZAWA] I guess if everyone's
in agreement, then it's okay.

157
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,000
Right?

158
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,583
[IZUKU] Weird, that doesn't
seem like something

159
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,666
Hatsume would do. Unless...

160
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,791
[giggles]

161
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,250
[PRESENT MIC] Well, if
everyone's on the same page,

162
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,875
let's begin the fourth match!

163
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,666
[CROWD cheers]

164
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,000
Bet you love how fast
that gear makes you!

165
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,166
Huh, Iida?

166
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,666
She's got a mic?

167
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,708
Hey, now.

168
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,375
[AIZAWA]
Is she wearing speakers?

169
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,708
[TENYA panting]

170
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,500
[HATSUME] Don't your legs
feel lighter than usual?

171
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,916
That's to be expected.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,125
I designed those leg parts
specifically to increase

173
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,458
the wearer's speed and mobility.

174
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,125
But, of course...

175
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,125
[TENYA yelps]

176
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,208
[HATSUME]
I can easily evade you

177
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,500
with my hydraulic attachments!

178
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,041
[HATSUME] Those are boxes
for support companies.

179
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,333
[HATSUME squeals]

180
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,000
They love my babies!
I've got this in the bag!

181
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,625
[PRESENT MIC]
Mei Hatsume. Her Quirk: Zoom!

182
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,291
If she gets serious, she can
see up to five kilometers away!

183
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,375
Since I've got sensors
in every direction,

184
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,833
it's impossible for an
opponent to sneak up on me!

185
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,041
[TENYA yelps]

186
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,458
[TENYA yelps]

187
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,958
What the heck is going on?

188
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,916
Look at how adeptly Iida
just changed his course!

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,208
It's all thanks to the ingenious
auto-balancer I created.

190
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,583
This is weird.

191
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,833
[AIZAWA]
She's turning the festival

192
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,083
into one big commercial.

193
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,416
[HATSUME]
There's absolutely no lag time!

194
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,958
[TENYA growls]

195
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,041
[HATSUME]
The auto-balancer is equipped

196
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,375
with a custom
32-axis gyro sensor!

197
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,583
As you can see, it can
keep the user from falling

198
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,333
unless they actually want to.

199
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,958
I thought you said you wanted
this to be a fair fight!

200
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,250
[yells]

201
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,000
[HATSUME cackles]

202
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,958
That's right, I'm practically
flying through the air!

203
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,333
These electro shoes use
electromagnetic induction

204
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,833
on both feet. They're perfect
for evasive maneuvers

205
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,791
or just keeping things light!

206
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,125
As soon as she lands,
I'll stop her!

207
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,916
Huh? What is this?

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,583
[HATSUME] A capture gun
to use against villains!

209
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,708
The nets are loaded
into small cartridges.

210
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,750
You can fire up to five
before having to reload!

211
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,291
And all of these
items were developed

212
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:27,791
by yours truly--Mei Hatsume,
support course prodigy!

213
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,500
So, to any support
companies out there

214
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,125
looking for strong new recruits,
the choice is clear.

215
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,375
You want me!

216
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,125
Again, I'm Mei Hatsume,
that's H-A-T-S-U-M-E.

217
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,333
She's something.

218
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,791
[HATSUME]
And now, let me introduce you

219
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,500
to a few more of my babies.

220
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,541
Wait, there's more?

221
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,791
[HATSUME] Whew! That was fun,
but I think now I've shown off

222
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,875
everything I wanted to.

223
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,791
I suppose it's time for me
to wrap this show up.

224
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,000
Uh, Hatsume stepped
out of bounds,

225
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,208
so Iida advances
to the next round.

226
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,416
[TENYA] I can't believe
I let you trick me!

227
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,625
Sorry about that.

228
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,291
I needed to use you to
make a name for myself.

229
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,500
[TENYA]
I looked like a fool!

230
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,500
Iida's so sincere,
he trusted her motives.

231
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,000
She probably made it sound like
she was doing him a favor.

232
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,625
She's so driven.
Straightforward about her goals.

233
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,125
And from what I can tell,
she'll pretty much do

234
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,083
whatever it takes to reach them.

235
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,416
Amazing.

236
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,791
[CROWD cheering]

237
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,791
[PRESENT MIC]
We're gonna charge right along

238
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,750
to the fifth match.

239
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,416
Let's hope that gaudy belt
serves some kinda purpose.

240
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,541
It's Yuga Aoyama
from the hero course!

241
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,583
Bonjour.

242
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,166
[PRESENT MIC]
Versus...

243
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,750
Is there some kinda
purpose for those things

244
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,125
sticking out of her head?

245
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,458
From the same class,
Mina Ashido!

246
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,791
This match is gonna
be a piece a' cake.

247
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:01,875
I do believe you're going to be

248
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,041
eating those
words, mademoiselle.

249
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,125
Come on, Mina, you can do it!

250
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,291
[MINETA] Don't show her
any mercy, Aoyama!

251
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,083
Fight like you're in
one of those video games

252
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,208
where everyone's clothes
get beaten off!

253
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,041
[JIRO]
You pervert!

254
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,250
A match between
Aoyama and Ashido.

255
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,500
Let's see. Considering
what their powers are,

256
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,250
Aoyama will probably
keep his distance

257
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,291
and try to attack with
his laser from far away.

258
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,083
So it'll all depend on
whether or not Ashido

259
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,166
can dodge his attacks
and manage to use her power

260
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,500
against him in close combat.

261
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,625
Problem is, there's nothing
much for her to use

262
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,666
as cover in this ring.

263
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,833
So she's at a
slight disadvantage.

264
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,500
Now let's get started!

265
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,916
Fifth match... Begin!

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,708
[AOYAMA]
Navel laser, activate!

267
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,083
Think again!

268
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,250
We were on the same team
for combat training,

269
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,000
so I know all about
your Quirk, Aoyama.

270
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,041
I can say the same
thing about you.

271
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,416
Sure, but there's
a big difference.

272
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,083
I remember something you said.

273
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,250
Shooting my beam for
more than a second

274
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,958
can sometimes hurt my tummy.

275
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,916
I know your weakness!

276
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,458
Here's a big one!

277
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,083
Ow. My tummy.

278
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,583
There's my shot!

279
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,708
Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no!
Not my precious belt!

280
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,875
[yelps]

281
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,083
[AOYAMA]
My pants!

282
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,625
For my finishing move...

283
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,083
...an uppercut!

284
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:40,750
[AOYAMA whimpering dramatically]

285
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,375
[MIDNIGHT]
Aoyama has fainted!

286
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,166
The winner of this
match is Ashido!

287
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,833
Dang, Aoyama went down hard!

288
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,166
That's an indisputable victory

289
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,416
if I've ever seen
one, sports fans!

290
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,000
Wow, Mina is amazing!

291
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,083
[thud]

292
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,291
I got to see panites,
but why were they his?

293
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,875
[JIRO]
Oh, for crying out loud.

294
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,250
[MINETA whimpers]

295
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,916
[sighs]

296
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,958
[IZUKU] The match unfolded
like I though it would,

297
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,625
but I definitely
underestimated Ashido.

298
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,625
Although, now that I think
about it, she did place ninth

299
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,583
outta the class in that
Quirk assessment test.

300
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,791
She has a great
power, but she won

301
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,458
because of her
physical strength.

302
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,875
[PRESENT MIC] Now, let's not
let this hot streak cool.

303
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,583
Time to move on
to the sixth match!

304
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,250
[KAMUI WOODS]
We're not here to watch TV!

305
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,250
[PRESENT MIC]
Offense and defense in one!

306
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,791
The dark samurai and
his darker shadow!

307
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,750
From the hero course,
Fumikage Tokoyami!

308
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,541
Versus...

309
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,958
The great creator!

310
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,958
She was admitted
because of recommendations

311
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,875
and I think we can all see why.

312
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,166
Also from Class 1-A,
Momo Yaoyorozu!

313
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,041
How do you think this
one will end? Any clue?

314
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,291
Timing is going to be
the key thing here.

00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,916
Oh? How so?

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,666
[YAOYOROZU] Present Mic's
description of Tokoyami

317
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,583
was accurate. With Dark Shadow,

318
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,333
he's skilled at both
attacking and defending.

319
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,916
He can also call upon
the creature instantaneously,

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,583
so there's little doubt
he'll start the match

321
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,250
with a preemptive strike.

322
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,916
If I can make a simple
shield, I can block him.

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,375
But I'll have to
be fast about it,

324
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,958
or else this fight will be
over in a matter of seconds.

325
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,625
Just like that.

326
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,166
Then, if I have
enough time to make...

[YAOYOROZU]
Quickly! A shield!

331
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,416
Now it's my turn to attack!

[CROWD cheers]

00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,708
[PRESENT MIC] Yikes! Another
fast, overwhelming victory!

342
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,958
Is it possible that
Tokoyami's Dark Shadow

343
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,750
is the greatest Quirk
ever? I think so!

344
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,166
I lost...

345
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,208
I didn't even... do anything.

346
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,958
Tokoyami is way too powerful.

347
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,666
I can't believe he
forced her out of bounds

348
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,708
by focusing his
attacks on her shield.

349
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,791
He obviously had a
strategy worked out.

350
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, I guess so.

351
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,583
Maybe he didn't wanna hurt her.

352
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,416
I bet she's really upset
about how that went down.

353
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,083
[OJIRO]
I feel bad for her.

354

[PRESENT MIC] Okay, let's see
who we've got for ya next.

355
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,875
[PRESENT MIC]
The seventh matchup includes

356
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,208
two completely redundant Quirks!

357
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,250
One of them's a passionate,
manly fighter made of steel.

358

The hero course's
Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu!

The hero course's
Eijiro Kirishima!

363

Seriously, even our
intros are the same?

364

Make us proud, Tetsutetsu!
Win just like Ibara did!

Oh, it's nothing!

I guess I'm not great at
hiding how nervous I am.

380
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,583
I get that. You are up
against Bakugo, after all.

381
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,500
Not exactly an easy match.

Yeah, I'm kinda scared.

But, you know, after seeing your
match, I feel a little better.

Why aren't you out there
watching the matches?

Well, most of them ended
how I expected them to.

390
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,541
And, it's looking
like Kirishima's fight's

00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,458
going to drag on
for quite a while.

It'll be okay!

398
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,291
I don't think Bakugo
would use the full power

399
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,208
of his explosions
on a girl, right?

And besides, everyone's
trying to get the top spot

403
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,791
in these games. Even if she
wasn't fighting Kacchan,

would hold back.

Maybe I can repay you
a little bit with this.

for how you can use

your Quirk against Kacchan.

410
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,250
It's not much,
but I did my best.

You're wonderful, Deku.

I keep seeing that
over and over again.

During the cavalry
battle, I told you

it was good to
team up with friends.

But now that I think about it,

I might've been trying
to rely on you to get by.
