[ANNOUNCER 34A]
Team Midoriya and Bakugo:

16
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,625
practical exam. Ready, go!

17
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,625
[IZUKU]
I have to talk to him.

18
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,625
We're a team. We should
be discussing this.

19
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,416
Communication is the key here.

20
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,083
Kacchan, listen.

21
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,375
For this exam, the teacher's the
villain and we're the heroes,

22
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,833
so we need a solid plan.

23
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,875
Normally, I'd suggest that
we analyze the villain's

24
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,541
combat ability and
choose to fight them

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,083
or run away based on that.

26
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,833
But in this case,
the villain is All Might,

27
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,083
so we don't need
to think about it

28
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,541
because combat is
out of the question.

29
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,958
It'd be impossible
to beat him in a fight.

30
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,416
It's a really bad idea, Kacchan!

31
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,625
Stop following me.

32
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,875
[IZUKU]
Uh--

00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,500

waiting for us

34
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,833
on this main road. We
should take another route.

35
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,125
I'm not gonna run away
from this fight.

36
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,666
It'll look better if we blast
that smile off his face.

[IZUKU sighs]
No.

We should avoid fighting him
no matter what it takes.

unconscious for real.

Even with those handicap
weights, it's impossible

00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,125
from a weakling like him...

160
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,875
...then I'd rather lose this.

161
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,583
Do you hear me?

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,416
[ALL MIGHT]
I see.

163
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,125
Just remember that's
what you said, hero.

164
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,166
[KATSUKI]
Damn it!

165
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,166
Don't you dare say
that you'd rather lose!

166
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,916
Let's win this, Kacchan!

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,875
[KATSUKI grunts]

168
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,166
[ALL MIGHT]
I didn't expect Young Midoriya

169
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,041
to swoop in like that.
I let my guard down.

170
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,250
Man, did they have
to make these so heavy?

171
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,791
[KATSUKI]
Drop me, you bastard.

172
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,875
I got you.

173
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,875
I told you to
put me down, dammit!

174
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:21,916
[IZUKU, KATSUKI grunt]

175
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,791
[IZUKU, KATSUKI pant]

176
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,583
[IZUKU] Kacchan, I really
can't think of a way

177
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,541
for us to beat All Might.

178
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,083
Or to make a clean
getaway without him

179
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,750
swooping in and stopping us.

180
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,916
[KATSUKI]
Huh?

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,750
But before you give up,
we can at least

182
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,333
try using my power!

183
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,083
You can't say you're
okay with losing.

184
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,750
You're you because
you never give in.

185
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,916
You're always fighting.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,458
[BOY 37B]
Stupid! You're a first grader!

187
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,958
You apologize when you
bump into someone older!

188
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,583
Yeah, we're gonna tell Yocchan!

189
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,208
You'll pay for this tomorrow!

190
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,083
[BOYS gasp]

191
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,750
You're gonna regret this!

192
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,333
[KATSUKI sniffs] Ha, I didn't
bump into you losers.

193
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,458
You were the ones
who bumped into me.

194
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,833
[BOY 1C]
Wow, Kacchan!

195
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,291
You fought against two
big fourth graders and won!

196
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,041
[gasps]

197
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,666
[sniffs]

198
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,000
The most amazing
hero always wins.

199
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,000
In the end, they come out
on top, no matter what!

200
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,208
[IZUKU] "The most amazing
hero always wins."

201
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,166
You've been saying those words
since we were little kids.

202
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,791
How can you give up now?

203
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,416
[yells]

204
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,458
[gasps]

205
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,625
Kacchan...

206
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:36,000
[KATSUKI] I won't say it again,
so listen, you useless nerd.

207
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,958
All Might's speed is insane.

208
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,666
No matter where you
try to run and hide,

209
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,666
there's no way you'll
avoid fighting him.

210
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,416
Yeah, but we don't stand
a chance in combat.

211
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,666
I mean, you saw him back there!

212
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,791
Shut the hell up
before I kill you!

213
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,625
[gasps]

214
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,375
[KATSUKI] He won't be
stopped by anything less

215
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,916
than a full-power attack.

216
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,875
I learned that earlier
with my mini blasts.

217
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,083
So...

218
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,375
[ALL MIGHT] Where did
Young Midoriya run off to?

219
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,125
Since he's hiding, does
that mean he's planning

220
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,916
to make a break for
the escape gate?

221
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,958
You're going the wrong way!

222
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,375
[ALL MIGHT] That supposed
to be a sneak attack?

223
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,750
[KATSUKI]
This is pissing me off.

224
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,666
[KATSUKI] Can't believe I'm
working with someone like you.

225
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,583
Someone who shouldn't
even be here!

226
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,000
Deku!

227
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,541
[KATSUKI]
So...

228
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,208
We give him everything we've
got at point-blank range.

229
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,958
Our only option is
to inflict damage

230
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,625
and then put some
distance between us.

231
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,083
So, that's their game.

232
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,166
Shoot now!

233
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,500
This is our chance.

234
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,333
I'm sorry, All Might!

235
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,583
[yelps]

236
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,500
[IZUKU]
My shoulder!

237
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,125
Jeez. He really uses this thing?

238
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,458
[KATSUKI]
Run, you idiot!

239
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,791
Oh. Right!

240
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,250
[IZUKU] Don't you dare say
that you'd rather lose!

241
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,416
Let's win this, Kacchan!

242
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,041
[ALL MIGHT]
Ow. They got me.

243
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,833
A compromise between
running and fighting.

244
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,000
That's pretty decent for
an impromptu strategy.

245
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,958
[ALL MIGHT] They also limited
the damage to the city

246
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,166
by aiming toward places
I'd already demolished

247
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,291
when the exam started.

248
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,541
I think I taught them to do that

249
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,125
in their very first
combat training.

250
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,958
[ALL MIGHT coughs]

251
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,333
[ALL MIGHT]
I see, now.

252
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,208
Both those boys are
actually pretty darn clever.

253
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,875
The problem is that
they lose all sense

254
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,791
when it comes to each other.

255
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,416
[ALL MIGHT]
Envy. Hate. Competition.

256
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,166
Awe. Rejection. Pride.

257
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,625
From what I can tell,
they have so many

258
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,041
complicated feelings
about each other piled up

259
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,791
that they don't even know
how to interact anymore.

260
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,625
[ALL MIGHT coughs]

261
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,958
[ALL MIGHT] It's not the kind of
thing that can be resolved

262
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,208
in a single test. But I'm
sure their cooperation here

263
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,708
will mean big things
for them in the future.

264
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,708
This is just the first step.
A starting point.

265
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,708
Now then, students.

266
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,916
As your teacher, it's time
for me to school you.

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,375
We're almost there.

268
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,375
We just have to make it to
the gate. A little further!

269
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,750
It looks kinda ridiculous,

270
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,958
but if we can get through,
we pass the final exam!

271
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:26,958
[KATSUKI]
Damn.

272
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,166
All Might's first
attack was from

273
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,708
the middle of the fake city.

274
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,958
but it reached all
the way to the gate?

275
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,666
What the hell is that power?

276
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,041
[IZUKU] It doesn't look like
All Might is chasing us.

277
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,291
Don't tell me we actually
knocked him out back there.

278
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,625
Of course not.

279
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,833
You're the one who
keeps crying about

280
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,041
how it's impossible
to actually beat him.

281
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,250
There's no way that
attack KO'd him.

282
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,375
When he catches up to us,
it'll be my turn

283
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,125
to blast him to hell
with a gauntlet.

284
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,791
[ALL MIGHT] Interesting.
And then what will you do?

285
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,291
[gasps]

286
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,416
[ALL MIGHT]
Don't tell me you're surprised.

287
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,833
[IZUKU grunts]

288
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,250
[IZUKU]
He's too fast for us!

289
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,333
[ALL MIGHT] Unfortunately,
I've got these weights on,

290
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,625
so I'm nowhere near
my top speed.

291
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,958
[laughs]

292
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,166
[ALL MIGHT]
All right, heroes.

293
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,458
It's time for you both to die.

294
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,666
Kacchan!

295
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:13,875
[yelps]

296
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,125
That's my line!

297
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,041
[BOTH whimpering]

298
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,250
[BOTH gasping]

299
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,583
[ALL MIGHT] Ah. Well,
isn't that wonderful, boys.

300
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,708
You cooperated,
however reluctantly,

301
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,041
and faced me together.

302
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,208
Sadly, that's not enough.

303
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,833
Cooperation wasn't an option:

304
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,333
it was a prerequisite
for this exam.

305
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,500
[KATSUKI] He's got overwhelming
speed with strength

306
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,208
and stamina I can't
hope to match.

307
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:50,333
He's not just powerful.
He <i>is</i> power.

308
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:55,208
I realize that even more now
that I've faced him myself.

309
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:59,458
This man is the most
unstoppable force in the world.

310
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,125
He's the greatest hero on Earth.

311
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,791
Damn it!

312
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,250
What kind of face
is that to make,

313
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,833
Young Midoriya?

314
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,416
[IZUKU yelps]

315
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,958
[ALL MIGHT] You planned
to get away from me using

316
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,791
maximum firepower and then make
