You're stepping
onto a minefield!

If you look carefully,
you can see

where those little

on the ground, folks.

By the way, those land mines
were designed for the games,

so they might be
loud and flashy,

but, they're not
all that powerful.

there's no way I'll be
able to keep the lead.

318
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,958
I just... have to
hold on and keep going.

319
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,375
I have a chance here.

320
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,583
I have to reach out and take it!

321
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,791
The only way to stay ahead
is to take another leap.

322
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,125
I have to take them
out of the running!

323
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,416
I can show the world who I am!

324

[IZUKU grunts]

325
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,666
[PRESENT MIC] In a stunning
move, Midoriya has blasted

326
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,750
past his classmates from 1-A!

327
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,916
I don't believe it--he cleared
that minefield in an instant!

328
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,125
[PRESENT MIC] Eraser Head,
your students are amazing!

329
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,791
What the heck are
you teaching them?

330
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,166
[AIZAWA]
This has nothing to do with me.

331
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,166
[AIZAWA] Each of them
is powered by their own

332
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,250
drive to succeed.

333
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,250
[PRESENT MIC]
There ya have it,

334
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,166
Eraser Head is a
terrible teacher.

335
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,625
[AIZAWA]
I'm what?

336
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,958
[PRESENT MIC] Who would have
imagined at the beginning

337
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,625
of this race that the
climax would be a non-stop

338
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,541
mega-mix of surprises?

339
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,375
The first to make it
back into the stadium

340
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,333
is the first-place winner!

341
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,166
[PRESENT MIC]
Izuku Midoriya is our champion!

342
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,833
[AUDIENCE cheers]

343
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,250
Oh, my baby Izuku!

344
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,541
Hey, it's that kid.

[KAMUI WOODS] Oh, yeah!
He fought the sludge monster.

346
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,083
[SHIGARAKI]
It's that brat again.

[IZUKU panting]

348
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,875
U-Uh...

349
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,500
[ALL MIGHT] This sports
festival is a competition

350
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,791
where everyone aims for the top.

351
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,458
Even though that means defeating
your friends and classmates.

352
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,000
And for professional heroes,

353
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,083
popularity plays a huge
part in their careers,

354
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,208
so they have to
want to be the best.

355
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,625
It's a bloodthirsty world.

356
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,458
At your core, you
want to help others.

357
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:28,708
That's why I chose
you, Young Midoriya.

358
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,500
But in all honesty, I also
thought your selflessness

359
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,541
could be your weakness.

360
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,500
[ALL MIGHT] Turns out,
I was worried over nothing!

361
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,250
You are a fighter!

362
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,250
Still, maybe cool it
with the waterworks.

363
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,666
This is interesting.

364
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,750
I think it's obvious that

365
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,958
Midoriya's stock
is about to go up.

366
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,541
Not so fast.

367
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,291
He's still an unknown since we
have no idea what his Quirk is.

368
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,625
Imagine for a second

369
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,500
that an agency was to take
him on, how would they

370
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,541
market someone so
plain-looking who doesn't

371
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,750
show off his Quirk?

372
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,791
They'd definitely have
their work cut out.

373
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,333
Well, he doesn't have
much going for him

374
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,833
appearance-wise,
so you'd have to

375
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,541
push his skills
and the unexpected,

376
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,125
artistic ways that he
performs under pressure.

377
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,500
[ALL MIGHT]
Business course students.

378
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,208
Some things never change.

379
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,541
[PRESENT MIC]
The business course!

380
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,791
There's really no benefit
to them participating

381
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,916
in the sports festival. So,
they cultivate their instincts

382
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,750
by selling things or
running market simulations!

383
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,291
They have a lot of free time.

384

[KATSUKI panting]

385

[KATSUKI]
Deku... No way.

386
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,541
Not again.

387

[PRESENT MIC]
The contestants are pouring in

388
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,541
one after the other!

389
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,083
Let's hear some applause
for all our competitors

390
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,458
as we prepare the results.

391
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,791
[OCHACO]
Deku! That was amazing!

392
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,250
Oh, thank you!

393
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,041
I can't believe you got
first place, I'm jealous!

394
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,041
[IZUKU]
Uh! It was nothing!

395
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,500
[IZUKU] It's not like
I had some big plan.

396
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,125
I tried a few things
that worked out better

397
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,041
than I could have hoped for.

398
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,041
Any of those gambles
could've gone wrong.

399
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,125
I was just lucky, that's all.

400
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,875
[IZUKU] My real ability
will be tested after this.

401
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,458
What comes next?

[YAOYOROZU panting]

403
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,458
How could this happen?

[MINETA laughing]

405
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,208
Two birds with one
stone. I'm a genius!

406
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,500
You are the worst.

407
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,166
[MIDNIGHT] The first game for
the first years is finally over,

408
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,125
and what a game it was!

409
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,958
Now, let's take a quick look
at the standings, shall we?

[AOYAMA whimpers]

411
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,333
[MIDNIGHT] Only the top 42 will
advance to the next round.

412
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,083
But don't be too let down
if you didn't make the cut!

413
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,625
We've prepared
other opportunities

414
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,125
for you to shine.

415
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,125
[MIDNIGHT] Now the real
fun is about to begin.

416
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,333
The chance to fully move
yourselves into the limelight!

417
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,083
Give it your best!

418

[growls]

419
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,416
Let's see what we have
in store for you next.

420
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,875
Will your wildest
fantasies come to life?

421
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,916
What could it be?
The waiting is torture.

422
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,125
Prepare yourselves...

423
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,375
...for this!

424
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,250
Cavalry battle?
I'm terrible at those.

425
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,416
--Huh, it's not an
--[MINETA] Oh, yes.

426
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,416
--individual event.
--[MINETA] Oh, yes.

427
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,875
I wonder how they'll
split us up.

428
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,625
[MIDNIGHT]
Allow me to explain.

429
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,541
The participants will form
teams of two-to-four people

430
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,625
as they see fit.

431
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,291
In theory, it's
basically the same

432
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:01,416
as a regular playground game.
But there is one difference.

433
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,541
Each player has been
assigned a point value

434
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,000
based on the results
from the obstacle course.

435
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,041
I get it, a point-based system
like the entrance exams.

436
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,708
That seems pretty simple.

437
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,583
So that means each team
will have a different

438
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,833
point value based on
which students are on it.

439
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,583
Uh-huh!

440
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,625
Maybe you should shut up

441
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,625
and let me explain
things to you.

442
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,958
Now, then.

443
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,750
The point assignments go
up by increments of five,

444
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,041
starting from the bottom.

445
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,916
For example, 42nd place
is worth five points,

446
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,250
and 41st is worth ten.

447
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,625
And the point value assigned to

448
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,875
the first place
contestant is...

449
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,750
...ten million!

450
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,625
Ten million?

451
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,125
[SHINSO]
Really.

452
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,458
[HATSUME] In other words,
if you take down his team...

453
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,916
[STUDENT COMPETITORS]
...you'll win the Cavalry Game

454
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,833
and take the lead yourself.

455
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,833
That's right.

456
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,791
It's survival of the
fittest, with a chance

457
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,833
for those at the bottom
to overthrow the top!

458
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,333
[OCHACO]
Hey, Deku!

459
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,250
Let's talk about the
next episode, okay?

460
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,208
[IZUKU] The second game
is a cavalry battle!

461
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,875
Usually four people
fight as a team,

462
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,958
but no one wants to be on mine
because everyone's after me now!

463
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,125
[OCHACO] It's kinda sad
being you, isn't it?

464
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,083
[IZUKU]
Maybe you could have phrased

465
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,125
that a little differently.

00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,041
[OCHACO]
Deku you must be so lonely.

467

That's not any better!

Next time, "Strategy,

shed even more tears

now that he's a giant target.
