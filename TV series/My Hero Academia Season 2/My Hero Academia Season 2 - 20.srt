[IZUKU]
I know I wasn't here long,

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,041
but thanks for everything.

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,500
[yanws]

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,791
I don't think there's any
reason for you to thank me.

5
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,166
I wasn't around when the
really big stuff happened.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,708
Sure, but the only reason
I was able to stand up

7
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,000
against Stain at all
was because of our sparring

8
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,458
and your wise instructions.

9
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,958
Ow! Ow, ow!

10
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,041
You survived, yes,

11
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,333
but only because
the Hero Killer let you.

12
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,666
[gasps]

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,708
Well, at least you learned
to channel your power

14
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,250
instead of relying
on one monster smash.

15
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,708
Even though you did still manage

16
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,250
to get a stress
fracture in your arm.

17
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,625
I know what happened.

18
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,500
You went well over your limit.

19
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:45,791
I thought we agreed
you were only

20
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,708
supposed to use five percent.

21
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,875
You're too impatient,
and when you lose focus,

22
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,375
you lose control, too!

23
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,958
You must always
be calm and alert.

24
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,083
[GRAN TORINO]
I'm sure you know this, but,

25
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,375
if you're really aiming
to become the greatest hero

26
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,791
like All Might,
then you've still got

27
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,625
a heck of a lot to learn,
boy, so keep at it.

28
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,041
Yes, sir!

29
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:07,750
See ya 'round.

30
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,208
[IZUKU]
Wait!

31
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,125
I've got a question.

32
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,416
Please. Just one more.

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
I've been wondering for a while,

34
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,625
but never found
a good time to ask.

35
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,791
I mean, now's not the best
time either, but here I am...

36
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:19,916
Out with it now.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,541
I've got pastries to eat.

38
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,708
Even though you're really
strong and you trained

39
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,208
the number one hero
in the world yourself,

40
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,958
no one knows you.

41
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,500
You should be super famous.

42
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,833
But you're... not.

43
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:36,458
Is there a specific
reason for that, or what?

44
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,208
Oh, that's an easy one.

45
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,458
I was just never that interested
in working as a pro hero.

46
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,750
[IZUKU]
What?

47
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,125
[GRAN TORINO]
There was a point in my past

48
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,375
when I needed to be able
to use my Quirk freely,

49
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,625
without limits.

50
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,166
That's the only reason
I got my license.

51
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,625
It might be better
to hear this from Toshi.

52
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,791
All Might, I mean.

53
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,791
He can explain everything
better than me.

54
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,166
[gasps] Yeah, okay.

55
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,000
That's it, kid.
Keep workin' hard.

56
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,541
[IZUKU] Yes, sir!
Thank you very much again.

57
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,875
Bye for now.

58
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,125
[GRAN TORINO]
So he's the future, huh?

59
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,833
He may not look or act like him,

60
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,375
but he's still
just like Toshinori.

61
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,833
[GRAN TORINO]
The man chosen by my friend.

62
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,916
The man who inherited
One For All.

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,208
Who became the very best.

64
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,333
[GRAN TORINO]
Hey, boy!

00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,416
Who are you?

Seriously?

Oh, well, I'm, uh,

That's not right.

over him together, Toshinori.

Until the day you
pass on into history.

Until the day that the hero
"Deku" is celebrated

and I can't get it
back the right way.

I'll kill you both.

Hey, there it goes!

Awesome! You got to
face actual villains?

00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,333
I'm super jealous!

86
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,666
Well, I didn't fight.
All I did was help people

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,750
evacuate and provide
logistical support.

88
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,583
[ASHIDO] But it still
sounds like so much fun.

89
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,625
I spent basically the
whole time training

90
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,041
and cleaning the ship deck.

91
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,583
Though, there was
this one day we caught

92
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,083
a bunch of drug smugglers.

93
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,916
[BOTH]
Okay, that's cool!

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,708
What about you, Ochaco?

95
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,083
How was your week?

96
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,250
I'd say that it was
very enlightening.

97
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,250
I think she found
her fighting spirit.

98
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,833
Yeah, that battle hero
must've been something else.

99
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,708
After one week she's like
a totally different person.

100
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,416
Different? Don't be
fooled, Kaminari.

101
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,291
All women are demons at heart.

102
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,125
They just hide their
true personalities

103
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,375
behind pretty faces.

104
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,625
[KAMINARI] What the heck
did Mt. Lady do to you?

105
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,375
Everyone at my
internship loved me--

106
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,416
it was actually kinda great.

107
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,208
Now, if you wanna talk about
the ones who really changed,

108
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,500
it was those three.

Oh, yeah! The Hero Killer!

Glad you guys made it
back alive. Seriously.

and saved you guys.

114
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,333
[HAGAKURE]
So cool.

115
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,875
Just what I'd expect from
the number two hero!

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,291
Yeah, that's right. He saved us.

117
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,875
[OJIRO] Did you guys hear
the news about the Hero Killer?

118
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,416
Everyone's been saying
that he was somehow

119
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,208
connected to the
League of Villains.

120
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,125
Can you imagine how
frightening it would've been

121
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,708
if that creep had been there
when they attacked the USJ?

122
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,083
[KAMINARI]
He's scary, yeah.

123
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,958
But did you see him
in that weird video?

124
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,541
It's all over the internet.

125
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,125
I didn't even know there
was a video of him.

126
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,666
Yeah.

127
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,666
Stain's a pretty evil villain,
but, like, super tenacious.

128
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,791
He's almost kinda cool,
don'tcha guys think?

129
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,041
Kaminari!

130
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,666
Uh-- Oh! Dude!

131
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,166
No, it's okay. You're fine.

132
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,000
It is true that he's quite
a tenacious villain.

133
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,541
I understand why people
might think he was cool.

134
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,416
But instead of
helping the world,

135
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,250
his beliefs led him
to cold-blooded murder.

136
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,583
No matter his motives,
killing cannot be condoned.

137
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,958
To keep anyone else
from suffering like me,

138
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,500
well, I promise:

139
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,666
I will strive to be
the perfect hero.

140
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,166
Yeah. Let's do it!

141
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,083
It's time for class to begin!

142

take your seats.

He's back.

144
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,291
This is your fault for
talking about weird stuff.

145
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,083
Sorry, I'm gonna
keep my mouth shut.

146
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,708
Until I'm able to call
myself a real hero,

147
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,791
I'll leave my
left hand as it is.

148
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,958
[IZUKU]
Way to go, Iida.

149
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,625
[ALL MIGHT]
I am here!

150
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,875
Hope you're ready
to return to our lessons.

151
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,083
Today it's Hero Basic Training.

152
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,083
Feels like I haven't
seen you in a while.

153
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,583
Welcome back.

154
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,625
Now then.

155
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,500
Listen carefully for
what's in store.

156
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,583
We're going to be
conducting a little race.

157
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,750
Take everything you've learned
from your internships

158
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,041
and apply it to
this rescue training.

159
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,875
If it's rescue training,
then shouldn't

160
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,791
we be at the USJ instead?

161
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,541
[ALL MIGHT] Ah, that facility
specializes in disasters.

162
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:58,083
As I said earlier,
this is a race. So prepare.

163
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,333
You're about to step
into Field Gamma!

164
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,541
Inside is an area full
of factories that form

165
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,583
an intricate labyrinth,
so good luck

166
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,125
finding your way around.

167
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,333
You'll be competing
in groups of five.

168
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,291
Each person starts
from a different location

169
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,083
on the outskirts
of the model city.

170
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,666
I'll send a distress signal,
and you do what you must

171
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,583
to rescue me. Whoever
finds me first wins!

172
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,166
But try to keep
the property damage

173
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,750
to a bare minimum, please.

174
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,750
Why're you pointing at me?

175
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,833
[ALL MIGHT] All right. First
group, get to your places.

176
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,083
[KAMINARI] Iida hasn't
completely recovered yet, right?

177
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,250
He should sit this out.

178
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,333
[KIRISHIMA]
Man, everyone in this group

179
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,375
has really good mobility.

180
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,708
Huh. I'd say Midoriya
is at a heavy disadvantage

181
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,875
against those four.

182
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,416
That's what I think.

183
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,291
Moving around quickly isn't
really one of his strong suits,

184
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,625
that's for sure.

185
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,458
[YAOYOROZU]
And whenever he uses his powers

186
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,291
he always gets badly injured.

187
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,916
Who's your pick?
I'm bettin' on Sero.

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,291
Oh, yeah? I got odds on Ojiro.

189
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,583
I choose Ashido.

190
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,791
'Cause she's got a
super athletic body.

191
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,583
I know Deku will be last.

192
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,041
Even if he's still recovering,
I think Iida's got this one.

193
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,291
[TSUYU]
Mm!

194
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,916
Is everyone ready? Begin!

195
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,875
[KIRISHIMA]
Look at 'im go!

196
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,500
In a maze like this,
it makes sense

197
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,083
to be above everything else.

198
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,166
So that means Sero's
at an advantage

199
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,875
because he can take to the sky.

200
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:27,875
[SERO]
It's like this course.

201
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,791
was built with me in mind.

202
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,416
With my new training, I can win!

203
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,250
[ALL MIGHT gasps]

204
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,583
[MINETA, KIRISHIMA gasp]

205
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,333
[MINETA, KIRISHIMA]
Whoa, Midoriya?

206
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,791
[KAMINARI]
Since when can he do that?

207
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,416
[SERO]
What, no way!

208
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,791
[TODOROKI]
The way he's propelling himself

209
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,875
through the air...

210
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,416
Crazy. Those jumps--!

211
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,291
He looks just like...

212
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,875
[KATSUKI]
Those are my moves!

213
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,416
While I spent my
time getting groomed

214
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,375
at that useless internship he--

215
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,791
Look at him.

216
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,083
Dammit!

217
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,875
Midoriya? Are you kidding me?

218
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,750
Shouldn't he be breaking
a bunch of bones?

219
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,250
[IZUKU]
Focus. I can do this.

220
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,250
Don't go above five percent!

221
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,333
[IZUKU] I've just gotta
stay calm and alert.

222
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,625
Huh?

223
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,916
[ALL MIGHT]
And it's over!

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,250
Thanks, hero!

225
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,750
And congratulations!

226
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,208
All right!

227
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,291
--Darn it!
--[TENYA] Midoriya.

228
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,708
Uh, you're okay, right?

229
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,083
[IZUKU]
I see.

230
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,916
When jumping in an area
with unstable footing,

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,750
I need to be careful
where it is I'm landing.

232
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,333
I'll have to remember that.

233
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,333
Young Sero may have
come in first,

234
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,916
but compared to the
start of the year,

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,791
you all showed me some
incredible improvements.

236
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,208
Keep working and preparing
for your upcoming final exams!

237
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,416
[ALL]
Sir!

238
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,083
[ALL MIGHT]
Group One, leave the field.

239
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,000
You're up, Group Two!

240
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,041
[ALL MIGHT]
You surprised me.

241
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:02,416
That was incredible.
Find me after class.

242
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,083
We need to talk.

243
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,291
Um... Yes, sir.

244
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,458
[ALL MIGHT]
The time has come for me

245
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,625
to tell you the whole truth.

246
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,083
About me.

247
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,583
And One For All.

248
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,750
[SATO] Ah, that was some
tough training today, huh?

249
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,333
It's the first class in a while
that had me glistening.

250
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,833
Man, I really gotta
work on my mobility.

251
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,541
You could also compensate
by improving other skills.

252
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,208
Still wish I could use
my Quirk for speed.

253
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,916
I'm jealous of guys
like you and Sero.

254
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,458
[IZUKU]
I wonder what he wants.

255
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,083
He sounded so intense.

256
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,708
[MINETA]
Hey, Midoriya!

257
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,458
You won't believe
what I just found.

258
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,791
The jackpot!

259
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,166
Someone Shawshanked
a hole in this wall!

260
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,666
A previous generation
has given us a gift.

261
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,291
You know what's
next door, right?

262
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,250
This looks into the
girls' locker room!

263
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,833
Don't even think about it!

264
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,583
Peeping on them like
that would be criminal.

265
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,833
Then you'll have to throw me

266
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,916
in solitary confinement,
'cuz you can't stop me!

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I wanna see Yaoyorozu's curves.

268
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,541
Ashido's slender waist.

269
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,333
Hagakure's floating underwear.

270
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,708
Uraraka's super-fine body.

271
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,458
Asui's unexpectedly
soft boobies!

272
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,708
[screams]

273
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,000
That's Jiro's Earphone Jack!

274
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,291
What a brutal and precise
surprise attack from next door!

275
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,083
[HAGAKURE]
Ugh. Thanks, Kyoka.

276
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,500
Despicable.

277
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,541
We'll close up this
hole immediately.

278
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,416
[JIRO] Why am I the only one
he didn't say anything about?

279
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,250
[MINETA]
My eye! My eye!

280
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:43,041
[school bell rings]

281
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,583
[knocking]

282
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,208
It's me, All Might.

283
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,500
Come have a seat.

284
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,125
[IZUKU]
He seems... different.

285
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,250
You went through a lot recently.

286
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,583
I'm sorry I wasn't
around to help you out.

287
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,708
[IZUKU] Oh, no. You don't
need to apologize for that.

288
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,166
More importantly...

289
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,666
Um, you mentioned
One For All earlier.

290
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,416
I heard that the Hero Killer

291
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,166
swallowed your blood
in the attack.

292
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,083
Oh. Yeah.

293
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,958
His Quirk made him able
to paralyze someone

294
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,875
after tasting their blood.

295
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,916
Is that what this is about?

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,625
Do you remember how I
gave my power to you?

297
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,458
What I said that day?

298
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,208
"Eat this."

299
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,458
No, not that part.

300
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,625
I said the key was in my DNA.

301
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,750
That's why you had
to swallow the hair.

302
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,333
[IZUKU]
Oh, holy crap!

303
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,708
Don't tell me the Hero Killer
has One For All now!

304
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,250
No, he doesn't.

305
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,208
I just thought you might be
worried about that, but...

306
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,750
I see it didn't cross your mind.

307
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,333
One For All can only be given

308
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,291
to another person
if you, the bearer,

309
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,333
intend to pass it along.

310
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,125
It's not something that
can just be taken by force.

311
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,125
Although it can be
transferred by force.

312
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,625
Kind of like this.

313

Here! You have to take it!

[IZUKU]
What kind of example is that?

315
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,791
[ALL MIGHT] The Quirk
you now have is unique,

316
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,625
and you should know its origin.

317
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,333
One For All was
derived from another

318

odd Quirk, a power
that's very old.

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,500
It used to be
something different?

320
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:23,333
The name of that
Quirk is "All For One."

321
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,208
It allowed its user to
take Quirks from others.

322
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,375
Then the user could keep
the Quirks for himself

323
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,291
or give them to someone else.

324
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,916
What? You mean...

325
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,583
He could steal powers?

326
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,875
[ALL MIGHT]
This was back when Quirks

327
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,625
were just starting to show up.

328
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,791
Before society had figured
out how to deal with

329
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,333
the newly powered among them.

330
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,958
When Quirks first appeared,

331
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,541
suddenly, it was
impossible to say

332
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,875
what it meant to be
a "normal" person.

333
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,625
Laws and human rights
were hotly debated.

334
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,500
Civilization's progress stalled.

335
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,125
Society decayed.

336
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,666
[IZUKU] "If superpowers
had never appeared,

337
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,875
then humans would be
taking interstellar holidays

338
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,666
by this point."

339
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,333
I remember hearing that
from someone famous.

340
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,791
[ALL MIGHT]
Right.

341
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,291
During that chaotic
period of change,

342
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,958
there was one person who managed
to rally many people together.

343
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,041
He went by the name
of his power, All For One.

344
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,333
He stole Quirks from others.

345
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,666
And then, with his
overwhelming abilities,

346
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,208
he spread his influence
across the country.

347
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,625
He manipulated people
to serve his purposes,

348
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,625
and committed evil acts
with little resistance.

349
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,916
In the blink of an eye,
he became the leader

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,375
of villains and
ruled over Japan.

351
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,166
[IZUKU] I've seen plenty of
rumors about this online, sure,

352
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,583
but isn't that all just made up?

353
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,583
It's not mentioned
in our textbooks.

354
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,541
Because it's the kind
of shameful history

355
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,375
people would rather ignore.

356
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,458
Anyway, when a person
gains true power,

357
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,500
they enjoy showing
it off to others.

358
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,458
[gasps]

359
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,333
How does this all
tie together, though?

360
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,375
And what about One For All?

361
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,333
[ALL MIGHT] I said that
All For One could give Quirks

362
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,833
to others, remember?

363
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,333
He made people trust him
or submit to his will

364
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,041
by altering their abilities.

365
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,250
But apparently, there
were many poor souls

366
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,333
who couldn't bear the burden
of the Quirks they were given.

367
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:14,958
They became like mindless living
dolls, incapable of speaking.

368
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,083
Just like the Nomus are.

369
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,125
[gasps]

370
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,500
[ALL MIGHT]
Meanwhile,

371
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,916
some Quirks actually evolved
as they were passed on.

372
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,666
Some even combined
with other power sets.

373
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,500
This evil man had a
Quirkless younger brother.

374
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,500
He was small and sickly, but he
had a strong sense of justice.

375
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,125
They couldn't have
been more different.

376
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,000
It pained the brother
to see All For One's deeds,

377
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,541
so he kept resisting him.

378
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,166
And then, All For One
transfered a Quirk

379
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,375
to his sibling, one that would
allow him to stockpile power.

380
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,208
We don't know if it was a gift
he was giving his brother,

381
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,541
or if he just wanted
to force him to submit.

382
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,166
Don't tell me--

383
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,458
[ALL MIGHT]
Yes.

384
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,666
Even though everyone
thought he was Quirkless--

385
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,083
turns out, the brother
did have a Quirk.

386
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,041
Though even he hadn't
realized this to be the case.

387
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,708
He had a useless power

388
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,541
that only allowed him
to pass on Quirks.

389
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,125
And so, the stockpiling
ability merged

390
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,750
with the younger
brother's power,

391
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,916
and that is how
One For All came to be.

392
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,166
I've always found it ironic

393
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,541
that justice so often
spawns from evil.

394
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,291
[IZUKU] Wait, hold on!
I understand how One For All

395
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:31,750
came about now, but this bad guy
must be long dead by this point.

396
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,291
So why are you bringing him up?

397
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,708
One who steals Quirks
has no limits.

398
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,750
Anything's possible. There
are Quirks that halt aging.

399
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,541
He probably has
something like that.

400
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,875
The Symbol of Evil seemed
pretty much immortal.

401
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,333
With the state of the
world at the time

402
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,166
and the huge difference
in their combat abilities,

403
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,958
the younger brother
decided to entrust

404
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,541
this new Quirk to
future generations.

405
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,041
Even though he couldn't
defeat All For One,

406
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,041
he hoped One For All would
continue to grow in power,

407
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,916
until it was strong enough
to stop his older brother.

408
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,666
Eventually, it was
my turn, and I managed

409
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,875
to defeat All For One!

410
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,916
At least, that's what I thought.

411
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,541
But he survived and
is now back in action

412
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,458
as the brain behind
the League of Villains.

413
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,875
[ALL MIGHT]
So, now you know.

414
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:28,125
The entire purpose of One for
All is to defeat All For One.

415
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,791
As its holder, you may
one day have to fight

416
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:35,208
against this great evil
yourself. Because I failed.

417
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,458
[ALL MIGHT] I know you
didn't expect this, but--

418
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,166
[IZUKU]
I'll do my best!

419
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,083
I'll do whatever you ask.

420
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,375
No matter what it might take.

421
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,916
As long as you're with me,

422
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,916
I can do anything!
I know you'll have my back!

423
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,625
[ALL MIGHT]
Come on. Tell him.

424
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,458
He needs to know.

425
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,625
[ALL MIGHT]
That's not how it'll happen.

426
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,500
Our futures are--

427
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,208

He won't understand.

Thank you.

was mind-blowing, my daily

If only we'd gotten our hands

476
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,416
on the super regeneration
Quirk five years earlier.

477
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,458
Now that your wounds
are all healed,

478
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,333
it can't really do
anything to help you.

479
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,541
So he's to unite the
League of Villains.

480
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,916
I wonder if the child
can pull it off.

481
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,833
How much has he really grown?

482
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,291
He'll do well.

483
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,208
Even if I have to
work him to the bone.

484
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,708
It's the only way he'll
be able to take my place.

485
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,625
He was born with
the twisted mind

486
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:17,000
needed to become the next me.

487
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,208
I hope you're celebrating
while you can, All Might.

488
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,375
Because very soon,
this temporary peace

489
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:27,125
will come to a violent end.

490
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,083
[IZUKU]
Now, the preview!

491
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,083
Final exams are about to begin!

492
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,250
Ignoring the written test,

493
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,583
I wonder what the
practical will be like.

494
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,125
[ASHIDO]
Midoriya!

495
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,333
It looks like we'll be fighting
against giant robots again!

496
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,708
It'll be super easy!

497
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,208
[IZUKU] Ashido, I think they
changed it up this year.

498
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,416
[ASHIDO]
Let's see.

499
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,125
It says students are
going to form pairs...

500
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,000
[IZUKU] ...and fight
against the teachers?

501
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,208
The pro heroes?

502
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,666
[ASHIDO] What the what?
We can't beat them!

503
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,041
[IZUKU] Next time:
"Gear up for Final Exams"!

504
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,166
[ASHIDO]
Crap, I think I'm in trouble

505
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,541
for the written test, too!

506
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,000
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

507
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,416
[IZUKU, ASHIDO]
Plus Ultra!
