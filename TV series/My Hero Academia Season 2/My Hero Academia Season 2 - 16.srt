1
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:13,375
[IZUKU] We'll pass Hosu City.
I wonder how Iida's doing there.

00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,000
[BOTH gasp]

00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:24,250
[PASSENGERS screaming]

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,375
Nomu!

5
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,291
I want ya to stay
back, you hear me?!

6
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,375
[IZUKU]
Gran Torino!

7
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,291
[TRAIN CONDUCTOR]
Everyone, please! Remain calm!

8
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,500
Return to your seats!
The villain is no longer here!

9
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,541
More heroes will
arrive soon, I'm sure!

10
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,708
[IZUKU]
Keep them calm.

11
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,208
I'm going after him!

12
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,583
[TRAIN CONDUCTOR]
Hey, are you nuts?!

13
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,250
It's way too
dangerous out there!

14
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,375
[IZUKU] He looked different, but
there can't be that many people

15
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,833
with wild eyes and
brains spilling out.

16
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,375
Maybe Nomu's brother?

17
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,291
What is he doing in the city?

18
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,875
No time for detours or stairs.

19
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,916
Gotta put my training
to the test.

20
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,625
[IZUKU]
One For All... Full Cowling!

21
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,208
[IZUKU]
I've totally got this.

22
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,666
[IZUKU]
Gran Torino. Please be okay!

23
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,750
[MAN A]
A villain! Run!

24
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,958
Where are all the pros?

25
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,416
[howling]

26
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,750
[WOMAN screams]

27
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,666
I haven't fought this
earnestly in years.

28
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,500
Picked a fine time to patrol.

29
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,666
That's right! Bring it on, ugly!

30
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,791
[GRAN TORINO] He's fast.
But not faster than me.

31
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,666
[MAN A]
No, stay away! Ah!

32
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,416
[GRAN TORINO]
He's attacking at random.

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,416
Stop it, you stupid beast!

34
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,000
[ENDEAVOR] I was looking for
the elusive Hero Killer,

35
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,583
but this thing will have to do.

36
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,958
Thanks, old timer.

37
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,041
I'm afraid I don't know you,

38
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,541
but I can handle this
from here on out.

39
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,250
[GRAN TORINO]
It's you.

40
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,166
Whoa, look!

41
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,333
Why's he in Hosu?

42
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,583
[ENDEAVOR]
Hmph.

43
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,416
Isn't it obvious?
I came because I'm a hero.

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,458
[PEOPLE screaming]

45
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,208
[IZUKU] They're probably at
the center of this craziness.

46
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,416
I don't get it. Why did
that guy look like Nomu?

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,083
If he's got insane
power like the one

48
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,625
All Might fought at the USJ,
this could be really bad.

49
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:10,291
It won't just be Gran Torino
in trouble, but the entire city!

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,458
That includes Iida.
He's interning here!

51
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,041
Crap, what do I do?

52
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,500
Come on, think.

53
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,166
How do I be the best
possible hero right now?

Oh, no. What are these things?

[MANUAL]
Yeah. Got it!

00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,208
[IZUKU]
That's Manual. The Normal Hero!

63
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,583
Iida's at his agency!

64
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,083
Why'd run off by yourself?

65
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,791
Where the hell are you,
Tenya? Dammit.

66
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,458
[IZUKU] Wait, he went off alone?
Despite what's happening?

67
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,625
That doesn't sound like
something he'd do.

68
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,916
You're in the way, kid.
Get out of here.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,791
Right. I'm so sorry!

00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,791
[HERO A] We can hold these
things back on our own.

00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,708
Evacuate with everyone else.

[MANUAL]
I could've used the extra hands!

73
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,916
[IZUKU] I can't believe
Tenya would run off

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,250
with such a huge disaster
right in front of him.

75
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:30,708
Hosu City... Guys who
look like Nomu...

Killer attacked...

[HERO A] Dammit.

00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,458
They're way too powerful!

[HERO G]
Are these really men?

00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,375
Or are they actual monsters?

85
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,250
[SHIGARAKI] The Nomu make
such great play things.

86
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,291
[KUROGIRI] Are you not going
to participate in the fight?

87
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,833
[SHIGARAKI] Don't be stupid.
I'm still injured.

88
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,958
That's why I brought
those pets with us.

89
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,000
Master, how many
Nomu are completed?

90
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,416
[MASTER] I've finished adjusting
the behavior of six of them.

91
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,333
Though, they are not as strong
as the one from the USJ attack.

92
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,666
[SHIGARAKI]
Give them to me.

93
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,916
[MASTER]
Why?

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,458
[SHIGARAKI] Because I
don't like that arrogant

95
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,625
Hero Killer you brought in.

96
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,208
And it's my right
to destroy anything

97
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,833
that I don't like,
right, Master?

98
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:39,583
[MASTER] Very well. However,
you may only have three.

99
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,375
Try to use this as a
learning experience.

100
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,125
[SHIGARAKI laughs]

101
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,875
[SHIGARAKI]
Once this night is over,

102
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:52,000
the world will have forgotten
you ever existed, Hero Killer.

103
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,958
[STAIN]
A child wearing a suit.

104
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,250
Who are you?

105
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,375
[TENYA] I am the brother
of an incredible hero

106
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,166
who you attacked.

107
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,666
He's the best older brother
that anyone could hope for.

108
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,666
I have come to stop you.
Because he can't anymore.

109
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,583
[INGENIUM] I want you to take
the name. For me, Tenya.

110
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,375
You're going to remember my
name for as long as you live.

111
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:27,958
I am Ingenium, and I will
defeat you. That, I promise!

112
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,708
[STAIN]
Then so be it. Die.

113
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,541
For Tensei!

114
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,875
[STAIN]
Ingenium. So you're brothers.

115
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,958
I let him live so he could
spread the good word.

116
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,250
Word of me.

117
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,166
You're a weakling.
Just like he was.

118
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,958
You aren't heroes. You have
no right to be called that.

119
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,791
Both of you are
nothing but fakes.

120
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,458
[TENYA]
Shut up, villain.

121
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,750
You damaged his spine
and paralyzed him

122
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,958
from the waist down.

123
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:12,541
He's never gonna be able
to work as a pro hero again.

124
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,000
My brother was incredible.

125
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,750
A caring person who
saved many lives.

126
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,375
Someone people looked up to.

127
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,666
You had no right to take
that all away from him!

128
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,041
[TENYA'S DAD]
Tensei. I'm so proud of you.

129
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,333
You've become independent
at a very young age,

130
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,916
with many sidekicks
following you.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,666
That's no easy feat
in these times.

132
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,041
Nah, they're not followers.

133
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,916
It's the opposite, Dad.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,375
They support me 'cause
I'm not great on my own.

135
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,125
They're just looking out for me.

136
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,250
I honestly couldn't do
anything without them.

137
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,666
I need their support.

138
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,916
Of course, I'm working hard
so I can return the favor.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,541
I'm not super
talented or anything,

140
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,291
but if I'm going to
call myself a hero,

141
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:02,250
then I have to live up to
that title and help people.

142
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,291
[TENYA]
He is my hero.

143
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,750
My older brother
inspired my dream

144
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,208
that one day I could
be a pro, too!

145
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,000
I won't forgive you.

146
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,208
I'll kill you!

147
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,250
Shouldn't you be worried
about saving that guy?

148
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,500
[STAIN] So busy with your
grudge you forgot about him.

149
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,750
You plan on using your
Quirk only for yourself.

150
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,875
You're completely blinded by
a selfish desire for revenge.

151
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,916
You're about as far away from
being a hero as I can imagine.

152
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,791
And that's why
you'll die tonight.

153
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,666
[TENYA]
My body... won't move!

154
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,500
[STAIN]
Goodbye, child.

155
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,958
May your death bring
about a better world.

156
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,958
No, please! Not like this!

157
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,333
Knowing you look up
to me makes me better.

158
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,208
I have to be sure
I make you proud.

159
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,791
[laughs]

160
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,291
Say whatever you
want to about me!

161
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,666
You're still just a criminal
who hurt my brother!

162
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,750
[grunts]

163
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,125
[IZUKU]
Smash!

164
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,041
Who's there?

165
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,791
Midoriya? How?

166
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:32,250
Don't you worry, Iida.
I'm gonna save you.

167
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
[IZUKU]
I might be overthinking things.

168
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,416
I don't exactly have any proof.

169
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,000
But I can't just stand by.
I have to do something!

170
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,166
Guys like Nomu
are running wild.

171
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,083
The same place the
Hero Killer appeared.

172
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,083
I don't want to even imagine it,
but I'm afraid I might be right.

173
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,583
The League of Villains
and the Hero Killer

174
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,500
are connected somehow!

175
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,958
That means...

176
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,458
The Hero Killer is probably
somewhere in the city

177
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,125
this very moment.

178
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,208
Since Iida wasn't
at the fight earlier,

179
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,791
he may've stumbled upon the guy
who hurt his brother himself!

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,916
[gasps]

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,916
[yells]

182
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,333
Guess I was right!

183
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:37,458
[STAIN] It's him. The one
from Shigaraki's picture.

184
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,958
You found him, too? But how?

185
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,250
I saw it on TV.

186
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,666
They had some stats
about the Hero Killer.

187
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,541
Most his victims were found
where there weren't many people.

188
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,125
So in order to find you,

189
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,500
I needed to search far
away from the panic.

190
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,291
In the back alleys of Hosu City.

191
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,791
Let's go.
Back toward the street.

192
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,166
We have to get
help from the pros.

193
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,333
Ugh. I can't move my body.

194
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,333
[IZUKU]
Huh?

195
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,250
It must be his Quirk.

196
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,000
Since he cut me,
I've been paralyzed.

197
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,666
That's the kind of
Quirk people on TV

198
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,375
said the Hero Killer might have.

199
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,125
So cutting somehow
activates his power, huh?

200
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,166
[IZUKU gasps]

201
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,625
[IZUKU]
There's someone else!

202
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,208
If it had just been Iida,

203
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,250
I could've picked him up
and carried him away myself.

204
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:27,375
[TENYA] Midoriya, please!
Don't get involved.

205
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,750
This doesn't have
anything to do with you!

206
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,625
Iida, what are you saying?

207
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,666
You showed up to save
your friend's life.

208
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,291
You even made a big entrance.

209
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,625
But I have a duty to kill him
and this so-called pro.

210
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,166
When your friend
chose to fight me,

211
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,250
it guaranteed that the weaker
of us would be culled.

212
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,750
So what will you do?

213
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,083
Criminals like you--

214
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,041
You always try and make
your actions sound noble.

215
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,416
[IZUKU] He's different from the
villains who attacked us before.

216
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,708
Those are the eyes of a fanatic.

217
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,333
[IZUKU] Even though
it was just a guess,

218
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,208
and I didn't have any proof,

219
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,416
I should've made sure that a
pro came with me to find him.

220
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,375
I'll just have to protect
these two who can't move

221
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,458
and stall for time...
all by myself.

222
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,708
Maybe I can even force
the Hero Killer to run.

223
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:24,833
[TENYA]
Listen to me!

224
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,041
Stand down. Run away.

225
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,375
I told you, this has
nothing to do with you.

226
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,083
[IZUKU]
If you really believe that,

227
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,833
then why are you trying
to become a hero

228
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,375
in the first place?!

229
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,208
There are plenty of
things I'd like to say,

230
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,416
but they'll have to wait.

231
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,333
All Might was right, though.

232
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:47,541
Meddling when you don't need to
is the essence of being a hero!

233
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,666
Heh.

234
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,333
[STAIN]
Good.

235
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,541
[IZUKU]
Gotta get past the sword.

236
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,583
[STAIN] Trying to get in close
so I can't strike him.

237
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,333
Smart move.

238
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,125
[TENYA]
No! If you get cut--!

239
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,791
[IZUKU]
Watch the blades!

240
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,208
[STAIN]
He's gone?

241
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,291
No.

242
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:20,458
A five percent...
Detroit... Smash!

243
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,083
[TENYA]
What? These movements.

244
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,250
He's flying around,
like Bakugo does.

245
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,791
[IZUKU]
Did I get him?

246
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,708
Did Full Cowling work?

247
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,333
Yes, I really can fight!

248
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,750
[IZUKU]
My body!

249
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,291
[IZUKU] Did he cut me and
I didn't even notice?

250
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,375
One graze is all it took?

251
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,041
[IZUKU]
No. It's... the blood!

252
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,250
[STAIN]
You're not powerful enough.

253
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,416
It's not that you
predicted my movements.

254
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,083
You just left my
field of vision,

255
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,750
and maneuvered so that you'd
be able to get in a clean shot.

256
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,958
But I saw through your plan.

257
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,541
There are countless false heroes
around here who are all talk,

258
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,458
but I think you're worthy
of staying alive.

259
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,000
You're different from these two.

260
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,541
Wait, don't. Stop it!

261
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,958
Get away!

262
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,125
Someone else to get in my way.

263
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,291
Today's been full
of distractions.

264
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,875
[TODOROKI]
Midoriya,

265
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,125
you need to give more
details in times like this.

266
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,666
I was almost too
late to stop this guy.

267
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,250
[TENYA]
You, too, Todoroki?

268
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,666
[IZUKU]
How'd you get here?

269
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,958
Hold on, you're using
your left side?

270
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,083
[TODOROKI]
How'd I get here? Good question.

271
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,750
Your message took me
a while to figure out.

272
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,458
Next time, try to send more than
just your specific location.

273
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,791
But you're not really one
to send cryptic messages

274
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,791
without a reason, are you?

275
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,708
[TODOROKI] So I figured you were
in trouble and asking for help.

276
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,375
Everything's okay. The pro
heroes will be here any minute!

277
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,583
[STAIN] The time will be up
for one of them soon.

278
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,958
[TODOROKI] You're just
what they said you were.

279
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:23,208
But you won't be taking
any more lives, Hero Killer.

280
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,708
[IZUKU] Todoroki! You can't
let that guy get your blood.

281
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,458
I-I think he controls
his enemy's actions

282
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,833
by swallowing it.

283
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,041
That's how he got us!

284
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,708
He ingests blood to keep
people from moving.

285
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,625
That explains the blades.

286
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,291
All I've gotta do
is keep my distance.

287
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,125
[STAIN]
Ya have good friends, Ingenium.

288
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,375
Or you did!

289
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,333
[TODOROKI]
His sword!

290
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,708
He threw it at the same
time as the knife!

291
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,666
[TODOROKI]
He's strong.

292
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,500
Just stop it.

293
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:07,500
Why are you doing this?
His fight is with me!

294
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,375
I inherited my brother's name.

295
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,375
I'm the one that should stop
him. The Hero Killer is mine!

296
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,083
[TODOROKI]
You're Ingenium now? Strange.

297
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,166
[TODOROKI]
The Ingenium I knew before

298
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,416
never had that look on his face.

299
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,958
You've got a dark side.

300
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,416
Guess my family
isn't the only one.

301
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,041
[grunts] Careful, Todoroki!

302
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,375
Uh. Huh?

303
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,041
[STAIN] Ya blocked your
own field of vision

304
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,625
against an opponent
who's faster than you.

305
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,083
Rookie mistake.

306
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,708
Come get me then!

307
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,416
[STAIN]
You're good, kid.

308
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,375
Unlike him.

309
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,458
[TODOROKI]
Watch out!

310
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,625
Midoriya!

311
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,125
I'm not sure why,
but I'm able to move now!

312
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,708
So he has a time limit.

313
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,041
[NATIVE]
No.

314
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,125
That kid shoulda been
the last one to be freed.

315
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,041
I still can't move a muscle.

316
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,208
[STAIN]
He must be type O.

317
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,416
[TODOROKI]
Midoriya, dodge!

318
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,625
[IZUKU coughing]

319
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,958
He swallows a person's
blood to freeze them,

320
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,083
but I was the one freed first.

321
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,166
I've got three
different guesses why.

322
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,666
His Quirk could
be less effective

323
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,541
the more people he uses it on.

324
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,333
The amount ingested could
play into how long it works.

325
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,625
Or there could even
be a difference

326
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,250
based on a person's blood type.

327
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,541
If it's the last one,
my blood type is B.

328
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,250
[TENYA]
I'm type A.

329
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,750
So you figured it out.

330
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,208
Bravo. Very impressive.

331
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:40,083
[PRESENT MIC] Hero Killer Stain!
His Quirk, Bloodcurdle!

332
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,458
By tasting someone's blood,

333
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,416
he can freeze them for
up to eight minutes,

334
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,833
depending on their blood type!

335
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,791
From shortest to longest time,
it's O, A, AB, and B!

336
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,333
It doesn't really
help us that much

337
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,958
to know how his
Quirk works, though.

338
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,125
I thought we could hurry and
carry those two out of here,

339
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,458
but it's no good.

340
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,250
He's too fast. He can
dodge ice and fire.

341
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,125
I'd have to leave
myself unguarded.

342
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,541
Our best option is to hold
until the pros arrive

343
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,458
and avoid close combat.

344
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,208
No, you know you've already
lost way too much blood.

345
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,416
I'll distract him while you
support me from behind.

346
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,083
Sound like a plan?

347
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,291
You want us to take
a pretty big risk.

348
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,500
Okay.

349
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,083
We can protect them!

350
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:26,708
Two against one, huh?
This fight won't be easy.

351
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,208
[TODOROKI]
Iida.

352
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,291
I've been worried about you

353
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,208
ever since your
brother was attacked.

354
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:37,250
I recognize the face of someone
who's drowning in resentment.

355
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,750
[TODOROKI]
And I know just how narrow

356
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,708
your field of vision can get

357
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:46,500
when you long for justice.

358
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,125
That day, I told her about
my life with Father,

359
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,375
and about who I have become.

360
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,708
She cried and apologized.

361
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,500
She forgave me.

362
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:00,291
Faster than I ever imagined.

363
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,125
She told me to move forward.

364
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,333
That nothing was
holding me back,

365
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,666
and that doing so
would be her salvation.

366
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,208
If I hadn't spoken to her,

367
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,625
I would never have been able
to choose my old man's agency

368
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,250
for my internship.

369
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,458
I couldn't bare being near him.

370
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,125
I haven't forgiven him.
I doubt I ever truly will.

371
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,625
But I chose him,

372
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,541
so I could learn what it takes
to be the number two hero

373
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,708
with my own eyes and ears.

374
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,708
I had to know.

375
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,875
[ENDEAVOR]
Get ready. We're going out.

376
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,583
Yeah, okay. Where to?

377
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,708
[ENDEAVOR] If the Hero Killer
is following his pattern,

378
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,583
we know where
he'll show up next,

379
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:40,083
and we'll be there to stop him.

380
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,083
We're taking a
work trip to Hosu.

381
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,666
[ENDEAVOR SIDEKICKS]
Yes, sir!

382
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,375
[TODOROKI]
My old man is a scumbag.

383
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,375
But a scumbag with the
judgment and instincts

384
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,041
of a number two hero.

385
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,500
And I can acknowledge that.

386
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,041
It's so simple.

387
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,041
But I still needed
someone to show me.

388
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,208
It's yours! Your Quirk, not his!

389
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:07,958
[TODOROKI] Just a few words.
Two short sentences.

390
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,291
Shouldn't you be worried
about saving that guy?

391
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,458
Don't you worry, Iida.
I'm gonna save you.

392
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,625
[TODOROKI]
We can protect them!

393
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,166
[TENYA]
I'll kill you!

394

[STAIN grunts]

395
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,083
[IZUKU]
No good.

396
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,125
His fighting style has
completely changed!

397

[TODOROKI]
Midoriya!

398
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,375
[TENYA]
You have to run.

399
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,250
I can't watch this.

00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,500
You wanna make
your brother proud?!

401

[TODOROKI]
Then stand up and be Ingenium!

402
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,166
Become the hero he
wanted you to be!

403

[TENYA] I am Ingenium,
and I will defeat you.

404
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,333
That, I promise!

[IZUKU]

[TENYA]
Stand down!

I told you, this has
nothing to do with you.

408
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,250
[IZUKU]
If you really believe that,

409
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,041
then why are you trying
to become a hero

410
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,166
in the first place?

411
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,250
[TODOROKI]
I've been worried about you

412
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,791
ever since your
brother was attacked.

413
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,041
[IZUKU]
All Might was right, though.

414
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,500
[TODOROKI]
And I know just how narrow

415
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,333
your field of vision can get
when you long for justice.

416
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,916
[IZUKU]
Meddling when you don't need to

417
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,666
is the essence of being a hero!

418
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,666
[TENYA] I have no right
to call myself a hero.

419
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,333
Even so, there's no
way I can back down.

420
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:56,458
If I give up now, then
the name Ingenium will die.

421
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,416
[IZUKU]
Next time: "Climax."
