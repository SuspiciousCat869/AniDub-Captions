My father is the hero Endeavor.

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:17,000
He's the number two hero.
You must know him.

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,541
[ENDEAVOR] It's my Shoto's
duty to surpass All Might

as the number one hero.

5
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,291
So if you are somehow
connected to All Might,

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,875

then that would mean...

00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,458

reason to beat you.

In every memory of my mother,

00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,708
I only see her crying.

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:40,583
I remember she called
my left side unbearable

11
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,708
before she poured
boiling water on my face.

[TODOROKI]
I'm going to show my old man

13

that I don't have to rely
on his damned fire Quirk.

14
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,333
I'm going to show him
that I reject his power

15
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,125
and I can take first place
without using it.

16
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,916
[TODOROKI] I suppose your
relationship with All Might

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,750
doesn't actually matter.

18
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:03,416

only my right side.

[TODOROKI] I can't allow him to
use that power of his too much.

[PRESENT MIC] But which of
these rivals will advance

Hpmh. Just as I expected.

50
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,375
He's prepared to injure
himself to counter me.

51
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,416
[PRESENT MIC] Wow! Midoriya
managed to break Todoroki's

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,541
insane opening move!

53
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,416
[ALL MIGHT] He had no way
of knowing how powerful

54
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
Young Todoroki's attack
was going to be,

55
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:38,041
so he abandoned restraint and
fired off a shot at 100 percent.

56
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,000
It's true that this was
likely the only thing

57
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,583
he could do against the
ice barrage. However...

58
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,208
[IZUKU]
Smash!

59
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,458
[PRESENT MIC]
He countered again!

60
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,875
[IZUKU] I don't know much about
Todoroki's fighting style.

61
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,333
His attacks are so
fast that it's hard

62
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,958
to collect data on him.

63
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,333
So, during this fight,
I need to focus

64
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,791
on finding an opening somewhere.

65
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,625
The ice behind him is
probably how he plans

66
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,916
to keep from being blown
out of bounds by my smashes.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,125
Which means...

68
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,583
I was right to break my fingers.

69
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,833
If I'd spent my whole arm
on a full-powered smash

70
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,541
and the ice held up,
I'd be doomed.

I can figure this out.

Come on. Find a weak spot.

73
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,708

Todoroki both have moves

that blast the whole stadium!

Must be pretty nice.

90
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,500
Plus, you don't have to
pause between attacks.

91
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,333
It's not as easy as
you think, ya morons.

92
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,833
[KIRISHIMA]
Hm?

93
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,250
If you overuse your muscles,
you risk tearing them apart.

94
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,833
If you sprint too much,
you run out of breath.

95
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,625
[KATSUKI] We all have
a limit to how much power

96
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,500
we can produce.

97
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,583
That's why I designed
my costume the way I did--

98
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,416
so I'd be able to
fire off bigger blasts

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,083
than my body usually
allows me to.

100
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,500
Quirks are physical
abilities, too.

101
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,000
They can get worn out.

102
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,416
You can't just use them nonstop.

103
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,708
It makes sense when
you put it that way.

104
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:42,583
I wonder if that's how Midoriya
thinks he's gonna beat Todoroki.

105
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,750
[TODOROKI]
You want an endurance match.

106
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,708

He's full of adrenaline.

He probably doesn't even

00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,500
It's yours! Your Quirk, not his!

316
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,458
[gasps]

317
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,083
[ALL MIGHT]
Yes. That's right.

318
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,666
Children often do inherit
Quirks from their parents,

319
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,875
or develop similar power sets.

320
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,708
But the most important
thing to remember

321
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,500
is that a Quirk is
what you make of it,

322
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,333
regardless of your history.

323
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,250
You decide how you'll use it.

324
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,250
That's what I mean
when I say "I am here."

325
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,875
Only you can decide to
become a hero, no one else.

326
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,291
Take this to heart,
kids! You've got it!

327
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,291
[TODOROKI'S MOTHER]
Honey, you do still wanna

328
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,666
be a hero, don't you?

329
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,708
Just remember,

330
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,208
stay true to yourself.

331
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,666
[TODOROKI] I didn't realize
how much I'd forgotten.

332
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,291
[TODOROKI'S MOTHER] You are not
a prisoner of your lineage.

333
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,583
It's okay to use your power

334
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,000
to become who you want to be.

335
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,250
[PRESENT MIC gasps]
Is that...?

336
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,416
He's using his fire!

337
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,250
[TODOROKI] When I'm in battle,
I never use my left side.

338
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,791
Incredible.

339
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,458
[ALL MIGHT] You made him
use his father's power.

340
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,416
Midoriya. Don't tell me
you were trying to save

341
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,791
Young Todoroki this whole time!

342
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,958
[TODOROKI]
You're helping your opponent.

343
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,125
[gasps]

344
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,583
[TODOROKI]
You fool.

345
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,666
Even though you wanna
win this battle.

346
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,708
Now which one of us
is screwing around?

347
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,166
[IZUKU gasps]

348
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,166
I want it, too. I'll be a hero!

349
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,750
Yes, Shoto!

350
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,833
Huh?

351
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,083
Have you finally
accepted your purpose?

352
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,083
That's it. Very good.

353
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,666
This is the dawn
of a new era for us.

354
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,750
With my blood in your veins,
you'll surpass me.

355
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,666
You will live up to the
reason I created you!

356
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,375
[PRESENT MIC]
Endeavor suddenly shouts

357
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,791
words of... encouragement?

358
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,541
What a doting father.

359
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,666
Amazing.

360
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,166
[TODOROKI]
Why are you smiling?

361
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,958
With those injuries...

362
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,416
In this hopeless situation...

363
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,166
You must be crazy.

364
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,541
[IZUKU grunts]

365
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,291
Don't blame me
for what happens next.

366
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,166
That's it, Midnight.

367
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,291
One of them could be killed.

368
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,041
His body won't hold up!

369
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:07,375
[IZUKU] Gotta try and get
close and give it everything!

370
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,375
Come at me with your
full power, Todoroki!

371
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,333
I see now, Midoriya.

372
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,708
[TODOROKI]
Thank you.

373
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,500
[MIDNIGHT grunts]

374
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,458
[MINETA yelps]
Holy crap balls!

375
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,083
This is crazy!

376
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,333
What's happening down there?

377
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,000
[CEMENTOSS] Having a
great power doesn't mean

378
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,916
you'll be a good hero.
But these two are amazing.

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
[PRESENT MIC]
What happened just now?

380
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,000
What the heck is up
with your students?

381
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,000
[AIZAWA] The air around the
ring had been thoroughly

382
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,083
cooled down, and then rapidly
expanded when heated up.

383
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,458
Wait, that's what
caused the explosion?

384
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,291
How hot did that fire get?
Jeez, I can't see a thing!

385
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,875
Is the match still
going on, or what, huh?

386
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,875
[MIDNIGHT grunts]

387
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,125
[ALL gasp]

388
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,541
[MIDNIGHT]
There.

389
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,166
Midoriya is...

390
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,958
...out of bounds.

391
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,750
Todoroki wins!

392
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,500
He advances to the third round!

393
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:58,375
[CROWD cheers]

394
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,083
[TENYA]
Attention!

395
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,083
I'm Tenya Iida, the
resentative for Class 1-A!

396
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll be responsible
for this preview!

397
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,041
[IZUKU]
That's the same way

398
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,791
you introduced
yourself last time.

399
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,708
[TENYA] Midoriya,
I swear that I will win

400
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,083
this next match and advance.
For both of us.

401
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,583
[IZUKU]
Yeah! I believe in you!

402
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,083
[TENYA]
I've come this far.

403
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,583
I have to keep going and become
number one for my family.

404
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,625
[IZUKU]
Next time: "Fight On, Iida!"

405
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,875
[TENYA]
Hello, Mother?

406
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,416
What do you mean it's Tensei?

407
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,291
How could this have
happened to my big brother?

408
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:58,375
[IZUKU]
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
