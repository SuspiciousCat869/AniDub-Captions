This is a superhuman society,

with 80 percent of us possessing
some uncanny ability.

Cities swirled with
chaos and confusion

following the appearance
of these powers,

5
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:23,291
and a new profession emerged.

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,833
We call those who
fight for justice

and help others
in need, "heroes."

Oh, by the way,

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,541
this is the story
of how I became

Now, gird your loins and
prepare for a Cavalry Battle!

Izuku Midoriya placed
first in the qualifier.

He'll be worth
ten million points!

[MIDNIGHT] It's survival of
the fittest, with a chance

to overthrow the top!

No. Kaminari is the one to fear.

If there was any more sunlight,

would have completely

when I'm in darkness.

102
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,916
But, that makes
Dark Shadow aggressive

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,875
and difficult to control.

104
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,500
On the other hand,
the beast is easy

keeps using his Quirk,

for me to attack.

Midoriya is keeping his distance

and staying on my left side.
That's his strategy.

From this position if I try
to freeze them, I'll hit Iida.

Lay down some acid in
the direction we're going.

322
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,458
It's Mina Ashido!

323
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,250
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Bakugo.

324
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,083
You understand
something crucial,

325
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,750
a truth no one had to teach you.

326
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,791
[ALL MIGHT]
But there's a difference between

327
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,958
those who aim for the top,
and those who will settle.

328
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,833
[ALL MIGHT]
And that difference matters.

329
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,708
[AIZAWA] Class 1-B didn't
take into account Bakugo's

[PRESENT MIC]
Bakugo is a merciless force!

332
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,583
What a point hog!

333
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,916
That was a shield break
heard 'round the arena,

334
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,958
and I can't wait
to watch the replay!

335
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:42,208
Now! We're going after
Deku and Todoroki.

336
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,166
[IZUKU] It was the first
time I used my power

337
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,625
against a person.

[IZUKU]
This'll be fine.

I'm not actually
going to hit him.

340

I'm just slicing through
the air to take out

My left side. What am I doing?

00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,666
[IZUKU] My hand hurts,
but it's not broken!

344
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,250
He's turned the bands around
to hide their point values.

345
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,708
But he put the ten million
one on last, right?

346
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,458
So it must be on top!

347
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,250

I've got it!

348

With just 11 seconds left,

Team Midoriya's
back in the game!

352
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,291
Uh, wait a minute.

353
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,958
Please tell me I got something
wrong with my eyes.

354
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,291
[IZUKU]
They tricked us.

355
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,250
We mixed the headbands up.

356
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,791
There's no way we'd
leave the prize on top.

357
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,500
You underestimate us.

358
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,541
Todoroki. Better watch yourself.

359
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,833
That was too close!

00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,375
[PRESENT MIC]
Oh, no!

361
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,958
Team Midoriya didn't get the
ten million points after all!

362
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,000
[IZUKU]
Only 70 points. It's not enough.

363
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,458
The game is almost over!

364
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,958

And with that, the second round

Are you okay, man?

Damn it.

383
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:57,375
Now, let's take a look at who
our top four teams are!

384
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:01,208
In first place, Team Todoroki!

385
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,833
We ended in first place,

386
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,708
but it was too
close for comfort.

387
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,958
I'm sorry. I let
everyone down, didn't I?

388
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,250
That's not true.
You're the reason we won.

389
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,666
Thank goodness for that
special move of yours.

390
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,666
[PRESENT MIC]
In second place, Team Bakugo!

391
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,666
Ugh. We were so
close to first place.

392
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,791
Meh. Sure.

393
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,541
But we're movin' on,
so it's all good.

394
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,708
I don't think our leader
would agree with you.

395
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,541

is Testute-- Wait, what?

they come back from the dead?

When Todoroki was shaken
by your first attack...

[TOKOYAMI]
Still, I got one.

410
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,500
It was around his head, where
his guard was the weakest.

411
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,083
Midoriya. You're the one who
created the opening for me.

412
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,708
And ensured our advancement.

place is Team Midoriya!

[TODOROKI] I said I'd
never use this to attack.

420
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,333
But as soon as
I was overwhelmed,

421
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,333
I broke my own promise.

win and I'll end up

Suddenly we had zero points
and it was all over.

432
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,625
Maybe it was some
sort of karmic punishment.

433
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:18,000
For taking the tiny one's
headband. It was so underhanded.

only asked me to join

because I could
melt Todoroki's ice.
