Tokoyami is quick and can attack

But, looking at
that another way,

59
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,791
it means he's weak
at close range.

Wow, I never thought about
his powers like that.

Nice one, man!

[POWER LOADER]
Heh.

170
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,541
It was kind of a risky move, but
it put a quick end to the match.

171
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,583
And, you managed to get
your friend out of the ring

without getting
yourself injured.

All in all, not bad.

You pass. Congrats.

Thank you very much.

They're both amazing!

I promise I will strive
to be the perfect hero.

Uh, well. Sometimes at least.

It's our turn now.

Oh. No.

It's okay.

With our opponent,
I don't blame you.

But, I have a plan
in mind for us.

Yaoyorozu.

Listen, I want you to keep
making small objects.

197
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,166
When you stop being able to,
it means Mr. Aizawa's close by.

198
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,958
[PRESENT MIC]
And, I'm back!

199
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,791
That's Class 1-A's
homeroom teacher,

00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,166
Shota Aizawa.

201
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,208
He can erase the Quirks
of whoever he sees,

202
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,666
but the effect ends
when he blinks.

203
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,500
[TODOROKI] Our success will
depend on which one of us

204
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,750
finds the other first. Once we
spot him, I'll draw him to me.

205
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,208
Then you can run
to the escape gate

206
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,791
and win this thing for us.

207
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,958
Just stay close
to me until then.

208
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,416
C'mon. Hurry up and
start making things.

209
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,208
Sure. No problem.

210
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,208
[TODOROKI]
Um.

211
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,291
I guess those work okay,
but what are they?

212
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,333
Oh, these, things?

213
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,625
They're just
Russian nesting dolls.

214
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,208
[TODOROKI]
Right.

215
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,708
Let me know if you notice your
Quirk acting strangely at all.

216
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,083
[YAOYOROZU] I'd expect nothing
less from you, Todoroki.

217
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,416
[TODOROKI]
What do you mean?

218

[YAOYOROZU] You were able
to come up with a plan

219

to use against
Mr. Aizawa so quickly.

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,916
You knew exactly what was
best as soon as we started.

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,541

This is nothing.

222

[YAOYOROZU]
No. You're wrong.

223
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,083
[YAOYOROZU] As students
who got into UA through

from the same place.

225

But in terms of the practical
skills that a hero needs,

226
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,333
I haven't really managed to do
anything that stands out.

During the cavalry battle,
I just followed your orders.

228
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,583
And then when it was
my turn to fight,

229
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,041

I could do anything.

then you should be acting.

I would suggest that
you prioritize evasion

236
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,958
since I've taken your
power from you.

237

I was always going
to catch you first

Do whatever you want.

some kind of ninja?

from when you faced

252

I know about your Quirks

253
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,666
and what you can do.

254
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,500
I'm perfectly prepared
to defeat you both.

255
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,958
Your plan places most
of the burden on yourself.

256
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,500
It's nice you tried to be
considerate to the girl,

257
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,125
but maybe you
should have actually

258
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,875
talked this over with her.

259
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,500

[panting]

261
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,291
[YAOYOROZU] How much farther
until I'm at the gate?

262
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,000
Is there a shorter
route I should take?

263
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,833
I-Is Todoroki okay?
Is this right?

264
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,416
Should I take the time
and make something

265
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,250
to help me go faster?
Can I make it?

266
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,666
Will I be able to pass this way?

267
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,583
Wait. Where am I running to?

268

Can I do this? Or am I
going to fail us?

Let's see which
of us is stronger!

277
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,333
[YAOYOROZU] I don't have a
chance against my own teacher.

Changing direction?

282
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,791
She let him make
all the decisions.

283
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,958
Comparing herself to Todoroki,

284
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,250
she decided that he was
the superior student.

285
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,625
For better or for worse,
he never seems to hesitate much.

286
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,666
And she's lost her ability
to trust in her own

287

instincts and reactions.

288
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,166
Emotionally, she's still
a child of 15.

289
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,041
I'd like to help her
regain her confidence.

But that's not my job right now.

291

[AIZAWA]
Maybe you should have actually

292
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,000
talked this over with her.

293

[TODOROKI]
Now that I think about it,

294
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,708

had something to say.

[YAOYOROZU]
Should I save Todoroki?

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,750
Or run? What's the right answer?

304
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,458
What should I do?

305
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,583

a plan, don't you?

306
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,500
Sorry, I should've asked before,
and not told you what to do.

But you have an idea, right?

Your plan didn't work,

When we were voting
for class rep,

315

you had two votes, remember?

00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,500
One of those votes was mine!

317
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,625
Because I thought you would be
best at leading our class!

00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,000
[YAOYOROZU]
I'm pathetic, but maybe...

319
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,500
[AIZAWA]
Giving up?

320
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,125
[YAOYOROZU]
Not yet.

321
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,291
Todoroki, close your eyes!

322
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,583
What are these?

323
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,833
[AIZAWA]
Flash grenades?

324
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,833
You're right. I have an idea.

325
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,958
A plan for us to win!

326
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,041
This final exam isn't over.

327
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,416
We can still beat Mr. Aizawa!

328
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,583
So, you've got a strategy.

329
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,833
Yes.

330
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,583
I've been thinking about
it from the beginning.

331
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,625
His weakness.

332
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,375
All right, just tell
me what to do.

333
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,416
[gasps]

334
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,041
[AIZAWA]
As a result of my injuries.

335
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,500
I can't use my Quirk
for as long,

336
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,791
and I have to rest more
in between erasures.

337
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,208
If she chose her attack
because she noticed that,

338
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,250
she's pretty smart.

339
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,500
Yaoyorozu!

340
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,166
[TODOROKI]
Fire!

341
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,916
Crap. He erased it!

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,666
Todoroki. We have to hide.

343
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,333
Together!

344
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,625
Since he was injured, his
Quirk has become unstable!

345
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,708
[TODOROKI] Because of what
happened at the USJ?

346
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,500
So, we're going to exploit that.

347
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,000
Not yet.

348
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,041
For now, we just need to get
out of his field of vision.

349
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,708
It's all a matter of timing.

350
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,625
We're going to pass this final.

351
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,041
Timing?

352
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,833
How is getting out of his sight
gonna help us with that?

353
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,833
He can still take our
Quirks whenever he sees us.

354
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,500
[YAOYOROZU]
Just do as I tell you.

355
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,666
Keep checking to see if you
can use your ice power, okay?

356
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,416
Not fast enough, kids!

357
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,291
[YAOYOROZU] He's wrong
to think he'll be able to

358
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,666
keep our powers erased
the whole time.

359
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,416
There will definitely
be a single moment...

360
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,791
A brief interval when
Mr. Aizawa blinks

361
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,791
before he can use
his Quirk again.

362
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,333
[TODOROKI]
This is it.

363
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,416
[YAOYOROZU]
And I'll be counting on you

364
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,833
in that moment to attack.

365
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,083
Like you did at
the sports festival.

366
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,833
A giant ice wall!

367
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,166
[AIZAWA]
Todoroki's biggest move.

368
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,750
They were waiting for this.

369
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,208
[AIZAWA] They took advantage
of their opponent.

370
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,458
Hit me where it hurts.

371
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,000
[TODOROKI] I blocked him
with the wall the moment

372
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,916
my Quirk came back.
We can use our powers again.

373
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,208
So can you tell me the
rest of your plan now?

374
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,916
Is that Aizawa's
scarf you're making?

375
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,291
It is.

376
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,833
I don't know the
material it's made of

377
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,791
or precisely how
it's constructed,

378
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,666
so it's not exactly the same.

379
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,000
But I created my own version

380
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,875
with a special material
woven into it.

381
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,583
Since this is
a residential area,

382
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,375
we must keep collateral
damage to a minimum.

383
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,750
And he moves his own
restraining bonds so quickly.

384
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,375
It makes it difficult
to catch him.

385
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,500
So, you see, here is my plan.

386
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,458
[OCHACO] Huh, why isn't
Mr. Aizawa going after them?

387
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,833
[IZUKU]
He might have overused his eyes.

388
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,291
[YAOYOROZU]
What do you think, Todoroki?

389
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,541
I believe this has the
highest chance of success.

390
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,916
Or, at least, it's better
than trying to run.

391
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,458
[YAOYOROZU sighs]

392
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,708
[YAOYOROZU]
We'll only get one chance.

393
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,750
So is this all right with you?

394
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,791
Yeah. No complaints here.

395
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,333
[AIZAWA]
The escape gate is behind me.

396
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,125
It'll be better to watch
the approach from here

397
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,416
than to try and chase them.

398
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,166
[YAOYOROZU]
I have a plan for us to win!

399
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,375
We can still beat Mr. Aizawa!

400
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,750
Let's see it.

401
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,875
Disguises.

402
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,208
I can't use my Quirk
if I can't see them.

403
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,041
But they're at
a disadvantage, too!

404
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,958
[AIZAWA] The upper halves
were just mannequins!

405
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,000
[YAOYOROZU]
Now, I just have to launch it.

406
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:41,916
[YAOYOROZU gasps]

407
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,375
[AIZAWA]
A catapult?

408
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,083
[AIZAWA]
It's a diversion!

409
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,708
Todoroki! Blast your flames now!

410
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,750
[TODOROKI grunts]

411
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,875
[AIZAWA]
He's not aiming for me. Why not?

412
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,000
[YAOYOROZU] I'm not sure
we have a chance of beating

413
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,625
you in a full battle,
Mr, Aizawa, but that's okay.

414
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,541
[YAOYOROZU]
Nitinol alloy.

415
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,125
Have you heard of it?

416
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,500
When heated, it returns to its
original shape in an instant.

417
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,041
It's a metal with shape memory!

418
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,083
[AIZAWA]
Well, isn't that impressive.

419
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,208
[TODOROKI] It went exactly
according to your plan.

420
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,541
It was almost a
little too smooth.

421
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,125
Honestly, it shouldn't
have worked out.

422
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,750
When I was about to
trigger the catapult,

423
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,458
I made a big mistake.

424
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,958
Mr. Aizawa noticed,
but still jumped away.

425
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,750
Even though he could
have stopped me easily.

426
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,666
I think he allowed
himself to be captured

427
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,458
by my plan on purpose.

428
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,833
I was just trying to see
what Todoroki would do.

429
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,875
You were in my sights,
but he still

430
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,875
had a cloth over him, remember?

431
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,000
I thought he'd try to freeze me.

432
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,125
So I decided it would be
best for me to back off.

433
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,791
In doing so, it looks
like I ended up

434
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,333
playing right into your hands.

435
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:06,125
[sighs] It really was
just a matter of timing,

436
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,791
like you said, huh?
Thanks, teammate.

What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

[YAOYOROZU]
No. It's nothing, really!

440
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,291
If you feel nauseous,
there's a pressure point

--[YAOYOROZU] No, I told you,

[buzzer blares]

447

[ANNOUNCER 34A]
Team Todoroki and Yaoyorozu

448
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,458
have passed the final exam!

449
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,958
[IZUKU] The fifth match
is currently in progress.

450
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,291
Team Uraraka and Aoyama
against Thirteen.

451
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,500
It's almost over.

452
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,708
Ah! Oh, man, but we
were so close!

453

[THIRTEEN] There's no way I'll
let you get away that easily!

454
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,041
[OCHACO]
It's getting even stronger

455
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,333
the closer Thirteen gets!

456
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,875
[THIRTEEN]
I'm not great at combat,

457
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,125
but I am excellent at capturing.

458
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,208
It looks like escaping
from Thirteen's

459
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,833
Black Hole Quirk is
next to impossible.

460
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,083
[IZUKU]
They need a plan to break free.

461
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,083
Ah! I guess you
could say this Quirk

462
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,833
really sucks, doesn't it?

This is no joke.

474
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,583
What is your problem?

475
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,958
I have no flaws!

476
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,958
[OCHACO]
This isn't good. We're trapped.

477
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,416
Gotta figure out how
to get outta this!

478
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,041
Okay. Come on!

479
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,291
What would Deku do
at a time like this?

480
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,291
[AOYAMA]
Hey.

481
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,208
Not right now, I'm thinking.

482
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,833
About Izuku Midoriya?

483
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,958
Ah, how sweet.

484
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,208
Huh?

485
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:28,000
[AOYAMA]
Is it... because you like him?

486
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,166
[IZUKU] Here's the preview!
The finals continue!

and Hakagure against Snipe!

491
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,375
Everyone's giving it their
all to become heroes!

492
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,250
[IZUKU sniffles] Sorry, I'm
just really moved right now.

493
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,208
[OCHACO]
Hey, Deku?

494
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,541
[IZUKU]
What's up, Uraraka?

495
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,541
[OCHACO] Um, I know you're
having a moment and all,

496
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,250
but Mineta's running away!

497
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,250
[IZUKU] Next time:
"Stripping the Varnish"!

498
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,500
[OCHACO] Aw, Sero goes
night-night on someone's lap.

499
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,416
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

500
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
[IZUKU, OCHACO]
Plus Ultra!
