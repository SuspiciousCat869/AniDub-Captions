that I don't have to rely
on his damned fire Quirk.

00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm going to show him
that I reject his power,

00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,791
and I can take first place
without using it.

You think you can win
with half your strength?

Look at me, Todoroki.

You haven't managed to put
a single scratch on me yet.

[TODOROKI] Why are you putting
yourself through this?

[TODOROKI]
I will reject you.

00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,583
[AUDIENCE 24A]
So Midoriya was eliminated

25
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,375
in the quarterfinals.

26
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,541
[AUDIENCE 24B]
Well, that's what he gets

27
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,041
for provoking that guy.

28
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,791
[AUDIENCE 24C] Do you think
that was part of some plan?

29
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,583
Otherwise, why egg
him on so much?

30
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,916
[AUDIENCE 24D]
He was there to beat Todoroki,

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,250
but it almost seemed like
he was happy to lose.

32
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,583
[AUDIENCE 24E] Either way,
they were both crazy strong.

33
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,208
[AUDIENCE 24F] Sure, but you
can't be a good pro

34
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,708
if you get injured every
time you use your Quirk.

35
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,500
[AUDIENCE 24G] He attacked
even though it hurt 'im.

Not gonna tell me to get lost?

42
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,291
You need to learn to
control your left side.

43
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:42,291
It's dangerous to release
so much energy like that.

44
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,708
But I'm glad you're
finally seeing reason.

45

Now that you've abandoned
your childish rebellion,

we can get back
to what's important.

After you graduate,
you'll work by my side.

Huh?

You're a fool
to think my feelings

I couldn't do what

[IZUKU, ALL MIGHT gasp]

160
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,458
You must find a new way
for him to use his power.

161
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:57,250
There has to be an option
that's not so self-destructive.

162
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,875
[IZUKU gasps]

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,541
A new way of using
your Quirk. Hm.

164
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,666
[IZUKU]
Hey, All Might.

165
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,833
[ALL MIGHT]
Huh?

166
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,958
[IZUKU]
Remember when you told me

167
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,583
why you came to UA
in the first place?

168
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,416
To find a worthy successor
to inherit One For All.

169
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,416
Yeah.

170
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,541
[IZUKU] I put everything I had
into the sports festival.

171
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,000
But still...

172
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,958
There were other competitors
who fought for the victory

173
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,583
harder than I did.

174
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,541
[IZUKU]
So... Maybe--

175
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,750
[ALL MIGHT] You're thinking
it might be better

176
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,500
for someone else to be
my successor. Yes?

177
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,875
[IZUKU gasps]

178
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,000
[IZUKU]
Yes.

179
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,375
You speak the truth.

180
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:47,125
This place is full of
incredible potential heroes.

181
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,500
One For All is a
crystallization of power.

182
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,375
It bolsters Quirks.

183
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,500
For example,

184
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,750
if Young Todoroki
were to inherit it,

185
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,916
the strength added to his
own Quirk would probably

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,125
make him an
unbeatable superhero.

187
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,833
Then--

188
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,750
[ALL MIGHT] But, you know,
I was Quirkless, too, as a kid.

189
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,458
[IZUKU gasps]

190
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,666
[IZUKU]
Quirkless? Seriously?

191
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,416
Back then it wasn't
as rare of a thing.

192
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,166
But it was still
out of the ordinary.

193
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,958
Even though I didn't
have a power of my own,

194
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,125
I had someone who
believed in my potential.

195
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,708
My master gave me One For All

196
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,916
and raised me to become a hero.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,708
[IZUKU]
You never told me about that!

198
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,541
It's not my fault
you never asked.

199
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,083
Which is honestly surprising.

200
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,333
The number-one hero...
was Quirkless?

201
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,208
[ALL MIGHT]
It's true.

202
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,375
When we first met,

203
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,916
I saw a little of
the old me in you.

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But, kid,

205
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,708
you've gone beyond
my expectations,

206
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,791
time and time again.

207
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,750
One day you're gonna
do incredible things

208
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,916
with One For All. That's
something I truly believe.

[ALL MIGHT] Anyway, the
sports festival isn't over yet.

214
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,000
Get out there--you don't
wanna miss the end.

Hah!

00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,750
Nice try, but that's not gonna
work on me, Explosion Boy.

[KATSUKI]
He's still going strong.

237

But how long can he
keep his Hardening up?

Kirishima! Go straight
for his chin!

[HONENUKI] What you're
rooting for him now, man?

240
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,708
Kirishima and Kacchan.

241
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,375
So that would mean...

242
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,541
Iida and Tokoyami finished
their matches already.

Bakugo's having a heck of a time

00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,666
dodging Kirishima's
fierce attacks!

248
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,250
[IZUKU] Whoa, Kacchan's
on the defensive?

249
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,833
I guess Kirishima's Quirk
seems simple on the surface,

250
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,666
but it's still effective.

I take it that your surgery
must have gone well.

I'm up against Todoroki.

I watched your fight
with him closely.

259
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,750
Maybe I can learn from it.

00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,625
Yeah.

00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,250
Is Ingenium excited that you've
blown through the bracket?

262
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,166
He must be so proud
of his little brother.

263

[TENYA]
Mm. I'm not sure.

264
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,166
I called him earlier,
but he was working.

Oh. Sorry.

No. It's for the best.

267
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,541
When we do talk, maybe I'll
get to tell him that I won.

268
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,375
[TENYA] Ingenium is
an unmatched commander

It seems to be
working this time!

274

You've been straining
to keep your body

275
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,666
rock-hard this
whole fight, right?

276
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,208
But that means you're
overusing your Quirk.

277
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,875
And sooner or later,
you'll fall apart.

There.

It looks like your

me up enough to walk.

you be taking it easy?

I wanna watch these
matches in person.

This is where everyone's efforts
are finally gonna pay off.

303
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,708
[PRESENT MIC] The first
match of the semifinals!

304
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,333
Both come from hero families,
making this a battle of elites!

305

From the hero course,
Tenya Iida! Versus...

His classmate, Shoto Todoroki!

[TENYA] I can't negate his
attacks like Midoriya did.

308
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,041
Plus if he uses his flames now,
he's even more dangerous.

309
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,333
Focus.

00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,291
Recipro... Burst!

319
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,500
[TENYA] I have ten seconds
before my engines stall!

320
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,041
Which means I have
to win this right now!

321
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,333
[PRESENT MIC]
Look at that speed!

00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,375
[TODOROKI grunts]

323
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,291
[GROUP gasps]

324
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,375
[SERO]
That was a heavy hit.

325
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,166
I didn't know he
could kick like that.

326
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,541
[ENDEAVOR growls]

327
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,041
[TENYA]
Eight seconds left.

328
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,500
I've got this.

329
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,666
I'll throw him out of
bounds before he can--

[gasps]

331

[TENYA]
My muffler's blocked!

332
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,791
When did you--?

333
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,458
[TODOROKI]
When you kicked me.

334
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,291
I've only been showing off
ranged attacks today.

335
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,666
You forgot I could do precision
moves, too, didn't you?

336
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,750
I was trying to
dodge your Recipro.

337
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,000
But it was too fast
to avoid, even for me.

338
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,833
Iida has been immobilized.

339
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,041
Todoroki advances!

340
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,875
[PRESENT MIC]
Todoroki moves on to the finals

341
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,916
without even using
his flames again!

342
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,750
[TODOROKI]
Maybe I don't need you.

343
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,583
[ENDEAVOR] Why are you
holding back? Don't be a fool.

344
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,125
Poor Iida.

345
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,375
I'm sorry, brother.

[STAIN]
Fame... Money...

347
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,750
That's what all of you
who call yourselves

348
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,958
heroes are really after.

349
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,375
[STAIN]
But you bastards are not heroes.

350
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,583
[STAIN]
Except him.

351
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,791
The only one with
permission to kill me.

[STAIN]
All Might is worthy.

[CROWD cheers]

354
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,875
[PRESENT MIC]
And now, Bakugo versus Tokoyami!

355
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,291
Bakugo's vicious rushes
are unstoppable!

356
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,833
That thing is so damn annoying!

357
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,333
Die! Loser!

358
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,708
[TOKOYAMI]
Such brutality.

359
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,583
[PRESENT MIC]
Tokoyami has advanced this far

360
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,416
with an almost unbeatable Quirk.

361
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,666
But this time, it looks
like he's on the ropes!

362
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,166
What is that bird-brain doing?

363
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,916
He attacked super hard
when he was up against us!

364
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,625
[YAOYOROZU]
There must be a reason.

365
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,083
Dark Shadow.

366
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,458
He can't go on the offensive
because of all the light.

367
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,250
This matchup couldn't
be any worse.

368
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,625
Most people don't know
about his weakness.

369
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,916
Kacchan may not have
figured it out yet.

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,791
[TOKOYAMI]
I underestimated him.

371
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,958
I don't have any time to
recharge Dark Shadow's power.

372
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,666
I'm running out of darkness!

[KATSUKI grunts]

00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,458
[TOKOYAMI] Is he just
trying to wear me down?

375
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,291
It looks like his moves
are getting faster!

[TOKOYAMI]
Tell me, Bakugo.

384
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,375
Did you know of
my weakness before?

385
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,708
I figured it out by attacking
over and over again.

386
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,000
It was a pretty bad
matchup for you.

387

Almost feel bad.

388
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,750
But you're done.

[MIDNIGHT]
Tokoyami gives up!

Bakugo's the winner
of this match!

392
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,750
[PRESENT MIC] That means
our final fight will be

393
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,833
between Todoroki and Bakugo!

394
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,125
[OCHACO] Man, what a
bummer. Poor Tokoyami.

395
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,500
I totally thought the
bird would win for sure.

396
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,250
I guess that means his Quirk's
not invincible after all.

397
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,208
So light is his
weakness. Interesting.

398
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,000
And Bakugo's the kinda guy
who would exploit that.

399
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,666
You chose a terrifying
person to make your enemy.

400
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,166
Not at all.

401
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,333
Just luck that his Quirk worked
so well against that guy.

402
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,125
These finals have been
one big showcase

match will be like.

408

Well, that's a relief.

[TENYA]
Mother?

415
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:44,208
[TENYA] Hello, Mom? I hate
to tell you this, but I lost.

[TENYA'S MOM] No, son,
I'm not calling about that.

But, Tenya, please
listen carefully.

It's your brother.

A villain got Tensei!

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,291
[STAIN] You haven't even
noticed it, have you?

422
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:15,541
This warped society mired
by hypocrisy and vanity.

423

That's fine, I'll open
your eyes, "heroes."

424
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,750
You will see the world
that you've created.

425

[KUROGIRI] Please remain calm.
We are of the same mind.

426

428
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:43,708
I heard of your exploits and
wanted to meet you in person.

429
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,625
I think you'll be interested

[IZUKU] The UA Festival
is coming to an end!

434
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,666
[ALL MIGHT]
The final match will be between

435
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,916
Young Todoroki and Young Bakugo.

436
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,666
So, who do you
think'll win, kiddo?

437
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,416
[IZUKU] Well, Kacchan has
an all-purpose Quirk

438
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,000
that can be used for
attacking and moving,

439
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,041
and he's clever enough
to come up with

440
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,833
solid tactics and strategies.

441
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:45,875
However...

442
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,416
[ALL MIGHT]
Okay! My bad for asking.

443
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,791
Just, tell us the title!

444
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,375
[IZUKU] Oh! Next time
it's "Todoroki vs. Bakugo"!
