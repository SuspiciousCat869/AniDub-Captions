[IZUKU]
It's been two days since Hosu,

2
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:19,125
and five days since Class 1-A
started our internships.

3
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,000
Because my injuries from Stain
aren't fully healed yet,

4
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,875
I'm stuck at the hospital.

5
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,833
[IZUKU] Everyone on the news is
obsessed with the Hero Killer.

6
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,333
The story being reported
is that seven pro heroes

7
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,458
and three high school
students stumbled upon him.

8
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,750
Then Endeavor rushed in and
took care of the situation

9
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,416
all by himself.

10
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,250
[IZUKU] Of course, that's
just the official cover

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,041
from the police department.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,041
[IZUKU]
The chief was true to his word.

13
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,958
Me, Iida, and Todoroki were
never named in connection

14
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,625
to the Hero Killer.

15
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,583
Our injuries were
explained as being caused

16
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:57,291
by accidents that happened
during our internships.

17
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,583
The day Iida got his
exam results and realized

18
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,375
one of his arms was
seriously damaged,

19
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,083
he ended up going back home
to his parents' house.

20
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,458
so his mom could
take care of him.

21
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,083
Todoroki's injuries
weren't all that bad.

22
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,458
I'm returning to my internship.

23
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,208
Back to your dad's agency?

24
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,583
[TODOROKI] I still wanna learn
everything I can from him.

25
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,958
Besides, they're
saying he defeated

26
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,916
the Hero Killer, even
though it was actually

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,875
his son who helped out.

28
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,166
I wanna see if there's
any shame on his face.

29
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,791
[IZUKU] Just when I think you
can't get any more intense,

30
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,666
your dad comes up.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,083
[IZUKU]
Huh.

32
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,458
I wonder how everyone
else is doing.

33
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,625
[BEST JEANIST] It's possible
some villains were inspired

34
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,500
by what happened in Hosu.

35
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,833
That means they could
be feeling bolder.

36
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,041
This may just be a patrol,
but keep your guard up.

37
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,416
[BEST JEANIST]
Here's a question for you.

39
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,208
Patrols are mainly
meant to deter villains

40
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,333
from committing any crimes.

41
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,875
But they also have
a secondary purpose.

42
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,291
What is it?

43
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,041
If we see some bad guys,
we can beat 'em up on the spot.

44
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,375

[BEST JEANIST] The answer is:

[BEST JEANIST] Have you
really forgotten everything

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,916

Yeah. Fine.

Listen up! I wasn't helpless.

I was just coming up
with ways to fight him.

66
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,958
Sometimes a hero has to
pretend he's been caught.

You really think <i>I</i> would lose?

I'm the new number one hero!

[BEST JEANIST sighs]
He has too much pride.

73
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,500
It would be one thing if he
channeled all that passion

74
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,375
toward becoming a hero,
but at this rate,

75
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,500
he could turn out quite poorly.

76
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,750

So, then, what do I do with him?

[GUNHEAD] Let's start with
how you'd fight against

78
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,708
someone wielding a blade.

00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,291

Are you sure?

81
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,541
[GUNHEAD]
There's no need to hold back.

[yells]

84
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,166
[GUNHEAD] When someone's
waving a knife around,

85
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,333
your best bet's to
keep your distance.

86
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,250
If they attack directly,
plant one leg

87
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,875
and use it to pivot and dodge.

88
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,750
Then, grab their wrist
and back at the same time.

89
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,875
Now you can take 'em down!

Twist your attacker's wrist

93
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,583
to make them drop their knife.

94
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,375
Make sure you kick it
away for your own safety.

95
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,625

It turns out, the reality
is very different.

I always figured
being a hero would be

00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,625
super glamorous,
but then I discovered

145
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,291
it was a lot of patrols
and cleaning up.

[SIRIUS]
So, what are we dealing with?

205
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,791
[SELKIE] The Coast Guard
got a tip that there were

206
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,083
stowaways on the
trade ship, <i>Nysan</i> ,

207
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,541
but things may not
be what they seem.

208
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,000
Officials inspected
the ship, but they didn't

209
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,458
find any stowaways
hiding on the vessel.

210
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,500
Upon further investigation,
though, they discovered

211
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,208
that important cargo from the
ship's freight list was missing.

212
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,458
I'm sure you all know
what that means.

213
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,458
What do you think, Froppy?

214
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,291
It's likely that, before
the Coast Guard arrived,

215
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,541
the stowaways moved the
cargo to another ship

216
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,666
somewhere close by and fled
the scene of the crime.

217
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,666
In fact, it's possible
that the stowaways

218
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,375
had plants on the ship.

219
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,666
Correct!

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,875

It's our job to
find these criminals.

223
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,958
Based on the information
we have, they probably

224
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,666
escaped on a small boat.

We will deliver them
to the Coast Guard!

00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,583
Considering the
<i>Nysan's</i> position,

227
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,333
this is the general
location that would make

228
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,333
the most sense as
an escape route.

to working with you again.

476
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,583
Hope to see you soon, Froppy.

477
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,208
[TSUYU]
Ribbit, ribbit.

478
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,458
[IZUKU]
All Might!

479
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,458
I'm finally back
from my internship!

480
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,541
[ALL MIGHT]
You went through a lot

481
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,208
in the Hosu incident, huh?

482
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,208
I'm sorry I wasn't
there for you.

483
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,375
[IZUKU] All Might,
what do you have to tell me?

484
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,625
[ALL MIGHT]
The time has come for me

485
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,000
to be completely honest.

486
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,250
About myself, One For All,

487
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,291
and the mission
entrusted to you.

488
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,333
[IZUKU]
Next time:

489
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,750
"Listen Up!
A Tale from the Past."

490
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,416
[ALL MIGHT]
It's a super important episode

491
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,083
you're not allowed to miss!

492
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,625
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

493
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:58,416
[IZUKU, ALL MIGHT]
Plus Ultra!
