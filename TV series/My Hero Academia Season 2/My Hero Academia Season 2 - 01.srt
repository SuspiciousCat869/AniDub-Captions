1
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,666
[IZUKU] The first incident
was in Qingqing City.

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,166
An extraordinary child was
born who radiated light.

3
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,750
[IZUKU] After that, reports
of people with superpowers

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,291
popped up across the globe.

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,875
No one knew what was
causing these Quirks.

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,500
The world became a
superhuman society,

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,791
with about 80 percent of
the population possessing

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,458
some uncanny ability.

9
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,958
Our streets looked like
scenes from comic books.

10
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,250
As cities swirled with
chaos and confusion,

11
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,375
a new profession dominated
our collective consciousness.

12
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,541
It was an age of heroes.

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,666
[ALL MIGHT laughs]

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,166
[ALL MIGHT]
Fear not, citizens.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,875
Hope has arrived.

16
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,875
Because I am here.

17
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,583
[yells]

18
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,833
[giggles] He's the coolest
in the whole world!

19
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:03,291
And once I get my Quirk, I'm
gonna be a hero just like him!

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,375
[IZUKU'S MOM] I'm sorry, Izuku.
I wish things were different.

21
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,833
[IZUKU]
I was born without superpowers.

22
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,333
Quirkless.

23
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,583
Just an ordinary kid.

24
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:21,416
I wanted to be like him
so badly, but I wasn't.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,333
And so, I started to
give up on my dream.

26
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,708
[IZUKU grunts]

27
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,791
[IZUKU] Still--even though my
brain told me I could never

28
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:37,375
be a pro, in my heart I knew
all I wanted was to be a hero.

29
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:40,541
And, thanks to the people who
guided me and supported me...

30
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,625
[IZUKU]
I am here now. On my way.

31
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,875
[IZUKU]
My dream is becoming a reality.

32
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,583
[IZUKU]
And though I've had setbacks,

33
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,625
I keep pushing forward.

34
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,500
[IZUKU]
My journey is just beginning.

35
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,208
You see, this is the story...

36
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,416
[IZUKU] ...of how I become
the world's greatest hero.

37
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,166
[NEWSCASTER 14A]
Up next: an update

38
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,083
on yesterday's
incident at the UA

39
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,333
rescue training center
where hero course students

40
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,125
were attacked by
a gang of villains.

41
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,750
According to new
police officials,

42
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,541
the criminal forces
called themselves

43
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,041
"The League of Villains."

44
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,416
Investigators have reportedly
uncovered that this group

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,250
has been plotting to kill
UA teacher and popular hero

46
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,500
All Might since the
spring of this year.

47
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,916
Police arrested 72
villains at the scene,

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,750
but the League's leader escaped.

49
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,750
His whereabouts are unknown.

50
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,750
[ALL MIGHT]
Greetings. The air is warm here.

51
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,416
It feels like summer is
just around the corner.

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,666
I hope this letter
finds you well, sir.

53
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,208
In good health and
even better spirits.

54
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,583
This semester,
I took a position

55
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,875
as a teacher at UA High School.

56
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,416
Heh. That's right.

57
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,750
I'm now guiding the next
generation of heroes.

58
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,416
I was hoping to
find someone worthy

59
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,250
of inheriting my power among the
elite students at the school.

60
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,833
A hero-in-training with
outstanding test scores

61
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,625
and a powerful Quirk.

62
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,291
However, before I
ever began my tenure

63
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,416
at UA, I met a young man.

64
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,958
Even though he was weak,

65
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,541
and had no Quirk of his own,
he showed incredible bravery.

66
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,291
He rushed into
a dangerous situation

67
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,250
that caused pro heroes,
including myself, to hesitate,

68
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,375
and managed to save
the life of a classmate.

69
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,916
He may not have had
a plan when he acted,

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,166
but he knew he had
to do something.

71
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,583
I feel like watching
this young man

72
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,375
spring into action taught
me something that day,

73
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,583
and it reminded me of
the virtues I must embody

74
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,583
in order to call
myself a pro. A hero.

75
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:20,208
That's why... I meant it
when I said to him:

76
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,791
"Young man. You, too,
can become a hero."

77
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,291
Soon after that, I told
this pupil the secret

78
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,833
of my Quirk, and proposed
that I transfer it to him.

79
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,958
This ability I have,
that's been passed on

80
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,541
from person to person,
cultivated, and made stronger,

81
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,000
the crystallization of
power that binds itself

82
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,458
to a courageous heart for
the good of those in need:

83
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,958
One For All.

84
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,875
He accepted without
hesitation, and I began

85
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,041
training him for the trials
he'd need to overcome

86
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,125
in order to be accepted
into the hero course

87
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,208
at UA High School.

88
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,625
Even though he
sometimes struggled

89
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,375
with his newfound abilities.

90
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,958
he never stopped fighting,
and gave 100 percent

91
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:02,375
as he tried to
harness One For All.

92
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,916
I don't like to
toot my own horn,

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,250
but I believe I found
the perfect person

94
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,208
to pass my Quirk on to.

95
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,125
He has shown me time
and again that he has

96
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,125
what it takes to be a real hero.

97
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm still quite new to
the role of instructor.

98
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,875
The day may come when
I must trouble you,

99
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,708
my old teacher, for advice.

100
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll be counting
on your wisdom

101
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,583
and patience when
that time comes.

102
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,666
Until then, please
take care of yourself

103
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,958
as the seasons begin to change.

104
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,500
I'll continue to
keep you updated

105
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:34,791
about what's happening.
Sincerely yours.

106
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:39,625
[GRAN TORINO] So, Toshinori
has found a worthy successor.

107
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,416
[TSUKAUCHI] Our investigators
are trying to learn

108
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,625
everything they can about this
so-called "League of Villains."

109
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,750
We've made some progress,
but we can't find anything

110
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,791
on this Shigaraki so far.

111
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,333
We've searched our
records for men

112
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,416
in their 20s or 30s who
are registered as having

113
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,416
some sort of
disintegration Quirk,

114
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,541
but so far, we've come up empty.

115
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,125
Same for the Warp Gate
villain, Kurogiri.

116
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,916
So they're not citizens
or they're using aliases.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,083
Hard to find, either way.

118
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,750
So what you're really saying
is we don't know anything.

119
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,458
[SNIPE]
We've gotta track 'em down.

120
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,083
I shot their ringleader, but
once he heals up he'll probably

121
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,541
try pullin' somethin'
like this again.

122
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,083
What a pain.

123
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,791
He did seem like the type.

124
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,958
Is something on
your mind, All Might?

125
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,875
[ALL MIGHT] The attack
on the USJ was too bold.

126
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,083
No sane adult would
ever attempt it.

127
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,083
The ringleader kept monologuing
about the reasons he was there.

128
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,666
And he bragged about
Nomu's many Quirks,

129
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,500
but he never said a word
about his own powers.

130
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,458
When things didn't go his way,
he was visibly upset.

131
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,666
Like he was gonna
throw a tantrum.

132
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,541
Ah, I guess bragging
about Nomu's Quirks

133
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,500
was a quick way to
draw me into a fight.

134
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,958
That might be true,
yes, but strategically,

135
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,125
it was foolish to reveal
his Quirks up front

136
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,916
instead of keeping
them a secret.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,583
[ALL MIGHT] Shigaraki made
wild, immature claims,

138
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,208
but did so with a
completely straight face.

139
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,583
And he talked about Nomu
like he was some kind of a pet.

140
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,750
It seemed like he'd never
been told "no" before--

141
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,500
like he thought things would
go his way no matter what.

142
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,625
He has the personality

143
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,625
of a spoiled little
brat. A man-child.

144
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,125
A child with incredible
power, though.

145
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,333
It's possible he never
got the Quirk counseling

146
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,125
students receive
in elementary school.

147
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,250
[SNIPE] Maybe so, but it
doesn't really matter now.

148
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,958
[TSUKAUCHI]
There were 72 villains arrested

149
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,416
in the aftermath
of the USJ attack.

150
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,916
They were all small-time thugs

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,958
who usually lurked
around back alleys.

152
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,875
What worries me is
that this "man-child"

153
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,958
got them all to
follow his crazy plan.

154
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,791
They viewed him
as a real leader.

155
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,666
Criminals are starting
to feel more pressure

156
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,875
now that the world is
brimming with heroes.

157
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,583
That could be why they
were so quick to back

158
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,750
such simple-minded villainy.

159
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,666
Guess that makes sense.

[SNIPE] There are plenty a'
people out there lookin'

for a cause to get behind.

162
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,833
So, what can we do to stop them?

163

Well, it is thanks to
you heroes that we have

164
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,333
the time to devote
ourselves to this case.

165
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,375
We'll expand our
investigation and continue

166
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,875
searching for the perpetrators
who planned this attack.

In some ways, he shares common
ground with our students.

They both have
so much potential.

170
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,583
And, like our students,
I suppose it's possible

171
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,541
someone is guiding him,
trying to nurture

attacked the USJ.

178
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,500
I think they wanted us
to have a little break,

I have to make

every aspect of it, until
it's second nature for me.

we're all in the same place.

262

[AIZAWA] Apparently, the
administration thinks this is

263
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,625
a good way to show that
the threat has been handled

264

and our school
is safer than ever.

Plus they're beefing up security
compared to past years.

This event is a huge opportunity
for all students at UA.

most-watched events
in the entire world.

In the past, everyone obsessed
over the Olympic games.

00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,333
But then Quirks
started appearing.

278
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,375
Now, the Olympics
have been drastically

scale and viewership.

For anyone who cares
about competition,

there's only one
tournament that matters.

That's right!

And top heroes everywhere
will be watching.

285
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,000
This is where you get scouted.

After graduating,
a lot of people

289
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,166
join pro agencies as a sidekick.

290
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,291
Yeah, but that's as far
as some people go.

291
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,708
They miss their
chance to go indie

292
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,416
and stay eternal sidekicks.

293
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,708
Actually, that's probably
where you're headed.

294
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,083
You're kinda dumb.

295
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,125
[AIZAWA] It's true that
joining a famous hero agency

296
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,625
can garner you greater
experience and popularity.

297
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,875
That's why the festival matters.

298
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,000
If you wanna go pro
one day, then this event

299
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,000
could open the path for you.

300
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,625
One chance a year.

301
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,666
Three chances in a lifetime.

302
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,833
No aspiring hero can afford
to miss this festival.

303
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,666
[AIZAWA] That means you
better not slack off

We get so few chances.

314
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,666
We have to make
the most of this.

315
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,791
[HAGAKURE] Oh, man, Ojiro,
I'm getting kind of nervous

316
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,041
about the festival.

317
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,083
I have to come up with
a way to get noticed!

318
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,666
--[OJIRO] Uh, sure.
--[HAGAKURE] Maybe with a cheer!

319
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,000
Maybe you should be looking at
a shinier costume or something?

320
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,958
Otherwise, you're gonna
have to try really hard.

321
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,625
My, what's a boy to do?

322
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,291
I stand out even when
I'm standing still.

323
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,750
That means the scouts
won't be able

324
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,791
to take their eyes off me!

325
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,916
Don't you agree?

326
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,375
[sighs] You're so lucky, Shoji.

327
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,166
People are bound to
notice your unique Quirk.

328
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,125
[SHOJI] Sure, but what
matters is that I show them

329
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,458
how useful I can be.

330
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,750
No doubt you'll
make a scene, too.

331
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,833
[KAMINARI growls]

332
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,375
This is gonna be nuts!
Everyone's so excited.

333
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,958
Well, yeah, of course we are!

334
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,666
We enrolled at this school with
the sole aim to become heroes.

335
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,791
So naturally, we're
all getting fired up.

336
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,958
Wow, Iida.

337
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,000
Those are some
interesting moves. Ribbit.

338
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,166
You have to be excited,
too, right, Midoriya?

339
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,125
Well, yeah, of course I am!

340
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,416
And also nervous.

341
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,541
[OCHACO]
Deku! Iida!

342
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,708
--[TENYA] Uh...
--[IZUKU] Ah.

343
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,875
Let's do our best
in the sports festival.

344
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,125
[IZUKU] Uraraka, what
happened to your face?

345
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,541
Seriously, what's up?

346
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,833
You're normally, like,
the most laid back girl ever.

347
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,875
PMS?

348
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,458
[OCHACO grunts]

349
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,708
Everyone! I'm gonna do my best!

350
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,500
[TENYA, IZUKU]
Yeah!

351
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,166
[ASHIDO]
Yeah!

352
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,250
I said, I'm gonna do my best!

353
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,583
--[KIRISHIMA] Got it...
--[SATO] Uh...

354
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,666
[KIRISHIMA]
You okay?

355
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,791
Ya kinda look like
you're losin' it.

356
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,583
[IZUKU]
Now that I think about it...

357
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,333
There's something I've
been meaning to ask her.

358
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,375
[IZUKU]
Hey, Uraraka?

359
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,583
[OCHACO]
What's up?

360
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,208
[IZUKU] Why did you
decide to come to UA?

361
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,000
What made you wanna
be a pro hero?

362
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,500
[OCHACO gasps]
Oh...

363
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,375
Well... Because...

364
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,458
Uh-- For the money?

365
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,083
You wanna be a hero
so you can get rich?

366
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,833
If we're cutting to
the chase, then, yeah.

367
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,625
I'm sorry if it sounds greedy.

368
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,041
You two have such
admirable motivations.

369
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,083
I hope you don't
think less of me now.

370
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,166
Not at all!

371
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,791
Your goal is to
support your wellbeing,

372
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,250
which is a perfectly
admirable ambition to have.

373
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,291
[IZUKU] Mm-hm. It's just
kinda surprising.

374
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,333
[OCHACO sighs]
Well, you see,

375
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,708
my family owns
a construction company,

376
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,666
but we haven't gotten any work
lately, so we're flat broke.

377
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,750
Anyway, this isn't
really something I usually

378
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,500
tell other people, but...

379
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,041
Construction, eh?

380
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,625
[gasps] If she got licensed,
I bet she could use her Quirk

381
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,250
to bring costs down a lot.

382
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,666
And they could sell their
heavy-lifting equipment.

383
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,916
She could float everything!

384
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,166
I know, right?

385
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,166
I've been telling Dad
that since I was a kid!

386
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,250
But...

387
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,791
[OCHACO'S DAD]
You want to work for us?

388
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,833
When I grow up
all big and strong,

389
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,666
I'll help you and Mommy
out any way that I can.

390
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,875
[chuckles]

391
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,583
[OCHACO'S DAD] I really
appreciate the thought, Ochaco.

392
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,541
But as your dad,
I'd be even happier

393
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,041
if you achieved your own dream.

394
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,791
That's the way to make us happy.

395
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:40,916
And if you do make money,

396
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,250
you can take us to
Hawaii or something!

397
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,916
Daddy...

398
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,541
[OCHACO]
I'm gonna become a pro.

399
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,666
I'll sign with a good agency
and make plenty of money.

400
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,791
Then I'll be able to let my
parents have an easy life!

401
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,375
[BOTH gasp]

402
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,166
That's beautiful!

403
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,541
So noble!

404
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,750
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

405
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,625
[IZUKU] She's not here because
of some hero fantasy.

406
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,000
She's more grounded
than any of us.

407
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,625
[ALL MIGHT laughs]

408
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:20,208
Young Midoriya is here!

409
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,208
Whoa, All Might!
What are you doing here?

410
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,208
Lunch! Ya wanna eat with me?

411
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,416
[OCHACO]
That's adorable!

412
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,666
[ALL MIGHT]
Whaddaya say?

413
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,458
Sure thing!

414
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,458
[IZUKU]
Is something wrong?

415
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,625
[OCHACO] I wonder what
he wanted with Deku.

416
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,291
I heard that when
All Might was attacked

417
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,208
by villains during
the USJ incident,

418
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,333
Midoriya tried to
stop them himself.

419
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,125
Perhaps that's what
this is about.

420
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,416
Oh, yeah!

421
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,083
Also, remember what
Asui said on the bus?

422
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,500
That power of yours...

423
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,750
Isn't it a lot like All Might's?

424
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,958
Since their Quirks are
so similar to each other,

425
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,750
it's possible that All Might's
taken a liking to him.

426
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,166
How lucky!

427
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,375
[TODOROKI] All Might and
Izuku Midoriya, huh?

428
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,416
[IZUKU]
Only 50 minutes?

429
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,666
[ALL MIGHT]
Yeah.

430
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,333
That's about how long
I can use my power now.

431
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,125
I overdid it too many times.

432
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,708
That Nomu was a
real tough customer.

433
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,666
He took a lot outta me.

434
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,541
At this point, I can
barely even look like

435
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,750
All Might for an
hour and a half.

436
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,416
I'm so sorry.
I should've just--

437
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,208
--[IZUKU yelps]
--[ALL MIGHT laughs]

438
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,583
[ALL MIGHT] You don't need
to apologize for anything!

439
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,416
Man, we are alike, you and me.

440
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,083
Have some tea.

441
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,333
[IZUKU]
Thanks.

442
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,416
I brought you here to
talk about the festival.

443
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,625
The problem is, you still can't
fully control One For All yet.

444
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,375
So then, what's your plan?

445
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,250
[gasps] Wait, I did once!

446
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,083
When I landed a smash
on that brain villain,

447
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,416
there was no backlash at all!

448
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,833
Oh, that's right,
you did mention that.

449
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,041
What was different
about that smash?

450
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,916
Let's see...

451
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,166
We were facing real villains

452
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,958
and I didn't have
much time to think,

453
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,625
but maybe that's part
of it, since I knew

454
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,208
this wasn't just more training.

455
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,666
[THIRTEEN] I'm sure you're
aware that I have

456
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,375
a powerful Quirk.
It's called Black Hole.

457
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,375
I can use it to suck up
anything and turn it into dust.

458
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,208
But my Quirk could
also very easily

459
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,791
be used to kill.

460
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,833
This was the very
first time, ever,

461
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,666
that I used my power
against a person.

462
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,000
[ALL MIGHT] Hm... Sounds like
you succeeded in subconsciously

463
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,208
putting on the brakes so so you
wouldn't have to kill anyone.

464
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,083
Hey, that's some kind of
progress at least.

465
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,583
[ALL MIGHT]
Tea's gettin' cold.

466
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,666
Oh, right, thank you.

467
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,666
[ALL MIGHT] To be frank,
I don't have much time left

468
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,500
as the world's Symbol of Peace.

469
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,208
Soon, I'll have to
put that title to bed.

470
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,833
No way...

471
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,666
And some villains out there
are startin' to notice that.

472
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,166
Someone has to step up
and keep the people safe.

473
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,708
[gasps]

474
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,708
I gave you my power
for one reason:

475
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,625
'Cause you will be the
hero who takes my place.

476
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,208
[IZUKU] I want to be the
greatest hero in the world!

477
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,000
I want to save people
just like you do.

478
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,708
When they see my fearless
smile, they'll feel safe.

479
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,625
[ALL MIGHT] Do you still
feel the same way you did

480
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,583
when we met? Do you
still wanna be a hero?

481
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,875
Yes.

482
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,958
Excellent.

483
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,958
The time has come
for you to prove it.

484
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,250
[gasps]

485
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,416
This sports festival:

486
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,125
it's something that the pros--

487
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:38,333
no, the entire country will
be watching very closely.

488
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,541
Uh...

489
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,333
I want you to think
of this sports festival

490
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:45,791
as your debut. You are the
fledgling Symbol of Peace.

491
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,708
The next All Might!

492
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,750
Izuku Midoriya.

493
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,791
[ALL MIGHT] I want you to
introduce yourself to the world

494
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,375
and proudly say "I am here!"

495
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,708
[ALL MIGHT] The next
episode preview is here!

496
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,250
[IZUKU] The UA Sports Festival
is finally starting!

497
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,958
[ALL MIGHT] The first event
is an obstacle course

498
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,458
everyone participates in.

499
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,125
And, there's no
limit to Quirk use.

500
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,458
[IZUKU] Doesn't that sound
kind of dangerous?

501
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,458
[ALL MIGHT] Regardless,
you must aim for the top!

502
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,625
Show the world that
you're Izuku Midoriya,

503
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,333
the world's next great hero!

504
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,666
[IZUKU] Next time:
"Roaring Sports Festival"!

505
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,375
[ALL MIGHT] Ooh, don't
miss Young Todoroki

506
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,000
pick a fight with
Young Midoriya!

507
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,875
[IZUKU]
Uh, go beyond!

508
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,375
[IZUKU, ALL MIGHT]
Plus Ultra!
