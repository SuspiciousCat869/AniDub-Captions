1
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,458
[IZUKU] This is a superhuman
society, with 80 percent of us

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,833
possessing some uncanny ability.

3
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,958
Cities swirled with
chaos and confusion

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,750
following the appearance
of these powers,

5
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:23,083
and a new profession emerged.

6
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,750
We call those who
fight for justice

7
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,208
and help others
in need "heroes."

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,916
Oh, by the way,
this is the story of how

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,666
I became the world's
greatest hero!

10
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,583
[AIZAWA] The UA Sports Festival
is about to start.

11
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,083
It's true that joining
a famous hero agency

12
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,000
can garner you greater
experience and popularity.

13
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,541
One chance a year,
three chances in a lifetime.

14
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:22,125
No aspiring hero can afford
to miss this festival.

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,291
[AIZAWA] That means you better
not slack off on your training.

16
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,583
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

17
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,750
[ALL MIGHT]
This sports festival...

18
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,666
It's something that the pros--

19
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,875
no, the entire country will
be watching very closely.

20
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,750
Think of the sports
festival as your debut.

21
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,958
You are the fledgling Symbol
of Peace, the next All Might!

22
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,791
Izuku Midoriya.

23
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,083
You must introduce
yourself to the world,

24
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,458
and proudly say "I am here!"

25
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:06,375
[gasps] But, All Might,
that's your catchphrase!

26
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,541
Besides, what can I do?

27
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,500
You know how the sports
festival is set up, right?

28
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,791
[IZUKU]
Oh, yeah. Of course!

29
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,750
Students are separated
by class year,

30
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,000
and then the support,
business, general studies,

31
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,000
and hero courses all
fight against each other

32
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,000
in a bunch of
preliminary trials.

33
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,541
Whoever makes it through
the initial games

34
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,000
face off in the finals.

35
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,875
It's basically a big
round-robin tournament.

36
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,708
Right! Meaning,
you'll have plenty

37
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,708
of opportunities
to sell yourself.

38
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,750
I guess.

39
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,000
[ALL MIGHT groans]

40
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,041
[IZUKU] I'm sorry!
I mean, what you're saying

41
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,500
is absolutely
correct, All Might!

42
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,166
But honestly, it's kind of
hard to get excited

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,708
about this after everything
that just happened at the USJ.

44
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,291
Plus, I've already got
the world's greatest hero

45
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,333
teaching me, so the festival
probably isn't my only hope

46
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,875
of getting scouted by an agency.

47
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,541
And besides, I don't
know that I can stand out

48
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,708
right now considering I did
so horribly on the fitness tests

49
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,250
and can't control
One For All very well.

50
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,416
Man, nobody is better
at spoutin' word vomit

51
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,583
than you, kid.

52
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,250
Oh, hey, are you okay?

53
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,041
Some heroes always
aim for the top,

54
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,708
while others happily settle.
The difference between

55
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,666
those two mindsets
has a big impact on

56
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,000
how far you go
in the real world.

57
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,000
I understand how you feel.

58
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,208
And I may even be projecting

59
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,208
a bit of myself
onto you. However,

60
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,791
I hope you haven't
forgotten the emotions

61
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,583
you felt back at the beach
during our training.

62
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,500
[ALL gasp]

63
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,291
[OCHACO] U-Um, why the
heck are you all here?

64
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,958
Do you students have
some sort of business

65
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:31,958
with our class?

66
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,000
Why are you blocking
our doorway?

67
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,708
I won't let you hold us hostage!

68
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,666
They're scouting out
the competition, idiots.

69
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,458
We're the class that survived
a real villain attack.

70
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,250
Let's just hope he
doesn't explode anybody.

71
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,541
At least now you know what
a future pro looks like.

72
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,000
Now move it, extras.

73
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,000
[TENYA] You can't walk around
calling people "extras"

74
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,166
just because you don't
know who they are!

75
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,166
[SHINSO]
So this is Class 1-A.

76
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,375
I heard you guys
were impressive,

77
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,708
but you just sound like an ass.

78
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,833
Is everyone in the hero course
delusional, or just you?

79

[KATSUKI growls]

80
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,541
How sad to come here and
find a bunch of ego maniacs.

81
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,875
I wanted to be
in the hero course,

82
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,041
but like many others here,

83
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,583
I was forced to choose
a different track.

84
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,583
Such is life.

85
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,833
Tch.

86
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,541
[SHINSO] I didn't cut it
the first time around,

87
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,125
but I have another chance.

88
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,166
If any of us do well
in the sports festival,

89
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,958
the teachers can decide to
transfer us to the hero course.

90
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,416
And they'll have to
transfer people out

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,250
to make room.

Maybe some of my
peers are, but I'm here

95
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,208
to let you know that, if you
don't bring your very best,

I'll steal your spot
right from under you.

We heard you fought
some villains,

if that was true.

00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,250
[KATSUKI]
Yeah!

[KAMINARI groans]
Yeey...

[DARK SHADOW]
It's too much light!

162
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,166
Thank you all!

[TODOROKI grunts, pants]

164
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,250
[IZUKU]
Days passed.

165
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,583
All the training made
time go by quickly.

166
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,958
Before we knew it, it was
the morning of the festival.

167
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,666
[IZUKU'S MOM] Izuku, please
be careful and don't get hurt.

168
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,083
[IZUKU]
I won't.

169
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,708
[IZUKU'S MOM] I'll record
the whole festival in HD!

170
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,708
[IZUKU chuckles]

171
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,916
Do your best, son.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,416
Okay, I'm off!

173
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,125
[REPORTER 9A] This security line
is huge. What's the deal?

174
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,375
A bunch of villains
did just break in.

175
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,083
Of course the school's
being stricter this year.

176
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,416
Some people think they shouldn't

177
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,625
be holding the festival,
considering what happened.

178
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,333
Perfect! Nothing
brings ratings up

179
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,791
like a little controversy!

180
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,916
Plus, everybody will
tune in to see Class 1-A!

181
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,958
[MAN 15A] I'm always psyched
to see the third years

182
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,291
since they've got the most
experience with their Quirks.

183
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,583
Plus, it's their last chance
to show their worth.

184
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,750
[MAN 15B]
Nah, this time it's all about

185
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,041
those powerful first
years. I can't wait.

186
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,583
[WOMAN 15A] Hey, did you
hear that Endeavor's son

187
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,333
is one of the first-year
students? Can you imagine?

188
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,500
[MAN 15C]
No way, seriously?

189
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,250
[MAN 15D] Man, the stands
for the first years

are gonna be packed.

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,458
[MT. LADY] I'll take
one order to go, please.

192
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,958
Whoa! Mt. Lady,
is it really you?

193
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,375
And hold the salt, will you?

194
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,583
Of course! That's
gonna be ten bucks.

195
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,208
[gasps]

196
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:15,666
[MT. LADY] Um... Oh, no,
my money's in another costume.

So hot! This is on the house!

Aren't you a dear?

[KAMUI WOODS]
Have you no sense of shame?

200
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,458
[KAMUI WOODS] I was hoping
I'd get to do some scouting

201
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,916
while I was here.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,583
Yeah, too bad we're stuck
working security this time.

203
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,041
Looks like they
called in pro heroes

204
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,041
from all over to guard
this thing. Quite a show.

205
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,166
[ASHIDO]
Aw, man.

206
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,500
I was totally hoping
I could wear my costume.

207
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,250
At least everyone'll
be in uniforms.

208
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,666
That'll keep things fair, right?

209
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,250
I wonder what they
have in store for us

210
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,625
in the first round.

211
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,291
No matter what they've
prepared, we must persevere.

212
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,500
[SHOJI]
Right.

213
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,875
Everyone, get your
game faces on!

Hey, Todoroki. What's up?

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,375
Huh?

220
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,166
From an objective standpoint,

221
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,500
I think it's fairly clear
that I'm stronger than you.

222
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,041
Uh-- Um, yeah.

223
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:22,083
However, you've got All Might
in your corner, helping you out.

what's going on between you two.

What's with all these
declarations of war lately?

231
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,500
Yeah, what's the big deal?

232
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,458
Why are you pickin' a
fight all of a sudden?

233
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,916
And right before
we get started...

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,250
[TODOROKI] We're not here
to be each other's friends.

235
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,666
Don't forget. This
isn't a team effort.

Wait a sec, Todoroki.

237
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,583
I don't know what's
going through your head

238
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,416
or why you think you'd need
to tell me that you'll beat me.

239
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,416
And, yeah, of course
you're better than me.

240
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,333
In fact, you probably
have way more potential

241
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,625
than anyone in the hero course.

242

That's why you
got in so easily.

244
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,916
a little hard on
yourself, and us.

245

[IZUKU] No, he's right, you
guys. All the other courses--

they're coming for us with
everything they've got.

to fight to stand out.

for the top, too.

prepped, media hordes!

some of the hottest performances

in UA's festival
history, guaranteed!

257
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,250
I've only got one question
before we start this show:

258
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,500
Are you ready?

259
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,583
Let me hear ya scream
as our students

260
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,958
make their way
to the main stage!

00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,458
C'mon, Izuku!

[ALL MIGHT] You must introduce
yourself to the world,

263
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,666
and proudly say "I am here!"

[PRESENT MIC] Welcome back
to the UA Sports Festival!

267
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,916
Where up-and-coming
heroes leave everything

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,166
on the field as they fight
for the chance to achieve

269
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,250
worldwide fame and celebrity!

270
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,833
This first group are no
strangers to the spotlight!

You know them for withstanding
a villain attack--

they're the dazzling students
lighting up your TVs

with solid-gold skills.

274

That's right! It's The hero
course students of Class 1-A!

275
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,458
Uh... I didn't know
there'd be so many people.

276
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,833
I hope we're still able to
give our best performances,

277
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,333
even though all these
eyes are watching us.

278
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,750
I suppose it's just another
aspect of being a hero

279
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,333
we all have to learn
to get used to.

280
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,791
Present Mic sure did
talk us up a lot.

281
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,041
Kinda makes me nervous.
How you feelin', man?

282
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,333
I'm not worried.

283
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,333
Makes me wanna win
this thing even more.

[PRESENT MIC] They haven't
been getting nearly as much

285
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,500

is still chock full of talent!

Welcome, hero course Class 1-B!

Next up, general studies
classes C, D, and E!

And finally, the business
classes I, J, and K!

290
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:41,333
Give it up for all of UA's
first-year contestants!

291
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,666
I get the feeling
we're just here

292
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,500
to make the hero
students look better.

293

I can't wait for this
to be over with.

[MIDNIGHT]
Now, the introductory speech!

295
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,416
Whoa!

296
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,583
This year's chief umpire
for the first years

297
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,291
is the R-Rated Hero, Midnight!

00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,708
Amazing.

00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,208
Seriously, the other
years don't know

what they're missing.

301
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,583
Uh, someone should
talk to Ms. Midnight

302
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,958
about what she's wearing.

303
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,125
Yeah. That costume should
come with a warning.

304
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,666
Is that really
appropriate apparel

305
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,250
for a high school game?

we have Katsuki Bakugo!

Uh... He's the first-year rep?

[IZUKU] I don't think
it is overconfidence.

The old Kacchan would have
laughed while saying that,

[IZUKU]
This is him pushing himself.

Without further ado, it's time

Ta-dah!

So it's gonna be
an obstacle course.

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,083
All 11 classes will participate
in this treacherous contest.

344
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,791
The track is four
kilometers around

the outside of the stadium.

346

I don't wanna restrain anyone,
at least in this game.

347
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,250
As long as you don't
leave the course,

348
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:08,333
you're free to do whatever
your heart desires.

and proudly say "I am here!"

353

[IZUKU]
I have to be smart about this.

I'm still not able to
control One For All, yet,

so I have to be
careful when I use it.
