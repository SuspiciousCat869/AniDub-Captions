1
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:10,583
Oh, I get it.

2
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:13,583
Up until now, I've just been
summoning One For All.

3
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,708
I shouldn't be
flipping the switch off!

4
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,500
I just have to leave
the power on the whole time.

5
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,666
Imagining the energy
that used to be focused

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,666
in one place spreading
throughout my entire body!

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,625
Wanna give it a try?

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,416
[IZUKU]
Yes! Let's do this!

9
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,916
[GRAN TORINO]
That's it!

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,750
Keep One For All flowing
throughout your entire body.

11
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,875
If you can move around
while maintaining this...

12
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,791
...then you'll be on a
completely different level

13
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,583
than you were at
the sports festival.

14
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,958
[grunting]

15
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,291
[GRAN TORINO] So, kid,
think you can handle it?

16
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,333
[GRAN TORINO]
We'll begin with three minutes.

17
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,250
Okay. For what?

18
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,000
That's the amount of
time you have to try

19
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,875
to hit me with a smash.

20
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,208
[IZUKU grunts]

21
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,000
[IZUKU]
Crap, he's fast.

22
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,500
[GRAN TORINO]
Pathetic.

23
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,666
If you can't even hold
your own against an old man,

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,583
how will you protect
those who're in need?

25
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,666
[IZUKU grunts]

26
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,875
[GRAN TORINO] Someone praised
by the Symbol of Peace

27
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,958
himself should be able to
complete this challenge easily.

28
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,458
No sweat.

29
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,125
[IZUKU growls]

30
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,208
One For Al--

31
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,958
[IZUKU]
I need some time to get it

32
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,458
going through my body again.

33
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,750
A single hit from him
doesn't pack much power,

34
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:11,083
but he's too fast for me
to follow with my eyes!

35
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:14,708
Come on. I just
need a few seconds.

36
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,208
There!

37
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,291
[GRAN TORINO] Don't be stupid.
I can still see you.

38
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,458
If you're trying to
buy time... It won't work.

39
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,791
[IZUKU]
Now's my chance!

40
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,708
[GRAN TORINO] So you were
just trying to keep me off you

41
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,666
for a minute. Now that
was a good idea.

42
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,166
[IZUKU]
One For All. Full Cowling!

43
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,833
Almost.

44
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,041
[IZUKU]
From behind!

45
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,125
[GRAN TORINO]
You already tried to counter

46
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,833
like this once before.
Remember, kid?

47
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:46,875
[GRAN TORINO grunts]

48
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,416
Smash!

49
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,875
[IZUKU]
He dodged that, too?

50
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,541
[GRAN TORINO]
Your time's up.

51
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:10,666
[IZUKU] Oh, man. It's hard
to keep it going like that.

52
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,416
I guess I still have
a lot of work to do.

53
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,750
[GRAN TORINO]
Nice work.

54
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,041
You managed to attack me
while I had my guard down

55
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,791
thanks to your analysis.

56
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,250
You must spend a lot of time
thinking about strategy

57
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,958
and how to fight.

58
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,875
You've already grown
since yesterday,

59
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,416
and this was just our first go
at using One For All this way.

60
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,083
[GRAN TORINO] It's been a
long time since I've had to

61
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,083
seriously dodge an attack.

62
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,833
This kid might turn out
to be a real monster.

63
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,750
[GRAN TORINO]
All right, no time to rest.

64
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:39,666
Let's keep training.

65
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,833
Yeah! Please! What's next, sir?

66
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,375
[GRAN TORINO]
Something very important.

67
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,333
We haven't had any
breakfast this morning.

68
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,666
[IZUKU]
Huh? O-Oh, you're right!

69
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,791
So, why don't you go and
heat up those pastries again.

70
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,625
[GRAN TORINO]
They're all ruined!

71
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,750
[IZUKU] Don't worry,
I'll go buy some more!

72
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,750
[IZUKU] I've still got
a long road ahead,

73
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,791
but I can see where I'm going!

74
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,958
One For All Full Cowling.

75
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,625
That's the next step to
making this Quirk my own!

76
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:17,166
[OCHACO, SIDEKICKS]
Right! Left! Right! Left!

77
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,916
[GUNHEAD] Don't just
go through the motions.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,166
Make sure you're focusing
on each individual punch.

79
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,166
Remember, the most
important thing

80
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,041
is your basic physical strength.

81
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,291
[SIDEKICKS]
Yes, sir!

82
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,083
[OCHACO]
Look at how cute that pose is!

83
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,583
This is lukewarm.

84
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,375
Can't you two dense idiots
even make a decent cup of tea?

85
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,500
We wanna impress clients
who visit our agency.

86
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,625
Is this the kinda crap
you would serve them, too?

87
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,875
[KIRISHIMA, TETSUTETSU]
Sorry, Mr. Fourth Kind, sir!

88
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,375
[FOURTH KIND]
Jeez.

89
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,166
Those powers of yours sure
make it satisfying to hit you.

90
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,208
Right!

91
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,541
Thank you, sir!

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,875
[BEST JEANIST] To be a good pro,
your presence must calm

93
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,916
those in danger and give
them peace of mind.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,958
You must be capable, of course,

95
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,625
but there are other
things to consider.

96
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,708
Your physical appearance, speech

97
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,666
and actions must
all be elegant.

98
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,500
You must give off
the aura of a hero.

99
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,833
Do you understand?

100
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,166
[SIDEKICKS] Another perfect
style, Best Jeanist!

101
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,750
[KATSUKI] Dammit I came
to the wrong hero agency.

102
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,250
[YAOYOROZU] After this
photoshoot, she's scheduled

103
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,958
to be a guest on a radio show,

104
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,416
and then she has a quick
magazine interview.

105
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,000
I feel like we're her
entourage, not her interns.

106
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,250
This is part of what
it takes to be a hero.

107
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,541
It's unavoidable given
the age we live in.

108
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,250
And I'm sure there's
some important lesson

109
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,625
we're missing here.

110
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,125
[YAOYOROZU]
Right? Maybe?

111
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,541
[KENDO]
Poor girl's deep in denial.

112
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,416
[TSUKAUCHI] I'm sorry
to show up unexpectedly.

113
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,833
Hope you don't mind.

114
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,333
Please, it's always a pleasure
to see you, Tsukauchi.

115
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,291
So, how's the investigation?

116
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,625
Well, there were
a number of villains

117
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,416
who attacked the USJ.
But we're puzzled by one.

118
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,791
The one you fought
who they called "Nomu."

119
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,291
[ALL MIGHT]
Ah, that strong bird guy.

120
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,791
[TSUKAUCHI]
We went ahead and ran some tests

121
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,250
on Nomu's DNA.

122
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,125
And what exactly did you find?

123
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,333
[TSUKAUCHI]
First: We're not asking you

124
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:21,250
to help us with the case.
Technically, this is a leak.

125
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,041
I just felt I owed it
to you to let you know.

126
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,041
It could lead us
to the one in charge.

127
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,458
[ALL MIGHT gasps]

128
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,458
[TSUKAUCHI] After several
attempts at interrogation,

129
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,541
we realized that
Nomu can't speak.

130
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,166
He shows no reaction
to anything.

131
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,458
It's as though
he literally can't

132
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,916
think for himself.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No matter what's
going on around him.

134
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,375
[TSUKAUCHI]
As for his identity:

135
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,541
We discovered that he
used to be a low-level thug

136
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,291
with a record of
assault and extortion.

137
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,416
Why do you think this'll lead us

138
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,041
to the mastermind
behind the League?

139
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,166
Here's where it
gets interesting.

140
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,500
Our reports show that he's
been altered drastically.

141
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,208
When we analyzed his genetic
makeup, we discovered

142
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,666
four different people's DNA.

143
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,500
Someone combined people's DNA

144
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,250
to make this guy. So is
he even human anymore?

145
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,166
[TSUKAUCHI] The transformation
is a result of drugs

146
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,375
and other unknown methods.

147
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,750
To oversimplify a bit, he's
been modified so that his body

148
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,875
is able to hold
multiple Quirks at once.

149
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,250
His brain's apparent
lack of processing power

150
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,875
probably comes from
the burden that causes.

151
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,416
But we're more
concerned about his DNA.

152
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,000
He shouldn't have
more than one power.

153
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,500
Even if new DNA's introduced,

154
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,166
that shouldn't give a
person multiple powers.

155
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,541
Not unless it's completely
integrated into someone's body.

156
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,708
Not all Quirks work
like One For All.

157
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,083
But maybe...

158
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,750
...there's someone out
there with the power

159
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,166
to pass different Quirks
on to other people.

160
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,625
[gasps]

161
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,083
[ALL MIGHT]
It can't be!

162
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,333
Given the evidence,

163
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,000
I think it's a
reasonable conclusion.

164
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,166
S'why I came.

165
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,583
I had to let you
know immediately.

166
00:08:56,375 --> 00:09:00,583
[ALL MIGHT]
No. It's not possible.

167
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,041
Don't tell me he's back again.

168
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,000
[STAIN] So you want me
to be a part of your

169
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,916
crumbling little league.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,833
But you won't accomplish
anything if you don't

171
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,750
have conviction and desire.

172
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,500
Without those, you'll always be

173
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:21,541
an aimless weakling.
Achieving nothing.

174
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,625
That's how you got here.

175
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,375
[SHIGARAKI breathes heavily]

176
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,625
[SHIGARAKI]
Hey, now.

177
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,833
You're being a little
rough, aren't you?

178
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,291
Kurogiri, take this guy back.

179
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,291
[KUROGIRI]
I'm sorry. I can't move.

180
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,291
It must be the
Hero Killer's Quirk at work.

181
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,708
[STAIN] The word "hero" has lost
all meaning in this society.

182
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:44,333
The world is overrun by
fakes and criminals like you

183
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,250
who chase petty dreams.

184
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,166
They must all be purged.

185
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,250
[SHIGARAKI]
What do you think you're doing?

186
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,500
If you touch this palm...

187
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,000
[SHIGARAKI]
...I'll kill you.

188
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,291
[STAIN grunts]

189
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,708
[SHIGARAKI] You sure
talk a lot, "Hero Killer."

190
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,000
Conviction?

191
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,125
Maybe I don't have anything
as loaded as that.

192
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,541
If I had to choose
a desire, though...

193
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,208
Yeah, it'd be killing All Might.

194
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,958
If this world wants to
worship trash like him,

195
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,375
I'll destroy their
beloved symbol of peace,

196
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,125
and then crush them
while they're in shock.

197
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,875
[STAIN grunts]

198
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,333
[SHIGARAKI] The last of my
injuries was finally about to

199
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,375
finish healing, and now this.

200
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,916
You should learn not
to play with knives.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,375
We don't have a healer
in our party, you know.

202
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,333
[STAIN]
I see your nature.

203
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,666
[SHIGARAKI gasps]

204
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,083
It seems our goals
fundamentally oppose each other.

205
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,041
However, this wasn't in vain.

206
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,333
We agree that we need
to destroy the present.

207
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,416
[SHIGARAKI] I'm over this.
Leave, drop dead.

208
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,583
I'm the kind of person
you hate most, right?

209
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,041
[STAIN]
I was testing your motives.

210
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,958
People always show
their true colors

211
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,250
when on the verge of death.

212
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,250
It's abnormal,
but there is desire,

213
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,958
a warped sprout of
conviction, inside of you.

214
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,583
How will it bloom
in the end, I wonder.

215
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,333
Maybe I'll let you grow.

216
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,708
If you don't turn out well,
I'll take care of you later.

217
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,666
[SHIGARAKI] You think <i>you</i>
could get rid of <i>me</i> ?

218
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,083
[KUROGIRI]
I'm free.

219
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,500
[SHIGARAKI]
Kurogiri.

220
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,875
Someone as crazy as this would
be nothing but a problem

221
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,875
for the League of Villains.

222
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,500
[KUROGIRI]
Please reconsider.

223
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:28,208
This man will be a great
asset if he joins us.

224
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,666
I'd say this was a success.

225
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,416
My business here is done.

226
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,625
Now, you will return me to Hosu.

227
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,666
There are still
several false heroes

228
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,750
I must attend to there.

229
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:49,250
[sighs] Well, the nice thing
about having the whole city

230
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,041
on alert is that no villains
will dare come out.

231
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,791
Oh, yeah, sure.

232
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,833
[TENYA]
Hero Killer Stain.

233
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,000
It was obvious once I
looked at your crimes.

234
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,083
In the seven places
that you've appeared so far,

235
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,166
you've always injured
at least four pro heroes.

236
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,083
Maybe there's a reason
for that, or maybe I'm just

237
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,291
reading into things,
but it looks like a pattern.

238
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:16,416
And Tensei is the only person
you've attacked in Hosu.

239
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,458
[INGENIUM]
I'm so sorry--

240
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,250
I failed you.

241
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,916
[TENYA] That means...
it's very likely that you'll

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,916
appear in this city again.

243
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,708
[TENYA] Good. I'll dispose
of you with my own hands.

244
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,750
[IZUKU grunts]

245
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,958
[IZUKU] Gotta keep the five
percent going and attack!

246
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,125
[grunts]

247
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,458
[sighs] We should
switch up the training.

248
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,250
If you get too used to fighting
against my distinct tactics,

249
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,166
you might develop
some weird habits.

250
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,083
What habits? I'm just trying
to keep up with you right now!

251
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,166
Please, let me fight more!

252
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,958
[GRAN TORINO]
No, we're done here.

253
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,916
Change into your costume, boy.

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,708
We're moving onto Phase 2.

255
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,833
Huh?

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,958
[GRAN TORINO]
Hope you're ready.

257
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,750
We're going out to
fight some villains.

258
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,000
Huh?! What, just like that?

259
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,333
If you only fight against me,
you'll be in trouble

260
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,833
when you come across someone
who's the complete opposite.

261
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,625
The key is to let
you get experience

262
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,500
with different types of
villains and situations.

263
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,708
This is an
internship, after all.

264
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,000
You really shouldn't
be that surprised by this.

265
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,583
I get what you're saying,
and I totally agree.

266
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,166
But I still think I need
more time to prepare myself.

267
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,750
From what I heard,
you've already been

268
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,625
in combat with
some real villains.

269
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,000
You'll be just fine. We aren't
gonna go after anyone that big.

270
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,791
[GRAN TORINO] And it won't do us
any good hangin' around here.

271
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,041
Because of the small
population in this area,

272
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,750
the crime rate is pretty low.

273
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,791
That's why there are
so many hero agencies

274
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,666
in urban areas, there's
a lot more crime there.

275
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,291
The higher the
population density,

276
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,875
the more trouble you'll find.

277
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,500
Now, in Shibuya,
we'll have plenty

278
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,000
of small fights to
break up, I guarantee.

279
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,708
Wait, you mean we're
going to Shibuya in Tokyo?

280
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,875
I'm, uh, not so sure my
hero costume is hip enough.

281
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,583
That costume of yours tells
everyone you're a hero.

282
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,250
You should be happy
to get to display it

283
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,916
in such a bright spotlight.

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Uh-- Hold on.

285
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,458
Are we gonna be taking the
bullet train toward Shinjuku?

286
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,500
[GRAN TORINO]
Yup.

287
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,958
[IZUKU]
We'll pass Hosu City.

288
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,875
I wonder how Iida's doing there.

289
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,791
I'll try to message him later.

290
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,333
We'll patrol Kyoto today, too.

291
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,583
Sorry this is so monotonous.

292
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,166
[TENYA]
No. It's better this way.

293
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,333
[MANUAL]
Hey.

294
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,333
[TENYA]
Hm?

295
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,916
[MANUAL]
This is kinda hard to ask,

296
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,583
but you're after the
Hero Killer, aren't you?

297
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,958
[TENYA gasps]
How did you...?

298
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,625
I couldn't think of
any other reason why

299
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,083
you'd come to my agency.

300
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,291
Uh! I mean--

301
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,958
Don't get me wrong,
I'm really glad you did,

302
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,416
but...

303
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,708
You shouldn't be
pursuing personal grudges.

304
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,291
We heroes don't
have the authority

305
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,500
to arrest people or punish them.

306
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,500
The only reason we're
allowed to use our Quirks

307
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,666
is because of the
regulations put on them.

308
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,666
That's why, no matter how noble

309
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,125
the reason may be,
a hero must not

310
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,708
use their Quirk for themselves.

311
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,750
If a pro used their power
for their own selfish desires,

312
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,291
it would be a
very serious crime.

313
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,750
I'm not saying that
the Hero Killer

314
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,708
isn't incredibly
guilty or anything!

315
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,666
You just seem like the
earnest type, you know?

316
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,166
I'd hate for you
to focus on one goal

317
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,708
and ignore everything else.

318
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,708
[TENYA]
Thank you. I appreciate it.

319
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,541
Oh, it's fine, as long as
you get what I'm sayin'.

320
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,500
So, we good?

321
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,500
[TENYA]
No.

322
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:50,125
What am I supposed to do
with this burning hatred

323
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,208
if I can't act?

324
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:01,791
[SHIGARAKI]
Huh.

325
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,458
Hosu City looks nicer
than I expected.

326
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,750
So, what are you gonna do?

327
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,916
I will reform it.

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,375
In order to do so,
blood must spill.

329
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,208
[KUROGIRI]
You have a clear goal.

330
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,166
Your dedication is admirable.

331
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,250
[STAIN] Ah... Finally,
someone who understands.

332
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,958
[SHIGARAKI] I get the feeling
you enjoy picking on me.

333
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,708
[STAIN] "Hero" is a
title for those who've

334
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:30,125
accomplished great deeds! This
city is full of false champions.

335
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,291
All they care about
is money and fame.

336
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:37,125
Until this world
realizes its mistakes,

337
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,666
I will continue my work.

338
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,625
[SHIGARAKI] He talks all
high and mighty and stuff,

339
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,916
but he's wasting his time
focusing on a small stage.

340
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,708
He's so noble I could cry.

341
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,208
[KUROGIRI]
You shouldn't spurn his methods.

342
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,708
The reality is, in all the
cities where Stain has appeared,

343
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,250
the crime rates have fallen.

344
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,041
Perhaps because heroes
are more conscientious,

345
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,208
or perhaps out of fear.

346
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,916
Regardless, he does
bring change.

347
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,125
[SHIGARAKI]
Oh, isn't that just wonderful.

348
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,208
Heroes are working harder
thanks to all those murders.

349
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,250
I guess you could say
our "Hero Killer"

350
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,916
is also a "Hero Breeder."

351
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,958
This is getting boring.
It won't work.

352
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,291
We just can't agree
on a basic level.

353
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,833
And he annoys me.
Kurogiri, bring out the Nomus.

354
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,166
[SHIGARAKI] You think you can
get away with stabbing me?

355
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,833
When I get tired
of you, I'll kill you.

356
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,583
Whenever I feel like it.
Just like that, Stain.

357
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,250
[SHIGARAKI] But let's
make it more interesting.

358
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,083
How about I crush your honor
and your pride first?

359
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,375
What do you say,
big bad Hero Killer?

360
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,291
So, um...

361
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,291
This train isn't gonna get
there until pretty late.

362
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,375
Are you sure that's okay?

363
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,958
That's why I picked it.

364
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,791
There'll be more skirmishes
then, so it'll be much more fun!

365
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,416
Maybe we just have
different ideas

366
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,083
about what "fun" is.

367
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,791
You kids these days.

368
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,375
You're constantly buried
in your cell phones.

369
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,333
[IZUKU] He read the
message but didn't reply.

370
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,583
I don't think Iida has ever
waited more than three minutes

371
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,708
to respond to something before.

372
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,041
We're almost at Hosu station.

373
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,750
Hey, if you ever wanna
talk or anything,

374
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,250
just let us know.
We're friends, right?

375
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,625
Yes.

378
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,083

00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,291
[gasps] Where?

380
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,541
What's the ruckus?

381
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,083
Some kind of fire?

382
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,583
[ANNOUNCEMENT 28A] Passengers,
please hold onto your seats.

Don't worry. I can
head there right now.

Stay with me. We're running.

[STAIN] That idiot's making
a move. And he's so noisy.

I'll have to dispose
of him later.

If you call yourself a hero,

you should choose your

Be careful what you say next.

If need be, even someone
your age can be my target.

00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:17,833
[TENYA] Are you saying that
I'm not even a threat to you?

431
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,375
You listen to me, criminal.

00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,125
[TENYA] I am the brother
of an incredible hero

He's the best older brother
