[IZUKU]
This is a superhuman society,

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:15,958
with 80 percent of us
possessing some uncanny ability.

3
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,083
Cities swirled with
chaos and confusion

00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,958
following the appearance
of these powers,

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,000
and a new profession emerged.

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,833
[IZUKU] We call those
who fight for justice

7
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,375
and help others
in need, "heros."

8
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,041
Oh, by the way,

9
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,708
this is the story
of how I became

10
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,666
the world's greatest hero.

11
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,958
[IZUKU] All three of them
put their trust in me.

12
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,791
This is my responsibility.

13

We all have our
reasons to win this.

And I refuse to
let the others down!

15
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:19,333
It was around his head,
where his guard was the weakest.

the opening for me,

18
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,791

[PRESENT MIC] And in fourth
place is Team Midoriya!

Let's find some food.

So, you brought me here.

28

Now what?

29
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,000
We should probably eat soon.

30
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,666
The cafeteria's gonna be busy.

31

[gulps]

33

[IZUKU]
He's all cold intimidation.

34

Way different from Kacchan.

[TODOROKI]
I was overwhelmed.

36

[gasps]

37
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,041
And it made me break
the promise I made

38
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,333
to myself a long time ago.

39
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,041
[IZUKU] It would have given
him such an advantage

40
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,833
to use his left side.

41
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,375
And yet... he didn't.

42
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,041
Ida and Kaminari...

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,791
Yaoyorozu and Tokoyami...

Uraraka...

45
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,583
None of them felt it.

46
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,958
In that moment,

47
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,166
I was the only one who
could sense your true power.

48
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,208
It reminded me of something...

49
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,333
Experiencing All Might's Quirk.

50
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,125
Oh, yeah? Okay...

51
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,625
Is that all?

52
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,041
I'm saying...

53
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,000
The power coming from you
felt the same as All Might's.

54

[TODOROKI]
Midoriya, tell me.

56
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,041
Are you really All Might's
secret love child

57
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,166
or something?

58
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,500
[IZUKU]
Am I... What?!

59
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,916
I've seen it.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,583
You've got All Might in
your corner, helping you out.

61
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,291
[IZUKU]
Okay. I get why he'd think that.

62
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,000
As insane as it sounds.

63
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,041
[TODOROKI]
Well, are you?

64
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,125
No, no way--
that's not it at all.

65
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,333
But I guess even if I was,
I'd totally say I wasn't,

66
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,541
so you probably won't believe
me no matter what, I bet.

67
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,750
Anyway, I promise,
you've got the wrong idea.

68
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,708
And... Why would you
even think that about me?

69
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,541
"That's not it at all"
is interesting wording.

70
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,541
It suggests there is
something between you two

71
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,416
that you're not
supposed to talk about.

72

U-Uh...

73
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,458
My father is the hero Endeavor.

74
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,875
You must've heard of him.

75
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,541
Which means you're aware
that he's the number-two hero.

76
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,833
So if you're connected to

77
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,500
the number-one hero,
All Might, in some way...

78
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,166
That would mean...

79
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,833
...that I have even more
reason to beat you.

80

that press conference
ten years ago.

Been a while.

figured I'd say hi.

very well out there,

No. I want to know your secrets.

generation of heroes?

of one thing, All Might.

My old man is ambitious.

He aims for the top.

117
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,875
He used his power to make
a name for himself as a hero.

118
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,916
But he was never able
to best All Might,

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,500
so the Symbol of Peace is
living proof of his failure.

One way or another.

131
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,583
There were those who sought out

potential mates solely
with the intention

of creating powerful children.

Many people were forced
into relationships.

135

tell me about it.

163
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,333
But no matter how fiercely
you come at me in the future,

164
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:37,166
I will defeat you using
only my right side.

165
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,166
I can assure you of that.

166
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,458
[IZUKU] So this is why
Todoroki's so focused.

167
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,250
He's like a
comic book character.

168
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,166
A hero with a tragic backstory.

169
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,333
Fighting to rise above it.

170
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,583
[IZUKU]
Hey, wait!

171
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,833
[IZUKU] I'm only here because
others have supported me.

172
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,791
I've been really lucky.

173
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:13,833
In fact, I've had even more
help since I've come to UA.

174
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,125
[ALL MIGHT] Have no fear.
You're safe. I am here.

175
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,333
Can't you just give him
some of my points?

176
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,833
I'll support you with
everything I've got!

177
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,458
[AIZAWA] You can't be a pro
if you only have one trick.

178
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,125
[TSUYU] I guess we passed
the shipwreck zone.

179
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,041
[KATSUKI]
Get the hell outta my way, Deku!

180
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,166
[HATSUME] Team up with me,
person in first place!

181
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,000
It was around his head,
where his guard was the weakest.

182
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,416
Young man,

183
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,833
you, too, can become a hero.

184
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,208
[IZUKU] All Might is
constantly saving people

185
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,625
with a fearless smile.

186
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,666
He's the greatest hero.

187
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,166
And I wanna be just like him.

188
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,000
In order to do that,

189
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,958
I have to be strong enough
to become number one.

190
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,833
I know my motivation
might seem stupid

191
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,416
compared to yours.

192
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,333
But, still--I can't
lose this, either.

193
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,625
I owe it to everyone who's
supported me to try my best.

194
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,916
[IZUKU]
You declared war on me earlier.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Well, right back at you.

196
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,166
I am going to beat you.

197
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,083
[PRESENT MIC] Get those
foam fingers in the air!

198
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,583
It's almost time
for the last round!

199
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,000
But before that:

200
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,875
good news for everyone
who didn't make the finals.

201
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,750
Since this is a sports festival,

202
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,750
we've prepared some
super-fun side games

203
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,166
everyone can participate in!

204
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,833
We even brought in cheerleaders

205
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,458
from America to get
your blood pumping!

206
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,083
[AIZAWA]
Ah--

207
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,666
Hold up.

208
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,458
[AIZAWA]
What are they doing?

209
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,958
[PRESENT MIC]
Looks like Class 1-A is goin'

210
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,625
full-on fanservice!

211
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,958
[KAMINARI, MINETA cackle]

212
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,625
What?! You tricked us?

213
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,500
You're gonna regret this!

214
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,541
Yaoyorozu. Jiro.

215
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,208
Uh-huh, do you need something?

216
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,000
[MINETA] Well, I'm sure
you already know since

217
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,750
you're like, a class rep...

218
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,208
But they said all
the girls have to wear

219
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,208
those uniforms for the big
cheer battle this afternoon.

220
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,208
Huh?!

221
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,375
That's odd. This is the first

222
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,250
I'm hearing about it.
Are you sure?

223
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,125
You don't have to believe me
if you wanna get in trouble.

224
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,541
But this is coming
straight from Mr. Aizawa.

225
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,833
I thought maybe you'd forgotten,

226
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,833
so I figured I'd
remind you, just in case.

227
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,250
[sighs] Why is it that
I always end up falling

228
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,791
for that little pervert's
stupid schemes?

229
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,625
I even used my Quirk
to make these outfits.

230
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,625
Ugh, I hate those guys!

231
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,291
[HAGAKURE] Well, we do have
a little time before

232
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,833
the finals start, and I kinda
like these uniforms, so...

233
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,333
How 'bout we just roll with it!

234
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,625
[JIRO]
Are you crazy?

235
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,708
Wow, Toru. You've got skills.

236
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,041
[PRESENT MIC]
Have fun competing in these

237
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,208
little side games, everyone!

238
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,250
[PRESENT MIC] After they're
over, the 16 students

239
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,333
from the top four teams
will be duking it out

240
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,791
one-on-one in a tournament-style
fighting competition!

241
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,333
[PRESENT MIC]
I promise you're not gonna wanna

242
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,458
miss these epic match ups!

243
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,708
[KIRISHIMA]
Aw, yeah.

244
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,416
Finally getin' the chance
to show what we're made of.

245
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,750
I watch these finals every year,
and now I'm actually in them!

246
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,958
So, wait. Is it
always a tournament?

247
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,291
The final's always a
one-on-one competition,

248
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,125
but they switch
it up every time.

249
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,041
Last year it was a foam
sword-fighting match.

250
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,916
[MIDNIGHT]
Come closer and draw lots to see

251
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,458
who you're up against.

252
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,083
Then enjoy the pleasure
of the recreational games

253
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,666
before we start.

254
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,375
The 16 finalists have the option

255
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,083
of participating in those
activities or sitting out

256
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,541
to prepare for battle.

257
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:04,125
I'm sure you all want
to conserve your stamina.

258
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,041
I'll start with the
first place team.

259
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,333
[OJIRO]
Um. Excuse me.

260
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,333
Sorry.

261
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,541
But I'm withdrawing.

Ojiro. No way!

00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,958
But this is a rare chance
for you to get scouted.

265
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,791
It just wouldn't be right.

266
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,083
I barely remember anything
from the cavalry battle

267
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,500
until the very end of it.

268

[gasps]

was that guy's Quirk.

270

[IZUKU] Wait, who was
Ojiro with, again? Him?

271
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,583
[OJIRO] I know this is
a great opportunity.

272
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,208
I wish I could
take advantage of it,

273
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,125
but my conscience won't let me.

274
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,250
Think about this.

275
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,708
[OJIRO]
I have, okay?

276
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,500
Everyone gave their
all in round two,

277
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,250
but I was just
someone's puppet. No way.

278
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:50,250
I don't wanna advance if I
don't even know how I got here.

279
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,750
It wouldn't be fair.

00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,791
[HAGAKURE] You're making
way too much of this!

281
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,166
Just kill it in the finals
and prove you should be here.

Yeah, what she said.

I didn't do much
in the battle, either.

[OJIRO]
That's not it.

I'm talking about my pride here.

I think I should withdraw
for the exact same reason.

Regardless of how strong I am,

this isn't how
I wanted to get here.

295
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,875
It would go against
the values of the festival

296
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,416
to advance without
earning my spot.

has to say about all this--
she's the one in charge.

incredibly naive, my boys.

Don't worry.

We'll have to

from the fifth-place
cavalry team

311
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,541
so we have enough contestants.

312
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,166
We were frozen most of the time.

313
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,500
Honestly, we barely did anything
in the cavalry battle.

the whole time.

319
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,375
Team Tetsutetsu.

320
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,791
Kendo!

321
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,833
I'm not doing this as
a favor. It's just fair.

322
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,791
Seriously, you guys!

323
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,250
Thank you!

324
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,875
[MIDNIGHT]
And so, Tetsutetsu and Shiozaki

325
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,958
have advanced to the final!

326
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,958
Take a look at the
bracket, my dears.

327
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,541
These are your opponents!

328
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,541
[CROWD cheers]

329
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,416
[KIRISHIMA, TETSUTETSU]
Seriously?

330
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,750
How does this keep happening?

331
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,166
I'll give it my all.

332
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,458
Good. That's all
that I ask of you.

333
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,666

334
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,958
I'm afraid it's the end
of the road for you.

335
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,250
I can't wait to melt your butt.

336
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,791
[IZUKU] I'm the first match
of the first bracket.

337
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,000
Which means I might
fight Todoroki next.

338
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,166
Great.

339
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
[IZUKU]
First things first.

340
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,833
I have to worry about
this Shinso guy.

341
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:11,041
That is you, right?
Izuku Midoriya?

[IZUKU whimpers]

[IZUKU yelps]

344

[IZUKU]
It's him!

345
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,125
If any of us do well
in the sports festival,

346
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,000
the teachers can
decide to transfer us

347
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,708
to the hero course.

348
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,458
[IZUKU]
From General Studies!

349
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,541
A pleasure. So you excited?

350
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,416
Uh... Ye--

351
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,833
Not so fast.

352
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,083
Heh.

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,666
Ojiro. What's the deal?

354
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,958
You can't say a word to him.

355
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,250
Huh?

356
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,500
[TODOROKI]
He could be my second match.

357
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,583
You must advance, Midoriya.

358
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,125
So I can beat you with one hand.

359

Hm? Correct. I'm Tenya Iida.

Oh! That's perfect!

00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,750
I have something nice for you!

Okay.

Let's press pause for
a momentary interlude!

367
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,625
Before the battles begin,

368
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,708
it's time for some
pulse-pounding side games!

369
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,041
[HAGAKURE]
Woohoo!

370
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,958
[PRESENT MIC] First,
how about a scavenger hunt?

371
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,208
Hey, anyone up there
got a bag they can give me?

372
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,750

What in the heck?

375
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,333
[MONOMA]
What a joke.

376
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,125
They're actually taking these
dumb side games seriously?

377
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,875
As usual, those Class 1-A
idiots really need

378
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,291
to get their
priorities in check.

379
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,375
[KENDO]

If you're not playing,
come with me.

00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,833
Okay?

382
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,500
[MONOMA] Uh... I think you may
have the wrong impression

383
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,916
of me, Kendo.

384
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,083
Trust me. This fits.

385
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,666
[IZUKU] Even though
we were told to have fun,

386
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,208
those of us in the
tournament couldn't relax.

387
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,333
Some tried to come up
with a strategy.

388
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,041
Some tried to rest their bodies.

389
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,375
There were those who
prepped for the fight.

390
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,250
Or tried to hype themselves up.

391
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,083
And others still
who just focused on

392
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,208
trying to calm their nerves.

393
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,291
[IZUKU] We wanted to be
ready for anything.

394
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,833
And before we knew it,
the finals began.

395
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,541
That's it. I'm pretty
much done here.

[PRESENT MIC] After all the
action you've already witnessed,

00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,125
it's time for the
real battles to begin!

Our competitors are
on their own now!

403
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,875
Sometimes, heroes have only
themselves to rely on!

00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,583
Heart. Skill. Strength.
Wisdom. Courage.

405
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,625
They'll have to use all of these
things to rise to the top!

Sorry I haven't said hi.
You've been great.

You harnessed One For All!

410
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,541
No, not really.

411
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:07,166
I'm... still worried
about using it.

412
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,083
I imagine the
egg in the microwave

413
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,166
or how it felt
to hit that villain.

414
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,958
But I'm still not in control.

415
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,541
It feels so unpredictable,

416
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,041
like I might be ripped apart
if I'm not completely focused.

417
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,375
Besides, I'm still not ready
to fully wield it, I can tell.

418
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,625
Even after so much training,
my body is weak.

419
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,708
It just can't handle
your power at 100 percent.

420
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,958
Yeah.

421
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,666
If we're talkin' about
how much of One For All

422
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,375
you'd be able to
use at this point,

423
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,750
I'd say my closest guess would
be around five percent or so.

424
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,083
[IZUKU]
What--only five percent?

425
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,916
Wow, okay.

426
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,750
I guess I really have
only been getting by

427
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,000
because of luck and
my friends helping me out.

428
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:45,833
[ALL MIGHT grunts]

429
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:46,916
All I wanna hear you say

430
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,791
is that you'll
do your best, dammit.

431
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,833
There's no such thing as luck.

432
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,625
You're never gonna
become the hero you want

433
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,791
if you believe in
somethin' like that.

434
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:55,708
Ah...

435
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,083
[ALL MIGHT]
Listen.

436
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,333
Whenever you're scared
or nervous about a fight.

437
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,875
Just try and deal
with it by smiling!

438
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,583
You've made it this far, kid.

439
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:07,166
Even if you're worried,
you must stand tall!

440
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,375
Don't forget that
I'm counting on you,

441
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,541
and cheering you on!

442
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,500
[PRESENT MIC]
All right, audience!

443
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,583
Let's cut to the
good stuff and not delay

444
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,000
these finals any longer.

445
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,000
Welcome our first fighters.

446
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,666
Whoa, he looks kinda scared
in that picture, doesn't he?

447
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,791
It's Izuku Midoriya from
the hero course versus...

448
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,208
Hitoshi Shinso from
general studies,

449
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,208
who really hasn't done
anything to stand out yet.

450
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,708
The rules are simple.

451
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:40,291
Immobilize your opponent
or force them outta the ring.

452
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:44,125
You can also win by getting
the other person to cry uncle!

453
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,541
Bring on the injuries,
'cause we've got

454
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,833
our very own Recovery Girl
waiting on standby!

455
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,708
So put your morals aside and
don't be afraid to play dirty!

456
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,208
But of course, no
life-threatening crap, folks.

457
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,666
It's not allowed!

458
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,166
Real heroes use their power
to throw villains in jail,

459
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,750
not kill them.

460
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,958
I'll stop anyone who
tries to get too rough.

461
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,333
[sighs]

462
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,875
[SHINSO]
So you can just give up, huh?

463
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:08,958
[gasps]

464
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,250
[SHINSO]
In a way, this is a test

465
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,583
of how strong your spirit is.

466
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,291
If you know what you want
your future to hold for you,

467
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,250
you can't worry about
what other people think.

468
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,583
[PRESENT MIC]
Ready?

469
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,958
That monkey was going on
about his pride earlier.

470
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,041
[PRESENT MIC]
Begin!

471
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,541
[SHINSO]
But I just think he's an idiot

472
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,625
for throwing away
his chance like that.

473
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,166
[gasps]

474
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,625
[growls]

475
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,958
Don't you talk about
him that way!

476
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,875
[SHINSO]
That's it. I win.

477
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,541
[groans] I warned him
not to say anything!

478
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,875
[ALL MIGHT gasps]

479
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,000
[PRESENT MIC] Huh?!
Hey, hey, what's the dealio?

480
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,416
This is the first match!
It should start out with a bang!

481
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,666
[PRESENT MIC] The fight has just
begun and Izuku Midoriya is...

482
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,583
...completely frozen?

483
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,208
[OJIRO] The finals
are starting, Midoria.

484
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,208
[IZUKU] So, what'd you
wanna tell me, Ojiro?

485
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,000
[OJIRO] It's important you know
about Shinso from Class 1-B.

486
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,541
He's your opponent
in the first round,

487
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,125
and his Quirk
could be a problem.

488
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,625
[IZUKU] Aw, I didn't know you
cared about me that much!

489
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,458
[OJIRO] Uh, yeah, I mostly just
wanted to get to do the preview.

490
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,791
[IZUKU] Oh. Well,
at least you're honest.

491
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,833
Next time: "Victory or Defeat."

492
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,291
[OJIRO] Get ready for
a quick match that leaves

493
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,541
the whole stadium
feeling bad for the loser.

494
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:55,458
[IZUKU]
Go beyond!

495
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,500
[IZUKU, OJIRO]
Plus Ultra!
