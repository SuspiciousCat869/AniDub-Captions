00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.052 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] May I have
your attention, please.

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:15.932 position:50% align:center
A mushroom warning
is currently in effect.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.935 position:50% align:center
Inhaling spores is
extremely dangerous.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
Please take proper
precautions to avoid this.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.733 position:50% align:center
[LADY A]
It's huge. What is it?

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.776 position:50% align:center
Never seen anything
that big before.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.737 position:50% align:center
Though some clients would argue.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.363 position:50% align:center
[LADY C]
Yeah. Same.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
[TIROL sighs]

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] Might be time
for a career change.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.661 position:50% align:center
[MADAM] Stop rubbernecking
and get inside, girls!

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
Don't want you inhaling spores.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
'Kay.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
[MINER A]
Everyone! Bad news!

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.004 position:50% align:center
Panda Clinic's gone!
The terrorist got it!

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:47.213 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
You're kidding!

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.965 position:50% align:center
What about the doctor
and his sister?

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
Did they get out in time?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50% align:center
[MINER A]
I-I don't know!

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
[ELITE B]
Ah, found you!

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
What're you doin'
in this part of town?

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:58.183 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Me? Just looking for our target.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.893 position:50% align:center
Can you say the same?

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
[ELITE B] Yeah.
He's over at West Gate.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:03.730 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Oh.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
Then the guys over at West
Gate should have it covered.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:06.816 position:50% align:center
[ELITE B]
Nice try.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] Wait! I was only
told to search downtown!

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:13.782 position:50% align:center
Hey! I can walk on my own!
Don't touch me there!

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.515 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] N-Now before you
get all crazy, hear me out,

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
'cause I was against
this from the start!

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
My woman's intuition
was screaming

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
you're a kind and just man!

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50% align:center
I tried to tell the governor,

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.692 position:50% align:center
but he still forced
me to do this!

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
Cool. Now tell me
who you freaks are.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.614 position:50% align:center
Where're the Watch members?

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
Well, it-it doesn't matter now

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.993 position:50% align:center
because I'm quitting all
of this life as of forever!

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
Plus wouldn't killing
a sweet innocent girl

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
haunt your dreams
and ruin your life?

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
So, I'll make you a deal.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
[TIROL screams]

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
You know, you are
one scary dude.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
[MILO sighs]

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
[MILO] This artificial blood
should be compatible.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
But even if it works, such a
severe case of Rusting means...

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center
You guessed it.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
I only have about one more
month before I croak.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Uh. Oh!
You're already conscious?

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
I-I'm doing a blood
transfusion, so stay still.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
I didn't know your blood
type, but so far so good.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.457 position:50% align:center
Seems it's taking just fine.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of a blood
type. That like my flavor?

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.963 position:50% align:center
Hey! I said stay still!

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
You a doctor? You don't look it.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
Hm. What happened to our
little bunny friends?

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about them.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi left to draw
those guys away from here.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
For somebody as
young as you look,

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
you're a pretty skilled doctor.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
[groans] I guess moving around
wasn't the best idea.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
So, um, who are you?

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
And how do you know
someone like Akaboshi?

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
Call me Jabi.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
As for Bisco, well, I suppose
you could say I'm his mentor.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.502 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
No human could shoot that.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
What's your deal?
Huh, tough girl?

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center
Can't imagine you learned
how to use that fancy pole

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
from going to Imihama's
finishing school.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
Show some respect, you scum.
I'm the captain of the Watch.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
So if you don't surrender
and await your sentence,

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
I'll skewer what
little brains you have.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center
Wow, might wanna focus
on your people skills, Cap'n.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
Feel like you'd kill me
even if I surrender.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
Did I off your parents
or something?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
Remember I warned you!

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO yells]

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] That's some awful
Rusting she's got.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.881 position:50% align:center
Pretty nimble for a
girl at death's door.

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
I'd compliment your prowess
in spite of all that Rusting,

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.720 position:50% align:center
but you're speeding its
growth like an idiot.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
You're one to talk.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.349 position:50% align:center
You Mushroom Keepers
only spread the Rust

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
to every town you pass through!

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
I'm so sick of correcting
all you gullible simpletons.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
The Rust is not spread by
mushrooms! Did ya get that?

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
They grow by consuming Rust.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
Mushrooms are the only known
way to purify the disease.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
Then it's true.
I thought as much.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
Seems like that's not much
of a surprise to hear.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
Guess that's a doctor for you,

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
even if you are just
from the city.

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
[JABI laughs]

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
Take it easy, sir!

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
Anyone else with your
wounds would've died.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Lots of creatures
have gone extinct

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
because of the Rust Wind.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
Yet, some life has evolved
to withstand it.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
It only makes sense
for there to be

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
some kind of organism
in the outside world

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
that adapted to the Rust

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
in a way which made it
thrive instead of wither.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
[JABI] Your theory
was correct. Congrats.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
And the organism
that adapted is...

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.698 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
...mushrooms!

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
Complete and utter nonsense!

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
Who in their right mind
would ever believe

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center
something so outrageous?

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center
If what you say is true,
why not prove it?

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
Save the entire country from
the Rust Wind right now!

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
I'm trying my best,

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
but morons like you are
making it a little difficult.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
[JABI] Though Keepers
attempt to grow mushrooms

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center
in places dense with Rust,

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
the cleansing effect
doesn't start right away.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.935 position:50% align:center
This misconception is
cause for great distress.

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50% align:center
As a result, the casual observer
sees how dense the Rust is

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.816 position:50% align:center
where mushrooms grow
and freaks out.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
Now I get it!

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
That's how rumors about Keepers
spreading the Rust started,

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
and why they're persecuted.

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe not the only reason.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
Mushroom Keepers aren't
the type to socialize.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.206 position:50% align:center
Also, not all Mushroom Keepers
have the best of intentions.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
I mean, we're still
human after all.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
Some use their control of
forbidden mushrooms in plots

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
to amass huge fortunes.

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center
[JABI coughing]

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
Ah! I'm so sorry!
You should rest.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
I may actually talk
myself to death, huh?

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
[WATCH D]
Sir!

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
The captain has engaged
Akaboshi near the West Gate.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
Understood, we'll
provide backup.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
[ELITE A]
Seems the special forces failed.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Hm.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
I'm not that picky. I just
want this guy dead and gone.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
Let the captain dirty
her hands if she wants.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
You talk a lot.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
Then again, you are a villain.
They never shut up.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:45.275 position:50% align:center
She's a monster
like the other guy!

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Mushrooms purify the Rust,

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
so we plant them in
places packed with it.

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
You should shower us
with gratitude!

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
But instead of your thanks,

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
I get your best attempt
at bashing my head in!

00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
Why thank someone for wasting
my time with fairytales?

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
You Keepers have been
discriminated against for years,

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.836 position:50% align:center
so of course you'd
want vengeance.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center
Thus, you pass from
town to town exacting it.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
Wrong again!

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.802 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm just searchin'
for the Rust Eater.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
This Rust Eater thing,
what is it?

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.140 position:50% align:center
Most people say
it's just a myth,

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
but it's a rare mushroom
we Keepers believe comes from

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
the prayers of a dying hero.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.065 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] This thing can absorb
even the deepest Rust,

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
from man or machine.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.569 position:50% align:center
And there's one man in
particular I'm trying to save.

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm town hopping.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
Lower your weapon
and let me through.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
I bear your city and
its people no ill will.

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50% align:center
I won't be fooled.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
Not by such an obvious
display of deceit!

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center
To stop all your lies,

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
I'll shove my staff down
your throat from right here!

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] Why is he looking
at me that way?

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:52.509 position:50% align:center
Does the sight of my
Rusting give him pause?

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
Get a grip.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
Don't fall for this
Mushroom Keeper's ploy.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50% align:center
All I need to focus
on is victory!

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
I will say this,

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
coming to your town was
actually worth my while.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
You have a great doctor.
Even took care of us.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
You remind me of him in
some way. Not sure why.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
Do you know him? Name's Milo.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
Did you do something
to Milo? Where is he?

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
Answer, you bastard!

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
It would seem I've
struck a nerve. Uh-oh.

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
I heard Mushroom Keepers
can grow shrooms

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.531 position:50% align:center
even on barren land.

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50% align:center
I guess those rumors were true.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE]
Stop fawning over it, dumbass.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
You know what I heard?
Mushroom spores spread Rust.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
If we don't do something
about this pain in the butt,

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
this place will be one big
Rust bucket, and quick.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Hey! Shroom for brains!

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
[BISCO chuckles]

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
Why, you!

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
Listen for a sec! Give that king
trumpet hippo dung once a week!

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:26.311 position:50% align:center
It won't grow as well
if it only has sand!

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE] Wait. You expect us
to fertilize that thing?

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Good! Your pig ears have range!

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
Shrooms feed off the
Rust and sap it away!

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50% align:center
Every single frickin' time.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
Try to be nice 'n'
what do they do?

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
Why won't you people listen?

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
You made the mistake
of showin' me your face!

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
Next time we meet, I'll rip
your tongue outta your head!

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.090 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE grunts]

00:11:58.218 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
There's this nest of monsters

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
called Weeping Child Ravine
in Akita Prefecture.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
A Mushroom Keeper died
there while hunting,

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
and when they went to bury him,

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
they found a Rust Eater
growing where he passed.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
Weeping Child? That's some name.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
[JABI coughing]

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Feeling dizzy.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
[JABI coughing]

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
[JABI yelling]

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:22.158 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Mister Jabi! Hang on!

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
You've got me really
curious, so tell me,

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
what do you think I did to him?

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
They don't call me a
man-eater for nothin'.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.425 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO yells]

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
You poisoned my staff?

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't stood there
and let me chew your ear off,

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
you would'a had me beat.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:48.685 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Akaboshi!

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
I know, it was an
underhanded tactic,

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
but it was hard hitting
someone so pretty.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.421 position:50% align:center
Milo.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:35.857 position:50% align:center
[VOICE]
Don't move.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
Set the hostage down
and put your hands up.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
You're a fun guy!

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
Won't even take it easy
on a sickly old fart.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.377 position:50% align:center
Jabi!

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] How are you up?
You were almost dead!

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
Don't have to tell me that.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
Guess it takes more than
six bullets to kill me.

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
What the hell, you geezer?!

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
Where was all this confidence
you'd pull through

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
when you initially got shot?

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
What a dumb question.
I wasn't confident at first.

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
I'm standing here now
because of that panda kid.

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
I'd've bit the big
one if not for him.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.194 position:50% align:center
But, ya know,

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center
surviving makes me pretty
awesome, too, right?

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
Awesome my ass!
More like awful.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
You made it sound like those
words would be your last.

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
Not cool.

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Jabi!

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:36.418 position:50% align:center
Pretending to be dead in front
of a doctor is not funny!

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't be
this active yet.

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.799 position:50% align:center
Wow. You really
pulled it off, Doc!

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
Well, I did what I could, yeah.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.138 position:50% align:center
But that remedy of yours
is what saved him.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.181 position:50% align:center
Mushroom Keepers
always repay debts,

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
and I'm in yours as of now.

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
So if there's anything
I can do, name it.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.647 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's, um, not necessary.

00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.068 position:50% align:center
Pawoo!

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Figured you knew each other.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Yeah. She's my sister.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
Well, she's pretty impressive.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
Had to hit her with a knockout
arrow. She's asleep.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
So then you two fought?

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center
And Pawoo actually lost?
You beat her?

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
Mushrooms will still be
effective on her Rust.

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
Use the stuff you gave to Jabi.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Incredible.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
Bisco, we've dawdled
long enough.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
And I imagine the iguana
cavalry is hot on your tail.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
They're less than
five minutes out,

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.905 position:50% align:center
and I don't see
that ending well.

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know. North Gate's
close. Shall we?

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
Mhm. You go ahead without me.
I'll stay and hold 'em off.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
Sure, I'll-- Wha--?

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:59.209 position:50% align:center
What do you mean,
you'll hold them off?

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
There's no point in
leaving you behind!

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
Think smart for a second, boy.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.049 position:50% align:center
It may not seem like it,
but I'm still recovering.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
You want a man who was just
shot to run right away?

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.553 position:50% align:center
The only one not
thinking smart is you!

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:12.180 position:50% align:center
What about synthesis?

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
Even if I find the Rust Eater,

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
I can't make it into
medicine without you.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Hm.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.145 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Huh?

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Uh.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Tch. Wow! Seriously?

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
Please, Akaboshi!
Allow me to go with you!

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
What the hell did that senile
old man put in your head?

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
A couple things.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
He spoke of your goal.
About the Rust Eater.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
I can help you by making meds
and patching you up when needed.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
Are you stupid?

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
The minute I take my eyes off
your panda ass, you'll die!

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
Maybe even sooner than that!

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
What was that about
you being in my debt

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
and doing whatever I wish?

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
Gimme a break!
I'm not some genie in a lamp.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
It's too dangerous
outside the walls.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.222 position:50% align:center
A city brat like you
would never survive.

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
You'd be lucky if the
only thing you lost

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
was one or even both of
your frail little arms.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
So what?

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
This is a chance to save my
sister, the only family I have.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.609 position:50% align:center
I'd gladly trade my arms.

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
They could take my head--
I don't even care!

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.163 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
Squad Two and
Squad Three, fan out.

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
Loop around to the North Gate.

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
[JABI] Bisco, it's the Watch.
No more time for debating.

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
If you don't wanna die,
then do as I say.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
To travel with a Mushroom Keeper

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
is to hold their life
in your hands.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
If one of us dies,
so does the other.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Our names.

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.027 position:50% align:center
Give the pain-in-the-ass
formality a rest.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.862 position:50% align:center
Being partners
means we're equals.

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
So you're Milo and I'm
Bisco. Ya copy that?

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
I'll do my be--

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
Uh. Loud and clear, Bisco.

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
Well, look at that. The birth
of a promising new tag team.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
[WATCH A] We're positive
they fled this way!

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
Leave no stone unturned!

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
Over here!

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
[BOTH scream]

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
Go while it's still clear.

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
Take care, Bisco.

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
Um, question. So, about your
sis, gonna just leave her there?

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
She'll be fine.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.783 position:50% align:center
The guys in the Watch will
take her somewhere safe.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
I put lots of those mushroom
injections in her pouch, too.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:41.329 position:50% align:center
Oh, but--

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
This could be the very
last time you ever see her.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
Take a good hard look.
But make it kinda quick.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You've protected me
more times than I can count,

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
my personal loving shield.

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center
So just this once,
I'll protect you, Pawoo.

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
And may the pain I endure
end yours. That sound fair?

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
[MILO] I promise I'll save you.
Whatever it takes.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center
So hold on. I'll come back.

00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
All right, Bisco. I'm ready!

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
[BISCO grunts]

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
That was the longest
goodbye ever!

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:23.496 position:50% align:center
Our journey almost
ended before it began!

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
[WATCH C gasps]

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Hurry up, Milo!

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Hurrying!

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
[WATCH C] Look, there he is!
And he's headed this way!

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
So your name, it means "strong"?

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.796 position:50% align:center
It does. Or "strong child."

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:14.798 position:50% align:center
My mom's the one
who picked it out.

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
I guess that's not a bad name!

00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:19.673 position:50% align:center
[MILO] It's called
the Nikko War Memorial.

00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:22.300 position:50% align:center
Long ago, when the Rust
first infected the world,

00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:24.135 position:50% align:center
they took all the
Rusted tanks and stuff

00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:27.931 position:50% align:center
and entombed them in
this temple to purify 'em.

00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:30.016 position:50% align:center
That's why the torii are
made from what used to be

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.395 position:50% align:center
the barrels of some
giant guns and canons.

00:22:33.478 --> 00:22:35.063 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
What's that statue?

00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:38.817 position:50% align:center
The one on the roof.
Has three chimps makin' faces.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.403 position:50% align:center
[MILO] The three wise monkeys
that embody the proverb

00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:44.114 position:50% align:center
"See no evil, hear no
evil, speak no evil."

00:22:44.197 --> 00:22:46.491 position:50% align:center
The same principles
of the Watch.

00:22:46.574 --> 00:22:47.659 position:50% align:center
It's said they came from

00:22:47.742 --> 00:22:50.453 position:50% align:center
Tochigi's military
regulations way back.

00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:53.748 position:50% align:center
Oh. For a panda, you know a lot.

00:22:53.832 --> 00:22:55.375 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Well, I did go to school.

00:22:55.458 --> 00:23:00.130 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Ah, okay. Wait,
are you implying I didn't?

00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:09.764 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
What incredible resilience.

00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:13.268 position:50% align:center
One thing's for sure,
you're no average crab.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.354 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:20.859 position:50% align:center
[gasps, screams]

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.535 position:50% align:center
The Nikko War Memorial is alive?

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:35.123 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] The destined pair
start their journey together

00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:37.292 position:50% align:center
and the tale truly begins.

00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
Though I'd be just as happy
with it truly ending

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.756 position:50% align:center
with both of them dying
at their next stop.

00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:46.593 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Ride the Crab."
Whatever that means.
